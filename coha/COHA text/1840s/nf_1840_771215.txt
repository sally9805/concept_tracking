Before entering on any statement of duties , it is incumbent on us to determine what power there is to perform them . An angel 's task may not be laid on a mere mortal . It is only where many talents have been given , that great returns can justly be required . Nor should our requisitions fall below the powers of those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child 's service , where the ability of a giant clearly exists . Achilles would spurn the light offices of Adonis . So will that woman , who regards her sex as co-equal in every part of their nature , with the opposite sex , contemn the delicate tasks , usually termed feminine . Much is said in our age and country of the appropriate sphere of woman . The discussion of that point is too interesting and too important to be passed over in this work , but the consideration of it involves another , viz. , What are her Natural Capacities ? How does she compare with , and wherein differ from man ? This topic seems a fit introduction to what may follow in our survey of the wide field now open before us . The capacities of woman may be ascertained by the study of her Physical , Intellectual , and Moral constitution ; by the disclosures of the Sacred Scriptures ; and by a reference to History , observation and experience . 1 . The Physical Constitution of woman is peculiar . In barbarous nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as man ; sometimes to those even more arduous . But the progress of refinement and civilization always establishes a marked distinction between the two sexes , in this respect . Nature revolts at the thought of the Amazon . A Boadicea and a Joan of Arc , were they now to appear , would be almost universally regarded as disloyal to their sex . A masculine woman and an effeminate man are in equal disesteem . We instinctively pronounce her to unsex herself , who arms for the battle-field , or engages in those agricultural , mechanic , or other manual pursuits , which demand great bodily vigor . God hath made the sexes herein to differ , and man , we feel , ought not to confound them . In respect also to Intellectual Powers , there is among most people a conviction that severe reasoning , comprehensiveness , and logical acuteness belong pre-eminently to man . I know there are illustrious exceptions to the truth of this statement ; but do we not rightly esteem the Elizabeths and Somervilles that occasionally challenge our admiration of their intellectual strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this difference , if you please , to the neglect of their education , say that man is only the superior , because of his higher advantages of culture , still must not the fact of his present mental superiority be conceded ? Nor should I deem it to the discredit of woman , were it incontestibly proved , that her Maker had given her less intellectual power in some provinces than man . For though , in civil affairs , in controlling the destinies of nations , in framing laws and administering justice , man labors in his exclusive sphere , yet in delicacy of perception and taste , and as a guardian at the fountains of Imagination , to woman he must yield the superiority . In the silence of her retirement she ponders on the themes of fancy , and while the consecrated names of Hemans and Sigourney shall endure , let man be slow to assume an absolute dominion in all the noble provinces of intellect . But maintain as we may our constitutional ascendancy in the Physical and Mental capacities , there is one realm where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Moral power . God has given her a keen sensibility , and a strength of feeling , and sympathies and affections which prepare her for singular eminence in moral attainments . In the religion of Ancient Greece , it was she who presided at the tribunal of fate ; her native enthusiasm qualified her for this office . " A man , " says Diderot , " never sat on the sacred tripod ; a woman alone , could deliver the Pythian oracle ; alone could raise her mind to such a pitch as seriously to imagine the approach of a god , and panting with emotion , to cry , ' I perceive him , I perceive him ; there ! there ! the god ! ' " The same zeal which was displayed in devotion to a false faith , is seen in Christian lands , sustaining the morals and piety of eternal life . Woman is more susceptible than man of sudden and strong impressions . Her impulses are quick and prompt , but this trait unless counterbalanced by others , would expose her to irresistible evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God has kindly averted this calamity , by inspiring her with a constancy and devotedness seldom witnessed in man . Let her place her affections on any object , and they will cling to it through every trial and change . What love so strong as woman 's ? What moral power can compare with hers , when principle , duty , devotion , once engage the full energies of her soul ? 2 . What we have learned from this glance at the constitution of your sex , is verified by the Sacred Scriptures . In the book of Genesis we are told that God " took one of the ribs of Adam , as he slept , and closed up the flesh instead thereof . " Some commentators translate this passage thus : " he took one out of his side , and put flesh in its place ; " and they thence infer that Adam and Eve were created at once , and joined by the side to each other ; that God afterward sent a deep sleep upon Adam , and then separated the woman from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period of the fall . After that melancholy event , the sentence was pronounced on woman , " Thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee . " And through all the subsequent history of woman , as found in the Bible , it is said , her inferiority to man is constantly implied .  --  Among the woes predicted by the prophet Isaiah , as awaiting Jerusalem and Judah , this is included , " Women shall rule over them . " Let the original relative capacities of woman have been as they might , one fact is clearly apparent , that the general condition of women among the ancient Jews , and in contemporary nations , was one of degradation and servitude . She was the slave of man . The Essenes , a Jewish sect not unlike the modern Shakers , treated this sex with little respect , often with contempt . The system of polygamy , of old almost universally prevalent , tended directly to " stifle the best emotions of the female heart , and to call all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some , that the wonder which the disciples of Christ expressed , when they found him conversing with the woman of Samaria , originated partly in their low opinion of her sex . The Talmud teaches that it is beneath the dignity of a Rabbi , to talk familiarly with a woman ; and the Jew was accustomed , we are told , to give thanks to God , that he was not a woman . But open the New Testament , and how in a moment is this estimation elevated . Of the Physical and Intellectual rank of woman , nothing is , indeed , there said . But as a creature of God , and a member of the great family of mankind , she is placed on an entire equality with man . Christianity does not make her responsible , as a moral and immortal being , to man , but represents both as having a common Master in heaven . No virtue inculcated on the one sex is omitted in describing the duties of the other . The Christian character is a moral statue , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition , symmetry , effect , are required and expected , in the spiritual workmanship , no less of woman than of man . The personal treatment which this sex received at the hand of Jesus , was always respectful , as well as tender and kind . " His earliest friend was a woman ; his only steadfast friends through his ministry were women . " It was " the daughters of Jerusalem , " who wept for him in his final agony . " The last at his cross , and the first at his sepulchre , was a woman . And when , after his ascension , the little company of believers was assembled , waiting for the fulfilment of his promise , there also were found the women who had accompanied him in life and stood by him in death . " How could he , with such proofs of their piety , zeal and perseverance , fail to regard the sex with a consideration , at least equal to that he bestowed upon man ? And in the religion itself , we find qualities with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based upon the affections . Love to God , and love to man , are its two great commandments . The sacrifice it requires on the altar of life is that of the heart . And what is this but the unquestioned empire of woman ? Sentiment with her is natural , the growth of her moral being ; in man it is usually acquired , the result of thought . Deny , as man may , her mental equality with himself ,  --  doubt as we may , the comparative strength or capabilities of any other portion of her nature , as related to man , in the possessions of the heart , no man can contest the ascendancy with woman . She is naturally less selfish than man . She can , if she will but obey her best impulses , rise to the loftiest heights of Christian excellence . And , if serious impediments oppose her progress , on herself , her own culpableness , not on her nature , must each consequent failure be charged . Another characteristic of our religion is its call for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission , patience , resignation . The acquisition of these qualities is to man a most arduous task . He can toil , and struggle , and resist . In scenes of active effort , and strong conflict , he is at home . But his power of endurance is by no means commensurate with these traits . In woman they find a congenial spirit , a heart open , and waiting for their reception .  --  " Those disasters , " says an elegant writer , " which break down and subdue the spirit of man , and prostrate him in the dust , seem to call forth all the energies of the softer sex , and give such intrepidity and elevation to their character , that at times , it approaches to sublimity . " Who does not perceive that this sex enjoys pre-eminent advantages for the culture of that spiritual union with God required of the Christian ? And in sustaining the ordinary trials of our lot , as social beings ; in cherishing forbearance toward the unjust , kindness to the thankless , and love toward those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maker with a divine power . 3 . The History of this sex is a still farther testimony to their moral capacities . We have examples of illustrious female virtue in the annals of the Patriarchs , as Sarah , Rebecca , and Rachel . In Holy Writ , we read also of Miriam and Deborah ; and the picture left us by Solomon , of " a virtuous woman , " evinces not only the existence , but the appreciation of a true woman , by some in those early ages . If we turn to the records of heathen nations , we find them occupied , when they speak of this sex , almost universally , in describing rare cases of personal prowess or physical conquests . The wealth of Babylon was such , and its advancement in science and refinement so great , that we may presume the female character to have been more elevated , than in savage countries . There was a true moral courage in that act recorded of the Phoenician women , who agreed , that if their countrymen lost a certain battle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with flowers her who made that proposition in a council . Would that history had transmitted the testimony of those quiet , unobtrusive virtues , which must at some ancient periods have prevailed , and which are the glory of woman . In more recent ages , we find among the Greeks noble examples of female heroism , of conjugal love , and sisterly affection ; but the exclusion of woman from society placed her under great moral disadvantages . Rome allowed this sex more free intercourse in social life , and the renowned Cornelia was hence a representative of no small number of her age . But how few opportunities do modern Pagan religions allow woman for exhibiting her moral capabilities . The stern creed of the Mussulman pronounces , we are told , that woman has no soul ; she is treated , in any event , according to this doctrine . In China , among the lower classes , all the hard labor is laid upon the wife , while the husband performs only the lighter tasks . In the higher classes , the sex is completely secluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws which repress all their energies , both of mind and heart . India furnishes examples of conjugal devotedness , worthy a more enlightened direction . Alas ! that such a spirit can find no purer modes of self-sacrifice , than casting the body on a funeral pile , or beneath the wheels of Juggernaut . Profane History , in its wide range , gives us indeed but an occasional gleam of the genuine virtues of woman . How unlike Christianity , which presents a brilliant succession of these fair examples . In Christian lands the occupations and habits of woman are such as to give scope for moral eminence . She has fewer worldly interests and engagements than man . She is not here accustomed to command armies , nor lift up her voice in the Senate chamber . Nor is she subjected to those coarser employments , and that severe bodily toil , which elsewhere rob her of all true delicacy . What an immense chasm do we see between the Christian female , devoted to her quiet domestic duties , and the inhabitant of Van Dieman 's land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while her husband sits by the fire , pampering his appetite with the choice morsels which she has procured for him . But Christianity must be pure , to produce this change ; we shall else retain , under the light of the Gospel , the spirit and practices of Paganism . " In one place on the road , " says a recent traveller in Italy , " we saw at least one hundred young girls , mixed up with as many rough coarse men , carrying baskets of earth , some fifty rods , upon their head , for the purpose of filling up an embankment or road . " " Heathenism , and paganized Christianity , " he remarks , " degrade woman to a level with the slave . " " In none of the slave States which I have visited , " says Professor Stowe , " have I ever seen negro women drudging in such toilsome out of door labors , as fall to the lot of the laboring women in Germany and in France . " " Haggish beldames fill all our markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields . " But in the beautiful language of another , when speaking of the sect called Friends , which language I would apply to all genuine piety , " The Inner Light sheds its blessings on the whole human race ; it knows no distinction of sex . It redeems woman by the dignity of her moral nature , and claims for her the equal culture and free exercise of her endowments . As the human race ascends the steep acclivity of improvement , the Quaker cherishes woman , as the equal companion of the journey . " The Christian 's home is a scene of retirement favorable to moral culture and to growth in grace . There the soul may contemplate its Creator , and hold communion with the lovely image of his Son . Far from the fields of ambition and gain , away from the agitations of a public arena , in sacred seclusion pursuing her domestic avocations , why should not woman be distinguished for her spiritual attainments ? Can it be , that with the same watchfulness , and self-denial , and toil , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity ? Another circumstance , friendly to the developement of woman 's capacities , is the state of society and the country in which we live . Our free institutions do much to remove those obstacles , that elsewhere exist , to the full exercise of her powers and faculties . Those false distinctions in society , by which wealth and rank alone can secure to a child its rightful education , are here seldom witnessed . In the public schools , the daughters of all , rich or poor , high or low , mingle for literary instruction . A mighty arm is thus raised to level that barrier , which in other lands , rises even between the cradles of the titled and the obscure . Not only is the intellect of woman thus trained in childhood to equal progress with that of the opposite sex , but all those moral advantages , which are connected with mental culture , are secured to this sex . The constitutional advantage she possesses , for attainments in virtue and piety is thus indulged with peculiar facilities for its exercise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not corrupted but purified by the social atmosphere she breathes from her earliest days . We are now prepared for a reply to that exciting inquiry alluded to in the commencement of this work , " What is the appropriate sphere of woman ? " Having determined for what duties and occupations she is qualified , it becomes less difficult to decide when she is acting within her true sphere , and when she departs from it . If Nature has intimated any class of employments , as more suitable , from their delicacy , for her physical powers than others , then we infer , that if she forsake those for sterner avocations , she disobeys the will of God ; and that too , as clearly and certainly , as if it were inscribed in letters of fire on the material heavens . It would have been surprising , however , had not many in this age , and especially in our own country , have passed to extremes in their opinions of the rights of woman , and of her appropriate sphere . Having escaped , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to the station of a slave , it was natural that they should more and more elevate her , until her true position in the world would be entirely misapprehended . The first impulse in this direction was seen in the age of Chivalry . Then woman was the idol of man . She was served with a sickly and sentimental devotion , through which its object became indolent , degraded , and lost to all moral and intellectual excellence . Then came the influence of those Political changes produced by Christianity , which , while they somewhat elevated the mental condition of this sex , left them still subordinate in many respects to man . At length a republic was founded on these shores , tending , in its true uses , to elevate all classes , but still to render each individual , when his own best interests were perceived , content in that state , for which Providence manifestly designed him . But how natural that the condition for which God had created the strongest physical frames and intellectual capacities , should be an object of envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he had denied these endowments . Could it be anticipated that woman would in all cases be true to her sex , and reply , as did the discreet Shunamite to the prophet 's interrogatories , " What is to be done for thee ? Wouldst thou be spoken for to the king ? or to the captain of the host ? " " I dwell among mine own people . " That is , " Where God has appointed my lot , I am content to live and toil . " It may be objected that I assume the existence of two distinct spheres of action , in this world . This is acknowledged , and it is , I believe , susceptible of demonstration . In all nations there is found a division in the character of human occupations . The savage has his hunting and fishing grounds , which call for labors of a wholly different character from those of the wigwam . And though woman may , and often does engage in the sterner duties of the tribe , yet man can not supply the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrees of nature , if he leave not some other duties exclusively to woman . Civilization modifies this division of labor , but can not obliterate it . Rather must its true work be the more wide separation of the sphere of each sex from that of the other . Christianity elevates the rank of woman , and through civilization , gives her a new moral and intellectual importance in society . Mental culture , again , diminishes both the taste and the necessity for those coarser tasks , to which , in ruder ages she must in some degree be subject . But if it qualify her for higher intellectual employments , her progress does not surpass that of man . They are relatively , as distant in this respect from each other , as they were in the days of the Patriarchs . The cultivated female mind enchants the world , " And fills The air around with beauty ; we inhale The ambrosial aspect , which , beheld , instils Part of its immortality . " This leads us to say , that God must have designed woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when she is thus situated , that the mutual influence of the sexes , so important to earth 's moral good , can be fully exerted . The boy at school inclines to rough manners . What more effectual restraint upon this tendency , than the delicacy and gentleness which marks the little girl ? She again , may become painfully diffident , and a recluse in her bearing , if not subjected to the society of the more confident sex . Encourage the boy to sit always by the fireside , and studiously shun conversation with the opposite sex , or put the girl forward and incite her to a bold and boisterous manner , and their mutual influence is diminished and soon lost . You transgress a plain law of the Creator . So in the society of adults . Let men group themselves together , and they will converse only of their farms , their merchandize , and their manufactures , or of governments and administrations . Insulate the female sex , and they shall discourse upon dress , or the minor affairs of their neighbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these evils , completely transpose their conditions ? Do we wish to see woman on Change , or man given up to fashion , and culinary duties ? No ; let the main pursuits of each be distinct ; but let neither regard him or herself as having no influence on the duties of the other . What check were there on man 's wrong impulses as a lover of gain , or a devotee of ambition , should woman participate with him in these dispositions ? And would not the inevitable consequence of her resigning herself to masculine offices and labors be , that she became as insane in the toil for riches as man ; that she proved his rival instead of his ally ; that far from composing and regulating the fire of his ambition , she did but kindle it to a devastating flame ? To argue the contrary were to close our eyes on the native ardor of woman , and to forget the fearful agency of sympathy , when it takes an unholy direction . Morality , religion , the order , if not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appropriate sphere to woman . Let me say first , negatively , what is not the province of this sex . They should not engage in pursuits , for which their Physical powers are inadequate . If man is endowed with superior bodily strength , to him exclusively be allotted those manual avocations , which demand that strength . Let not the more delicate sex be tasked with the severe exercises of the field or the workshop . And if mental power depend at all on physical , if giant minds are usually found in vigorous frames , woman may infer that she can engage in the highest intellectual pursuits only by becoming an exception to the ordinary character of her sex . " For contemplation he , and valor formed , For softness she , and sweet attractive grace . " Again , it is not the province of woman to enter into Political life . Plato , indeed , admitted this sex to an equal share with man in the dignities and offices of his commonwealth . But we should remember his was an imaginary state , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . I do not forget here the long line of Queens that grace the annals of history ; yet what had they achieved , wreaths though they wore on their brows , had not man been usually the prime minister and controlling agent in their governments ? The affairs of nations require in those who guide them a practical acquaintance with business transactions , and a familiar knowledge of pursuits and interests with which woman is not ordinarily conversant . And how unfeminine were it in her to raise her gentle voice amid the storm of debate , or to rush into the heat and strife of partizan politics ! Let such scenes never be coveted save by the Wolstonecrafts and the Wrights who have madly unsexed themselves . Nor can I admit that woman may with propriety be seen and heard at Public Meetings , mingling with the opposite sex . Man becomes effeminate by intermeddling with the province of woman . She also becomes coarse and masculine , when she enters his sphere . Is her nature more mild than his ? Why then desecrate it , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our public discussions ? How unlady-like are contention , violence , and passion . How certainly will woman sacrifice her best influence over man by consenting to stir his spirit to hostility , in ardent debate . Where are those mutual services , and friendly offices , so beautifully ordained by Providence , between the two sexes , when once they are ranged , as public competitors , in pride , zeal , envy , and jealousy , stimulating each other to the struggle for victory ? But to speak on the positive view of our subject . What is the appropriate sphere of woman ? Miss Sedgwick , in her work on Self-training , has answered this question well , and to that I refer the reader . Meantime we all have , I think , an ideal of this sphere , although in the details of it we may somewhat differ . We all desire to see this portion of our race pure and pious ; and we should add to these qualities gentleness , graceful manners , and a delicate , modest deportment . There are limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond which we should be pained to see a friend of this sex ever pass . For one , I would not so contract these limits , as to repress the powers , or to do injustice to the capacities , or trench on the rights , of woman . I would encourage no Sultan spirit , nor arrogate a single claim over her , deduced from any assumed superiority of my own sex . Give her every opportunity ; remove all obstacles ; furnish the utmost facilities , and let God speak his will through her actions . To this end , I would name first , what is incontestibly one part of the sphere of woman , Home . She may act in other situations , in this she must . Providence whispers to her in the cradle the divine monition , " Be a kind , obedient , dutiful daughter . " And if , to the latest moment of her life , she heed not this solemn charge , she is false , not only to her own sex , but to man and to God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neglect of the claims of her beautiful relation ? Let her be a monitor to the younger , and receive kindly the counsels of the elder , in her paternal circle , and how does she grace a sweet portion of her appropriate sphere . Nor will I omit to say , that whether united to another by the sacred bond of marriage or not , if she be a true woman , she is instinct with those inward charms , and Christian dispositions , which qualify her for that responsible connection . Intelligence , wisdom , disinterested affection , a mind to advise , a heart rich with sympathies , and a hand to aid ,  --  these should find in her their chosen resting-place . And what Mother can fill the sphere ordained for her sex , if she be not a devoted parent ? Possessed of this trait , no woman can fail of honor and usefulness . She who looks on her race with a maternal interest , who feels that God hath made of one blood all the children of the earth , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the genuine female nobility . There is in her character a grandeur ,  --  let her dwell in " Alpine solitude , "  --  before which the admired of all admirers , the gay butterfly , whose wings open and close with the sun of adulation , shrinks into an object of pity . Next to home , I should cite Private Beneficence , the scenes of Charity , and the chamber of sickness , as within the sphere of woman . Let her not only minister to the needs of her own fireside , but put on the sandals of mercy , and go forth to the bed of suffering , and the dwelling of poverty . Does she court distinction and applause ? There are those who would rend the air with shouts , did she pass as a Queen , in some gilded chariot ; or clap their hands at the strains of her eloquence , in crowded halls . But how few are these , compared with those who commend her , who is an angel of love in the dark hours of life . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her honor should be of the delicate ivory , rather than of brass , that emblem of boldness ? She who would follow Christ , must , I am sure , take generally the sequestered path of private charity , rather than live for the public gaze , though it were that of the host of officers and members of all the benevolent societies in Christendom . Who were the women , whose charities are engraven on the eternal records of the New Testament ? Private almoners , Joanna , Mary Magdalen , Susanna , and others " ministered unto their Lord of their substance , " by personal attendance . But still farther , in the intercourse of Society , woman has duties appropriate to her sex , grave and weighty duties . I would not that she engage in a single pursuit , that shall disqualify her for this function . If she degrade herself to the rank of a painted image , decked in apparel to charm simpletons , or if she flutter in the breeze of silly speeches and simpering airs , she is a traitress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her sphere . Nor would I that , by sun-burnt labors and field-tasks , she should bronze herself , and lose that refinement , which is a guardian to her virtue , and the anchor of her spiritual hope . A coarse woman , she who fails in all the attractions and graces of her sex , and who is a corrupter of good society , steps sadly aside from her place . While Christian gentleness , seeking to render all happy , and Christian purity , frowning on every shade of guilt , in social intercourse , are the true praise of this sex . Lord Halifax , in his advice to his daughter , observes , " Nature hath made you such large amends for the seeming injustice of the first distribution , that the right of complaining is come over to our sex . You have it in your power , not only to free yourselves but to subdue your masters , and without violence , throw both their natural and legal authority at your feet . We are made of different tempers , that our defects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your conduct , and our strength for your protection ; ours wanteth your gentleness to soften , and entertain us . The first part of our life is a good deal subjected to you in the nursery , where you reign , without competition , and by that means , have the advantage of giving the first impressions . Afterwards you have stronger influences , which well managed , have more force on your behalf , than all our privileges of jurisdiction can pretend to have against you . You have more strength in your looks , than we have in our laws ; and more power by gentleness , than we have in our arguments . " Have I circumscribed too much the sphere of woman ? Does she aspire to other and broader scenes of occupation ? If God hath endowed any one with the spirit of a prophetess , let her prophecy ; if of teaching , let her wait on that office . Wheresoever a capacity is bestowed , it is the sign-manual of Heaven . Forbid it , honor , justice , and all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Divinity . But I have spoken of woman in the mass ; " Common clay , ta'en from the common earth , Moulded by God , and tempered by the tears Of angels , to the perfect form of woman . " She who is faithful to her Home , to the sacred calls of Charity , and to the holy impulses of her Social being , fulfils no mean office . She ranks with the glorious sisterhood , who have gone to the rest of the sainted . Let her soul be baptized into the spirit of God , let his glory be the seal of her deeds , and she shall at length join that great company , who " neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God .

There are none so high that it can not raise them still higher ; and none so low , as to escape its kindly notice and fostering influences . It unites in one fraternal bond , all who bear the impress of God . As a social religion , breaking down every wall of partition , and bringing the whole race into fellowship , its fundamental principle is , " We are members one of another ; "  --  " No man liveth unto himself alone . " If we consider the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Religious condition of the world , we shall find abundant reasons for giving a prominent place , in all counsels and instructions addressed to the public , to her spiritual necessities . Let me here premise , that , in dwelling on this topic , I should revolt at the thought of administering to a vain , self-complacent spirit . It is mournful , it is humiliating to know , as we do , that the incense of adulation has been offered up to this sex , from the most selfish and unworthy motives , and in commendation of qualities which a true woman will regard as her lowest praise , mere personal attractions . Was it for this that the beneficent Author of nature called her into being ? Does she answer the purpose of her existence by submitting to be the toy of man ? Has God breathed into her an immortal principle , to bestow its best energies on the mortal frame that enshrines it ? to live for an outward adorning ? to be satisfied with applause for her external graces alone ? " For nobler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heirs of time . " This position will be confirmed by a view of the influence of woman on the condition of Society . If this be at all extensive , then we must infer that her Creator intended she should be thoroughly educated ; that her moral and intellectual powers should be fully developed ; that the spirit should not be subject to , but reign over , and that with entire supremacy , the outward and perishable form . But , is it not true , that civilization , refinement , and the manners and habits of society , depend much on her character ? In Christian lands , and beneath our own observation , we can see that it is so . Mark the nation , the city , the village , where order , purity and the social virtues in general , prevail . What is there the female character ? We hazard nothing in the reply , that it is elevated , accomplished , and pure . The coarse jest , the impure expression , the subtle inuendo ,  --  poisoning the more surely and deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerated ? Where woman maintains the high rank of her sex ? No ! for she has but to frown on such improprieties , and steadily , and on all occasions , to discountenance them , and they are banished from the social circle . Let her influence , in this regard , be correct , let it be mild and gentle , yet always decided , and there is no passion so rude , nor any proneness to an outbreaking of temper , or to a violation of the courtesies of life , which she can not , and does not , restrain . The influence of woman on the Intellectual condition of the world , is by no means small , or unimportant . How many of our best literary productions are from her pen . Science owes much to her . Galvani acknowledged himself much indebted to his wife , for aid in those investigations which led to the discovery of the science that bears his name . Miss Herschel , sister of the distinguished astronomer , received a gold medal from the Astronomical Society in London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In how many Seminaries of learning has woman been the chief instrument in forming the minds of the youth , not only of her own but of both sexes . Who has not marked , that where a taste for reading and mental cultivation is found , there the female sex is usually intelligent , educated , and refined . It follows indeed naturally , that a well trained intellect will discover itself in the intercourse of society , and that it will impart a tone to its familiar associates . She who reads much and profitably , will converse upon the subjects that have occupied her thoughts . This will incite others to imitate her course ; and pride is sufficient ,  --  were no higher motive awakened ,  --  to induce man to make himself at least the companion and equal of her who thus laudably cultivates the nobler part of her nature . But should this position be questioned , none can doubt that in one sphere the intellectual influence of woman can hardly be exaggerated . I refer to that of the Mother . " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Campan , " in order that the youth of France be well educated ? " " Good mothers , " was her reply . This struck the Emperor . " Here , " said he , " is a system of education in one word . " Let the mind of this parent be imbued with knowledge , and her children will imbibe from her the love of learning . How often has she planted germs , which in subsequent years expanded , and produced the fairest fruits of science and wisdom . It is related of Alfred the Great , that at the age of twelve years , when he had not even learned the alphabet , his mother once shewed him and his brothers a volume adorned with versicolored letters and other embellishments . Seeing it excite the admiration of the children , she promised to present it to him who should first learn to read it . Alfred immediately procured a teacher for himself , and in a short time was enabled to claim the promised reward . And such was his thirst for knowledge , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most learned men of his nation . Bacon , Cuvier , Sir William Jones and many other prodigies of learning , received their first impulse in the path of study from their mothers . Who is that mother , that thinks lightly of her influence on the minds of her children ? Let her know that on her it may now be depending , whether a son is to pass through life , ignorant of this world , of his duties as a man , a citizen , and a Christian ; or to be so educated as to adorn the stations he may hereafter fill , to be a blessing to his country , an honor to his race , and better than all , trained up to know and to serve the Great Father of lights . This leads me to observe , that woman affects vitally the interests of Society , from the transcendent influence she exerts on the Domestic relations in general . The prosperity of nations depends intimately on the prevalence of the fireside virtues . Unless the foundations of order , peace , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for none of these essential blessings . Let there be discord in our families , and the same spirit that creates it , will lead to public , civil , social , and political , dissensions . If our sons are trained up in an allowed disrespect to their parents , the retribution will be felt , not only in the privacy of our homes , but everywhere around us . And the daughter , who demeans herself irreverently toward the guardians of her life , will not fail to manifest the same melancholy trait in her intercourse with all her superiors . Nor may we confine these remarks to this one aspect . We desire kind neighbors , men who will regard the rights and the happiness of others , and who will strive to promote them in their daily walk . But from what school do these virtues usually proceed ? Where are generous , conciliatory , obliging dispositions first formed ? In the family circle . The faithful and affectionate husband , the tender , yet wise and judicious father , the considerate and kind brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the good neighbor . He who is false to the claims of home , may shine on splendid occasions , and attract the admiration of a distant world of spectators . But his heart is hollow , and the more he is known , the less will he be loved or esteemed , and the feebler will be his influence . The inquiry then becomes of paramount interest , " What are the chief springs of domestic wellbeing ? " Who are they , that contribute most largely to the advancement of piety at home ? I answer , with confidence , the female sex . For what is essential to piety at home ? It is gentleness , quiet habits , the beautiful harmony of many members , fulfilling each its appropriate function . It is the peaceful spirit of the Gospel , mingling with the joint efforts of a well disposed household . But the habits and occupations of man are adverse to this tranquil temper . He is called , in the pursuit of property , to labor abroad , amid conflicting interests . Competition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toiling ceaselessly to reap some little advantage over their fellows , this is the sea on which he must follow his fortune . And what a restless and troubled deep it is . Now the sun beams brightly , and the wind is propitious to his course ; anon , darkness gathers over his prospects ; clouds are lowering ; the distant murmur of peril is heard . Too happy is he , if some portentous sign do not swell , and ripen , and at length break upon him , in dread fulfillment of his fears . And what but the same unquiet path do the sons of Ambition tread ? Party excitement , and the contests of rival factions , are to them the very breath of life . An intense interest in political questions is at war with inward peace . He who burns for office , station , and power , has little within him congenial with the calm of the domestic circle . And these are the two great spheres of human occupation , gain , and honor ; they are both exciting , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this all ; the employments of our sex lead us of necessity away from the fireside . Were they ever so favorable to quiet excellence , we should be compelled , for the livelihood of our families , to absent ourselves , a large proportion of our lives , from this sphere of duty . But woman passes her days within the walls of domestic retirement . That is her accustomed scene of toil . In the temptations that befall her relatives abroad , she is not present . But where thoughtfulness comes , where good resolutions are formed , where the tears of penitence are shed , in that sacred retreat where man finds his only refuge for prayer , for self-examination , and for the culture of the spiritual life , there woman habitually dwells . From this circumstance , joined to her native susceptibilities , she is pre-eminently qualified to preside over and foster the fireside virtues . Who has not seen the unbelieving husband sanctified , made serious and holy , by the believing wife ? Where a free intercourse on the subject of religion exists between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softened , his thoughts withdrawn at times from the world , and the concerns of the soul , infinite and eternal considerations , brought home to his heart by the power of his nearest earthly friend . Sometimes , alas ! she , whose whole nature and whose entire condition seem but one lesson to awaken piety , has given her influence against it . By a worldly disposition , by a neglect of the means of religion , or by indifference to the most solemn themes , and an habitual levity of character and speech , the wife has been known to check the best aspirations of her husband , and reduce his spirit to the same low , earthly level with her own . She has fastened the more firmly around him , that chain , which the love of riches , or a thirst for fame , had already drawn till it corroded his immortal part . And when God has spoken to his conscience , and rebuked him for his iniquity , what better plea was at hand than this , " The woman whom thou gavest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , and I did eat " ? Look again at the fraternal influences in a family group . What inestimable power , can a wise and virtuous Sister exert . Has she a brother prone to waywardness and passion ? Her words may restrain his wanderings , her example subdue his anger . It can hardly fail , that a daily influence , mild , gentle , Christian in its character , will produce no effect on so near a relative . Do the brothers incline to seek their recreations abroad ? Are the charms of merriment , of sensuality , or of questionable excitements and pleasures , stealing on the heart , and estranging it from God and duty , from purity and heaven ? Now is the moment for kind remonstrance , for affectionate counsel , and earnest entreaty . She , who employs these means , and adds to them all the attractions she can throw round their common home , may be sure that her efforts will not be lost . Let her persevere , and success , earlier or later , shall crown her toils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Heaven , " Years have passed away , " says the grateful brother , as his thoughts revert to his distant home , " and Heaven has prospered me . Often , when temptations have assailed me , should I have yielded to them , had not a still small voice have whispered , thy sister prays for thee . " " High above The fret and tumult , and discordant jar Of the base world , she led me , and the war Of grosser passions , which she dreamed not of . " But there is yet another relation , which gives woman her chief power over the destinies of our race . It is that of the Mother . We have already spoken of this power , as affecting the intellect of children . But a far higher work is still to be accomplished . For if the mind alone be educated ; if science and literature be all she impart to them , if their love of knowledge be not quickened and controlled by a spiritual love , it will be a vain possession . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of duty and of the entire moral nature , this is the great business of human life . And to whom has God entrusted the commencement of this solemn work ? Who is to cherish the swelling bud , who to point the infant soul to its spiritual Father ? On whom does it devolve to call forth the infant man ? Where is the influence that shall keep the young heart from fatal wanderings and errors ? It is the mother to whom we look , for the discharge of these momentous offices . It is not more certain that Providence designed her to supply the first wants of the animal nature , than it is that she must impart to her child its spiritual nutriment . If she neglect to do this , there remains no substitute , none to whom we can turn , to excite , purify and foster its immortal faculties . An irreligious mother ! what an anomaly , what a monster , among things human , is she . A wicked woman is always one of the darkest spectacles this earth can exhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give poison to her own offspring , who can exaggerate her faithlessness , her unnatural , may I not say , her inhuman qualities ? The influence of woman is felt beyond the circle of her own fireside , in the wellbeing of her Country . If this sex contribute so largely , as we have affirmed , to the progress of civilization and refinement , then can it be no little aid they afford , by their character and exertions , to the support of pure political institutions . True , the fair hand of woman deposits no vote in the ballot box . She takes no part , at primary meetings , or on days of election , with the mass who place men in office . But is she therefore destitute of political power ? No , she has the sacred right of petition . She may be heard , appealing to the legislative body for redress of the wrongs done her , or of the grievances she suffers . Question , as some may , the expediency of her ever exercising this privilege , she has still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this right can give her , over the destinies of her country . Think of the mother of Washington . Peruse the biography of the wife of that sainted patriot . Study the character of the elder Mrs. Adams , of the wife of Hancock , and of the long list of females , who lived and toiled in the period of our Revolution . Could they do nothing ,  --  did they accomplish little ,  --  for this country ? How many hearts were cheered in the Senate chamber , what courage was infused on the battle-field , by the mother , companion , sister , and daughter , among the noble race that then lived . In these latter days , what is to give integrity to the statesman , purity to the patriot , and true glory to the nation ? It must be done in part by woman . Let her be educated , and above all , let her educate herself , in intelligence , grace , and holiness , and I have no fear of conflicts abroad , or of perils at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glazed frame , does not more surely save the ship , amid darkness and storm , than does she , who at the quiet fireside , exerts the influence which she may for her country , on son , husband , and brother , by pointing out the path of political salvation . The influence of woman is felt in the general interests of the Christian Religion . We have already remarked that she was a personal friend and servant of Christ , while he was on earth . Nor did her devotedness to his cause , terminate with his ascension to heaven . We read of " some of the chief women and the devout , " as among the earliest converts of the Apostles . Paul speaks of certain " women , which labored with him in the Gospel , " and he sends numerous special salutations to individual females , who had " helped him in the Lord ; " shewing that this sex took a direct share in the promulgation of Christianity . They not only embraced it with their whole soul and strength , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induce others to participate in its blessings . Their efforts have been seen in determining the general character of the Christian world . If any age has been peculiarly spiritual , or any people more than ordinarily devout , it was because woman was there true to the holiest impulses of her nature . Point me to the most prosperous era of the institutions of Christianity ; shew me a sect , who honor the Sabbath , or who sustain most liberally the ministers of Christ , and I am confident that then and there the female sex will be found most active in defence of the holy day , and of sanctuary privileges . Look at the Church of Christ . Who are they that confessed their Lord before men , in the early ages of the gospel ? " Within a few years after Christ , the Christian martyrologies are full of the names of female sufferers , who , for Jesus ' sake , went to the stake , with all the courage and inflexibility of apostles . " Whence come the majority of church communicants ? Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death , and who inspired man to do likewise , has always been prompt to profess her faith at the table of her Lord , and give her influence to the honor of his visible church . Had this work been left to the other sex , where had been now this goodly fellowship of avowed believers ? Should woman ever forsake her Master , or shrink from bearing his name at the altar , it would portend gloom , decay , and desolation , to the fair fabric she now so devoutly upholds . To the female sex we owe a large share of the benefits resulting from the present enlarged means and methods of religious education . Not only in the day school , and at the fireside , but in the Sunday school , we find this sex occupied in one of their most hallowed services , the training of the young . Difficulties occur in securing and retaining the aid of male teachers in the Sabbath school . The heart of man is not always so disengaged from the world , and so intent on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come cheerfully and punctually to this divine work . But our female teachers are prompt to assume , and unwearied in the discharge of , this function . What were the institution , without the spirit of woman operating on its vital principles , toiling and praying , and sacrificing herself , to save those " little ones " whom Jesus loves ? " Meekly ye forfeit to your mission kind The rest of earthly Sabbaths.  --  Be your gain A Sabbath without end , ' mid yon celestial plain . " Let me add , that the Benevolent Enterprizes which mark the train of Christianity , have received much of their support from woman . Previous to the coming of Christ , public charities were nearly unknown . Among the names of the disinterested women of the first century , who were " full of good works , and alms-deeds , which they did , " stands that of Dorcas . Her example was not lost on the ages that followed . And in the Catholic church , the kind , self-denying labors of the " Sisters of Charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to this sex , are we indebted for the sacred and sympathetic services rendered by the multiplied Benevolent Associations and Institutions of our own age ? So long as the Orphan has a tongue to tell of her deeds , or the sick-bed of Poverty can show a gleam of gratitude , or the Seaman 's heart shall beat and glow , they will testify , that it is woman , who is God 's high-priest of mercy to the suffering . Legislation may appropriate its thousands for the Blind , the Dumb , and the Insane ; but how poor were its consolations , did not she who best knows how to smooth the pillow for the aching head , and cheer the spirit in its heaviness , administer to each sufferer the public bounty ? Who can estimate her influence in originating , and directing , in co-operation with man , and in giving its final efficacy to , every blessed charity , that springs from the soil of Christianity ? Such being the influence of woman on all the great interests of humanity , how should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drawn from the possession of this mighty power ? No candid mind can deny that it involves responsibilities , corresponding precisely to its extent . To whom much is given , of them much is required . Were this sex of insignificant moment in the world , then might they plead for an exemption from its duties and obligations . But now the burden presses on them , and no individual can cast it lightly from herself . In society , woman should ever bear with her a deep conviction of the power she there exercises . Her deportment should never be of that frivolous , or insipid character , which betrays no consciousness of a share in the dignity of our nature . She should carry to the social circle a sense of the value of human life , and a resolution to acquit herself as becomes an intelligent and immortal being . A courteous , yet perfectly natural manner , a cultivated understanding , and pure morals , are the tribute she should lay on this altar . Why should our approach to a lady be the signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles of this sex , from which a man of sense must turn away with the caustic saying of Wallenstein , " I can not traffic in the trade of words With that unreasoning sex . " ? When will the civilities of social life become , through her influence , something beside an exchange of heartless forms , or of self-seeking attentions ? Precisely so soon , and so fast as woman shall determine to reject the empty adulation of fops and simpletons , to be commended only for what deserves praise , and to be entirely sincere and Christian , in the social interview , no less than by her own fireside . Until this take place , society , in fashionable circles , will be , as an authoress remarks , like " the brilliant assemblies of Paris , a collection of young men who have nothing to do , and young women who have nothing to say . " The responsibleness of woman extends widely through the world of Intellect . She is called to preside over schools for the nurture of the infant mind . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shall she come to this work , and daily pursue it , without a thoughtful preparation for her task ? Is it for the mother to say , " I may read little or much , as I please . Of what consequence is the condition of my mind ? " when she can hardly breathe on the germs before her , without either blighting their beauty , and checking their expansion , or shedding life , health , and eternal freshness , upon them ? Let no young lady disclaim for herself any lot or portion in those sober concerns . Hannah More had , at one time , more than a thousand children under her instruction . Others have recently followed in her steps . Every woman is , I maintain , by virtue of her sex , a teacher . There are now , or there sometime may be , minds subjected to her influence , over whose destinies , for weal or for wo , she will exert a fearful sway . Is it certain she will never be school-mistress , or mother , or guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , unless her path be strange , secluded , and anomalous , she will be either the architect , or destroyer of , or at least , a more than leaden weight on , some human intellect . Let her reflect on this fact , and conduct herself always in view of it . At the fireside , what a sum of duties does her power impose ? Here she wields a more than regal sceptre . Wisely did Boaz argue the excellence of Ruth , when he said , in reply to her modest question , " why have I found grace in thine eyes ? " " It has fully been shewed me , all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law , since the death of thy husband . " Such domestic piety , a virtue that could sacrifice home , people , substance , and which tendered even life itself for a parent , was an earnest of the choicest worth . It formed " A wreath that can not fade , of flowers that bloom With most success , when all beside decay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrivalled claims of her children on her spiritual care , no language can speak too strongly , or even in adequate terms . From the hour when their first cry announces to her their utter helplessness , onward through the trials of childhood , and the crossing elements of youth , till they part from her charge ,  --  no , this they never do ,  --  but until she grasps their hand amid the chill of death , they draw from her , as a well-spring of life . What a question then is there to be asked , " Does she shed upon them an Eden-like fragrance ? Is she a true mother ? " Worlds of wellbeing hang on the answer . In every domestic relation , the influence of woman is of transcendent concern . Let her measure the responsibilities that attach to her position . The faithful daughter , the kind sister , the disinterested inmate , no less than the parent , must habitually realize , that around that little spot , her home , she is distilling and must distill , either dews that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . Consider the demands of her country upon woman . Sparta required her women to bear arms in war . Rome called on hers for the austere virtues of heathenism . But America justly anticipates in this sex a union of grace with power , intellectual cultivation sustained by moral and religious attainments . During the French Revolution , we are told that the wives and daughters of the celebrated artists gave their jewels to extinguish the national debt . Would that they had added the fairer gift of the Christian graces . She who shapes so emphatically the destinies of home , should be aware of the calls of patriotism on her sex . I have read of a family in the West , in which the daily conversation of both sexes is , " What can I do for my country ? " Rare as this example may be , I earnestly hope that , through a sense of her high obligations to her country , woman will everywhere emulate its spirit . Is it not due for the rank she is allowed to hold in our republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevails in so many foreign lands , and recognized as a partaker in the divinity of our nature , why should she sink into inaction ? How , as if an angel spoke to her soul , should she rise and gird herself in the meek robes of righteousness , standing fast by the young , and inciting them to a lofty patriotism , quickening brother , husband and son , to public integrity , and calming the fierce spirit of political contention . But how shall I describe the paramount necessity of woman 's devotion to the interests of religion ? Christianity regards her as a human being , equal in moral power to man , and accountable to the same God and Judge with him . Our religion has elevated her sex from Pagan degradation , and expects a commensurate return , in her superior virtue . Let her then first give her own soul to God , and then shew forth in her works the spirit of her Savior . By the study of the Scriptures ; by establishing herself in a rational faith ; by an humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sunday instruction of the young , and by a series of benevolent and charitable offices , among the sick and the needy , let her requite the love of God , as manifested in the Gospel of his Son . How can one of this sex , constitutionally gifted with strong and enduring affections , sequestered from man 's peculiar temptations , and summoned by unnumbered considerations , to meditate on heaven , be other than pious , other than a beacon-light on the rock-begirt coast of human life ? What can she offer at the judgment-seat of Christ , if she have denied him on earth ? To every young woman , I would say , shew " That thou , in the prime of earliest youth Wisely hast shunned the broad way and the green , And with those few art eminently seen , That labor up the hill of heavenly truth . " * * * * * * " That Thy care is fixed , and zealously attends To fill thy odorous lamp with deeds of light . " Chapter III . FEMALE EDUCATION . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be educated .

Extract from Coleridge . The prophet Isaiah , when predicting the fate that awaited the renowned Babylon , uses the following striking expression : " And thou saidst , I shall be a lady forever ; so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The term lady , here employed in personifying a prosperous city , is one of various significations . Its etymology is Saxon , it being derived from a word meaning " loaf-giver ; " which refers to the custom of females distributing bread among retainers , after the feasts which were held in the halls of barons . In later periods it has been used , under monarchical governments , to designate women of rank , the wives of knights , and the daughters of earls . It is used by the apostle John as a title of honor : " The elder unto the elect lady and her children . " We find it employed by the prophet in still another sense , that of dominion and power : " Thou shalt no more be called the lady of kingdoms . " In our modern use of it , there is perhaps a union of these two significations . I shall be a lady forever , would be now understood to mean , " I shall be always an object of supreme attention , and of honor . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can command the services of whom I will , and be free myself from all care and effort . " Before proceeding to my main topic , let me premise , that the word woman is , in my judgment , an honorable appellation ; and that , under our republican institutions especially , it should be regarded as no ordinary praise , to say of a female , she is a true woman . Better , far better aspire to deserve this name , than to repose indolently on a rank and a title deduced from monarchies , to say to thyself , " I shall be a lady forever . " But our present associations with the term lady being such as they are , and so many in every condition being jealous of their claims as ladies , I am compelled to adopt that appellation in order to guard against injurious misapprehensions . Having spoken already of the capacities of this sex , and said something also of their Influence , we are now prepared to answer the great questions , " How should woman be educated ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the End of her tuition ? " First , I reply , she should be educated as a Human Being , possessed in common with man , of an intelligent , moral , and spiritual nature . Christianity recognizes no distinction of the sexes , so far as the broad principles of piety and virtue are concerned . Both are endowed with the same conscience . To each is allotted the same sphere of discipline ; and unto both is the gospel of Christ , in its solemn appeals , its sacred encouragements , hopes and promises , and its fearful sanctions , alike addressed . Contemplate this holy companionship , and how insignificant seem those barriers raised between the two sexes , in some ages and countries , by the pride , the caprice , and the despotism , of man . Are we destined to a common moral tribunal ? Pitiful is his spirit , who , for any fancied or real , outward advantages , shall here and now , with the ancient philosopher , " thank God that he was born a man , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , who allows herself , even in the secrecy of her heart , to look on one of the opposite sex with the murmur , " O that Heaven had made me such a man . " In all that is noblest , purest , divinest , thou art a man . Defile not thy spirit with invidious prayers . Thank God that thou dost share with man all that dignifies him , all that is worthy the high aspirations of immortality . Educate thyself as a human being ; unfold the godlike powers , which are thy joint possession with man ; prize and improve thy blessed partnership in the bequest of Jesus , and thou shall rejoice evermore . Nor is this view at variance with the position that to woman is assigned a peculiar sphere of duty and action . Her gifts differ , in some important respects , from those of man . Her station and relations in life are not his . A second point then is this , that she should be so educated as to know her appropriate sphere . There are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit . She may undervalue her capacities , and imagine , that being able to acquire or perform little , nothing need be attempted ; or that her influence is trifling , that she helps few and harms less , and therefore , whether she be ignorant or learned is of no consequence . Or she may pass to the opposite extreme , and believe herself all-competent , qualified by nature to cope with man in every situation . This view will lead her to self-satisfaction , and of course prove unfriendly to her moral character , and to her spiritual culture . The affectation that has sometimes accompanied learning in females , has led not a few men to abhor the very name of a " literary lady . " A good education will so expand her mind and mature her judgment , as to rescue her from the dangers of these fatal extremes . A refined intellect will not consent , with the women of Persia , to dwell in the harem ; nor subscribe to the Hindoo doctrine , that " the female who can read or write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heir of misfortunes . " Neither will such a one aspire to the baubles of office , pant to join in harangues to the crowd , or to compete with man at the ballot-box . Woman has rights ; but how shall she truly understand them ? Not through ignorance , not by being half-educated , or miseducated . It can be only through a liberal culture of all her faculties . So trained , she will ever bear in mind " that knowledge is not to elevate her above her station , nor to excuse her from the discharge of its most trifling duties . It is to teach her to know her place , and her functions , to make her content with the one , and willing to fulfil the other . It is to render her more useful , more humble , more happy . " " Such a woman will not seek distinction , and therefore she will not meet with disappointment . She will not be dependent on the world , and thus she will avoid its vexations . She will be happy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable employment of her time . " Woman should be educated according to her Constitutional Temperament and Susceptibilities . If , in any respect , her endowments be , as they certainly are , superior to those of man , then let there be but a secondary degree of culture given to these faculties . Has she naturally a nicer perception of beauty , or propriety , a more correct taste than man , then do not bestow your chief care on the developement of this quality . Is she less gifted with strength of intellect , with calmness , or comprehensive understanding than man , employ the greater efforts to supply this defect . Let the solid preponderate over the merely ornamental . Plant not the pliant osier , but the firmer elm . Instil principles of severe reasoning , and form habits of connected thought . Is she rich in imagination ? Madam de Stael tells us she is , that this is the chief of her faculties , and that " her sentiments are troubled by her fancies , and her actions dependent on her illusions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does she love God , inspire her with a boundless philanthropy . Thus will she be a true companion and undisputed equal of man . Excitableness and acute sensibility will be beautifully tempered in her by the spirit of sound knowledge and good sense . The whole character shall be fitly framed together in Christ and in life . Let the education of woman be commensurate with her influence . Is it true that , in the complexion of social life , she is mistress of that which decides its hues ? Then let her be trained to wield this fearful power with skill , with principle , and for the salvation of social man . Does she sometimes bear the sceptre of a nation 's wellbeing in her hand ? Cato said of his countrymen , " The Romans govern the world , but it is the women that govern the Romans . " The discovery of this very continent testifies to the political influence of woman . Who favored the bold genius of Columbus ? Do you say Ferdinand of Spain ? I answer , it was Isabella , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her influence unexerted , the Genoese mariner had never worn the laurel that now graces his brow . Will you leave this all-potent being illiterate , to rear sons debased by ignorance , and to become dupes of the demagogue ? Look at the Domestic circle . Not more surely does the empress of night illuminate and beautify the whole canopy of heaven , than does woman , if educated aright , irradiate , and give its fairest tints to , her own fireside . To leave her uncultivated , a victim to ignorance , prejudice , and the vices they entail , is to take home to our own bosoms a brood that will inflict pangs sharper than death . For the love and honor of our homes , let us encourage the most liberal culture of the female mind . A more general diffusion of the privileges now enjoyed by a few only , would prevent the envy of others , no less than the vanity of the favored ones . It would assimilate the tastes , and multiply the sympathies , of the sexes ; it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convince him that woman was neither made for a household drudge , nor yet for an education of mere show and accomplishment . The useful would be seen to benefit her at least as much as man . Some are fearful that women may become too learned , that they will then be discontent with their ordinary occupations , and become tinged with " blue , " and lose their native simplicity . Such should recollect that it is " shallow draughts " of knowledge , which " intoxicate the brain . " A truly learned person seldom affects superiority to others , or gives himself airs . I know of no better security against the tyranny of fashion , against caprice , ennui , and the languishments of indolence , than a well stored mind . She who best comprehends her nature and relations , will usually best adorn any and every sphere in which Providence may place her . I am led here to say , that if a distinction must exist in the education of the sexes , that , which is deemed the weaker , should receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman a low rank in the scale of intellect , when we do nothing to elevate her to an equality in this respect with man ? Why educate the girl only in the graces of learning , while you give the boy tasks which try his utmost power ? Are accomplishments all she needs to place her on a level with man ? Yet how often do we see her " Bred only * * * * * * * * * * * * to sing , to dance , To dress , and troule the tongue , and roll the eye . " Give her facilities for the full culture of her understanding and the highest faculties of her soul , and if she then fail , with more reason may you repeat the taunt about her mental inferiority to man . This leads to the remark , that female education should embrace our whole nature , and not one portion of it . Why sacrifice the body to the improvement of the mind ? It is a melancholy spectacle to witness the pale countenances and attenuated forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school-room . How long shall consumption prey on so many at this age ? When will American females imitate those of our fatherland , where sickness among this sex is almost as rare as perfect health is in our own country ? And why should the Moral powers be neglected as they are , and their culture postponed to that of the intellect ? For manifold reasons these faculties should be simultaneously developed . The best interests of the mind demand it . Increase the moral energies , and you strengthen the intellect . Vice does not more corrupt the soul , than it darkens the judgment . A pure heart is a well-spring of clear thought . Again , virtue promotes mental composure . It confers inward peace ; it secures that tranquillity , without which no science can be successfully pursued . Sin disturbs the reason . Putting evil for good leads one to substitute error in general for truth . Nero was said to be as deficient in taste , as he was cruel and wicked . The imagination of a profligate can not be other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , do good , and you perceive these with more and more clearness . Thus is " light " always " sown to the righteous . " Live in God , and you enjoy a perpetual sunshine . Earnestly , therefore , would I plead with all occupied in female education , that while they encourage the study of the philosophy of life , they join with it the practice of its duties . Let knowledge be the herald of goodness . Let intellectual improvement conduct to active virtue , and sincere piety . Unite with literary excellence a devotion to home , to charity , to faith and prayer . I have now in mind a picture of moral purity surmounting skill in the divine tones of music , and the exercises of the pencil and the brush .  --  Virtuous maiden , " Thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear The freedom of a mountaineer ; A face with gladness overspread ! Soft smiles , by human kindness bred ! And heavenliness complete , that sways Thy courtesies , about thee plays . " Of what avail indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left barren and dead ? Can any degree of knowledge compensate for a selfish spirit ? Let envy , pride , jealousy , vanity , be nurtured by the studies that engage the mind of a young lady , and who can rejoice at her intellectual progress ? Better have less learning , less mental power , than increase these possessions only to desecrate them in the service of iniquity . Ignorance is always a less evil than guilt . No amount of literary acquisitions can atone for the want of a spiritual mind , for frivolity , heartlessness , and irreligion . Let then the desire to be useful , to be holy and heavenly , crown and consecrate the education of woman . Let her ponder on wisdom and learning , and " lay all these things to her heart . " Female culture should always have reference to the Future . It should lead to a remembrance of the " latter end " of life 's course . How much has been done , in this work , for the present , for show and effect . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on a firm foundation , the endeavor has too often been to build up in a day a specious structure . So has it been , that , when , the storms of life came on , the moral building was rocked by the winds , the rain pierced its thin covering ; it rested on the sand ; it fell , and great was its fall . Here is a young school-girl . What is to be her situation on arriving at womanhood ? Must she assume responsible stations ? Have we here the germ of the conjugal tie , and the elements of maternal influence ? How then can we forget these relations , and train a being fit only to bask in the beams of praise ? Let not this be . Address now the same motives as you must in subsequent years . If there must then be self-denial , toil , and care , for the love of humanity , leave not the young heart , at this stage , to become steeped in selfishness . Let the glory of God and the good of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to speak naturally of the Place , the theatre , on which the young female must be educated . It is to be done partly in public , at the schools instituted for this purpose . But I do not design to enter the halls of science and literature . I would rather , adverting here to the conclusion of her studies , confine myself to the use which a young lady should make of the education she has received at school . The advantages , now enjoyed by the youth of our land for mental culture , are rare . Parents are solicitous that their children should spend much time at the seats of learning . The daughters are receiving a far higher intellectual training than their mothers enjoyed . But is this all a sure good ? Have the thousand rivulets of learning that now flow fast by our homes , sprung all from a crystal fount ? Do they , in a word ,  --  for that is the test question ,  --  so penetrate the life and soul of the young , as to give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said about " finishing the education . " And finished , in one sense , is that of many females in this age . For , between their school culture and their subsequent character , there is as little connection as between the body and its dress . The school-room is left , and the garment , so beautiful to the eye , falls at once off . Into the centre and essence of the individual 's being , the permanent character , nothing has passed . The books once studied are gladly thrown aside . Not a single motive is felt , to press forward in the noble work of self-education . Languages have been learned ; but their great object , as keys to the study of foreign literatures , is left unanswered . History is a dull theme ; philosophy is merged in the newest novel ; dress and gossip , a little fancy needle-work , and a world of castle-building ,  --  oh ! it is sad ; it is humiliating ; would to God it were false . I speak to the wise , judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterpart within your personal knowledge . But how should the young lady improve the literary privileges of her early days ? Let her not depend on the reputation of the teacher who instructed her , nor of the school , high though it be , which she last attended ; nor yet again on the branches she has studied , however numerous or unusual they are . It is her own efforts , the attention , the application , and the intellectual toil she passed through , on which alone she may reflect with satisfaction . What effect did all these studies produce on her mind ? Is the tree laden with fruits , or did the profusion of blossoms fall barren to the earth ? Among the results of a good intellectual training is this ; it gives vigor to all the powers of the mind . Memory is cultivated , but not at the expense of the understanding . Female pupils often shine in those branches which depend on mere memory , while they fail in those which task the reason . Geography and history are their delight ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Woman is exposed , by her habitual seclusion , to many narrowing influences . She has little of that severe discipline of the mind to which man is daily subjected . His intercourse with the world is more extensive . His whole life is a school for the intellect , while she is restricted , to a great degree , within the limits of home . Her duties consist much of details ; and small subjects engender contracted views . Therefore should her early days be devoted to studies that , in after life , will serve to counteract this evil tendency . It should be made a matter of principle with teachers and parents ,  --  and the pupil must , of course , co-operate in their plan ,  --  to enlarge her mental vision , to fortify her intellect against limited notions , and to strengthen her judgment . The atmosphere of the fireside is often close and oppressive ; let her in her youth , breathe the free air of heaven . So will her mental constitution be invigorated and prepared for all coming duty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for its invigorating influence , I would name the practice of frequent composition . She who writes daily , whether it be in her journal , or essays on indifferent subjects , or even good letters , will , in addition to many other benefits of this practice , strengthen in herself greatly the habit of connected and profitable thought . Study should form intellectual Tastes . To what purpose has the girl been placed all these years at school , if , when her privileges terminate , she has no fondness for study ? Why lead her through the pleasant fields of learning , if , at the close of her walk , she is to possess no relish for these scenes ? She has drank at " the wells of English undefiled , " and shall she now turn aside and imbibe the turbid waters of a corrupt and corrupting literature ? Alas ! that she should now prefer fiction and folly to the healthful writings of wise men . Deplorable is it , that her past lessons of instruction , so many and so faithful , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have fallen on her ear , like snow-flakes that melt on the ocean . Another office of education at school is to impart Knowledge . It has been said that a woman must possess either beauty or knowledge to commend her to favorable notice in the world . The former is the rare gift of nature ; while the latter may be always acquired . John Wilkes , who was as famous for his ugly face as for being universally popular in society , on being asked the secret of his popularity , answered , that " it took him but five minutes to talk away his face . " What a talisman might every young woman thus bear with her into society , would she early cultivate and store her mind . How should it be , that she who has spent years over grammar , can not now write a letter to a friend without violating its fundamental principles ? I have read of one , who , when at a loss how to spell a word , put a dash under the doubtful letters , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subterfuge ! What better is it to pass the most precious period of life in a school room , if such be the fruits , than to live uneducated and ignorant ? Those are indeed the truly and unpardonably ignorant , who leave their studies with no accurate knowledge . Better is her lot , who was constrained to give her whole youth to manual labor , if she have a thirst for knowledge , and devote her leisure frugally to profitable reading . The young lady should not finish her school occupations without securing good Habits of mind . Let her carry through life her present mental discipline . Let her accustom herself , if she read a book , to review and give an account to herself of its contents . Is she listening to a discourse ? What a valuable means may it be made of intellectual improvement . Let her reflect on each topic , and on the order , the arrangement and connection , of the whole . After listening to an interesting conversation , let her recall , and strive to impress on her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her whole earthly experience may be so improved as to be a continual seminary of self-instruction and mental advancement . How infinitely better is it thus to construct a firm bridge across the entire river of life , than to trust to the frail bonds of ice , the work of a night , and to be dissolved before the next meridian sun . This leads me to say that female education should be of a Practical description . The girl is destined to be a house-keeper , and yet she is , perhaps , doing almost nothing to prepare herself for that station . She thinks a knowledge of housewifery comes by instinct ; and so it is that she cares more for her French and her piano than for those studies which would fit her for domestic duty . But in vain do this sex receive high degrees of culture , if they are still unable to apply their knowledge to any useful purpose . Why train the mind so sedulously , if it prove in the end but a leaden instrument , too flexible for service ? Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let her be educated for self-subsistence . What a miserable creature is she , if incompetent to obtain her own livelihood . That she is now placed in independent circumstances , affords no assurance that she will be always thus situated . Can any one forget the fearful reverses of fortune , especially in this land of pecuniary adventure and adversity ? A lady , who had once rode in her own carriage , and lived in Eastern splendor , was seen , not long since , seated in Broadway , New York , selling nuts to the passengers . Talk we of independence ! Who are free from bondage to others , and slavery to time and circumstance , but those who can not earn their own subsistence ? Among the causes for gratitude , that woman now has , not the least is the circumstance that new avenues for female industry are constantly opening in this age . To some one at least of these , should every young lady direct her attention . No one should be entirely unskilled as a teacher , a housewife , and above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it not be imagined that I advocate the education of females for any one station or class of circumstances . Let her who is prepared to support herself by toil , either mental or manual , be also qualified , should Providence elevate her in life , to grace the highest social and intellectual circles . If there have been any single error in the training of this sex , more prominent than all others , it has been this , that they were prepared for one station , or for one event only , and that every influence was deemed quite unimportant , save those which tended to qualify them for that station or relation alone . But it was not surely for marriage alone that God fashioned this associate and moral equal of man . Neither was it for high life , or low life , or middling stations , for east , west , north , or south , that she was made in the sacred image of her Creator . For all these circumstances , if Providence so appoint , should she be prepared . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spiritual , should be fully developed ; then is she truly educated . Especially should the school-room give personal Virtue . It should train the conscience , the heart and its affections aright , and guide to consistency of character . " Want of perseverance , " says Madam Necker , " is the great fault of woman , in every thing , morals , attention to health , friendship , &c."; Her intellect is cultivated too exclusively , in our times . It is to be feared that her education now gives her little moral energy . This is a grievous error . Instead of being more frail in body , and less firm in mind , or thorough in morals and piety , than in past ages , she should be endowed with new force of character . Amid the increased dangers of society , what is to protect her , and lift her from feebleness and degradation , if not personal character ? Man is to be educated for a vigorous encounter with the world ; in him the stronger qualities , tempered by sensibility and affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him in the station he may fill , not openly and directly , but by a wise , gentle , and steady , domestic influence . In her , love should be the ruling star ; but that love will avail him comparatively little , unless joined to a well trained intellect , a cultivated mind , and sound judgment . Amid the darkness , and tempestuousness , and growing perils of these latter ages , she should be a Pharos-tower , giving light and life to tempted man . If her moral culture do not correspond to her literary acquirements , they will prove but dangerous weapons in the hand of the lawless . Catharine de Medici was renowned , like her family , for talent and learning . She possessed unbounded influence over her son , the prince . But the horrid massacre of St. Bartholomew , the work of her spirit , is sufficient to render her name as infamous as it is distinguished . Let the intellect of this sex continue to be highly cultivated . But let " such respect To woman 's noiseless duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart That fears their splendor , loves their goodness too . " Mrs. Jameson inquires , and very properly , whether " where woman is idle and useless by privilege of her sex , a divinity , and an idol , a victim , or a toy , her position is not quite as lamentable , as false , as injurious to herself , and to all social progress , as where she is the drudge , slave and possession of man ? " Another scene for the education of woman lies in circles for Conversation . This is a pre-eminent means , not only of pleasure , but of improvement . It is a quickener of the intellect , a purifier of the affections , and an instrument of heightening our spiritual aspirations . I doubt whether woman especially is not more indebted to this , than to all her other facilities , for mental and moral advancement . But how shall it be made conducive to the highest possible good ? It must be studied , as an art . A girl may as easily be taught to converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differ , in this talent , it is true , as regards fluency ; but this is by no means essential to useful conversation . Good sense , a respectable education , and a pure heart , are the great requisitions . She who has these , can not fail , with suitable efforts , of becoming agreeable and edifying in her discourse . To give the utmost effect to your privileges in this respect , learn first the talent of listening to others . Never pass even a few moments with one skilled in this accomplishment , without earnest attention . You will thus not only gather knowledge , but observe how this great art may be practised . You will perceive that no affectation and no insincerity are needed to enable you to improve in this precious power . Simplicity , naturalness , a truthful air and manner are , indeed , more frequently the result of labor than their opposites . It is hard , in this world of artifice , to be perfectly artless . To educate yourself in this talent , resolve , in the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own heart . Nothing is more fatal to improvement than being the echo of other voices . Let your remarks be like the gentle stream from the hill-side , which spreads freshness and verdure on its banks . Better say a simple thing of your own than a wise one purloined from your neighbor . Regard this great principle , and you will grow in the gift of conversation , and you will also keep your soul unpolluted by guilt . Adhere sacredly to the truth . Avoid exaggeration , the sin of the young and the ardent . Rather understate than exceed the facts of a case . This rule will save you from the two great vices of social intercourse , flattery , and detraction . It is right to tell another precisely what we think of his merits , if done discreetly . But to give him a better impression of our estimate of his character than the truth will warrant , is , although very common , a plain violation of the laws of God . Adhere to the truth , and you will always exhibit charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your words with a noon-tide brightness . It will dispel the mists of scandal , and beautify , and write the law of kindness on , your lips . Speak much of principles , and little of persons . You have enjoyed a good education , and why should you prefer the discussion of such beggarly topics as dress , or the private concerns of your neighbor , to those noble thoughts , which learning , morals , and religion , would always supply to your mind ? Determine to carry with you childhood 's innocence , and angel love , and you will find the field of topics spread out before you an illimitable harvest of good fruits . Make your Friendships a means of intellectual and moral improvement . God has graciously given us this boon , as a burnisher of our existence : " Nature , in zeal for human amity , Denies or damps an undivided joy . * * * Joy is an exchange ; Joy flies monopolists ; Delight intense is taken by rebound . " The friendships of woman , from her being gifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and destiny . Therefore is it , that a young lady should choose her intimate associates with care . Let it not be accident , still less unhallowed gratifications , prejudice , pride , passion , folly , which form the basis of this holy structure . Where our friends can be selected , they should be those of attainments superior to our own , of pure principles , and virtuous habits . The pursuits of the school-room afford opportunity for forming the closest friendships . The address of Helena to Hermia , is applicable to very many females who associate early in seminaries of learning : " We , Hermia , Have with our needles created both one flower ; Both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion ; Both warbling of one song , both in one key ; As if our hands , our sides , voices , and minds , Had been incorporate . " Let the youthful female beware , in school and everywhere , of hasty preferences , of taking home to her inmost confidence the acquaintance of a day . Her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Purity and love , the loftiest powers of our nature , not time alone , but eternity also , should form the seal of her lasting friendships . Educate yourself at home and in private . By fireside fidelity the soul is expanded and our being lifted toward God . View your relative connections as each a Heaven-sent teacher . Incline your ear to them , as if through their lips an oracle uttered its decrees in your hearing . By your Reading , much may be accomplished toward correcting your taste , enlarging your intellectual vision , and sanctifying your spirit . Form now the habit of daily reading some volume with reference to your personal improvement . Let no engagement seriously interrupt this practice . Read the writings of your own sex . Woman takes up her pen , usually , from the promptings of sympathy and affection . The temple she builds to literature , may have an altar consecrated to reason , or to imagination ; but it is love , a high and holy love , which she inscribes on its portals . Her works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Woman is addicted to the eager perusal of works of fiction . I regard this fact as an indication of a want of her nature . Not , therefore , to eradicate but to control , and direct , and restrain , this propensity , would I make an endeavor . In the words of the afflicted Lady Russell , used on the anniversary of her husband 's execution , I would say , " I do not contend with nature , but keep her as innocent as I can . " Select only such writings of this class as some judicious friend has recommended . Read poetry . If it be true poetry , it is the twin-sister of religion . It will exalt and ennoble your soul . Study history . From that you will draw unfailing draughts of knowledge and wisdom . Be familiar with good biography . Above all , make the Word of God your constant study . So will you be educated for every stage of your existence , and ripe clusters of virtues will adorn your life . But louder than those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading . Let each line raise a rivulet on the bosom of your being ; let there be in it no stagnant waters . Be active in mind ; meditate on your daily experience , your prospects , your deficiencies , your progress , your hopes . Wouldst thou have peace in this world , " From the soul itself must issue forth A light , a glory , a fair luminous cloud Enveloping the earth ; And from the soul itself must there be sent A sweet and powerful voice , of its own birth , Of all sweet sounds , the life and element . " Wouldst thou enjoy peace in the interminable future , " lay these things to thy heart . " Then shall thy inward beauties shine with a fadeless refulgence . All true power shall be given thee . Thou shalt be " a lady , " not indeed of an earthly kingdom , but of that high realm , boundless as thy desires , and enduring as God . Chapter IV . HOME . Domestic virtues the glory of a country .

Disinterestedness . Elizabeth of England . Charities . Quietness . Spirituality . Piety at home the zest of Joys . It gilds the darkest cloud . Wherein consists the true glory of a people ? Their prosperity does not lie simply in outward abundance . It depends far more on the solid virtues and the Christian graces of the young in their midst . And these qualities appertain not only to our sons , in whom it is often imagined the whole strength at least of nations is concentrated . Our daughters likewise are concerned in the advancement of this high object . One of the sacred writers implores for his countrymen this blessing ; " that our daughters may be as corner stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They must be " corner stones , " lying at the very foundation of the social edifice , and therefore an essential part of its support . And to their power must be added moral beauty . They are to be " polished after the similitude of " that most splendid of structures , " a palace . " Observe also the relation through which the sex may afford this aid to their race . It is not petitioned by the writer referred to , that our women may become all eloquent orators ; or be fitted to bear the sword , or sway the sceptre ; nor yet that they may rival man in physical achievements ; nor even is the prayer that they may be renowned for genius and intellect alone , or supremely . But to a far less conspicuous and imposing sphere are our thoughts directed by the Psalmist . It is to home , to " our daughters , " and through them to the domestic relations in general , that we are pointed for the elements of public prosperity . " Happy is that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they , because a people " whose God is the Lord . " What views are usually taken by the youthful female of her parental home ? It has various aspects . To one it appears pre-eminently as the place in which she is to find the necessaries , comforts , and , perhaps , luxuries , of life . The heads of the family are appointed to toil for her . At her feet must brothers and sisters lay the daily tribute of service . She exacts from each inmate all the attention that can be rendered to one born to command . She is , in one word , a household divinity . Another regards her home as a scene for display . The furniture , the style , the outline , and the filling up , must be all for the eye of the visitor . If she consent to give her own hand to the work , the main motive is for fireside decorations . A third is alive to the natural ties which bind her to one and another ; but it is chiefly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest and most sacred relations . Has she been absent for a season , how fervent are her salutations , on returning to her native spot . Does sickness assail a parent or a brother , and life seem exposed , what tears , what wringing of the hands , what uncontrolled wailings are heard . But the test of true love is not here . It is the personal sacrifices we make for another , the toil , self-denial , watchfulness and patient service we bestow on him , that reveal the sincerity and depth of our affection . Still another class are those young women who esteem the great purpose of their home to be the furnishing all possible facilities for their literary instruction . If they attend school constantly and improve their time there , then they have a claim on all their connections to wait their bidding , and execute their mandates , in every interval of study . The whole being is thus absorbed in the intellect . There remains one more view of the fireside , and that is the moral , spiritual , religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the canvass of domestic life . Every other should be subservient to this . It should stand forth with a commanding interest , and address us in a tone of authority . Our home may be welcome for the conveniences and comforts it affords . We may take a just pride in its external aspect . Our hearts are allowed to fix some of their affections on its objects . It is right that the young should seek earnestly the means of intellectual culture at the hands of parental care . But these are all " lesser lights . " They can only borrow and reflect . There must be in the highest heaven a " greater light , " even the Sun of Righteousness , or life sinks beneath a darkness that may be felt . The Scriptures assign this rank to the moral bearings of home . The patriarchs exhibited their fairest virtues in the private relations of life . Judaism was penetrated with a domestic spirit . The age of the wise man could furnish qualities , of which , in the book of Proverbs , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect matron and wife . Sarah , Rebecca , Ruth , Hannah , where was the scene of their glory ? In home . Equally does the New Testament exalt the spiritual influence of the domestic relation . Who was the immortal Mary ? The mother of Jesus . What gave Martha and the other Mary their renown in the gospel ? They were sisters of Lazarus , and partly from their fidelity as such , were loved by their Master . She who cast the two mites into the treasury , among the rich the richest , was the more commended because a poor widow . Lydia , not only gave herself , by the baptismal seal , unto God , but honored the cause in her household . Thus does home blend its waters with the river of life . Fidelity to its trusts is an inseparable ingredient in the cup of salvation . Therefore would I conjure the youthful female to value her domestic bonds as a means of moral culture , and never , under sunny skies , or beneath clouds that lower , to lose sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detail of her daily walk religious principle . Not the slightest act should she perform , which is at war with her spiritual culture . Love , duty , trust , these may enter into the very soul of her being . Let her place them before her , and pursue them steadily , and she shall become the " corner-stone " of her family , " polished " with a divine lustre . But , to render a greater aid to her who desires and wills domestic excellence , let us now speak of the particular relations of home , and their natural , consequent claims on the young of her sex . The filial relation is replete with moral incentives . To both parents a daughter is indebted beyond even the powers of requital usually granted her sex . From the hour of her birth up to the present moment she has been to them an object of unceasing thought , care , and solicitude . The little being , over whom , as she graced the cradle , they hung with the deepest joy , spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell of her wants , by her utter helplessness . No labor was spared , no sacrifice withheld , did they promise to advance her happiness . A few weeks pass , and she is radiant with smiles , the emanations of light and love ; but they are smiles effaced often by tears , and for these , the parent can not rest till they dry on the cheek . And soon her age exhibits character , dispositions , propensities . How anxiously is their earliest developement observed . What plans are devised , what efforts employed , what prayers nightly ascend , that she may prove an heir of grace and godliness . " The parent-pair their secret homage pay , And proffer up to Heaven the warm request That He who stills the raven 's clam'rous nest , And decks the lily fair in flow'ry pride , Would , in the way his wisdom sees the best , For them , and for their little ones provide ; But chiefly , in their hearts with grace divine preside . " That father , with what meditations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul been visited , as he looked on this daughter . How has his daily toil been cheered by the anticipation that its fruits would afford means to meet her wants , to educate her well , and to furnish resources for supplying the outward and inward necessities of her responsible age . Can she love , respect , and honor this benefactor ? Can she avoid it rather , who does not ask ? I know how much has been written , in romances , of the devotedness of daughters ; and yet the warmest coloring of this sentiment seems never beyond parental desert . There are scenes in which this truth is strikingly illustrated . It was a severe task for the daughters of Milton to read to their blind parent , languages sealed to their own understanding ; but was it not the discharge of a simple duty ? We are struck with the Roman instance of filial piety , in which the life-blood was shed by tender woman to save a father . Yet when should one meet a voluntary death , if not for the redemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father , and seek so to demean herself that his eye might dwell fondly on the very secrets of her heart . Let her refer to his opinions , consult his wishes , and conform to his tastes and habits . His reception as he returns at evening to his fireside , should not consist in ceaseless importunities , nor of aught which terminates in unreasonable regards for self . How much better were a studious concern for his wants , and the bestowal of some act of delicate attention . His pecuniary circumstances should be thoughtfully considered . Perhaps he is destitute . Then do not press him with calls he is pained , but yet compelled , to deny you . It may be that his fortune has recently been marred . Consider this , and be willing to relinquish personal gratifications and adapt your feelings and desires to his present situation . Or he is thrown , perhaps , on the bed of sickness . Manifest now the reality of that affection you professed for him in his health . Delight to bathe his fevered brow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has qualified your sex . In his old age be still more devoted . Point out to his failing vision the path he would tread . Let him feel that you are striving to solace his declining years , and to requite that love which was shed upon you , the earliest moment of your consciousness . Can you do less for him , now that desire fails and the grasshopper has become a burden and he must soon go to his long home ? Of you may it be said , " Amid the giddy round of prosperous years , The birth of new affections , and the joys That cluster round earth 's favorites , there walked Still at her side , the image of her Sire . " But , if all this be due to a father , how shall we describe the claims of a mother ? To this parent the daughter owes her very being . These are the arms which never tired of supporting her in infancy . For her the step was light , the voice hushed , the breath almost suppressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and home made the one thought , until the cheek grew pale , and the eye dim for sleeplessness . The sickness of her daughter poured new waters into a cup , that seemed already filled with cares . To clothe and adorn her , every personal comfort was cheerfully foregone . That she might enjoy the best mental and moral culture , this mother discharged daily those services , which the domestic walk daily demands . In sorrow there is no bosom that consoles like a mother 's . Into her ear the child pours its every trial . When the world censures , she will soothe . Let injury , degradation , distress come upon us , let us dread the eye of others , or , through guilt , shrink timidly from them , we flee to her for refuge . This affection is bestowed on the daughter with a fulness and a permanence , which she can not comprehend , and remain still insensible . In view of her relation , the true daughter will always sympathize with , and aid , this her greatest earthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw every burden on her spirit , because she is willing to bear them . No , her point of view will be the opposite of this . " How much , " she will ask , " can I do for my mother ? Is there nothing in which I can relieve her from her toils ? The utmost I can render her is but a meagre compensation for her countless sacrifices for my sake . " The daughter may not only think of those domestic duties which require manual efforts , but in the general education of her brothers or sisters , she may prove a powerful ally with their natural teacher . Having composed the infant to rest , let its childhood continue to be her care . She can aid it to lisp the first accents of its native tongue . In the rudiments of knowledge she may be an efficient instructor . For this work her age peculiarly qualifies her . As the breath of spring quickens the tender bud , so let her youthful spirit infuse vigor into these minds yet younger than her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes she should strive for a spotless character . What joy and pride will her obedience to Jesus impart . Let her know , that the virtue of her daughter is dear to a parent as life itself . What a weight is thrown on that bosom , if she fail of goodness . Death is grievous : " But ye , who for the living lost That agony in secret bear , Who shall with soothing words address The strength of your despair ? " Weigh well the influence you exert on this parent . God has ordained that the child should re-act on the parent in his riper years , that the daughter should become in her turn the counsellor and the confidant of her mother . Let her wield this power with wisdom and in purity of conscience . Never take advantage of your influence , to secure a sanction of the wrong . But lead your mother , and aspire yourself , toward perfect integrity , and the sinlessness of heaven . Let the portraiture of a holy life be drawn on the canvass before you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears bedew her grave , " My mother  --  where thou art gone Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown . May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore , The parting word shall pass my lips no more . " If the claims of a parent be such as I have described , then no defect of character , still less any outward deficiency , can justify the daughter in a disregard of father or mother . Wealth does not increase the filial obligations , neither does poverty diminish them . Honors , dress , fashion did not lay the foundation of your duty to love and respect your parents . Let them then live in obscurity , or be constrained to wear plain apparel , or have unfashionable furniture , or lack graceful manners , none the less are you solemnly bound to honor and comfort them . There is one circumstance , especially , which leads some young ladies cruelly to neglect their parents , and yet with no reason whatever . The daughter has received a better education than they ; she has spent a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learnt music and French . But what are these , and all her accomplishments worth , if they have but taught her to despise or neglect her truest benefactors ? Can she cast off , in their old age , those who toiled and bore unnumbered burdens , to procure for her these literary privileges ? If she do this , then , woe to her ; and woe to the unfortunate being , to whom she may be joined as a partner . For no sin does the curse of Heaven more surely descend on one , let it be delayed as it may , than for unkindness to parents . Nor does their guilt dissolve the bonds of filial duty . Every offender deserves more our pity than our cruelty or wrath . Who then should be commiserated and watched over , whose evil should we seek to overcome with good , and whose heart to melt by love , if not an offending parent 's ? Another relation , happily suited to promote female virtue , is that of Brother and Sister . Here are those united , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dear ties which belong to the associations of childhood . Theirs is not the conjunction for an evening of planets , whose orbits lie all apart ; but it is a union that dates from the earliest moments of life . And it is one as pure as it is primitive , giving scope for unalterable attachment , and deep joys , for kind offices and sincere virtue . But let it not be imagined that all these fruits spring from the soil spontaneously . Not of necessity is a sister happy in this relation ; and the reason is apparent . She is not coerced into sympathy , and self-sacrifice , and devotedness to her brothers , and without these qualities no outward connection brings peace and pleasure to the heart . It must be her study to devise means , frame plans ,  --  and to execute them faithfully ,  --  of promoting their good . Far will it be from accomplishing this most desirable end , to make protestations of her love , when prompted by impulse . Her actions must be the still , small voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she refuse to enter into the schemes and prospects of a brother , and to render him those minute services , which both indicate affection and prompt to it , she will regard this relation as a dull thing . It may be but a source of alienated feelings , of vexation and strife . Especially must the sister guard well the avenues to moral danger , which beset her brothers . Let her strive to make home attractive in their sight . Is she competent in music , she has here a means of ever-new interest , and of affording that variety of recreation for which the young man thirsts . By pleasant conversation , and by reading occasionally a volume to a brother , she may bind him to the fireside . Does he desire to pass the evening abroad ? Better join him , even at some cost of personal ease , or of taste , than leave him exposed to seek places of equivocal character . Be his confidant , his adviser , constant in demonstrations of kindness . Perhaps he is aiding your progress in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his care , as by a steady emanation of moral and spiritual light ? A sister 's love is often an amulet to the subsequent character of a circle of brothers . She whispers to them , when on the brink of temptation . Her form is ever present . Their thoughts wander often to their childhood 's home , and in secret self-communion the sentiment re-visits the heart , " For I , methinks , till I grow old As fair before me shall behold , As I do now , the cottage small , The lake , the wood , the waterfall ; And thee , the Spirit of them all . " The services of a sister are peculiarly to be appreciated by the other sisters . If they comprehend most fully the joys of one another , so do they those sorrows , with which no " stranger intermeddleth . " They , who have shared one mind and one heart , from their early days , can comprehend those sufferings which not even the parent , from her elder age , entirely participates . In sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in those trials , to which their condition through life subjects them , no sympathy is dearer than a sister 's . How unnatural is a deficiency in these holy dispositions . Can it be that the one is ever an object of envy , or jealousy , or ever regarded with distrust , coldness , or still more with hostility , by the other ? Let them beware of the first approach of a contentious spirit . Their manners ,  --  as indeed those of all in a family circle ,  --  should never be rude , or careless , but ordered with watchfulness , delicacy , and propriety . The manner between sisters may be such as of itself to enshrine and secure their mutual kindness . It may too , by negligence , become a provoker of dissension and enmity . The fairest of maidens , is not she whose cheek mantles in beauty ; but she whose gentle , Christian , courteous , carriage with brother and sister , radiates a perpetual moral beauty . The eldest of a band of sisters is by nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her circle younger than herself . How can she so well fulfil all righteousness in the domestic sphere , as by cheerfully sharing with her mother this office ? Her age and experience qualify her to instruct the mind and train the affections , and tempt forth the virtues , of pliant childhood . Neither sister nor brother can estimate , in this life , all they owe to such a teacher . Eternity will reveal the extent , and complete the reward , of these sacred services . The young woman may be useful , still farther , to all the Inmates of her father 's dwelling . Not one of the number can witness her daily deportment , without receiving from it some impression of her character . And now what shall this be ? Do all testify that she lives unto others , that the noble spirit of the gospel is inhaled , as the life-breath of her moral being ? She has constant opportunities to deny herself for the sake of some member of the household . Does she seek , or does she shun , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has demands on her kind consideration . Nor yet is this duty restricted by the fraternal bond . Her remote relations should be sedulously regarded . Let me add that , if her situation be a favored one , her poorer relations should be objects of thought and attention . How ungrateful for her own blessings were she ,  --  and how forgetful , that soon she also may experience the buffetings of fortune ,  --  did she treat such a relation with negligence , or with a haughty , condescending , patronizing , which is often a heart-lacerating , attention . Why should a visitor be despised because her age , or manners , or dress are not perfectly agreeable ? Woman has been celebrated by travellers for her universal hospitality . Let it not be strangers alone , and these the learned and prosperous , who enjoy her smiles . All , who come beneath a father 's roof , should be made to feel that the daughters are Christian ladies . Nor should Domestics fail of receiving a respectful and generous treatment from the young females of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and mind , as ourselves . Why then demand of them tasks , which only the mere animal can sustain ? We should strive to assist ourselves , for their sake , no less than our own . Spare them in their sickness . Speak to them always in a tone of gentleness . If an overbearing manner in the head of a family be hard to meet , how must it strike a domestic , when coming from the younger members ? Above all , provide something for the mental , moral , and religious , good of the domestic . Can you not lend her a volume , or read aloud to her yourself ? Can you not , occasionally at least , facilitate her attendance at church ? Remember you must meet this being at the common judgment-seat of Christ ; and let this thought pervade your whole manner toward her . Having contemplated a part of the duties growing out of special domestic relations , let us now advert to a few of the prominent moral virtues , for whose culture home is peculiarly congenial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dignified with the name of duty . But if Health be essential to happiness , and the basis ,  --  as it doubtless is ,  --  of several Christian qualities , who shall deny the sacred title of duty , to the care of the physical system ? Whence proceed that morbid sensitiveness , that sickly sentimentalism , and that puny selfishness , which sometimes mark the delicate woman ? They spring from ill health ; and while no means are employed to remove the root of these moral evils , in vain will the branches of each month or each day of her life be pruned diligently away . If there be no muscular energy the nerves become irritable , and the temper a source of perpetual disquiet , not only to one 's self , but to every associate in the household . It is therefore a duty of the young woman , for health 's sake , not to allow a kind mother to become her waiting maid , but to exert herself in the performance of domestic , manual services . If she permit the needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sacredly devoted to physical exercise , then let her know that God is thereby dishonored ; for laws , which he thought worthy to establish , are , by her negligence , daily and directly violated . Home is a moral school for the acquisition of habits of Industry . It is a singular fact that , while every young man is trained to a regular occupation ,  --  even the sons of the wealthiest are so ,  --  and to have no business or calling is , with this sex , deemed a reproach , young ladies are , in some circles , not only excused in indolence , but regarded as disgraced , if they are industrious and useful . Is this a pure state of society ? Are not all who thus judge , and all who thus live , sadly deluded ? God has wedded industry and happiness , and ordained that they shall never be divorced . Idleness corrodes the mental faculties , and thus causes depression and gloom . It is the disturber of conscience ; for nothing makes us so miserable , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are drones in society . Blessed are the poor ; for they know the sweets of toil . Pitiable are the rich , if their treasures generate a selfish indolence . Equally true is it that diligence is indissolubly bound to virtue . The mind , when unoccupied by profitable topics , roams on forbidden ground . Folded arms are accompanied by a distempered imagination . The tongue of the idle often setteth a world on fire ; for scandal and gossip vegetate to rankness in the garden of sloth . The degradation , therefore , is not on the side of work . Be not ashamed to labor ; for it is Heaven 's decree that all should labor . Conceal not your industry . It is honorable , and honored by all good minds . In a republic especially , where the follies of caste should never enter , let woman , if she must glory , glory in being scrupulously devoted to some useful occupation . So living , she will find grace and goodness attend on her steps . Where is the habit of order better acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In what school can a girl so well learn lessons of energy and firmness , as in that where she relieves a mother more and more , as her ability increases , of the charge of her family ? Neatness is of primary importance . The care of a brother 's linen , or even so humble a teacher as the duster , may inculcate this virtue . Let her , who prizes cheerfulness aright , know that never does she sing lullaby to an infant sister , or act as a peace-maker between two contentious brothers , without making music in her own heart . At the period of my writing no quality is more loudly commended than frugality . It should always be encouraged , for its Christian influences . She , who is prodigal of her father 's possessions , is seldom mindful of the calls of charity , or marked by propriety of dress , and the subordination of the appetites . I have elsewhere spoken of habits of industry as a preparation for reverses of fortune ; but were a young lady perfectly assured of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own character , she should be diligent and frugal . Let her expend freely for her mental culture , and devote large sums rather to the relief of the needy , than to selfish indulgences . She who belongs to the mass in this country , removed alike from the extremes of wealth and poverty , can never with impunity allow herself in habits of extravagance . This thought should be kept daily in mind , as she pursues the round of domestic duty . The wardrobe and the table constantly suggest it . The duties of the fireside are friendly to Contentment . Why are females so often restless and disquieted at their own abode ? Why does ennui prey on their spirits , save when some visit or visitor is in prospect ? How should it be , that daughters , blest as those of America now are , should pant for the excitements of a round of public pleasures ? Providence designed our institutions for the promotion of woman 's content and peace , no less than for that of man . Her hearth-stone was intended to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of herself and her duties , will ever find it so . Here is an individual , who is disturbed by ambition . Her own little family circle is too narrow a sphere for her . But she mistakes the springs of content . Let her know that the wreath she wears should rest on her heart . The reply of the illustrious Lady Jane Grey , to those who informed her that her father had left her the crown of England , is worthy of her sex . " I am not so young , nor so little read in the smiles of fortune , to suffer myself to be taken by them . My liberty is better than the chain you proffer me , with what precious stones soever it may be adorned , or of what gold soever framed ;  --  if you love me sincerely and in good earnest , you will rather wish me a secure and quiet fortune , though mean , than an exalted condition , exposed to the wind and followed by some dismal fall . " Her melancholy fate , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave a new and sad proof of her rare sagaciousness . She who is faithful in the domestic walk , enjoys singular opportunities for the exercise of Gratitude . Not only may she , by her assiduous attentions , partially requite a mother 's services , but she can thus express her grateful sense of the superior elevation now allotted her sex . At the table and the fireside she may cause man to bear witness to , and rejoice in , the use she is making of her increased privileges . Here may she describe , in Christian colors , the much sought " line of beauty . " Our country has done for her what Greece and Rome proudly denied her sex . It has conferred on her the blessings of education , equality of companionship with man , new means of benevolence , and the pledge of new spheres of action , so far as nature qualifies her , and the paramount claims of undeniable duty shall permit . What returns shall she make ? Her country asks but one . Fresh zeal in self-tuition and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for true citizenship , and for immortal virtue and blessedness . Another moral aspect of home , to be regarded by woman , is that it affords room for the practice of habitual Disinterestedness . A selfish man is an object of painful contemplation . How much more is this defect to be deplored in woman . She , whose nature , so ardent and susceptible , prompts to an almost instinctive kindness , can not fail in this quality , without shedding a blight on her entire character . But designate a female insulated by circumstances from the usual family connections , uninterested in domestic duties , and how often do you see one destitute of sympathy and an expansive benevolence . Elizabeth of England had no love of home ; and what do we hear of her ? That she had a lion-like port ; but woman-like , Christian-like , humane , she certainly was not . She passed through life , it is said , without a single friend . She who performs the domestic duties aright , will find time for , as she must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school is a sphere in which her fireside virtues prepare her to instruct . Teaching in general accords beautifully with the inspirations of home . Every female should be an intellectual and moral guardian to some portion of the young around her . In bestowing of her substance , and especially of her personal attentions , on the sick and the poor , she will find all she has done of good at home an invaluable prompter and aid . For the sake , therefore , of others , as a social and responsible being , let the flame she would support on the public altar be kindled from the vestal fire of the domestic one . Again , what purity would it infuse into her Friendships , did the young maiden love first and serve best her own kindred . Let her deep affections be developed by fireside fidelity , and how may she expend , of these heart-gathered riches , on the friends she is making of her own sex . What a pledge has she given too of constancy in every new relation she may form . Piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " work of righteousness , and its effect " also . She is the true gentlewoman , who nurtures most faithfully in herself the calm virtues of the domestic walk . Heaven is a tranquil abode ; let the soul be attuned for its harmonies by the quiet measures of fireside melody . I close by saying , that in the family we may best cultivate a Christian Spirituality . There may self-communion be enjoyed . There too can we indulge in the perusal of those writings , which invigorate our faith , and give a firmer tone to our religious sentiments and our moral principles and habits . Be frugal of your moments , and each day you will redeem the hour for this duty , which God and the future demand . Commune habitually with that Being , whose countenance beams brightly on our dwellings . It is morning ; trust not yourself to the trials and temptations before you , without commending yourself to your Immortal Guardian . It is evening ; enter the sanctuary of the Holiest , " And take the thought of this calm vesper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , On through the dark days fading from their prime , As a sweet dew to keep your soul from blight . " To all your literary acquisitions , and to every accomplishment , as a relative and a friend , add piety at home . That shall be an ornament of grace to thy neck . If God prosper your domestic ties , piety will give fresh zest to every homefelt joy . And should He call you to those trials , disappointments , and sorrows , of which , when they come on a household , woman must drink the dregs of the cup , how will you sustain them , without the love of God in your heart ? Make Him your early trust , and He will gild the darkest cloud , with a ray of that mercy , which falls never so welcome as on the stricken heart . " Earth may forsake  --  oh ! happy to have given , The unbroken heart 's first fragance unto Heaven . " Chapter V. SOCIETY . Dangers on entering Society . Of cherishing a Passion for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's view of it ; connected with virtues . Mrs. Hancock . Exposure of Health . Affectation ; of extreme sensibility ; of insensibility .

A holy Purpose . We spoke , in the preceding chapter , of the paramount demands of home on the youthful female . This was represented as the central luminary of life . We are led naturally , in this place , to note those influences adverse to domestic piety . There are planets , in the moral heaven of woman , whose orbits are so eccentric , that their motions are of fearful import to her heart . When she enters society , an equal among elders , it is a trying exigency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptations are numerous , while her moral energy is usually less decided than at subsequent periods . Among the perils appertaining to this stage , of a general description , I name , first , That of cherishing a Passion for Society , to the neglect of domestic duty . To one issuing from an ordinary light , into the broad glare of the sun , there is danger that the vision may suffer . How often has she , who might have graced her home through all coming years , had she retained her first love of it , failed and fallen from this height , by being overpowered by the dazzling charms of a round of new pleasures . In vain has a brother , distant from home , entreated that she continue a sisterly correspondence . To no purpose has the gentle voice of a mother been at length raised against her dissipating course . The spell of a sorcerer is upon her . She is a doomed woman ; there , in the gay world , fluttering , perhaps the admired of all admirers . Her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should she be placed at the head of a new household ? Another exposure , always to be feared in society , arises from the sensitiveness of woman to Public Opinion . In our country this influence brings danger and evil to both sexes . The language of Cecil , if true of London , is more so of America . " Doing as others do is the prevalent principle , " he affirms , " of the present female character . This ,  --  so far as it avails with man or woman ,  --  is the ruin , death , and grave of all that is noble , and virtuous , and praiseworthy . " An inordinate desire to please every one is surely a snare to integrity and purity of character . But who so tempted , in this respect , as a young , dependant , and almost helpless , female ? Such are the customs of society , that woman is placed beneath the protection of man . A consciousness of this position can not fail to awaken a strong desire for his favor . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over one just entering the path of social life . In future days she will gain , perhaps , new confidence in herself , and rely more on her inward resources , while in the world . But now , she must lean much upon others , and will , almost insensibly , conform unduly to their wishes and practices . Let a guard be early stationed at this post of peril . In regard to her Dress , the young woman is liable to subject herself completely to that form of public opinion termed fashion . This power , elsewhere an idol , seems in the realm of dress a very Moloch . How often are our children cast into its fiery arms , and the cries of the victim , or rather the cries of duty , and reason , drowned by the harsh music of the world . Not only at evening parties , in the streets , and at Lectures , but in the very house of God , you shall see the dominion of this tyrant . I quote , on this topic , an eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards you are accustomed to hear such remarks as follow : ' Did you observe Mrs. M. 's dress last Sunday ? She must have got it from France ; it was something so out of the common way , I could not take my eyes off from her all church time . ' Another wore some article so old , or ill-fashioned , as to be unfit to be seen at church . A third looked so ugly in black that she ' must detest going into mourning . ' " Now is not all this unworthy a rational and immortal being ? Shall even the sanctuary be profaned by this polluting intruder ? It is only our familiarity with such scenes , that prevents our shedding angel tears over this sin . Why should it concern us , that Paris is glittering with some new token of her passion for outward adorning ? It is sad to see the devotion of this young republic to the customs and follies of the old world . The gardener tells us , that a tree or a flower , unless imported from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our boasted horticulturists . Let us reform this spirit of servitude , and , repair to our own fields and forests for specimens of beauty . Let the good sense and the good taste of the American woman , shew to the nations abroad , that we will not servilely depend upon them , for every turn of a collar , or form of a bonnet . Had we more of " the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , " yes , a quiet , contented , and Christian spirit , we should devise for ourselves meet fashions and modes of apparel . My reason for dwelling on this subject is , that it has important Moral relations . I do not deny that dress may be properly regarded , both from a reasonable conformity to custom , and as an expression of the sense of beauty . Nay , I believe it may minister to several of the virtues . Neatness , economy and purity , rank high in the Christian scale of attainments , and all these are promoted by propriety of dress . It is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity , those prime moral qualities , are very often manifested by the mere materials , or the construction , or adjustment , of the dress . Let it never , therefore , be viewed as a matter of indifference . Still less should a lady excuse herself in negligence in this respect , even for the care of her family , or the culture of her mind . Least of all should she affect a total unconcern about dress . The wife of John Hancock was remarkable , to the close of her life , for her attention to the neatness and beauty of her apparel . " I will never forgive , " said she , " a young girl who does not dress to please , nor one who seems pleased with her dress . " Literary ladies are sometimes strangely negligent in this respect . They may imagine that carelessness about personal appearances will be taken for a proof of genius . But men do not thus judge . On the contrary , they regard her as truly great , who is eminent for learning and talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manners . The sin of this matter lies in a breathless devotion to outward adorning . This is fatal to the inward and Christian graces . She who foregoes a reasonable regard to economy , for the sake of dress , is decidedly culpable . We are told that " a collection of three hundred and fifty pounds was once made for the celebrated Cuzzona , to save her from absolute want ; but that she no sooner got the money than she laid out two hundred pounds of it in the purchase of a shell cap , which was just then in fashion ! " Something of the same prodigality is often exhibited , only on a smaller scale . She who thinks more of her apparel than of her language , more of adopting the latest fashion than of conversing with intelligence , and demeaning herself as becomes a disciple of Jesus , must beware of her moral exposure . Let it not be conceived , that whatever of error woman exhibits in her attachment to fashion is to be charged on her sex alone . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idolized foreign modes of dress . It has been to gratify man ,  --  and he knew the disposition that prompted it ,  --  that such folly and excess have been shown in her apparel . Yet will I say that it is not so with us all ; few , very few of our sex are propitiated by an extravagant care for fashions . Most men are pained by the attenuated forms and pale countenances of those , who are slaves to every new mode of dress . They prefer the bloom of health , and the evidences of good taste , good sense , purity and propriety , seen in a well-dressed female , to the caricatures sanctioned only by the name of some foreign city . The care of a young lady 's health is another interest affected much by her entrance into society . The little girl is a picture of bloom and buoyancy . And why ? Because fashion permits her to sport in the freedom of nature . The laws of God are allowed , in her case , to be so regarded as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were rude and disreputable in her to indulge in those bodily exercises essential to her physical wellbeing . There is much ignorance , I am aware , among this sex , in reference to the conditions of health . Yet more are they who sin in this respect against light , than in the absence of it . Is it not known that the exposure of the feet to wet and cold , in shoes genteelly thin , may induce disease ? Can it be , that the multitudes , who compress the lungs and chest into half the space designed for them by nature , and thus occasion diseases of the spine , if not even consumption , sin all in ignorance ? A slender waist was not regarded in ancient Greece as an attribute of female beauty ; in Paris it is now usually deemed a deformity . When will this perverse taste in America be corrected ? Let gentlemen cease to praise such distortions of the frame , and let ladies exhibit the intelligence and regard to the laws of God , which will second and secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbarity of a pinched foot is contrary both to health and true taste ? Why should we refuse instruction from the ancient models of beauty , on these points , more than on others ? Is it not known that to pursue the dance in winter through the chills of midnight , and return to one 's home , as the day dawns , in summer apparel , is treading that path which has led thousands to consumption ? Yes , too often are these guilty practices indulged in merely from the bondage of fashion . Not only are parental voices unheeded , but personal convictions are silenced , rather than violate its Draco-like laws . There may be men who encourage woman in the culture of a false delicacy in reference to her health . There must be somewhere a power , before which these unhappy beings do homage . Else had we never witnessed that affected fastidiousness of appetite , and that affected sickliness , so fashionable in some circles . Let this sex , however , for the sake of self , and of posterity , of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which calls for the sacrifice of sound constitutions , and sometimes even life itself , rather than permit the " tender and delicate woman to set the sole of her foot on the ground . " Let physical vigor , attended by mental excellence and moral soundness , become a part of her noble adorning . No more may childhood and youth be the only seasons , in which public opinion shall tolerate those generous exercises in the free air , by which buoyancy and vigor may be prolonged even to old age . Fashion , if allowed its entire sway , leads woman into many modes of Affectation . Rosseau affirms that " artifice is a talent natural to woman . Let , " he says , " little girls be in this respect compared with boys of the same age ; and if these appear not dull , blundering , stupid , in comparison , I shall be incontestibly wrong . " Does this , if it be true , explain in any measure the strange fact that the servants of fashion must never be known as industrious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be always at leisure for the morning call and the evening levee ? Nothing , in some circles , would prove so fatal to a lady 's reputation for gentility , as the character of a working woman . The more idle and dependant on others , the greater the renown . And then , too , to be in high repute , one must feign an ignorance of every kind of employment . To be a good housewife , to understand every domestic duty , is degrading in the extreme . It is thought a proof of vulgarity to be acquainted with ordinary things . Pride is taken in egregious mistakes as to certain persons , places , and pursuits . To show a knowledge of what is done beyond her own caste would be to forfeit her rank , and would expel her from the highest circles in society . How many in the fashionable world conduct as though an excessive refinement of feeling were the chief praise of their sex . They can not witness any spectacle of suffering and pain ; it shocks their nerves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she from the high station , for which God created her , who thus shrinks from scenes where the beauty and glory of her nature may be so nobly displayed ! Can it be that an affected sensibility shall shut one of this sex from the chamber of sickness ? Lives there the man , who commends this wretched sentimentalism ? If there be one such in this land , we devoutly hope that our soil may soon cease to be polluted by his steps . Let him take refuge among the nobility of man 's fabrication ; for God hath denied him a place among his . There is but one species of affectation , to be more severely reprehended , in this connection , than that now considered ; it is the opposite of this , a feigned Insensibility . I once heard a lady , who was about parting from a circle of most valuable friends , parting too from her own native spot , on being asked if she did not feel deep regret at the thought of leaving those scenes , reply , " What good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression might manifest the philosophy of a Stoic , but a Christian philosophy , I am sure it did not . And a more unfeminine spirit than it discovered , I have never known in one of her sex . If it be weak in woman to exhibit great sensibility , it argues no moral strength , to guard against this by affecting to be a stock , or a stone . " The haughty woman who can stand alone , and requires no leaning-place in our heart , loses the spell of her sex . " Another form of the disposition in question , to be avoided by her who is entering society , is Conversation for the sake of Effect . It is feared by some that the simple truth , simply expressed , will fail to attract and impress . Hence come departures into the boundless field of imagination . Ridicule is employed to color , and give zest to , the truth . Or Mirth suggests the addition of some new fact to a story , that the laugh may be universal and loud . Exaggeration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by here throwing in a circumstance , and there suppressing one . An emphatic tone , a nod , or a gesture , intimate far more than the lips dare express . A favorite phrase is continually recurring , or a set of superlatives , shewing that nothing common occurs in the sphere of this individual . Perhaps Irony is indulged , to such unreasonable extent , that a stranger to our young lady 's habits of conversation , would be totally at a loss to judge when she was in earnest , and when trifling with the truth . Now all this " colloquial romancing , " as one styled it , is a violation of duty to God and our fellow creatures . It is a deviation from the truth of God ; it is unjust to those , of whom , and to whom , it is daily addressed . She , who is soon to be exposed to this moral contagion , should be kindly forewarned of its approach . Honor , affection , and her personal good , through the range of her whole being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , a young woman is in danger of a love of Fame , as concerns her Personal appearance , her style of Living , and especially the Entertainments given , on her account , by her parents . It is right that we love the approbation of the virtuous ; nor may we violate good taste for the sake of defying popular opinion . But she , who allows her desire of human esteem to supplant the higher sentiments and principles of our nature , clearly does wrong . And are there not those , who pine in secret , because they receive less notice than their ambition craves ? It is nothing to such that hundreds are won , so long as a single heart refuses them homage . What condition more truly deplorable than this insatiable thirst for applause ? We are told that Elizabeth of England , " who referred everything to self , was even jealous of the beauty and the dress of her maids of honor . When advanced in years , the sight of her face in a mirror would throw her into transports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as finally to lay her mirror wholly aside . " You shall see this same spirit manifested in an excessive care for showy furniture , in the encouragement of artificial and numberless wants , and in a willingness to live on resources dishonestly obtained , and on means belonging rightfully to another , sooner than relinquish one particle of former splendors . In ambitious entertainments , how often is woman tempted to lift herself above those , whom it should delight her to meet in society as her equals . If they can afford only plain walls , hers must be garnished . Her chamber must exhibit tapestry , and her windows the silken and fringed curtain , or she will not surpass them . Her table must groan beneath the productions of all climates . Already it is said , we in America expend in our dwellings , on a slender income , more than many in Europe , who have millions at their command . Now let the young woman be made acquainted with these facts . Although a fond father or mother would fain make her presentation eclipse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from this course . She may save a parent from bankruptcy . He , who is a true friend , will assure her that life is not that rose-colored thing , which some of her companions describe to her . Let her know that a vortex is before her , and ere her feet are within its feeblest eddies , let her prudently escape the peril . A quiet life , inward adorning , should be the jewel worn nearest her heart . If she cherish a thirst for outward exhibitions , too late may it be her doom to feel that the sunshine of the world 's favor and applause , has but beamed upon her , to make more fearfully distinct the caverns and wastes of her ever unsatisfied heart . The young woman is passing into a state of society in which she will find much merely nominal Morality . At home she has probably been nurtured amid sincere hearts , and under the high standard of Christian action . In the world she will hear indeed the same standard , for the most part , verbally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conformity to its requirements . She will still be told that purity of mind , soul , and manners , is the shield of her sex , and yet , in some circles , practices shall be tolerated , or fashions of dress , or conversation permitted , which to her all-unsophisticated reason must seem absolutely indefensible . History tells us , that in the thirteenth century , when the plague raged in Florence , it spread through the suburbs of that city , from the exhalations of certain beautiful flowers . See , my young friends , that the lovely associates of your life , even by their most interesting traits , do not betray you into , first slight , then graver , and at length into serious , departures from rectitude and purity . As a check against the corrupting influences of popular opinion and practices , woman should cultivate two virtues , Moral Independence , and perfect Ingenuousness . If she determine to cleave sacredly to her homebred convictions of right , let the world commend or condemn her , she will maintain the royalty of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward , and ever toward God and felicity . But let her succumb to society , and bow to every mandate of fashion , and she shall become a mental and moral slave . Equally would I incite you to the retention of your youthful Frankness , and Simplicity . When a child , you expressed precisely what you felt . Let not womanhood rob you of this angelic trait . Shun art ; abhor affectation . Set to your seal , that , if detected in this habit , you will lose the confidence and the respect of all noble minds . Know that if you are always ingenuous , you will secure self-respect , and a conscious integrity of heart . Let clouds lower , let the storms of deceit menace the circle you grace , on you will all eyes fix ,  --  and none more benignantly than the All-seeing one above ;  --  and in you will all behold the blue ether of Heaven . If the general dangers which beset a young woman , on her entrance into society be great , those which have reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let philosophy explain , as it may , the cause , nothing is more certain than that the feelings , and deportment , and speech , that occur between her and her sister females , are a source of constant temptation . Man has charity for the faults of woman ; and she has much for the errors of his sex ; but for those of her own sex how contracted is her mercy . Never are her Christian principles so tried , as when the character of another is in any wise impeached . Curiosity , opening paths filled with snares , often leads her to venture , where angels dare not tread . Let her mark well its perils , and beware how she intermeddle , with tongue or thought , in the secrets of her neighbor . A root of iniquity in this world is Envy . In the lower grades of society what pining and misery might be traced to this baleful passion . Why are the actions of a rich rival , or one endowed with personal charms , or gifts in conversation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ascribed to any but pure motives ? Whence is it , that a woman of talent and literary claims shall be thought by so many of her sex tinged with " blue ? " Why the secret endeavor to awaken ill-will toward the distinguished , and the reluctance to join in the defence of such , when unjustly accused ? Too readily are the faults of a compeer rehearsed , and too slowly are her virtues acknowledged . Should the modesty of some one be commended , may it not be because her diffidence gives us room to pass before her in the public eye ? During the middle ages , the young and the beautiful were sometimes burned at the stake , on the charge of having dealt in magic . If the body be not thus sacrificed , in this latter age , truth knows that the peace and happiness of many an innocent young woman are devoured by insatiate envy . Imitate , my young friends , the sweet temper of those ladies in Switzerland , who are reported to be so firmly knit together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet , after separation , in the meridian of life , with the affection of sisters . A love like this would scorch and destroy each germ of envy , while it gave life , vigor , and permanence , to a gospel charity . Akin to envy is the passion of Jealousy . The conscious possession of eminent attainments exposes one to this sin . Let it not be palliated , as if consistent with humility . It is the child of a morbid selfishness . It is pride , which makes us jealous of inferiors ; never does humility . Observe the manners of her who is infected with this spirit . Does that lofty carriage , do those averted eyes , and that sullen lip , speak of self-abasement ? Woman , dwelling in and for her affections , is prone insensibly to indulge the risings of jealousy . A female writer says , " Our sex are apt to be more aristocratic than men . " The aristocracy of claiming attention , friendship , promptly and unremittingly manifested , the aristocracy , in a word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often does cherish . Counsel , therefore , calls them to be vigilant , lest they offend in this respect , even unawares . Is a young maiden in prosperous circumstances ? Let her know that the growing fortunes of another will excite her to temptation and prejudice . Even now the branches of the oak , that will tower and shade her whole being , might be detected in the acorn . Has God endowed her with personal charms ? Prudence would apprise her , that " if the body be a paradise , it needs a cherub to guard the spirit within it . " Especially , in this connection , would I warn my female friends against the vice of Detraction . There are those , who find pleasure in repeating what they hear of the sins of a neighbor . If a misfortune befall another , it is made food for calumny . Her adversity is made the occasion of intruding on her most private concerns , and exposing them to the world . Compassion is expressed , and yet in a tone that betrays a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is felt for the sufferer , but a vulgar curiosity bruits the ill-natured rumor , and many hearts must hence bleed in their unseen solitude . How easily may a few words , spoken concerning an enemy , or a rival , kindle a village into flames . Recklessness may prompt speeches , full of mistatements , wounding the fame of another , which a life may be insufficient entirely to correct . The young woman must set herself resolutely in opposition to this practice . If she once form the habit of selecting the errors of others of her sex for her usual topic of discourse , time may make it like the change of the leopard 's spots , if she ever thoroughly reform . A light word , a breath , may so scatter the Sybil 's leaves , that no human power can again reduce them to order . A most dangerous weapon , when employed by one of this sex against a sister , is Ridicule . Not only does it rob her who indulges it of the rich joys of admiration , but it poisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace of her associates . Few are they , who have not some foible or personal defect , on which this vice may fix itself . One is an object of taunts for her ignorance ; another for a plain face ; a third for an impediment in her speech ; and how many suffer this infliction for some article of dress proscribed by that mistress called fashion . Too often are we reminded of the fabulous Melusina , to-day , a theme of wonder , for her grace and eloquence , to-morrow , a loathsome reptile , with a tongue full of scorpion stings . How does every attraction we feel toward her , who was framed with powers of speech to obey the highest law of God , wither , as flax in the flames , when the lips thus breathe desolation around them . The eye of the eagle is there piercing all depths by its intelligence ; but the soaring wing of that bird is wanting . It is the office of woman , her high privilege indeed , " To heal and pacify distempered spirits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own sex ? Allow that an associate has reached that eminence , which you could not attain , be it in learning , affection , or fortune . Will you foster toward her a spirit of animosity ? Is there one of this sex alive to the noble , by girding on the armor of retaliation and resentment ? Remember Jesus , and you will bow to the wrongdoer meekly , magnanimously . Nor should our young friend yield to a disposition to Flatter her favorites , any sooner than one to depreciate a rival . We may praise another simply to gain a return in kind . Or we may do it thoughtlessly , and by impulse . In each of these cases , we not only injure her by inflating her vanity , but wrong our own souls . Nor are all commendations right , which spring from a desire to gratify others . Ill-timed or excessive praise often does serious evil . It is only that which is just , rational , and moderate , that we should bestow on a friend . Avoid flattery ; express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not possess , and promising no fidelity , that circumstances may forbid you to manifest , and you will then speak the words due to merit , perfectly free from falsity , and acceptable in the sight of God . To speak now of the positive view of our subject , I would name a few virtues and graces , of primary concern in a young woman 's intercourse with society . There should be Gentleness of Manner . In this term we include not simply external appearances , though these are of no trivial importance . If manner impress and accomplish much in the sterner sex , as we all have felt , it is in the other , almost omnipotent . Dr. Bowring informs us that , in his recent travels in the East , he found the Samaritan , Syrian , and all Mussulman , ladies were accustomed to veil themselves in public . He was asked whether " the English women were so immodest as to walk out with uncovered faces ? " Thus highly are gentleness and modesty prized by the heathen . Should they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a coarse and rude woman ? In such we expect ,  --  and we are seldom disappointed ,  --  to find a rough character , a destitution of the gentle spirit of goodness and Christ . Will not one of this class flame against her dress-maker , if some point of fashion be violated by her ? Must we not fear that animal impulse will control her actions ? I recommend no courtly airs , no studying of gesture , or look . But I must think that , simplicity , freedom from pretence and affectation , modesty , self-possession , escaping both reserve and boldness , and a perfectly frank , truth-speaking manner , are deserving the culture of every female , who seeks the true adorning , and who would give pleasure , and do good , to others . Octavia was none the less marked by a Roman severity of virtue , because gentleness and grace shone through her bearing . Neither is the Christian woman the more pious , for an utter disregard of the courtesies of life . But lest some should misinterpret these remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . Kind Feelings , or the most accomplished manners are but a splendid hypocrisy . Avoid discourtesy , but avoid still more a hollow , insincere , merely outward , gracefulness . If the feelings be correct , the manner will usually be so . Corregio painted three furies , represented by as many young women , with beautiful forms and regular features . Looking intently on the hair , you might see a single serpent wreathed in its tresses ; and studying the expression of their countenances , you detected in them cunning , malice , and cruelty . Such " beauty " and grace are truly " vain . " No single quality is so essential in society as a willingness to be pleased . " There is one art , " says a late writer , " which those whose object it is to charm , would do well to cultivate , the art of being charmed . For it rescues many an hour from listlessness and discontent , by freshening all the springs of life and action , awakening in old age the energy of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still the power to please , and that even for them the world has happiness in store . " Opposed to this stands caprice , a morbid desire of attention , a self-consequence , which would draw all eyes and all thoughts to its own important person . This spirit is full of coldness , jealousy , and every unamiable sentiment . Let the young woman forget herself , and study the feelings of others . She will then notice the modest , encourage the diffident , and strive to call forth concealed talent and virtue . She will scrupulously avoid all allusions , that would give pain to the hearer . His ill-fortune , the trade he pursues , if unpopular , or his low extraction , or the faults of his connections , and his own misdemeanors , will be carefully kept out of view . Thus will the inward man be perpetually overflowing with Christian courtesy . Good Sense is another requisite of female civility . " The excitable imagination and ardent feelings of woman , " says a female writer , " expose her to exaggeration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disgust many others , in society . They talk for the sound 's sake , giving flippant utterance to the commonplaces of the day . But did God endow this sex with speech , to be exercised only on folly and nonsense ? No , we have seen too many living examples to the contrary , of women " alike from careless levity remote , And a behavior schooled by selfish rules , Alike removed from rashness and from fear . " Is not this better than the indulgence in perpetual trifling and tattle ? How long shall it be charged on this sex that they often yield , without an attempt at self-control , to their supposed natural volatility ? If man be constitutionally grave , and life be with him all a serious affair , then should woman supply this want by careful self-culture . I would not frown on the innocent gratifications of the tongue ; but I would entreat this sex , instead of seeking their pleasure in discussing the concerns of their neighbors , to pause , consider , and resolve that they will set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secrets of a family , because accidentally made acquainted with them , or privileged with their intimacy . Disdain , as unworthy your nature and your sex , the practice of prying into the domestic affairs of others . Cultivate a taste for reading , and talk of books and principles , not persons . And never forget that " for every idle word you must give account " hereafter . Be so filled with good sense and knowledge , that of you it may be said , mark " that fund of truth and sense , Which though her modesty would shroud , Breaks like the sun behind the cloud . " Good Taste is needful in society . There are those , who so appear , as " thoughtless of gracefulness , to be yet grace itself . " This is the native endowment of some ; but all may approximate toward it . Propriety is a rich ornament of female speech . Modesty is a cardinal point in good taste . But let it be sincere . In the early ages of Rome , the women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were worn by certain of the beautiful , but disreputable of that sex , partially to shade the face , and thus add to their unholy fascinations . Beware of a tincture of this spirit . Let your deportment be always so pure and self-respectful , that " guilt shall seem a thing impossible in you . " Consummate the marriage intended , under Providence , between Taste and Virtue . The last topic I name in this connection is Moral Courage . There is a tyranny of circumstances which you may sometimes fail of successfully resisting . But never may you desist from the attempt to do this . Strive to maintain , mildly , yet firmly , every particle of the ground of right and duty . Perhaps no one source of temptation will so try your moral energies , in this respect , as that of amusements and recreations . God intended that you should sometimes rest from toil , and find relaxations to repair your exhausted spirits . Pursued for this purpose , they will ever prove more than innocent ; they will be useful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For , perilous as are theatrical entertainments , and protracted dances , there is , sometimes , greater guilt in the scandal of those who condemn , than in the character of those who pursue , them . But why desire these exciting indulgences ? Why risk health and morals , for the sake of a few hours ' pleasure ? Excitement do you seek ? Where is there more of this , so far as it is rational and safe , than in leaving your studies for an hour 's domestic avocations ; for a walk amid the enchanting beauties of nature ; or for a cheerful interview with a tried friend ? In the very change of employments , there is a fund of recreation . To train a few flowers for the hand of the sick , or prepare a dish of fruit for a neighbor , is a blessed amusement . Of such enjoyments you would never be constrained to ask , " May I safely partake in them ? " They are sweet at the moment , and hallowed by the ever-fresh joys of memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy purpose of passing its fiery ordeal unharmed . Let not fashion enslave and consume your soul . If society would degrade your nature , say to it , " Get thee behind me , Satan . " So will it exalt , and purify , and save , instead of overwhelming , you in perdition . Avow before all persons , your attachment to principle , to your Savior , and your God . Fix your eye , not on this vanishing scene , but on that land , where lies " the pearl of great price . " Submit not for a day to the dominion of an outward adorning . Let the jewels you wear , be fastened on " the hidden man of the heart . " Be ornamented with incorruptible robes . Secure , most of all , not the renown of earthly admiration , but that honor , which , when the world and its charms shall be dissolved and melt like the morning vapor , will crown you with laurels that fade not away . Chapter VI . LOVE . Delicacy of the topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burns ' lament . As an Illusion . An Impulse . A Weakness . A Disease . Romantic views of Love . A Fatalism . " Matches made in Heaven . " Some say , " Love can be Suppressed . " Associated with Lower Propensities . A theme for Jesting and Sport . Quotation , shewing its holy nature . The mind not to dwell constantly upon it . In approaching the topic named at the head of this chapter , I am by no means insensible of its difficulties and its delicacy . But no one can contemplate its bearings on the happiness of woman , without feeling that a work , treating of her duties and prospects , in which this subject is studiously avoided , must be regarded as essentially defective . It is the remark , I think , of Madam de Stael , that " love , which is but an episode in the life of man , is the whole history of woman . " Without subscribing to this opinion in full , we must still contend that the destiny of her affections is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but reflect much upon it ; and since her views may affect so deeply her ultimate decision in reference to a matrimonial connection , is he a true friend who fails to give her all the light , and counsel , and guidance in his power , on this point ? It is well known that not a few among the insane of this sex have been made so by their erroneous ideas relative to the exercise of the affections . I may be pardoned for adverting , in this place , to some of the many and various views entertained in regard to the sentiment of love . One considers it a Mystery , something with which the understanding has no concern , and which is never to be reasoned upon , although we may exercise that prerogative on all other subjects . Hence , according to the Roman mythology , Amor , the God of love , is represented as blind-folded . His arrows inflict wounds , it is said , of which the sight can take no cognizance . The language of the poet records the bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Had we never loved so kindly , Had we never loved so blindly , Never met or never parted , We had ne'er been broken-hearted . " The opinion under consideration is egregiously erroneous . Woe to her who abandons the helm of judgment , in forming that connection , which is to decide her whole fortune for life . Ill-fated must she be , who concludes that the head and heart must be divorced , before she can experience that sentiment , which binds human souls in the sacred tie of marriage . Another believes love to be an Illusion . She thinks it a subject fit only for the fevered imagination of the poet , or for tales of fiction and romance . With the realities of life it has no concern . In this plain , matter-of-fact , working-day world , there is no room , she thinks , for this creature of the brain . Therefore does she determine to fortify herself against its approaches . Others may pursue the phantom , if they will , but she is resolved to be never so cheated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . The enthusiast may subject herself to severe disappointments , and may find ultimately that the husband she loved and married , under the sway of the blind god , falls far short of that mysteriously exalted being she deemed herself connected with for life . But far more to be deplored is her fate , who entered the matrimonial state with the Stoical faith that love was all an " illusion . " What sympathy can those , thus joined , but not wedded , feel in the season of sorrow ? How little will they share , or even imagine , those joys which spring up between hearts that have been pledged , exchanged , and cemented . There are those , who regard love as of necessity a mere Impulse ; a thing not subject in any wise to human control , but fitful , an outbreaker , a tyrant . They can govern other emotions and sentiments . Anger , envy , jealousy , resentment , pride , they believe capable of being moderated , if not wholly suppressed . But love is lawless . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be opposed , no , not even questioned . Who has not seen some young woman of talent and virtue sacrifice herself to this mistaken impression ? The plume of the soldier , the gay air of the debauchee , the flippant beau , the half-insane tippler , could she not have seen her doom in being affianced to one of these poor pageants of humanity ? Ah , but " she loved ; she could not help loving ; " she gave herself a victim at the profane shrine , because she always thought she must love where and whom , her unbidden , irresponsible , feelings should direct her to love . There are others , who deem this sentiment a Weakness . If a lady find herself inclined to it , she should at once strive to subdue it . Much as one , whose face is marked by disease or accident , would fain conceal the blemish , so would she hide , even from a mother or sister , any experience of affection for a particular individual . Love is , in her view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , if one have not power wholly to escape , she should yet lock with eternal secrecy in her own bosom . Now I ask , why should we blush for emotions , of which the God of nature implanted the germs within us ? Is it weak to indulge a sentiment so productive of happiness as this , so essential to the wellbeing of the holiest bond on earth ? Love is not a folly ; in its purity , it is a noble , unselfish thing , the inspirer and friend of moral excellence . When I see a young woman pining over a hidden grief , which might have been spared , had she imparted her feelings to a friend ; when I witness the mental powers tried , and at length overcome , by the struggles of a pent-up fire in the soul , I lament the sad error , to which these mournful consequences can be so directly traced . Why , if the object , especially , of her affection deserve and requite it , why should she bury it as a weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which there is no one to whom a secret of this description may with propriety , and ought , to be frankly confided . The peril lies in concealment . Some esteem love a Disease . They look upon her , who indulges it , as in an unsound condition . It is as if a member of the body were amputated , or maimed . The individual , on whom its visitations have been inflicted , is an object of compassion . Hence its approaches are actually dreaded . She who entertains this theory , instead of receiving cordially the advances of a gentleman , even a favorite , shrinks from the thought of it , and repels the intimations of any special attention on his part . Is this well ? Is it right so to deal with a sentiment common to the sex ? Were it a disease , we should form exceptions to the rule . But since it is so almost universally experienced , why should one avert it from the heart ? She who does this , misinterprets the human constitution . Let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she refuse the admission of this sentiment , when circumstances justify its encouragement , than she will decline taking food , lest it cause sickness and death . The laws of nature , she will see , extend over the spirit , no less than the body . There are not a few who cherish Romantic ideas concerning the affections . They regard " marriage , " in the words of another , " as an occasion to be preceded by fears , and hopes , and love 's stratagems , by love-letters , passionate vows , sudden crosses , and intense joys . " It is to transform the individual subject to its power , to fill her with sensations , which she can not now even imagine . With this transcendental view of that passion , a young woman is likely to conclude that , for herself , she shall never see the person whom she can love . No angelic being , in human form , will ever cross her path , and therefore she shall always remain single . Anon she dreams of going into a nunnery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we can not too early set about correcting these false imaginings and vain expectations . Poets may sing of love as convulsing the frame , and rending the heart , and transmuting a human sentiment into divine extasies . But in the sober experience of life , such rapturous emotions are exceedingly rare . Indeed all the deep feelings of our nature are tranquil . It is the shallow stream only , which dashes , and sparkles , and deafens us by its noise . If you ever know the power of genuine love , you will find it as calm as it is intense . It will be in harmony with your other pure sentiments . Never will it subjugate , and tyrannize over , and do violence to , your whole nature . We have seen those ,  --  and we suspect they belong to a numerous class ,  --  who conceive that true love is attended by a Fatalism . It is first assumed , that every one must love some individual of the opposite sex . A necessity is laid on us all , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question may not so much as be raised , " Is it certain that I shall ever meet with one to whom I can give my heart ? " No , woman was made to love and to be married , that is her unalterable destiny . All that is to occupy her thoughts in this respect , is , " Who shall the individual be , on whom I must place my affections ? " This opinion is surely erroneous . For Providence has so arranged the circumstances of human life and of society , that some females are absolutely precluded from forming the matrimonial connection . Ill-health ,  --  to name no other cause ,  --  sometimes positively debars one from this relation . There are abundant reasons , indeed , for which every one , ordinarily situated , should contemplate marriage . It is the design of our physical and moral constitution , and the spring of unsullied enjoyments , social and spiritual ; and no one should voluntarily exclude herself from this bond , save for imperious considerations . Yet let no young woman predetermine that hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inquiry should at least arise in her mind , " May I not be of those , whose usefulness and happiness do not absolutely require their entering the marriage state ? " But our friend thinks there is a fatalism not only in regard to her marriage , but in reference to the particular companion , with whom she must be associated for life . " Matches are made , " say some , " in Heaven . " Prudence has no concern with this matter . A young woman fixes her affections on some individual , and believes that it is decreed she should love and should marry him . If circumstances appear unpropitious to their intimacy , she is perfectly wretched . And this , not simply because she loves him so ardently , but because she believes a decree of Heaven will be violated , if their union fail of consummation . " Our presentiments , " it is said " often work their own fulfilment . " I can not doubt , that , in the formation of the marriage bond , at least , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What an idea is this , if one will steadily contemplate it . That the heart is not subject , in the slightest degree , to our dominion ? That we must love , and love , too , one whom perhaps accident alone threw in our way ! Are you , indeed , obliged by a physical or moral necessity , to marry this person , because he is an inmate of your father 's household , or because you were both born in the same village , or because he has something in his countenance that tells you ,  --  before a word has been exchanged between you ,  --  that he must be your lover , and your husband ? The picture needs but be presented one moment before a calm , dispassionate eye , to force on us the conviction that , if in any human transaction we are free to accept , and free to reject the offers of another , we are clearly so in this . There are those who , passing to the opposite extreme , entertain the opinion that love is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of being entirely suppressed . They deem it altogether optional with themselves , whether they shall know anything of the affection between the sexes , or not . Did this notion extend only to the relative power of the sexes , or the direction we may give to our hearts , it would be less objectionable . For doubtless love , though more essential to woman than to man , can be more easily controlled by her than by him . A person of a strong will may bring herself , for prudential considerations , to prefer in marriage one who will be " a good match " with her , as the phrase is , to another whom she sincerely loves . And she may succeed in subduing , to no ordinary degree , her affection for the rejected one . But to eradicate from the heart the powerful principle of love is not given , I believe , to woman . She may substitute another object for that which ought to have engaged this class of her affections . A mother , or sister , or a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have known a mere animal to be caressed and apparently loved , as it could not have been , had the affections been properly bestowed on a human being . We can regulate and direct , but we can not destroy , in the heart , the sentiment of love . Some , again , associate with the thought of love the idea of our Lower Propensities . They regard it as an animal passion , and as debasing to the character . With false notions of delicacy , they determine to shun its snares , and hence strive to banish the impure thing from their minds , and to steel themselves against its access . How unworthy of our nature , and of the Being who formed us , is this view . To those who entertain it , we must say , " what God hath cleansed , that call not thou common , or unclean . " Far , indeed , are they , to whom we allude , from the elevated and true idea of that sacred tie , which joins the pure in heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitudes , who have proved marriage to be " honorable , " and to whom love has been the chief refiner of their souls . That it may be perverted , we can not , of course , deny . But that its legitimate tendency , is any other than to exalt , ennoble , and sanctify the spirit , we do not believe . So thorough is our persuasion of this , that we would commend the marriage relation to a seeker of moral excellence . We would say , that , in the hallowed sympathies of love are incitements to purity and piety . To her who earnestly desires to become spiritual , we would present the association in marriage with one spiritually minded , as , above all adventitious means , friendly to her holy purpose . To how many is love a theme for Jesting and Sport . The ancients represented Cupid under the aspect of a boy engaged in amusement . He appears driving a hoop , throwing a quoit , playing with a nymph , catching a butterfly , or flying with a bright torch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that love is a subject for sport . Let heathenism , if it must , so regard it ; but the Christian ought never to trifle with this sacred interest . The rite of marriage is a solemn thing . Who would jeer , and jest , as she stood before the altar , and pledged fidelity unto death to her betrothed partner ? And why , I would ask , should the preliminaries of marriage be treated as a theme fit only for levity and merriment ? It is said that we Americans are peculiar for banter on this subject . One scarcely hears it alluded to in society , except with a laugh , or a jest . As a natural consequence of this state of feeling , and this style of conversation relative to the affections , it is not easy to know when one speaks as he means on this topic . Not " seriously , "  --  for the matter is all sport ,  --  not in " sober earnest " may you take what is said , since soberness is supposed to be wholly irrelevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of this practice on the feelings and deportment of the parties most nearly concerned , even during their engagement ,  --  if this take place amid the bandying of jests ,  --  is often unhappy . The same levity pervades their conversation and manners toward one another ; and there is scarcely one sober sentiment , or calm thought , associated with their interviews . So also has this habit a blighting influence upon the views with which the individuals are at length joined in marriage . What was commenced in gaiety and sport , and has been continued in the same spirit , is consummated in thoughtlessness . It is only when these scenes of mutual delusion and folly are over , and the two beings are united by an inseparable bond , and begin to feel the pressure of real duty and actual life , that they look on each other as rational creatures ought . The words , sacred , and principle , the thought of responsibility to God , ideas of solemnity , are now for the first time associated with marriage . Can this condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and happiness , of the parties involved in its effects ? " O there is nothing holier , in this life of ours , than the first consciousness of love ,  --  the first rising sound and breath of that wind , which is so soon to sweep through the soul , to purify , or to destroy ! " So let every young maiden deem of this sentiment . None will then banter words with her upon her sacred affections ; for there will be that in her air and language , when this topic is referred to , which shall convince every one that she holds it a consecrated theme . In summing up my general remarks on the view to be taken of love , I would say , talk little with your companions about it ; and resolve , if the topic can only be introduced by a jest , that you will preserve upon it a profound silence . This would at first make you appear singular . But such a course would soon commend itself to every considerate friend and acquaintance in your circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teazing you in regard to it , you would be sustained by the consciousness of exerting all your influence for the elevation of society in their views , and conversation , on the most holy of human connections . Nor should the mind be permitted to dwell constantly upon this subject . Some are perpetually imagining themselves in love ; others are dreaming over the philosophy of the affections , and wasting precious hours upon that which adds nothing to their happiness , and does little to prepare them for married life . Let the mind be kept tranquil on this subject ; the heart will then be preserved in its soundness . No good affection will die or decay , but , in the time and method ordained by Providence , advances will be made , and the heart addressed , and the hand solicited for marriage . Let the young maiden bide the passing months in cheerfulness , and prepare herself for a Christian life . A character thus matured will give hope of the happiest results in new relations , and amid all the coming and unknown scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wrong idea . Some designed for Single Life . The " Old Maid 's " reproach . Addison . Two errors , Reserve , and Forwardness . Virtues of Single women . Humanity . Modesty . Economy . Neatness . Usefulness . Hannah More . Miss Sedgwick . Miss Porter 's " Aunt Rebecca . " Avoid affectation . Advice of Mrs. Hall . Two essentials , Mental Cultivation , and Industry . Marriage is not seldom regarded as " our being 's end and aim ; " hence a young woman is often filled with a feverish anxiety to form this connection , or at least to enter on its preliminaries , at an early period of her life . We believe there are thousands , who never so much as ask themselves the question , " Is it certain that I must be married , or be miserable ? " No , they assume that in one condition only can they be happy , and in that , therefore , let what may betide them , they must centre their every hope of coming peace . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are its consequences , that it should be removed from the mind of every girl who entertains it . God has not left woman but one alternative in this respect . Marriage is the general lot of her sex . It is productive of joys and blessings peculiar to itself . But not always , not of necessity . There may be , and there doubtless often is , great suffering in this connection . No small share of this might be ultimately traced to the fact that so many form this tie under the belief that they must be married ; that all which concerns them is to ascertain who the individual is , in whose hands they must place their whole earthly destiny . But although Providence did intend woman , in all ordinary cases , to enter the marriage state , yet precisely as much did He design some of this sex to remain single . He made all for the sake of character , usefulness , and happiness . Every institution he appointed was to be instrumental to the production of these three grand objects . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . If in any instance it shall appear that her improvement will probably be retarded by her entering that state , or her usefulness less extensive , or her happiness evidently sacrificed , then is it manifest that she belongs to the class of exceptions . It is her duty to continue unmarried . So that it is not simply a choice among many suitors , with the necessity of selecting or accepting some one of them , that is given her , but the whole subject is to be seriously pondered . If , after doing this , she is convinced that no individual has offered her particular attentions , whose character promises to enhance her virtue , usefulness , or happiness , then should she calmly resolve ,  --  let the decision be painful , as it may , and perhaps must be ,  --  that she will remain , under present prospects , through life , as she is . But the reproach of being an " old maid , " how can she endure this ? I answer , let her not , in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain charges are preferred against " old maids , " as this class are ignominiously termed , which do much to strengthen the impression just spoken of . They are said to possess an inordinate curiosity . Addison , like many others , alleges that old maids are given to credulity , and pours on them , for this reason , contempt and raillery . They are accused of disgusting affectation , of pretending to youth , to censorial importance , and to an exquisite sensibility . Finally , it is said , that they are notorious for envy , and ill-nature , being match-breakers , because themselves unmarried . Let these charges be destitute as they may of foundation , they doubtless impel many females to the determination that they must and will escape this terrific condition . But there is no portion of the community , whose opinion we should value , that will esteem a female the less for being in that condition where Providence has clearly placed her . It is not true that single ladies are usually despised , or subject to ridicule . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves by a deportment , which might have been shunned . Some have been derided for their excessive Reservedness of manner , for never permitting one of the opposite sex to address them , even indirectly , or scarcely to exchange a word with them . What else can the prude anticipate , or reasonably require , than that she be an object of reproach , if not of ridicule , for obstinately adhering to a manner that must result in her perpetual singleness of life ? If she debar all access to herself , except from her own sex , misinterpret every word and all intimations of , and thus insulate herself from , any special acquaintance with any gentleman , let her bear the consequences without a syllable of discontent . A morbid sensitiveness , in reference to all such company , must , in most cases , seal one 's doom . Perhaps a young maiden takes the opposite extreme . In her anxiety to fulfil what she deems her only possible destiny , she becomes Forward and assuming . She regards it as necessary to force attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be won , must be wooed . " Her aims are obtrusive ; instead of waiting for the approach of another , she makes constant advances toward him . This fault is still more repulsive to most gentlemen than the other . They esteem it an indication of great vanity on the part of a young woman , and expressive of no very high sense of their own powers of discernment , or of their delicacy of feeling . Such persons must expect little favor at the hands of the other sex , should all their endeavors be frustrated . " She might have been married , " is their uniform language , " had she not exhibited such boldness , and such determination to carry one 's heart by storm . " Nor will her own sex be sparing in their reproaches of one left in a single state , after so many , and such ineffectual , efforts to change it . The modest lady pities , and blushes for , a sister thus regardless of proprieties . Her companions , successful by their very neglect to toil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some pungency , the epithet of " old maid . " Ought she to repine at the fruit of her own indiscretion and folly ? Far different is the estimate usually formed of her who , by unforeseen and inevitable circumstances , or by a wise preference , continues single . Such can not fail of being generally respected in society . That they are thus situated is perceived to be no fault of theirs , but , at most , a misfortune . In a multitude of these instances a young woman shall be the more respected for remaining unmarried . It argues a moral independence , a regard not only for her immediate happiness , but for her personal character , which can not fail to excite , in all candid and generous minds , a true admiration . There are several traits characteristic , in some degree , of what is termed an " old maid , " that are in reality to be ranked among the higher Virtues . Such persons are usually marked by their Humanity . Not being exclusively devoted to one individual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest everywhere around them . She who retains her cheerfulness in this state , is often an invaluable friend among the sick , and the suffering poor . She has leisure to follow out her kind impulses . They are not contracted to a single sphere , but wherever she can go and do good , thither her steps hasten . Even the inferior creation share her attentions . There is many an eye , not radiant with reason , nor accompanied by the powers of speech , that is yet eloquent in praise of her kindness . Single women are usually adorned with Modesty . Some may court publicity , and pant for the forum , or the pulpit , but they are the few . Most ladies of this class are graced by a retiring manner , and quiet habits , and a gentle address . These traits we all prize in woman . Even in their excess , though they have virtually caused an individual to be single , they still have attendant advantages . They are certainly an ornament to the character , giving new lustre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Economy is another characteristic of a single woman . It may degenerate to a fault , it is true ; but in most of those in this condition it is so restricted , as to be a theme not for censure , but approbation . In a country like ours , where , if fortunes are often made , they are also not seldom lost , in a day , this virtue is of prime concern . And everywhere it is an incumbent duty of the Christian to " gather up the fragments , that nothing be lost . " She who does this may be a most valuable auxiliary in the family she resides with . Suppose one partly dependent , for her subsistence , on her manual exertions , or an inmate in the house of a relative or friend , she may do great good by an habitual watchfulness that nothing be wasted . Servants are proverbially lavish and careless in this matter . The head of the family may be deficient in economy , or what is by no means uncommon , so engrossed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after the savings , which might daily be made . But here is an individual , whose habits prompt her to the service , and who has leisure to make herself useful in this manner . Unmarried ladies are usually distinguished for their Neatness . We often hear it said of another , " She is so afraid of a speck of dirt , that she will certainly be an old maid . " If this be the chief index of that character , it is one which the married lady would do well to imitate , rather than deride . The personal habits can be excusably neglected by no one . If those , charged with the care of families , are so absorbed in their employments , as to pay little attention to neatness in dress , their condition is deplorable . She who has less to interfere with this all-important quality , and who , therefore , gives much time to cleanliness , order , and neatness , is to be envied , not censured . Should she hereafter be placed in the situation of a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which contributed to this most valuable trait in her character . Single women are sometimes more Useful than they would have been , if married . Such cases are probably rare ; yet the capacity of doing as much good in that state as another , should reconcile one to what might , otherwise , appear an evil . Who can estimate the amount of virtue and piety , that might be traced to the writings of Hannah More ? Had she been married , the world might have lost the whole of these sixty years ' toil in the cause of humanity . How large is our debt to the accomplished authoress of " Home , " and of those manifold publications of the same character , that enlighten , and bless , the youth of our age . Nor is it in literary walks alone that this class have proved signal benefactors of their species . In the domestic sphere , amid scenes of sickness and affliction , how often have they proved ministering angels . Miss Porter , I think it is , has a character in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebecca , " who was full of kind offices among the families in her neighborhood , taking care of the sick , supplying the place of absent mothers , and aiding relatives and friends with promptness , in their times of trouble and grief . The reader is sometimes tempted to smile at the abuses of her good nature by the selfish and indolent ; yet the character suggests to us the noble field of usefulness allotted to many , who are often supposed to lead a course of life contrary to nature . Having so many virtues incident to her condition , and enjoying such opportunities to do an amount of good , and of course to secure a degree of happiness , denied to those in married life , why should an individual repine at this lot ? Single women , it is well known , are sometimes envious , querulous , discontented , and restless . " Who can shew us any good in our state ? " ask some . " Providence made us , like the rest of our sex , for love , yet we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be loved . " In the agony of despair such array themselves , perhaps to old age , in attractive dresses and a profusion of jewelry , and affect the air of young ladies . But these views and practices are founded in error . Reflect upon the case , and you will see , that it is no more a law of God that your sex in general should love and be loved , and should marry , than it is that some of their number should remain single . She , who thus considers , is prepared to inquire whether she herself may not possibly belong to that class , and to be content in that condition , should circumstances seem to ordain her for it . The advice of an English lady on this point seems peculiarly pertinent . " Let women , " says she , " of a certain age beware of the affectation of youth , if they would avoid the shipwreck of their respectability and character . As the loveliness of girlhood fades from their cheeks , and the liquid brilliancy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves charms which neither the rust nor moth of time can corrupt ; let the warmth of goodness yield its gentle tinting to their cheek , and let tears of tenderness , of mercy , of loving-kindness , make their eyes moist with those beauties which will not be destroyed , but perfected hereafter . We must all fade , but it is in our power to exchange our charms . Keeping far from us envyings , strife , jealousy , evil-speaking , let us , as our days increase , improve in wisdom and good deeds ; caring for the young , comforting the old , and rendering our home the throne of domestic happiness . " There are two things requisite , I believe , however , to the enjoyment of its best effects , in a single state . The lady , who proposes to herself this destination , should cultivate her Mind . A good education prepares one for any fortune , or condition of life . She , who has stores of knowledge and a well-balanced intellect , will find herself possessed of unfailing resources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those whose thoughts feed on vacuity , and who , through the want of mental culture , dwell incessantly on degrading subjects , that suffer in the single state . The other preparation I referred to , is Occupation , habits of industry . An intelligent person may be indolent , and if so , the mental cultivation she has enjoyed may only serve to expose her feelings to more acute pain , from her solitary state . But she who is diligent in domestic economy , in the use of her needle , in the daily reading of valuable works , and especially in doing good , as she has opportunity , to others , can hardly be miserable , because unmarried . She will make friends , wherever she may reside , and find hearts rejoicing to reciprocate her affection . Chapter VIII . REASONS FOR MARRIAGE . The Fear of being Single .

To attempt the enumeration of all the inducements which may lead a young woman to marry , were perhaps a hopeless task . So complex are our motives that it is difficult to analyze them correctly , or even to say with confidence what was the sole motive operating on the mind in any particular action . This difficulty is increased , where the affections are concerned . They are too subtle and ethereal in their nature , to be subjected to minute examination . I shall , therefore , only promise in this chapter to endeavor , as I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for marriage , as they affect most persons in actual life . At the head of these stands the fear of being Single . There is supposed to be some latent and terrific evil in remaining unmarried . The imagination of the girl depicts its loneliness , its desolation , the blight it must shed on every gentle and happy emotion , the reproach it must bring on her from her entire circle of acquaintances , and the pride with which her more successful companions will look down upon her . These and other features in the picture become so fearful to contemplate , that she resolves to embrace the first opportunity to escape so awful a dilemma . She will engage herself as soon as practicable , lest she should outstand her day , and be left in the dread condition of an " old maid . " Hence a train of miseries . To prevent this calamity ,  --  for it often proves a serious one ,  --  I would recommend the culture of two virtues , Faith , and Moral Courage . There is no cause for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she shall be left single . How very few are they , who deserve the attentions of the other sex , and yet never receive any overtures for marriage . Where the means of support are so equally distributed , and where girls are so well trained , as they are usually in this country , nearly every young man is married , and of course finds somewhere a companion . Have then Faith that you will not be neglected . This will do much to inspire that modest conduct , which attracts so powerfully the opposite sex . It will also lead you to a course of steady preparation , in all respects , for marriage , and thus both insure your entrance on that state , and qualify you for its duties . Cultivate Moral Courage . It is better to wait this year and next , and many years , rather than , for the sake of appeasing the popular cry , to throw yourself away on a dolt , or a villain . What consolation can it be , when bound to such a companion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odious name of an " old maid ? " Better ten lives of singleness , than a few years of that wretchedness so often occasioned by marrying simply and solely for fear of being single . Others marry to gratify their Friends . This world abounds in match-makers . They are , too , of all descriptions ; some true friends to the parties concerned in their management , perhaps their parents ; others entirely indifferent in this respect ; others mere busy bodies , burning for the excitement of love affairs , for new offers , engagements , and weddings . As regards the agency of friends in these matters , I believe little good ever comes of their plans and efforts . Where they succeed , there are fearful chances that the individuals , intended to be benefitted , will have cause to rue the consequences . It is far better to let nature direct , or rather to leave Providence his own modes of operation , instead of attempting to force , or urge , what should be left entirely to the feelings , judgment , and taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who spend their days in instigating others to love , I can only say , they will have a dark account to render in the end . There is no more despicable character than a finished " manoeuverer . " It implies a meanness , that can pry into the corners of others ' affairs , an indolence , that neglects one 's own proper business , and a mental vacuity , and a littleness of purpose , which are the dread of every noble mind . Beware of the impertinence of such persons . Be very sure that you give not your hand and heart where they point , instead of following , as you ought , your own good sense , and the promptings of affection . There are those of an opposite description , who marry to gratify Self-will , and to shew their independence of advisers . This is the more dangerous error of the two . The law of the Laplanders on this subject is not without some reason , severe though it certainly is ; it is there death to marry a girl without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this occurs are rare ; yet there are those who , through pride and perversity , choose to be miserable in their own way rather than happy in one proposed , or sanctioned even , by others . Young women are sometimes disinterested in the indulgence of a passion , for they do it to their own injury , and to the sorrow of their relatives . Because advised to marry a particular gentleman , they set themselves in array against him . Or , blind to those faults , which every one else discovers , and warns them against , they commit their destiny to the actually abandoned . I knew one of this class , who , in spite of all remonstrance , married an intemperate man , and who went even so far as to say , after his death , which resulted from this vice , " that she never saw her husband intoxicated in his life . " Some marry to remove from an Unpleasant Home . They are obliged , perhaps , to work hard for a small compensation , or for none . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morose . The daughter receives frequent hints about her support , or , of her marriage being necessary to make her " respectable " among her companions ; or , the parents talk of their own early engagement , &c.; This conversation awakens a strong desire to escape dependence upon them . Other circumstances serve to alienate a female from the place of her birth , her town , or village , and she is induced to sacrifice herself to any one who proffers his hand . But is it not " Better to bear the ills we have , Than flee to those we know not of ? " By an ill-assorted match , a lady is placed in a situation , where , let her have suffered as she might previously , her condition is nearly certain to be made worse by the change . Under the parental roof , she enjoyed much liberty ; but now she is chained to one spot , and must receive to her bosom , a being , who inflicts pangs on her spirit . The die is cast ; she is enslaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many are married to obtain a Home . They desire an establishment ; the prospect of having no dwelling , which they can call " their own , " fills them with restless apprehensions . They crave some special protector , in whom they may merge , as it were , their own being , and be thereby released from personal responsibilities ; one on whom they may lean for the gratification of every wish and want . Like the emigrant who leaves the tough soil of New England , for the glorious West , they imagine that their exchange is to release them from toil , and crown them , at the same moment , with plenty . Such expectations are delusive . Woman was not created for this absolute and unlimited ease . Neither single , nor married , can she subsist with comfort to herself , except by being largely endowed with self-dependence . As a wife , she will not be caressed and cherished in one cloudless day , even though her husband prove the kindest of his sex . She must do and suffer much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be as flax amid flames . If she enter the marriage state with any other design than to devote herself to her family , to toil more , instead of less , than she now does , either by mental or manual exertions , or by both , let her be assured of a fearful disappointment . She may promise herself , in a pure connection , great joy , much to compensate her sacrifices , but a life of ease and entire freedom from care , let her never anticipate . There are ladies compelled , I am aware , to seek a home by matrimony , through the influence of their parents . This may be exerted , as in Mexico , indirectly , through solicitors and by management , or , like the French , the parents may negotiate the marriage in person , if not in form , yet by such methods , as to leave the daughter no alternative , but to accept such shelter abroad as any suitor may propose to her . Rise , I entreat you , above this servitude . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitation for yourself . Prepare so completely to earn your own livelihood , that no one , friend or foe , dare say of you , " she is obliged by her helplessness to marry some one . " There are honorable avocations , and not a few either , in which every young woman can support herself . Let all be acquainted with some of them , with one at least . Then may they listen to overtures of marriage , with the feeling , that , as for a home , that , they have already secured by the skill of their own mind and hands . Young ladies sometimes marry for Wealth . They have been educated to regard this as the criterion of excellence . A man 's " worth " is reckoned , not in moral attainments , but in dollars and cents . He , therefore , who is poor , is set down as beneath much consideration . From her earliest days , the girl has , perhaps , heard her parents talk of " being well-settled , " of " a good establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sine qua non of married life . In Tartary , a young man must purchase his bride , and if too poor to give money , he must serve her father four or five years . If a richer rival presents himself before the term of service expires , the first suitor is dismissed ; he can claim only wages for his work . How many parents in this civilized and Christian land , thus sell their daughters . Give the transaction whatever smooth name you please , it is , after all , a bargain and sale . Legislators , it appears , sometimes openly and directly encourage this traffic . The Congress of Texas recently offered a premium of nearly three thousand acres of land to every woman who would marry a citizen of Texas , who was one at the declaration of Independence . Let me warn my female friends against this influence . Marry for riches alone , and you will be a neglected , unhappy wife , as sure as gold is not kindness . How many of your sex have sold their honor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . Beware of that path , which leads in this fearful direction . Marry only a good man . Heed the advice of Themistocles to that Athenian , who consulted him in relation to the marriage of his daughter . She had two suitors , one a man of worth with a small fortune , the other rich , but in low repute . " I would bestow my daughter , " said he , " upon a man without money , rather than upon money without a man . " Never fear to form this connection with an individual of merit , though his circumstances be humble . Poverty indeed is often the nurse of rare virtues . It imparts energy , prudence , and industry , when rightly regarded . I like the reply of the Irish maid , when reminded of the extreme poverty of herself and her lover . " Sure , two people eat no more when they 're together , than they do when they 're separate . " And if this were not true , there are advantages in equality of condition which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth . God will bless those who act from principle and affection , as in all other relations , so in the formation of the marriage tie . Woman sometimes gives herself to Beauty of Person . She is led captive by a fair face and an elegant exterior . These cases are less frequent than those , in which men marry for beauty . Still , they do occur , and although outward graces are not to be contemned more than other gifts of Providence , yet she who bestows her hand for their sake alone is a victim to folly . Should such be free from impure passion , they still build their hopes on a foundation of straw . In the conflict of life , we need , in our nearest friend , inward charms . Where these are wanting , our lot is pitiable indeed . There are vain men , so weak , as to pride themselves on external attractions alone . But they are hollow-hearted . Woe to her , who commits her happiness to one of these shells of humanity . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being pure , is that which " dies With beauty , which is varying every hour ; While , in chaste hearts , uninfluenced by the power Of outward change , there blooms a deathless flower That breathes on earth the air of paradise . " Not a few marry from Fancy alone . They are attracted toward a gentleman by his manners and external appearance . They conceive a liking for another , because he has a pleasant voice , or an engaging smile , or is full of gaiety and wit . The influence of these qualities is felt by us all ; nor is it wrong to give them some weight , in forming our estimate of one as a companion . But what are they all , if disconnected from a praiseworthy character ? She who gives her heart , for this poor price , will sometime awake to a sense of her delusion . The imagination has an influence , perhaps an unavoidable one , on the affections . We invest a favorite with ideal charms , and put out of sight his faults . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady should abandon the exercise of her reason . Love , it is said , often so excites the fancy as to call forth effusions of poetry , where they were hitherto unknown . But woe to her , who cheats herself with the belief that the creature of her imagination is a real being , who will not listen to the counsels of understanding , but rushes blindly down the precipice , which , with one open eye , she might easily have foreseen . A recent writer , in giving advice to young ladies , speaks of " novels and tales , " and especially of the " best fictions of our day , as holding up to view the mistakes and faults , which young persons are most likely to commit on the subject of love and matrimony , in such a way as is likely to prevent their repetition . " With deference to one so intelligent in her remarks on other topics , I must differ from her on this . I believe that the reading of novels almost uniformly operates unfavorably on the female heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom read , except for the sake of the story . Let the author append a moral to his book , who thinks of stopping to read that ? But again , where is the novel , which is an exact transcript of real life ? There may be no one character in a work , that is not somewhat natural . Yet are the relations of each to all the others such as those in which we daily see people placed ? Are not the remarks of the speakers often forced and strained ? Do such loves occur in this working-day world ? Are not the incidents , and the plot in general , indebted largely to the writer 's imagination , for the effect they produce on the reader ? It is the reading of fiction and impure poetry , more than all things else , I fear , which leads so many females to sacrifice themselves to unprincipled and base-hearted men . Instead of consulting these works , as a guide in marriage , let every one take counsel of her sober judgment . When " the dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to captivate , we shall be left in a pitiable condition , if united to a being whom we could give no good reason for marrying . Fancy alone , much more a mere whim , is a fearful agent , with whom to entrust our entire happiness for life . There are those who accept the hand of another , because enticed by Flattery . The human heart is never more exposed to the poison of this insidious foe than in the affairs of love . A lady is beautiful , and she is praised to excess for her personal attractions . Her vanity is soothed , and her mind is so darkened , that she sees no bad motive whatever , and no blemish in the flatterer . " A woman , " says one well versed in our nature , " can always find a palliation for the misdeeds which are set in motion by her own beauty . " How often do we see the faults of the flatterer , in this way , actually converted into graces . Or a lady is but moderately well-favored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrust of herself . The assurance of her charms rushes like a tide over her spirit , and she surrenders herself a victim to blandishments . Or she may be even personally plain . The praise of some one good feature , will then suffice , perhaps , to subdue her affections . Is one more cultivated than her sex in general ? He , who offers incense to her intellect , may intoxicate and win . How often does this kind of adulation succeed , where the commendation of personal attractions would have failed . But let her , who is subjected to gross and excessive flattery , ask her own heart , " Do I respect this individual ? Has he my sober esteem ? Can I look on his character , and say it is such as to give promise of happiness to his bosom companion ? " These few questions would often dissolve the spell . If you marry one , such as I describe above , he may continue through the bridal month this delicious repast , but amid growing cares , when busy and anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hushed . It will be you , who must then speak sweet words . To you , will he turn for those kind attentions , which the habit of being caressed and complimented , and never forgetting yourself , will have miserably prepared you to bestow . It requires much watchfulness to shun the contagion of an earthly Passion , in forming the marriage tie . We should be perfectly certain that our impulses are all pure , that it is the moral and intellectual we prize in our friend . The spirit alone can profit us . An intemperate woman always shocks us beyond measure . She , who lives for the pleasures of the table , falls from the rank of her sex . All who would preserve their integrity , must guard against every gross and low tendency , and cultivate in their inmost soul a regard for character alone , and a desire of spiritual acquisitions , in their partner for life . Some are charmed by personal Bravery . It is often remarked , that the female sex admire military characters . Being constitutionally timid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them always an attractive quality . They lean upon it fondly , for protection in their own physical weakness . In the Island of Borneo , no man is allowed to solicit a damsel in marriage until he has cut off the head of an enemy . To how many , in Christian lands , is personal prowess a primary recommendation , in a candidate for marriage . Yet are not tenderness , fidelity , and constancy , quite as important in a husband , as physical courage ? She who gives herself for a plume or an epaulet , or for the bravery they are thought to indicate , will learn , in after days , that although the oak be admirable for its stoutness , there are gentler trees one would desire in the garden of domestic love . Many matches are made solely through the accidental Proximity of the parties . A young lady visits a friend often , and the brother , by being daily seen , engages her affections . Perhaps a gentleman boards in the family of her father . The simple circumstance of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others of his age , is the foundation of their marriage . There seems almost a fatality in these cases , they so often occur . Now I am far from recommending a female to put on an unnatural reserve toward those she sees thus frequently ; but let her recollect , that the mere fact of her interchanging so many thoughts and feelings with another , predisposes both to a more intimate connection . It is better , if the connection would be an improper one , to prevent such a consummation , by decided conduct in the outset , than by encouragements to induce an offer , you may feel compelled to accept . Are you much thrown by accident into the company of a particular gentleman ? Be sure that your deportment toward him be not such as to mislead him , in regard to your estimate of his character . Avoid every thing that shall seem to make it a matter of course that you will marry him . Study his traits , and look on him in all respects precisely as you would on any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are fated to marry a certain person , because you are so much in his society . A young woman is often induced to marry a man for the sake of his Family Connections . They are , perhaps , wealthy , and have a high standing in society , on that account . Or , they are respected for their name and rank , as descendants of worthy ancestors . The friends deem it " a good match ; " the alliance is desirable on many accounts . Who can think of rejecting overtures from so eligible a quarter ? All this is said and done with much the same feelings as the crowned heads of the Old World negociate intermarriages with one another , in cold blood , and as a business transaction . If the parties are of about equal standing , as regards their relatives , it is called on each side , " marrying into a good family , " and what more can be desired ? Or , the lady may be raised in the world by connecting herself with a family superior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this surely , it will be said , no one can object . Were it not folly to lose so fine an opportunity of entering a renowned circle of relations ? In Persia , the father first of all , selects a family , with whom he wishes to have his son connected . After this , he makes inquiries about the girl 's personal endowments . Is not something very like this often done in Christian lands ? The leading question , in these cases , is , " What are the connections ? " not , as it should be , the reverse of the practice in Persia , " Who and what is the individual particularly concerned ? " The character , the principles , the disposition and heart of him , to whom a lady consigns her whole destiny , are thus actually put out of view , for the sake of his family ! One may see , daily , alliances between individuals who come together evidently on account of their kindred alone ; and who , for any congruity of disposition , or fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobility , have been betrothed in their cradles . Many females marry for Personal Distinction . A gentleman is eminent in the political world , or as an author and scholar , or in military fame , or for skill and success in his calling ; or he shines in fashionable society . The origin of this practice may sometimes be found in early education . The parents are ambitious of elevating their daughter by marriage . They awaken in her hopes and expectations above her condition in life . They teach her , by their conversation and deportment , if not directly , that her " being 's end and aim " is to rise in the world . The cases are frequent , in which a girl is encouraged to receive the addresses of one , who is deficient in almost every quality requisite in a good husband , merely because he is " a great man . " A writer observes that " love is our first toy , our second , display . " But here this is completely reversed . Display is the first toy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You shall see a young woman led to barter herself to a man who is ignorant , proud , selfish , and unkind . " Let the person , " says one , " be blind , lame , deformed , diseased , severe , morose , vicious , old , or good for nothing , if the parents can but a little advance their daughter above the quality or condition themselves have lived in , the poor child must be made a living sacrifice , and probably know no more happy days after the solemnization of her nuptials . " We are told that in Naples , it is not uncommon for a nobleman of decayed fortune , to send his daughters to a nunnery , because his means will not enable him to educate them for marriage in the highest circles of society . The recent tragedy enacted in the city of Philadelphia , was a mournful illustration of the dangers of parental ambition . A father had toiled for years , to amass wealth for the purpose of introducing his daughter to society in England , and elevating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married contrary to his wishes , and in his fiend-like disappointment , wrought up to insanity , he actually murdered the victim of his rage , his own child . Why will parents thus attempt to coerce the chainless affections ? Why should so many females consent to marry the objects of their aversion , nay , sometimes , of their disgust , for the sake of a name ? Woman has been known to marry from the love of Conquest , and the desire to rule . The female heart is susceptible of the love of power , and one may seek , or consent to join herself to , a husband , for the sake of having a subject , over whom continually to reign . We are told that Madam Gamarra , the wife of the President of Peru , is a " female Bonaparte , and though her husband is nominally the head of the republic , she is the real sovereign . " How many smaller empires exhibit the same unnatural picture . It is in vain to say that the wife is the more capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from blame , who deliberately entered the marriage state with so little respect for her companion , as to cherish a determined purpose of lording it over him , as her inferior . Ambition of power is always a dangerous principle of conduct . She who consents to marry another , without love , esteem , or respect for him , and merely to queen it over his life , can hardly possess the Christian temper . She is assuredly destitute of that chief grace of her sex , deep and sincere affection . Mrs. Phelps says , on this subject , that " Submission and obedience belong to everything in the Universe , except the Great Master of the whole . It is a law , that support and protection demand obedience . Hence , the child is bound to yield this tribute to its parent , and the people to the laws , and the wife to the husband . " This doctrine , although advanced by a female , is likely to meet with some remonstrance at this day . Yet surely , none will contend that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contrary to the affirmation of Scripture , " the woman is the head of the man . " Let the maiden turn from such thoughts in her earliest days . " Now let a true ambition rise , And ardor fire her breast , To reign in worlds above the skies , In Heavenly glories drest . " Some ladies exchange their single condition , in the hope of escaping thereby the Toils and Cares of life . They picture to themselves the felicity of having one constantly devoted to the supply of their wants , and waiting to gratify their every wish . This looks all exceedingly captivating , in prospect . They expect from their friend not only the same attentions as he rendered during their engagement , but an increased service , from his being ever near them and having nothing but their happiness to occupy him . But can a lady anticipate these rivers of ease and pleasure , without securing the respect of her husband ? No one , who reflects for a moment on the future , can do this . Does our friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " No respect , "  --  and , of course , no love ,  --  " is lasting , but that which is produced by our being in some degree useful to those who pay it . " No age ever erected altars to gods destitute of good qualities . She , who would be worshipped in the heart of her bosom companion , can secure this homage only by deserving it through exertion . Married life must be one of care and toil . Let no female delude herself by imagining it to be otherwise . It brings , where hearts are wedded , as well as hands , joys and supports far more than sufficient to lighten its burdens . But burdens let none think to shun in it . Instances are not wanting , in which woman has given herself to a vicious companion , in the belief that she could reform him . The stage has often produced dramas , in which the hero , after a long course of conduct utterly inconsistent with matrimonial happiness , has at length been suddenly converted to the ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " a reformed rake makes the best husband . " But in real life , it will be found that instantaneous changes , occurring on the eve of marriage , are usually adopted for the sake of appearances , and endure only so long as policy requires . Dr. Dwight observes well on this point , that " nothing but folly can lead us to expect that this institution can change the whole nature of those who enter into it ; and like a magical spell , confer knowledge , virtue , and loveliness , upon beings who have neither . " She who marries a man , that is addicted to immoral practices , incurs fearful hazards . Not only does she risk her personal happiness , from his vicious conduct , but she exposes her own character . Who can tell that , instead of being reformed by her , the husband may not entice her into his own sins , or into those equally ruinous ? Will she calmly commit herself to the talons of the vulture , in the hope of taming his ferocity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no woman of ordinary prudence will try . The temptation I allude to is likely to be presented to many of this sex , especially in populous places , where the vices cluster . Had I a friend thus exposed , I would entreat her to beware of looking with the least partiality on a profligate , or an unprincipled man . " Let him be a very courtier , for his grace and agreeableness in conversation , " I would say to her , " be not you ensnared by his tongue . " By a strange paradox , the worst men sometimes fancy and select pious females for their wives . I do not deny that cases occur , in which the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife . But if gross sins be added to a want of religious faith , I contend that no woman is justified in forming this connection . Should she detect such traits and practices in her lover , on the eve of their marriage , she is bound to dismiss him . God will provide a lamb , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dearest affection . Some females have consented to bestow their hand , without a gift of the heart , upon one who importuned them by ceaseless addresses . They did not love , nor could they , where consent to marriage was yielded with such reluctance . Perhaps some considerable aversion to the union was expressed , but it was at length abandoned , as they thought , from necessity . " I am fated , " such an one will say , " to marry a person I can not love , and so it must be . " We have known many instances , in which it was paradoxically asserted , that the lady " married a certain gentleman to get rid of him . " The sentiment of compassion , has a large share in some of these cases . A suitor relates his troubles again and again ; his happiness will he forever blighted ; he shall even sicken and die , if rejected . Desdemona listens to the story : " ' T was pitiful , ' t was wondrous pitiful ; She wished she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitying , the steps are few to " embracing . " To relieve such sufferings , a lady resigns her every prospect of peace and comfort . How many , indeed , after once rejecting a suitor , are moved by his renewed entreaties , to sacrifice themselves , merely to assuage his flowing tears . They think it a duty , it may be , to forego every hope of happiness , to fly in the face of certain evil and woe , rather than see one so pained by a refusal . Benevolence deserves commendation in all cases . Yet not always is it the result of sound judgment , or the demand of duty to marry one , because importuned to that step . He , who waits at your feet and implores acceptance , might not be so miserable after all , as he and you imagine , should you decline his overtures . In the cares of a busy world , he may find a draught of the waters of Lethe . His affections ,  --  if it be a pure and deep love that impels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be turned into other channels , and the remnant of his life prove , after all , an endurable evil . He may be directed to a companion , who will render his lot far more agreeable than it could be , had you , with the feelings under which you separated , been his wife . Besides , the instances are very rare in which a female is required , for the gratification of an importunate lover , to do what she feels must be suicidal to her own peace . As a Christian , she is bound to love others as herself , if you please , even as much as herself ; but not more . If she offer up all her self-love , and take a course intended exclusively for the gratification of another , does she not go then beyond the gospel command ? There are cases in which this may be a duty , but let a young woman ponder long and seriously , before concluding that hers is of that number . It may call for great energy to withstand importunities . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but let her consider the future , a whole life of aversion from one ever at her side , and if this seem her inevitable doom , did she now marry , she will remain firm in her purpose to the last . Nearly related to the class just described , are those who marry under the impression that it is their Duty to form this connection with some one . Public opinion demands it , as a matter of course ; their parents have always conducted , as if this was their view of the subject , and the daughter conscientiously believes that she must conform to it . Now , if what I have hitherto said is correct , there is no such thing as an unconditional obligation to marry . It is a duty only when circumstances favor it . If there be decided objections against the character of the one , or the many , who may have made overtures of marriage to a young lady , it has never yet become her duty to marry . On the contrary , she is solemnly bound still to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prospect of so changing her situation , as to enhance her usefulness and happiness . Marriage is regarded too often as a Business transaction . It is entered upon for prudential reasons alone ; the heart is not interested , nor , of course , given at the altar . In our country , where all things take the form of traffic , there is especial danger that the most sacred bond which man can form , will bear a mercantile aspect , by being rudely exposed in the market place . Let prudence have her office in this matter , but let it always be subordinate to a higher principle . Affection should prompt and impel ; discretion ought only to act as a guide , a light , and counsellor , never as an originator and master , in matrimonial concerns . There is a wide chasm between imprudence and rashness in this transaction , and a Stoical sale of the hand , while the heart is kept back . Some marry from Gratitude . They have received pecuniary aid from another ; or they have been assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their afflictions or troubles . But can they not express their gratitude otherwise than by marriage ? If the single act , or few acts , of past favor , deserving though they be in themselves , constitute his sole claim to their hand and heart , let them be slow in the gift . Chapter IX . CONDITIONS OF TRUE MARRIAGE . But one divine cement . " Marrying to increase Love . " Must be Free . Advice of Parents . A rare example . Good Disposition . Good Temper . Charity on Religious Opinions . Intelligence . Refined Taste . Good Health . Energy of Character . Similarity of Fortune ; of Age . Early Marriages . View of them in Italy . Recommended by Dr. Franklin . Objections . Lady Blessington . Before forming any connection in life , we should consider well its objects , and the means by which they promise to be accomplished , and then ask ourselves if these be placed within our particular reach . Now what is marriage ? The union of two individual souls in one . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to the sacred name it bears . But what will secure a union of souls between husband and wife ? There is but one divine cement , Love . No substitute can atone for its absence ; no talisman can produce consequences that belong only to this holy principle . Many joys are inherent in a true marriage . It has sympathies , the most intimate of which mortals are capable , and it calls forth affections , such as pertain to no other voluntary relation of life . But these sentiments are the fruits of love alone . Disgust and aversion can not produce them , nor are they the growth of indifference . If there be not a peculiar interest in the society of another , and a pain in his absence , no foundation is yet laid for a genuine marriage between him and yourself . Again , there are evils incident to this life , which lose much of their bitterness , when shared with another . There is a sorrow of spirit , which none but a near friend can soothe . Peculiar trials belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trials be mitigated to the wife , or the husband ? Only by the power of love . If you dislike your companion , you can not minister cordially to his griefs , nor will he participate in yours . Marriage is an arch ; if love be its keystone , it will stand firmly ; it will grow stronger with time . That wanting , it will crumble in a day . Never should this relation be formed , except with such sentiments as give reasonable hope of an ever-growing love . Our natural emotions , on witnessing a marriage without apparent affection , are painful . If a lady be compelled so to marry , we pity her doom ; if she do it voluntarily , we can not but feel a disgust at the connection . Yet how often , could we unveil human hearts , should we see at the altar , nothing deeper than stratagem , expediency , fancy , or at best , friendship , as the chief attractive cause . Is it right to complain ourselves , or should we wonder , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple of marriage rest thus on wood , hay and stubble , instead of having gold , silver , and precious stones at its base ? " Marrying to increase love , " says a writer , " is like gaming to get rich . You are liable , in the hazard , to lose all you carry to the game . " They , who join hands , with cold hearts , often cease even to respect one another . They become , in truth , like the pith-ball , in its approach to the electrified cylinder , the more fiercely repelled , the nearer the contact . If you do not love the individual you wed , above all his sex ; if nothing more than fancy and friendship draw you toward him , then your marriage will be indeed a " lottery , " and yours may be a blank . Let there be genuine love , and if alienation afterward occur , it may be overcome by time and circumstances . Enter this condition in coldness , and strange will be the exception , if that chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be Free , contracted by the preference and choice of the parties . If it be done by constraint , or against the will of either , it comes short of an union , and is a mere bargain and sale . An offer may be accepted , simply to gratify a parent or a friend , when the taste of the lady would have prompted a rejection . The case of Madeline Bray , in Nickleby , is precisely of this character . She pledged herself a victim to one whom she did not love , and could not but secretly despise , and had the marriage been actually consummated , it would have hardly been a more incongruous , forced , and unnatural connection , than many which occur in real life . To marry only to please a third person , even though it be a father , or mother , is never a duty , and can be the result only of a misled judgment , or a mistaken kind of filial piety . Yet I by no means recommend the disregard of parental advice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age lie chiefly in that direction . There is often a false independence in this matter , an idea that a certain individual must be a lady 's companion for life . She may believe that " the match was made in Heaven , " and that it is a sin , in parents and friends , to oppose it . Or , she may determine that , let what will be the consequences , she will accept the overtures of the gentleman before her . The tendencies of the times induce many parents to keep silent , and take no part , and give no advice , when their daughters receive proposals for marriage . It is thought that , let them advise as they may , their children are resolved to do just as they please , and , to preserve peace , they forbear to interfere in the least . This state of things can not be too deeply deplored . When a young woman has an offer of addresses , it presents a solemn occasion , one which demands of her great deliberation , thoughtfulness and discretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision can with propriety be effected . Counsel and assistance are never more needed , than in this important exigency . And to whom should one go , in preference to those who best understand her character , and what traits are needed in another to render her happy , and useful to him ; and who feel also the deepest interest in her welfare ? The daughter should seek advice from this quarter , and the parent ought promptly to give it . In the other extreme , where parental partiality would coerce the feelings of a child , and impel her to a step she would fain avoid , then let the daughter mildly , but firmly , maintain her own purpose . I saw recently an account of a couple who were married nearly three years since , but owing to the opposition of friends , they lived separately , and kept their secret , until circumstances permitted a disclosure . Here must have been genuine affection , a true union of souls . " Stolen waters are sweet , " and none seem more so , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprecate the result of such elopements , I would rather a young lady should be even guilty of this imprudence , if she sincerely love her companion , than that she marry one she does not love , nor can hope ever to love , for the sake of gratifying any individual in the world . Let advice be sought , and let it be weighed and well heeded ; but let it operate only on a free mind , and induce only to a more serious , and dispassionate consideration , for yourself , of the reply you shall give . A good Disposition , if essential in the wife , is no less so in the husband . No young lady would marry one she believed destitute of this quality . Every instance , in which it is ultimately found to be wanting , is the result of a deception , either culpably disregarded by the lady , or so artfully conducted , during the days of " courtship , " as to be then wholly unperceived . But of what value are all other recommendations , talent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and kind feelings ? She , who allows herself to hazard any thing on this point , is little less than insane . If her partner prove morose , sullen , selfish , it will blight forever the joys of their marriage day . Better had she been bound to the dead , as certain offenders of her sex were said to be of old , than bound to a living mass of pollution , to one whose principles become more and more her horror , as they are daily betrayed . Next to the disposition , I regard a good Temper as essential to domestic happiness . If nature have bestowed sparingly of this gift , and there be evidence of inward passion , unless there be also unceasing efforts at self-control , commit not your destiny to the individual . When the restraints of unfamiliar acquaintance are at length thrown off , what can you anticipate , but captiousness , and peevishness , if not actual violence ? " Where surfaces , " says one , " are contiguous , every little prominence is mutually felt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought in so near collision , as may be produced by marriage . You will desire proofs of sensibility . This is often accompanied by excitable passions ; but not uniformly , not of necessity . No one could be prone naturally to greater strength of passion than Washington seems to have been , yet how admirably did he control his anger . The beau ideal of a desirable companion combines quick feelings , with a serene , self-possessed temper . Spare no efforts in ascertaining how near the individual who addresses you approaches this ideal . An utter failure , should present , in your view , an insuperable obstacle to a connection with him for life . Another condition of happy marriage , is an union of spirit on the great subject of Religion . It is desirable that the husband and wife belong to the same Christian denomination ; and that the family they constitute worship in one church . Still , the circumstance of their adherence to different sects should not alone prevent their connection . They should hope to unite in their views on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indispensable to a true marriage . One thing , however , is so ; and that is , that they each possess the spirit of Charity . There must be sympathy , as respects the value and necessity of personal piety . It is not their belief alone , which can produce this ; nor will a diversity of opinion prevent it , where the spirit of Christ exists mutually between them . We are told that , where husband and wife enter into a cordial union , there often becomes a growing personal resemblance of one to the other . Like views , tastes , feelings and interests , generate a similar expression of countenance . This blessed token of genuine affection , will often be manifested , where there is found a spiritual sympathy . Let this holy temper be deemed essential , and you shall " Learn , by a mortal yearning , to ascend Towards a higher object .  --  Love was given , Encouraged , sanctioned , chiefly for that end . " I have in mind , an instance , where there seems great unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be diametrically opposite . Who can tell but , by her singular charity , the wife is there sanctifying her husband , when had she exhibited toward him a bigoted and repulsive disposition , she might have driven him even to blank infidelity ? Let there be a full and frank expression of opinion on points of faith and conscience , before marriage , as well as after . Occasion is sometimes given for the complaint that the true feelings and intentions on this subject were concealed , during the engagement of the parties ; or , that more charity was expressed then , than afterward . This , of all prospects , is most assuredly fatal to the hope of a happy marriage . Whatever difference may exist , as to preferences of doctrine , or places of worship , let them be explicitly communicated , before marriage . Then will it never be said , " This I did not expect . It was not so , during our engagement . " The young woman may justly require that her future companion be a man of Intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where these are wanting , as the object loses its novelty , and becomes common , its beauties fade away , and the imagination , and the eyes which complacently and admiringly , rested upon them , begin to wander .  --  Love , if it ever existed , rapidly abates ; one or both regret precipitation ;  --  glaring defects stand out in bold relief , in place of the perfections which the imagination had painted . " She , who does not regard another as at least her equal in talent and education , can hardly entertain for him that respect , which is the basis of all true love . Not only should there be a moral and religious , but also an intellectual , sympathy between husband and wife . Else , how can they enjoy the society and conversation of each other , in those numberless hours , when they are sole companions ? What a burden to a lady of cultivated mind , must be the society of one , who takes no pleasure in a book , and can appreciate only the gossip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of being linked to stupidity , or ignorance , for life , of feeling always anxious , when in company , lest your companion utter the follies he does at your fireside , must be insupportable . If you have a husband , whom you can not trust as a man of common sense at least , woe is your lot . Nor is it unreasonable to require in your partner , refined Taste , and delicate feelings . There may be valuable traits , and still this be wanting . A friend of mine married an individual , whom she respected for his talents , and Christian character . But he was still destitute of acute perceptions and deep sensibility . There was a coarseness in his nature , which made him blind to her feelings , and a vulgarity of habit and speech , which to her was completely disgusting . He did not intend any harm , but was still always offending her taste ; and this simple circumstance embittered her whole happiness , and hastened her , I believe , out of this world . Opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the silent , the loquacious ; the irritable may seek the calm ; the bold , the modest ; and the impassioned , the gentle . This occurs , indeed , according to the analogy of the physical world , where attraction takes place between different bodies , as between the opposite poles of magnets , &c.; But it is not so in matters of taste , certainly not , so far as refinement and coarseness are concerned . Good Health is a point of no ordinary moment . It is needful for the discharge of our duties ; and she can hardly be justified , who allies herself to one evidently incapable , for his physical debility , of sustaining a family . A person afflicted by an incurable disease , especially if hereditary , can not reasonably expect a young lady to sacrifice herself upon him . There are other offices , beside that of the nurse , demanded of a wife , and the cases should be rare , in which all other considerations are merged in this . But there may be health , and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the foundation , you may anticipate a fair superstructure ; but if this be wanting , you ought not , and can not , look for anything but poverty , and wretchedness , throughout your connection . A worldly-minded man , will be far from an interesting companion ; yet , in the issue , it is better to trust yourself with the slave of business , than with a palpable drone . Similarity of Fortune is to be desired in those who contemplate marriage . There need not be , it is true , entire equality in this respect ; yet a great disparity of circumstances is often the source of melancholy evils . The individuals thus joined , will probably differ in their habits , and in their views of economy , of dress , and style of living . One shall appear mean , and the other extravagant . She , who is raised suddenly from poverty to affluence , must possess rare humility , to escape undue elation and pride . While to one accustomed to opulence , there will seem a degradation in the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in the character and feelings of the husband , where the wife has lived in circumstances entirely unlike his own . Instances there are , and will be , in which such consequences will not follow ; but the tendencies are strongly in this direction . The Ages of those joined in marriage , should be somewhat near each other . How else can there be true sympathy between them ? One shall charge the other with levity , and that allegation be retorted by the charges of moroseness , and insensibility to enjoyment . It is well , perhaps , that there be that difference of age , which nature indicates in the sexes . It is not of two , or four , years we speak . The great poet of humanity writes , and perhaps wisely ,  --  if these be the limits ,  --  thus : " Let still the woman take An elder than herself ; so wears she to him , So sways she level in her husband 's heart . " Much has been said in relation to the expediency of Early Marriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , that in many churches and fraternities , there are annual funds established , to raise portions , and procure comfortable matches for young maidens who are destitute . In their favor , is the circumstance that the habits are then less established , and the parties may more easily conform to one another , than afterward . Nor is prejudice then so strong , nor opinion so inflexible , as in later manhood . The husband and wife can hence educate one another better , than if their marriage had occurred late in life . It was for these , and for prudential reasons , that Dr. Franklin recommended early marriages . On the other hand , it can not be questioned , that young ladies are often engaged , and sometimes married too early , before their school education is completed , or their judgment matured . The mother is , perhaps , anxious to marry her daughters " off her hands , " and , moved by a miserable ambition , she and they , lest she be later in her engagement than some companion , consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it what it may . Hence come those fatal alliances , in which " a six month 's acquaintance after marriage , transforms the beau ideal into a fool , or a coxcomb ; and the happy couple , to use an expression of Lady Blessington 's , have to ' pay for a month of honey , with a life of vinegar . ' " Circumstances should affect a predetermination on this point , yet where they are balanced , she is the wiser , who postpones a matrimonial connection , until her age , and her preparation for it , indicate its propriety . Chapter X. THE SOCIETY OF YOUNG MEN . Importance of right views on this point . We can not banish all thoughts of love . The opposite extreme . Regard not every one as a lover . Two errors in the society of gentlemen . Forwardness . The poet 's caution . Undue reserve . The happy medium attainable . Should know a variety of gentlemen . The acquaintances of Brothers . No period of life is more decisive of a female 's character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite sex , as a woman . Her manners and conversation at that time usually do much to determine her condition for life . The IDEAL which she carries with her into the world , becomes the presiding star of her destiny . On her general estimate of man , and the views she entertains of his sex , every thing now depends . If she can penetrate character , and has resolution to form high purposes , blessed is her lot . First , then , I can not join with those who advise a young lady to banish entirely from her mind every thought of love , until she receives overtures for particular attention . Providence designed her for the exercise of her affections ; why then seek wholly to suppress them , or to expend no thought whatever upon them ? " Nature , " says a recent writer , " will assert her rights over the beings she has made : she avenges all attempts to force or shackle her operations . We ought long ago to have been convinced that the only power allowed to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to girls have been denied the very thoughts of love ,  --  even in its noblest and purest form . "  --  They " know nothing at all of it , or nothing but what they have clandestinely gathered from corrupt sources . " Is not this evidently doing violence to one of the strongest , and I will add , the holiest , impulses of their nature ? If it be true , as some affirm , that the marriage service is the first part of the Liturgy perused by a young lady , I do not regard it as matter for surprise , derision , or censure . She , who forces her mind wholly off this subject , will be ill qualified , when the occasion demands it , to listen to proposals of marriage . Ignorance and blindness can do little to give her that sound judgment , and true discrimination , which alone should dictate her reply . No , let this rather be done . Let her teachers and parents speak frankly on this topic , treat it as a serious concern , and aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral and intellectual excellence , such as would render one a desirable companion , and yet let this model be not a creature of romance , but of real life . Is it not better thus to guide the affections and regulate the views on this subject , than to stifle all feeling , and blindfold the mind to love ? In what province should reason be exercised , if not in that , which affects our condition through life , for weal , or for woe ? But , while encouraged to give suitable thought to this subject , let not a young lady become totally absorbed in it . Let her not look only on a gentleman to canvass his merits as a lover , and a husband . The sexes should associate for other and nobler objects ; for social enjoyment , for intellectual improvement , and for mutual aid , as moral and religious beings . She who overlooks these precious advantages of general society , sacrifices an invaluable means of education , no less than one of rational gratification . Still less should one allow herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes occurs in consequence of an ignorance of the world ; sometimes from the illusion of very strong affections ; and again , from the unworthy practice of certain young men , who delight in exciting and trifling with the feelings of the opposite sex . Let the cause be what it may , nothing more exposes a lady to ridicule . Such extreme and manifest sensitiveness provokes the trifler to fresh follies . The sensible are disgusted by it ; and she , who thus indulges her imagination , is sowing the wind , and will reap the whirlwind . Sorrow , regret , and disappointment await her . In regard to " behavior to gentlemen , " I do not think set rules and forms are needful . Where the heart is duly controlled , and the understanding cultivated , and fancy a servant not mistress of the soul , the deportment will be spontaneously right , and commendable . Then all may safely be trusted to nature . The manners will be the expression of gentleness , mingled with firmness . Two errors , however , are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . One is that of the Forward and presuming . No lady can make advances of a character bold and obvious to a gentleman , and still retain a good name in society . Modesty is the only current coin of her sex ; nothing can atone for its absence . A self-possessed , yet retiring manner , is at once the index , and the charm , of female worth . It may be needless to speak of the confirmed coquette . She , like the coxcomb , may expect no mercy from others . There are few , to whom the caution of the poet is necessary , " She can both false and friendly be . * * * * * * * * She gives a side glance and looks down , Beware ! Beware ! Trust her not ; She is fooling thee . " Examples of this character , I believe , are comparatively rare , despite his opinion , who said that " at sixteen , woman is a coquette , par instinct . " Still , it is too true , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruct women to allure , than to repel ; " although " as rationally might the military disciplinarian limit his tuition to the mode of assault , leaving his soldiery in entire ignorance of the tactics of defence . " Opposed to this fault stands that of undue Reserve . Some young ladies are so trained as apparently to enshrine themselves from all approach , in the society of gentlemen . They are models of decorum , miracles of prudence , and drawn up , as if always anticipating a foe . They inwardly sneer at all sentiment , and deride those , who exhibit it , and pride themselves , above all things , in keeping every one completely at a distance . I do not deny that a female has a right , and ought , to repel all improper liberties , and to shew those , who are unduly familiar , that she can assume , at fit times , a little dignity . But need one , in doing this , build round herself a wall of ice ? Shall she , through fear of seeming fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding French freedom , we often substitute an Anglo-American prudery . The slightest compliment is interpreted as flattery , so that the remarker must do violence to his honest convictions , lest he offend an ever-suspicious , maidenly , pride . The true medium between boldness and a chilling reserve may not be easily attained ; yet it is worth years of effort , even to approximate this happy manner . There are women , who can invite to easy and pleasant conversation , and yet repel the most trivial impropriety in a gentleman . I could wish that our female writers , in their minute directions to the young of their sex , had recommended this desirable medium , instead of teaching them to regard themselves as always acting on the defensive . Can a lady never accept a present from a gentleman , without so doing it as to encourage his particular attentions ? Does she , by consenting to walk , or ride with one , bind herself to him for life , or invite his addresses , as a suitor ? But let a young woman resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy with readiness , she will not allow herself to infer that they signify every thing . If the remark of Lord Bacon be correct in general , that " women , when young , are the idols of men , " the reverse of it is not seldom true . A companion for the evening is invested with imaginary dispositions , and she , who ought to have exercised her judgment , and waited for decisive tokens of favor , is captivated without the least intention on the part of her fancied lover . It is certainly desirable that a young lady be acquainted , and that somewhat particularly , with a variety of gentlemen . Thus only can she be qualified to discriminate between the undeserving , the indifferent , and the excellent . How else can you know the indications of those who undervalue your sex in general , the worthless , gay , and unprincipled , and guard against their influence ? There are those , who delight in making sport of an inexperienced female . To understand the traits of such , you must sometime have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself in the power of an individual of this character , or of one , whose principles and designs you suspect . If you doubt the purity of any one who seeks your society frequently , consult a friend older or wiser than yourself ; and abide by the judgment of disinterested observers . There are instances , in which a young woman is brought into the society of the other sex , by her Brothers . This sometimes exposes one to mistake the civilities of friendship , for manifestations of love . Thus situated , you ought to take special heed against those romantic ideas , and premature inclinations , that spring from passion and fancy . Here as at all times , the advice of a judicious brother , before whom those of his own sex are accustomed completely to disclose their true character , should be sought and prized . Do not permit yourself to indulge a predilection for one , against whom , as a companion for life , so near a relative and friend has warned you . Chapter XI . FIRST LOVE . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Laura . " Love-matches . " Self-oblivion indicates true love . Proofs of one 's being affected by this sentiment . Shakspeare 's description of a lover . Jealousy and Timidity indicate love . Overtures . Unrequited love . Rejection of Addresses . I use the expression at the head of this chapter , because of the importance I attach , not only to the sentiment in general , but especially to its earliest developement . There are those , who sneer at the name of love . There are many , who laugh at its mention , if made in sober earnestness , and yet some of these , who thus speak in public , do , I believe , in the secrecy of their hearts , believe in , aye , reverence , it , as one of the most sacred impulses of our nature . Because we have witnessed , or read of , a silly sentimentalism , that affected its character , let us not straightway question the possibility of its existence in any one . Nor would I encourage the little girl in musing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she dreams herself in love . There is indeed little danger of this where friends have not made it a theme for perpetual inuendos and jests , but spoken frankly , simply , and seriously of it , as a reality in human experience . She , who finds herself tending to foolish imaginings on this subject , has but to employ her mind constantly , and preserve her health in soundness , and the illusion will be dispelled . But what is love ? Shall we take the description of it given by the master poet of our nature , who tells us that " Love with the motion of all elements , Courses as swift as thought in every power ; And gives to every power a double power , Above their functions and their offices " ? It may be thus mighty in its sway over some hearts ; but not always are its courses so " swift . " The affections of some " tremble , like a leaf , at every breath of love ; while others , like the ocean , are moved only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , its approach causes great changes in the character , and usually alters the entire complexion of life . Where the individual has enjoyed great mental culture , it brings in its train increased hazards ; and in not a few hearts , its involutions are strangely complex , and its abysses of fearful depth . I am one of those who believe , that in strict truth , the first love is the only real , all-pervading affection . There are other sentiments , on which the marriage relation may be founded with fair and reasonable hopes of an happy result . But no one can love two individuals , simultaneously or successively , with equal strength . There is a fervor , in the freshness of the heart 's first gift , that no second occasion can quicken . Petrarch could never have found another Laura . Though his was love at first sight , it endured until twenty-one years had terminated the life of its object . Our earliest manners , tones of voice , and expression of countenance , endure the longest . So does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every subsequent impression . Hence the importance of bestowing this primal treasure with wisdom . Where all of this life , and all of the future is at stake , wary should be our steps , and well pondered our decisions . We hear much of " love-matches . " Weak transactions , but the foam of love 's great deep , are many of these matches . Still there is such a thing as marriage based on spontaneous love . It may occur at a chance meeting , not , I allow , to be consummated without the revision of calm judgment , but still the fruit of a moment 's impression . There is a kind of love , which is not natural , impulsive , and cordial , but the result of an unnatural predisposition , and an inflamed and diseased imagination . None the less is there an up-welling , genuine affection , that for the time , commands and absorbs woman 's entire being . It is possible , that what is treated here as a jest , and there , as a matter of skepticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet persevered in , and permanent . Some marry for money , others for beauty , for intelligence , or rank , or family , or fancy ; there are those who marry for love . We have known females , who venerated the object of their affection so completely , as to mourn sincerely their own unworthiness of , and regard themselves as a simple gift of God to so good a man . Where one sees this beautiful self-oblivion , can he be a true philosopher , and assign any cause for it , save the existence of genuine love ? She , who unites to this passion a provident self-possession , who is as calm , as she is keenly susceptible , will enter the marriage relation with the happiest omens of joy , and ever-growing success , in every coming duty . After these preliminary remarks , it will be expected that I should give a sketch of the tokens and proofs of one 's being under the influence of this sentiment . It occasions , on its approach , important changes in the feelings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their occurrence , although , so close is the resemblance between love and the effects of a warm imagination , that one may fancy herself in love , when she really is not . It wakes emotions and sympathies never before awakened , and lying deep in our nature . No writer has described its signs and effects so minutely as Shakspeare . If we may believe him , it is not always marked by deliberation , and entire self-possession : " If thou rememberest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into , Thou hast not loved : Or if thou hast not sat , as I do now , Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress ' praise , Thou hast not loved : Or if thou hast not broke from company , Abruptly , as my passion now makes me , Thou hast not loved . " Love makes the hours , when its object is absent , long and dreary . It renders even the contemplation of the preferred one more agreeable than the society of others . A prepossession for a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other persons . I once heard a gentleman remark , that it was this jealousy , which first convinced him that he was in love . You can not open your lips to speak against him , who has impressed your heart . You will inwardly , although not probably in words , defend him from the attacks of others . To blush and falter under such circumstances would indicate love , much more surely than open professions . Were the question put by yourself " Do I love this person ? " the first reply ,  --  that of timidity and doubt ,  --  would be , " no . " Still for no consideration could you rest an hour in that conclusion . Unstaid in all motions else , there would be one fixed object , " The constant image of the creature That is beloved . " Should Overtures be made by a gentleman , it requires great delicacy to treat them aright . Are you decided in the determination to accept them , let your reply be prompt . It is ungenerous to trifle with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need advice . Those entitled to your first regard , on this subject , are your parents . Reserve at this period causes many unhappy mistakes . A word of information , a hint from so true a friend as a mother , may confirm your undecided purpose , or lead you at once to abandon it . Let it not be your fault , if you do not enjoy the benefit of such valuable counsel . Suppose your parents object to the connection , when your heart is interested , and judgment approves your affection . There are examples of noble self-denial under these circumstances . Cases there are , too , in which health , peace of mind , and even life , have been the forfeit paid for compliance with such advice . I believe it right , where the opposition is evidently unreasonable , that a young lady should obey the promptings of her own heart . Gretna Green , if it have witnessed the union of some unprincipled fugitives from home , has seen others joined in a true and sacred bond . Is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oneself , as is so often done in France by thwarted lovers ? The instances that justify this procedure may be very rare , yet surely it is better to follow nature 's holiest law , than to drag out a lingering life of martyrdom , as thousands have done , to gratify what the world knew to be but a whim of an ambitious father , or a capricious mother . When conscience approves the step , let it be firmly taken . If the blessing of God can be invoked upon it , then is it right . Another event may occur . The offering of the heart may prove Unrequited . She , who has poured forth the fulness of her affections , meets a chilling repulse . Perhaps it is instant ; or there may be intimations of a favorable regard that shall fan , and keep alive , a hope . That hope is at length totally crushed . How is one to demean herself , under this severe trial ? Let her cherish no resentment . This will but aggravate her sufferings and expose her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate , and nurse in her bosom the seeds of consumption . Rather let the whole energy of her soul be given to banish the occurrence from her thoughts , and let her seek relief from the Source of all solace . The task of extinguishing our affection for an individual , voluntarily , is never an easy one . They , who are called by circumstances to this effort , should know that it can usually be effected only by a resolute purpose , and by a force of exertion which , to those of strong feelings , seems almost to rend the spirit in twain . Yet so it must be . As a lady has well remarked  --  " to a frank and ardent nature , " and such usually have this sex , " reasoning on love is a useless pastime ;  --  it can be overcome only by an effort strong as the whirlwind , such as uproots the young and vigorous oak , in its bright leafing time . Woman 's warm nature must cast it far away at once , though death were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reject the offers of a suitor . In this case , let your decision be communicated in such a manner as to spare the feelings of him , who can not but be mortified , if not humbled , by your decision . How can she maintain a clear conscience , or even a sense of honor , who exposes a gentleman , under these circumstances , to the derision of the public ? Let no one share the secret , beyond the precincts of your own family . Return all letters , and leave no evidence of the disappointment of your friend , where it may be discovered . She , who conducts thus kindly and wisely , will retain still a respect for her suitor . If she lose his friendship , or alienate him entirely from her regard , it is sufficient proof that there was something wrong , either in the spirit , or the manner , of her refusal . Why should one sink in your estimation , for an event unexpected on his part , and for which he had seen nothing in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your conduct be judicious , and then , should he address himself to another lady , she will not indeed have his first love , yet , unless greatly prejudiced by the fact of his previous rejection , she may accept his addresses , and be united to him , with the fair hope of a happy life . Chapter XII . CONDUCT DURING ENGAGEMENT . Two aspects of the Future . Extravagant Anticipations . Calm , and rational ones . We should disclose our true and entire Character . The great error of the Betrothed . Disclosure of Faults . Esteem and Respect to be secured . Sacredness of our Plighted word . Implied engagement . Dismissing a Suitor . A noble example of constancy . Sad fate of Mrs. Hemans . Preparation for marriage . Duration of engagement . Testimony from Pere Lachaise . Short engagements usually most desirable . After mature deliberation , and in accordance with the sacred impulse of love , you are now , let us conceive , pledged to one , who anticipates a future consummation with you , of the dearest relation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your present situation ? and how should you deport yourself in your intercourse with this near friend ? There are two aspects , under which the future may , from this point , be regarded . It may be to you a region of dreams , and extravagant Anticipations . The mind may easily be allowed so to dwell on its scenes , that imagination shall take the place of reality . Circumstances often warrant but moderate expectations ; yet amid the most arid waste you see , like the deceived traveller in the deserts of Zahara , the enchanting mirage , a beautiful lake of deep , refreshing , inexhaustible waters . A moment 's reflection might teach such an one the delusiveness of these prospects . Let it be that your lover has every good quality you ascribe to him , that he is quite perfection ; you must know , from the experience of other anticipated enjoyments , that the possession of an object tends naturally to moderate our feelings in regard to it . The heart , which beat feverish pulsations beneath the summer of expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . There is a wide chasm between the illusions of sleep and all we can call " The sober certainty of waking bliss . " There is a joy , it is true , in the marriage bond greater even than we once anticipated . But it comes from an unlooked-for source . It is not that very thing we imagined ; in that we are often disappointed . It consists in the shining forth of new and before undiscovered traits . But when were extravagant anticipations ever yet realized , and that too in the precise objects , on which they had fastened ? Another view a lady who is engaged may take of coming life , is , that of the calm and Rational description . She may strive to see her lover in the true light ; she may pray that her heart be not betrayed into false hopes , and resolve that she will never abandon her judgment , in so momentous a transaction . Such an one looks at the world as it is , a chequered scene ; a place in which " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which a just price must be paid for every article we obtain . This aspect of life may be less pleasing than its opposite . It may render what is termed " Courtship " something else beside a golden age ; yet , in the end , who can doubt , it will prove a rich source of substantial happiness ? If it be desirable that a young woman see her lover in his genuine character , so is it that she disclose to him every feature of her own . Why should she wish to keep any thing concealed ? What is the purpose of that period , which passes between the engagement of two individuals , and the consummation of their marriage ? If it have any rational meaning , it must be to afford an opportunity for a thorough mutual acquaintance . The parties do not ,  --  ostensibly , at least , this is the case ,  --  they do not , pass hours and months in the society of one another , except the better to understand , and hence the more truly to sympathize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suitor enter the presence of his friend , to exalt himself into an unnatural position . He is not striving to pass with her for some creature of romance , some hero , or god . No , the ostensible purpose of their interviews is , that he may exhibit himself to her more and more truly as he is , in heart , principle , character , and life . So is it designed , by these acts and conversations , that the lady should present her true phases before him . To suppose that she arrays her person , or frames her speech , with a view to concealing her real feelings , and thoughts , and dispositions , from him , is a mockery of the most sacred relation on earth . One would imagine that nothing would give an individual such pain , in this situation , as the fear that her too partial admirer might conceive of her as a divinity , instead of a mere woman , inheriting the common frailties of our nature . Her chief solicitude would be , we should think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her future character . Rather would she that he undervalue her merits , and so leave her room to rise in his estimation , than so heighten her charms , as to render the fruition of his hopes impossible . Is this the usual tenor of feeling in the hearts of the betrothed ? It would argue little practical knowledge of the world to contend that it is . On the contrary , there seems a systematic endeavor , on the part , too often , of both individuals , to disguise their real sentiments , cloak their sincere opinions , and throw a mist over their daily principles and habits . The gentleman usually exhibits only his Sunday exterior and manner , aiming studiously to veil his face , in the company of his affianced one . And instead of encouraging her to speak out her true thoughts , and show her ordinary disposition , he burns before her the incense of flattery , until she is constrained to force herself up to unnatural heights of goodness , in appearance and expression , lest her lover be compelled to lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , a poor , unadorned sharer of humanity , just as she is . Who can wonder , amid this utter want of frankness , and these pasteboard forms , that the foundation is laid for sure disappointment and misery , when the masks are thrown off , and the two individuals stand , a mere man and a mere woman , before one another ? Human ingenuity could not devise a system more completely adapted to entail sorrow and suffering on our race , than this . It may be said that I exaggerate the case , that the parties do not mean to deceive each other , but do really feel all that they now mutually express . In one sense this may be correct . The circumstances in which they are placed tend , I know , to foster kind feelings , and create courteous manners ; and to the manifestation of these , all that flow spontaneously at the moment , I do not object . But is not more also expressed ? Or rather ,  --  for the error lies chiefly in restraint ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom and ingenuousness , to be distinctly avowed ? Suppose I have faults ,  --  and who has not ?  --  why should they be cautiously concealed from my nearest friend ? I am , by nature , and indulgence also , peevish and ill-humored ; ought I to seek to pass for all that is opposite to this ? Contentiousness is a besetting sin of my character . Shall I strive to appear , always and only , one of the most yielding of my sex ? My temper is violent , or sullen , why should this fact be kept from my lover , until some outbreak after our marriage day ? Ought I not to speak decidedly , and unequivocally , of this my infirmity ? I am addicted to occasional depression of spirits and gloom ; by what right , or on what principle of religion , or expediency , shall I labor to keep up an unnatural cheerfulness ? If I am extravagant , is it wise or just to be always sounding the praises of economy ? Why profess a taste for reading , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force myself up to a pitch of neatness , when my wardrobe would , by a single glance , prove me a slattern ? It is hard , it seems cruel , to require these painful disclosures , to roll clouds over the sun of the matrimonial sky . But is not even this better than to suffer a dense mass to accumulate , which shall at length break in storm , and thunder , and desolation , upon the devoted pair ? We are both weak and wicked , if we deliberately lay a train , that must at length explode , and cause decrepitude , if not matrimonial death , to one , who is about committing his entire happiness to our hands . No marriage can be consummated , with a fair prospect of good , except between individuals , who have made it a point of principle to disclose to each other their entire characters . New scenes may develope new dispositions unfriendly to perfect harmony . But these can be met and successfully encountered , if there were no intentional deception , if there were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did really exist before marriage . Any efforts to engage the affections of another by false appearances will inevitably abate thus much from the future happiness of those who make , or are misled by , them . All that is termed " Courting , " so far as that word implies assumption , pretence , and flattery ,  --  and it too often means nothing more ,  --  should be sacredly avoided . Nature alone can lay the basis of an enduring superstructure ; art , affectation , disguise , and concealment , are but a sure presage of bitter regrets . The intercourse we describe would be pervaded by mutual Esteem and Respect . It would prevent the habit of trifling on the concerns of the affections , and render the conversation worthy of the holy relation now contemplated , and such as could be reviewed with satisfaction . From their taking just views of one another , there would be sincerity , confidence , and a rational , ever-growing , attachment , between the individuals thus situated . Their most private hours would be marked by perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In public , no occasion would be given for remarks on their silly and sentimental airs , while all would perceive evidence of a mutual and deep interest between them , and predict , as they ought , that their future connection would be auspicious of the happiest results . Where a true understanding of each other 's characters , and an esteem , sustained by self-respect , exists , the communications , however conducted , whether by personal interviews , or by correspondence , will be of a rational description . The letters will not be crowded with nauseating compliments , with nonsense and vanity , but will contain good thoughts , no less than the expression of pure feeling , and generous sentiments . There will be nothing of insincerity , nor what would lead a stranger , who perused them , to say that they were mere folly and illusions . A lady should feel bound , from the moment of her engagement , to be true to her plighted word . She is forbidden , by every dictate of Honor , from pursuing any course of conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steadiness of feeling and purpose , under these circumstances , which can not be too highly commended . " What state could fall , " asks a recent writer , " what liberty decay , if the zeal of man 's noisy patriotism was as pure as the silent loyalty of woman 's love . " Erring ,  --  all human as she is , to others ,  --  God gifts her with a thousand virtues , to the one she loves ; it is from that love , that she drinks her nobler nature ;  --  it gives her the meekness of a dove , the devotion of a saint . In his danger , she has the sagacity of the serpent , and the courage of the lioness . Like the chivalrous knight , she who thus feels , will " avoid no foe , forsake no love . " There are those who apparently enjoy the opposite of this course . They consent to receive marked attentions from others in company . A French author says he has known individuals among his countrywomen , " who unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively scenes with their lovers , solely to obtain for themselves the pleasure of tears , reproaches , and reconciliations . " This luxury is one , in which no lady of principle will indulge herself . Agreeable as an occasional conquest , or flirtation , might be to her , she will sacredly abstain from every act that tends in this direction . The sure possession of one true heart , one affianced protector , and unalterable friend , will suffice her desires . Nor is it enough to refrain from encouraging the open attentions of others , the truly loyal one will not allow herself to cherish a secret feeling or preference toward any other . Her every affection will be true as steel to the magnet . She will know no wayward inclinations , nor give way to whims and fancies , and undefinable emotions , to feelings , which she would blush to betray to her lover . This true-heartedness will operate not less where an engagement is implied and understood between the parties , than if a formal pledge had been given . It is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have encouraged him to expect , more than any set speeches and written promises , that binds the conscientious mind . Some , indeed , are never formally engaged , before the day of their marriage . The trust which such instances manifest , is a beautiful trait , and will be fostered by every pure heart . But , it will be asked , if a lady is never to change her mind in relation to a gentleman ; if she must always love where her affections have been once placed , and have no power of breaking off an engagement . This I do not contend . There are , doubtless , cases , where one is not only permitted , but bound , to dismiss a suitor . If he have intentionally deceived her in respect to any circumstances , which he well knew would have prevented her consenting to an engagement , had they been disclosed , she ought , at once to refuse any further intimacy with him . Or , if his character change decidedly for the worse , during their acquaintance , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profligate , let her immediately dismiss him . If on the other hand , he be merely visited with misfortune , by adversities , to be traced clearly to the hand of Providence , then should she not , for a moment , cherish the desire to dissolve their engagement . A noble instance of moral principle , as well as true love , under a change of circumstances , occurred in England but a few years since . Sir Robert Barclay , who commanded the British squadron in the battle of Lake Erie , was horribly mutilated by the wounds he received in that action , having lost his right arm and one of his legs . Previously to his leaving England , he was engaged to a young lady , to whom he was tenderly attached . Feeling acutely , on his return , that he was a mere wreck , he sent a friend to the lady , informing her of his mutilated condition , and generously offering to release her from her engagement . " Tell him , " replied the noble girl , " that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of body left to hold his soul . " This is marrying for the gem , and not for the casket . It is true constancy . I would not have a young woman insensible to any fault in her lover . Many persist in being blind to the least moral blemish in the loved . We are told that the lamented Mrs. Hemans was a victim to a passion of this nature . She was warned by her friends of the unsuitableness and dangers of her intended connection . Yet neither this admonition , nor a three years ' separation from her lover , could quench her affection for him . The soldier and hero of her glowing imagination had power to captivate , and then ruin , her noble spirit . When a dismission becomes inevitable , let it be given with decision , yet kindly . Never should the event be made matter of public remark , nor should a letter or line of the former correspondence be rudely exposed . Let oblivion rest on the whole transaction . But so painful an issue should , if possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still less for the gibes and jests of others , should so important a connection be frustrated . The cause should be one that sober judgment will approve , to your latest day . A most trying lot is hers , who is deserted by one , who had given a solemn pledge to be hers through life . It is no credit to steel one 's self against the sorrows of such a lot . There are those , who would well nigh offer their life to gain a lover , and yet could think of a faithless one only with emotions of indignation or anger . Such can possess but an apparent affection . I speak of that which is true and deep . When this is thus wounded , let the sufferer preserve a calm temper , if possible , a calm exterior always , and turn from human faithlessness to that Love which is a perennial fountain . As regards the Preparation to be made for marriage , where it is contemplated with fair prospects of certainty , little need here be said . The whole previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should train the wife and the mother . Fidelity to home , to parents , brothers , sisters , and all the inmates of the paternal roof , is among the best qualifications for married life . If these duties have been hitherto neglected , be assured that the marriage ceremony will do little to supply the deficiency . The Duration of an engagement should ordinarily be brief , at least , not needlessly protracted . We are told that no tomb in Pere Lachaise is so often decorated with chaplets of fresh flowers as that of Abelard and Heloise . This shows how large is the number of thwarted and disappointed lovers who visit that cemetery . Not a few of these crossing elements would be averted by less prolonged engagements . There are those , I am aware , who maintain that early and long continued engagements are desirable . Applied to those cases where the parties reside near one another , and are placed under similar influences , this doctrine may be true . The earliest attachments are sometimes most happy and permanent . But how often does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals become completely changed , in a few short years . Suppose a young man to leave a farm , and take up his abode in a city , as a merchant , or to commence a course of study with a view to a liberal profession . The girl , who , as a child , won his affections , has not , as a young woman , improved in her tastes , and character , like himself . His choice of a companion , if now to be made , would fall on one quite unlike her . There is something of this evil often attendant on protracted engagements . The affections may be biased by enlarged intercourse with the world . There are innumerable perils that beset a long acquaintance of this nature . The safe avoiding of them all comes usually from short engagements , from those in which the character and tastes of the parties are much the same at marriage as at the moment of the first decided intimacy . There is one topic more which I can not pass over in this connection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , who never exchange one thought or feeling upon religion , until after their marriage . It is not until they are constrained to do it , in the bitterness of bereavement perhaps , that they communicate with one another on this momentous subject . Were it not wiser to weave a chaplet early , to their joint remembrance of Christ , rather than hang the first consecrated wreath on the tomb ? How would it assuage their mingling tears , could they sorrow , " not as those without hope , " but in the long cherished spirit of a common faith and submission . They are musing on future joys . With what heightened charms and new anticipations would they enter the marriage state , if they had pledged their united hearts , before the Eternal One . They would then feel , that the bond which joined them was not one of a few fleeting years , but imperishable as their cemented souls . Shall they , can they , maintain a midnight silence upon all Heavenly themes , until " the evil days " overtake them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOLACE . An ancient example . Trials springing from Physical Constitution . Acute Feelings . Sentiment of Burns . Trials from Imagination . An affecting incident . Want of Interesting Objects . Defencelessness in Public . Sufferings through Affections . Instance of true love . Trials of Domestic Life . Bereavement . Mrs. Sigourney , on a lost Daughter . Supports should be equal to Trials . Need of Mental Culture . Moral Developement . Friendship . Piety the great Solace . It was remarked by an observing and wise statesman , recently deceased , that " most women are either formed in the school , or tried by the test , of adversity . " In this class stood the devout Hannah of old . She was reproached and persecuted by her haughty rival , she was the subject of remonstrance with her husband , and when she went to the temple of God , to seek peace in her troubles , because she spake not aloud , but only her lips moved , she was rudely charged with the vice of intemperance . To this allegation she replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink , but have poured out my soul before the Lord . " These words remind us of the trials of woman ; and they point us , at the same time , to her only , and effectual , Solace in trouble . Human life contains much to try the spirits of all . There are many afflictions , which man must share alike with woman . But , superadded to these , are sources and occasions of sorrow peculiar to her sex . There are none , who do not sometimes descend the vale of tears . The cup of bitterness is placed in the hands of all . But woman is constrained to drink it sometimes to the very dregs . In dilating on the Trials of woman , I commence with naming , first , those which spring from her Physical Constitution . To man Providence has assigned severe bodily tasks , but he has given him likewise a vigorous frame . It is the lot of woman , notwithstanding her infirmities , to sustain more physical sufferings than come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her sensibility to pain must , therefore , be greater . We might cite the scenes of the sick chamber , and hours , in which she needs a martyr 's fortitude . But more than this , in those sufferings incident to her sex , and almost universally experienced , she has trials of her firmness , energy , and patience , from which man is constitutionally exempt . How many secret tears are wiped from her cheek ; what untold anguish does she sometimes endure . And none the lighter is this load , from her being excluded , by her silence , from the supports of sympathy . On whom shall she cast her cares ? If there are motives , which forbid the disclosure to human ears , of the sword that is cutting the bare fibre of her frame , and piercing her heart , to whom shall she go for strength ? But not the outward man , alone , or chiefly , causes the severe trials of this sex . Their Feelings are acute ; they are peculiarly sensitive to the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The winds of adversity , which to the stern spirit of man , seem but a passing breeze , prostrate her to the earth ? " To feel and to suffer , " says one of this sex , " are synonymous , with woman . " This may exaggerate the strict truth , and yet it is doubtless substantially correct . Some of the noblest virtues of her sex imply great sensibility . What gives fortitude , in her case , such illustrious merit ? Her extreme susceptibility of suffering . The blow , from which the gnarled oak will rebound , shall crush the frail dahlia . Why is patience a prime grace in woman ? Not only because she has such burdens laid on her spirit , but still more for the reason that she feels so keenly their weight . Whence is it that tenderness , and a reliant dependence , qualities which , in their excess , unfit man to grapple with this tough world , and are therefore censured in him , as effeminate , are her ornament and praise ? Her native sensibility qualifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , we deem her an apostate from her sex . It would not be too strong an expression to say , that woman lives in the realm of feeling . Her life is not that outward thing , which it so often appears . Beneath a calm exterior she sometimes bears an heart full of disquietude and sorrow . Would you extend her the hand of gratulation ? Be first sure that you can discern the interior of her being . You may else admit sunbeams to a plant already scorched with heat , and demanding the waters of sympathy . Consider , too , that as are her griefs , such is her fortitude . Hence , without question , we sometimes regard her as bowed and overwhelmed by some worldly casualty , who has in her soul a power of endurance , that gives her angelic strength . We hear it affirmed that woman is naturally buoyant of spirit , that she is disposed to enjoy life , and look on its brighter aspects . Let this be conceded for truth ; what does it show , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his own delicate soul , tells us that " Cords , which vibrate sweetest pleasure , Thrill the deepest notes of woe . " So is it , that she who feels most keenly each pulsation of joy , is alive to corresponding tones of sorrow . The obtuse may receive less positive joy from the happy events that befall them ; but let us not forget that they suffer also less than the acutely sensitive . Says one of this sex , of a powerful mind , and a sagacious remarker , " I have seldom met with a truly cheerful-minded , and contented woman . " How should this be , unless the soul often loses its harmony , and then gives forth discordant notes , proportioned to its primitive melody ? We admire the Corinthian column . Its lightness and grace are replete with beauty . Yet , in the storms of this rude world , how often does it prove a fragile thing . The gayest smile on the fairest face preaches fearful susceptibilities of disappointment and grief . Woman is tried moreover by her natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her character can hardly be denied . She anticipates , in the day of health and happiness , more coming good , than man dares expect . Fancy creates round her a world of bliss . " Evermore her eye Is busy in the distance , shaping things That make her heart beat quick . " She dreams of golden gains , of victory , conquest , and triumph . The car of fortune bears her , amid gilded honors , with a subjugated world in her train . Or , do gloom and despondency come over her , imagination , not content with the cloud of to-day , summons from the deep , dark piles , that are charged with storm and tempest . Let her once begin , with high credit , to borrow trouble , and the future shall be well nigh drained of its myriad sorrows . She becomes fancy-bankrupt . An incident of recent occurrence , illustrates the transition from one to the opposite of these conditions . A young lady was seen wandering by the banks of the Hudson , wailing , and wringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion of this grief . A sister-in-law , to whose dwelling the death of her mother had compelled her to resort , had treated her so cruelly , that she had fled from her face , and had now no home or friend on earth . Touched with her troubles , a circle of generous spirits contributed a large sum to her relief . Such was the sudden ecstasy of her joy that she became actually frantic . Another trial of this sex springs from the want of interesting Objects of pursuits . The boy is no sooner arrived at his youth , than a world of occupations opens before him . He turns from his father 's roof and gives himself to preparation for some manly calling . A thousand scenes are daily in his path . Adventure , enterprise , the collision of men , and of interests , all rush in to fill his youthful spirit . In such courses trouble stands in his way but for an hour . The agitation and turmoil of life soon sweep from his bosom even the memory of yesterday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . Her school-day tasks completed , what great object comes in their stead ? She has a bounding pulse , high hopes , and ardent purposes . But whither shall they now be directed ? Will she not fancy the little sphere of home quite too contracted for her feelings and exertions ? In this position of the young woman , there is much of suffering , that springs from unexhausted feeling , and is wrought into acute pain . Let her beware of a morbid self-contemplation . Let her see that she do not expend on her own thoughts , desires , and feelings , that energy , which should be given to God , and her associates in humanity . What a foe must she now guard against . How high and glorious should be that great object , that is to receive the full strength of her interest . Woman is tried by her comparative Defencelessness in Public . She may hold opinions dear to her heart , and sound in themselves . These views may be unjustly assailed . Yet such is the sentiment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear as a public champion of her opinions , wrestling in the vulgar arena with man . Her character may be rudely aspersed ; but who does not feel that to defend it by lifting up her voice in tumultuous assemblies , or even to enter the lists with her pen , were derogatory to her sex . The law of the land may bear , in some instances , unjustly upon her . She may be deprived of natural rights . No one can deny that she did thus suffer , and was grievously oppressed , by the laws against Witchcraft , in the early history of New England . Nor is it impossible that taxation may wrong her ; that divorces may separate her , without right , from her partner ; that fines , imprisonment , and even capital punishment , may be visited iniquitously upon her . Still what evils , what a vast preponderance of harm , would accrue , on the whole , from her mingling in the affairs of legislation , and standing as an advocate at the bar . If man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whatever motive , shall trench on her God-given and inalienable rights , she must commit herself to that Being , who ever judgeth righteously . Another trial of this sex is one which I descant upon , in this place , with diffidence . Yet so severe are the sufferings , that spring , directly and remotely , from the exercise of her Affections , that I could not acquit myself of true fidelity , were I silent on this topic . By an appointment of Providence , woman is so constituted as to find her bane , or her blessing , pre-eminently in the interests of her heart . Her natural ardor , and strength of feeling , prompt her to place her affections on some object , with concentration and intensity . Nor is she exempt from that credulity , which usually accompanies an ardent temperament . Hence , the depths of her heart become often a fountain of disappointments , troubles , and sorrows . Her affections may be bestowed where they shall meet no requital . Perhaps this result was wholly unanticipated ; or , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been desired . Let the cause be of whatever description , the consequences are most trying to the female character . Man may throw off a grief thus occasioned by seeking new objects of interest . But woman must wear the iron round her very soul , and sometimes , only sits down , to weep , and sink in despondency . For such sorrow there is but one anodyne . No earthly solace can sustain a spirit thus stricken . In the destiny of her affections woman is , to a great degree , passive . She has little option left her . A negative , or affirmative reply , is all that shall decide the fortunes of her happiness through life . To how many desires , crosses , and reverses of feeling , to what painful indecision , or regretted decisions , is she thus exposed . Friends may induce the receipt of attentions , where her heart can not follow the assent of her lips . Perhaps her prospects have but assumed some certainty , when the promised hand is capriciously withdrawn . I have read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grief thus awakened , pursued the object of her regard into scenes of trouble , released him from prison , by her generous gifts , and attended him , when driven , by his guilty courses , to actual insanity . She , who thus conducts , is no summer friend . The blight of such sympathy is no ordinary calamity . Who is surprised , that untold sorrows , from this cause , should corrode the very springs of life ? Disappointed affection has a melancholy tale to relate , wherever are gathered the sad subjects of mental derangement . And blessed are those noble Institutions , which , by the power of Christianity , soothe the minds , and restore the reason , of those thus unhappily afflicted . The trials of Domestic Life impose no light burden upon woman . Those daily cares incident to the family , are a touch-stone of her patience , a test of her disposition , and an ordeal to her temper . She has petty disquietudes , and slight annoyances , singly unimportant , yet in amount not trivial . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attenuated by the accumulation of these minor troubles . Like the patient in the restlessness of fever , she needs some composing potion to allay , and give peace to , her soul . Again , the character , and deportment of each inmate in her household may present to her a trial . Self-denial must be practiced by some for the enjoyment of the remainder . How often does the lot fall upon her . The reputation of each near relative is another depository of her joys , or sorrows . Should he , whose position calls him to cherish and care for all beneath his roof , prove unkind , and selfish , and demand every arrangement to conform to his ease and appetites , on whom will the burden of the service required , be imposed ? Does he yield to temptation abroad , forsake the partner of his bosom , and give himself up to sensual and inebriating habits , there is one heart that must bleed over his sins . Honor and pride , it may be , forbid her disclosing his errors , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no support in this exigency ? What can the world give her , adequate to her fathomless wants ? But still heavier trials befall this sex in their homes . Sickness visits the loved . By the midnight lamp , the wife bathes an husband 's burning brow ; or the mother administers draughts to the parched lips of a daughter . To what fears is she then and there subject ? Tediously roll the long hours . Not the body alone sinks , but the spirit at length faints . For the conviction is forced on her mind that life is endangered . Suspicion yields to apprehension ; that again grows into argument . The physician shows signs of doubt ; friends whisper anxieties . Swayed for a season between hope and fear , at length , the dread certainty comes over her . She must part with this being , dear as her own life . The fatal stroke is near ; the hour arrives . Gone forever from mortal eyes is she , in whom blent " All images of comforter and friend , The fireside charmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , to the weary , wings . What shall console " The survivor ? To whom can we commend her who thus mourns the riven tie of a mother 's love ? Where is the solace for the dependent , affectionate female , who weeps over the ashes of a departed parent ? A sister is at her brother 's grave . Pleasant was their love , and who can assuage these bitter tears ? The husband ,  --  deepest of all life 's bereavements ,  --  perhaps it is he , for whom the funeral wail is now heard . What can time , and dust , and this tomb of earth , minister to her , who sits in the freshness of widowhood ? The catalogue of your trials , my friends , may seem to some already prolonged . But have I not left much unsaid ? Did you guide the pen , secrets of grief could be revealed , all unknown but to your sex . But enough has been written to persuade the thoughtful , that suffering must be to woman a thing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , never leave us as they found us . We are always either hardened , or improved , by the discipline of Providence . The question then with woman , what use she is making of her trials , is one of the deepest concern . She has peculiar griefs ; whence can she gain strength to endure them ? Woman needs every support that God has placed within her reach . She requires , first , Mental Culture . This will give her strength of mind , power to discern the true relations of our nature . A narrow mind can not comprehend the great scheme of Providence . If it submit to his will , there is still much blindness in the act . A fuller trust would come from enlarged conceptions of duty and life . She , who enjoys reading , can beguile many a sad hour , by a useful volume . How many are prostrated by domestic afflictions , for the want of that mental discipline , by which they might fix the eye of faith steadily on Heaven . The grave absorbs their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and contemplate the sainted spirit . Woman needs a Moral developement , corresponding to the demands of her peculiar temperament and dispositions . Her sensitive frame , unless accompanied by great self-control , will betray her into errors , which , added to the thorns that ever beset the path of human life , will cause her continual uneasiness and pain . Let fancy be the guiding faculty of her nature , and in what sins must she inevitably be involved . Its aerial flights will bear her above the beaten , common-sense , road of duty , and make her the prey of a fatal instability and its attendant mortifications , follies , and sorrows . Her acute feelings , and tender affections need a moral counterpoise . The sudden sickness of the loved will else overwhelm her , and unfit her for the service she owes them . In this world of casualties , if her heart be not braced by the power of good judgment , she will yield to disaster and grief , with a hopeless inefficiency . Her virtues must be the result of reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian dignity , a calm repose , that beautiful balance of character , in which keen sensibility is sustained by a patient and firm self-possession . So fortified , let her add one grace more and " The arched roof , * * * * * * By its own weight , stands steadfast and immovable . " We may not omit , in this connection , the influence of Friendship , as a soother of woman 's sorrows . Always susceptible of sympathy , and alive to the voices of kindred spirits , in her trials she feels their indispensable necessity . How are her affections knit to each relative , by adversity , disappointment , and death . In bereavement a family build , as it were , a single monument , each placing its tribute in the mournful structure . They lean on one another , and , thanks be to God , next to his own strong arm , there is none so dear in our grief , as that of a friend . Thanks for human love . " When cold storms Rack the worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a strength'ning charm , Next to the hope of heaven . " " The hope of heaven , " the prospects and supports of Religion , deep piety , these I name last , because they are the greatest , indeed , the only effectual solace , for the trials of woman . " Those wells of feeling , " says a female writer , " hidden in the soul , upon whose surface the slightest smile of affection falls , like sunlight , but whose very depths are stirred by the breath of unkindness , are too often unvisited by the kindly influence of kindred sympathies , and go wearing their own channels deeper , in silence and in secrecy , and in infinite bitterness ,  --  undermining health , happiness , the joy of life , and making existence one succession of burden-bearing days . It is in this species of blight , that that merciful and compassionate faith , whose words are , ' Come unto me , all ye that labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest , ' becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lights , in the darkness of sorrow ; but they will prove transient , the meteors of midnight . It is the Sun of righteousness alone , which can shed true peace on her troubled spirit . Jesus Christ was ' a man of sorrows , and acquainted with grief . ' He only can present to her , unfailing sources of consolation . She must follow him , and with him , ' glory in pursuing a path of steep ascent . ' " Let her set to her seal , that Religion , however received by man , is a gift which she can never , with impunity , decline . When piety presents its claims to the sterner sex , they raise doubts , and questionings , and comparisons with other goods . But woman may not hesitate for a moment . So does instinct teach us the fitness of female piety , that even the irreligious of our sex expect , and require , it in her . I can not but feel that the discipline of her trials was intended by Providence , to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was designed that her pliant affections should twine round our divine Father , as a pillar of enduring strength . In almost the earliest stage of her life , and onward to its latest hour , she is upheld by a little less than visible presence . Rescued by that Power in peril , enabled to pass through what was once her chief dread , how can she turn her eye off from him ? " God has ever supported and saved me . He will do it in future . " This language is a spontaneous utterance of the true woman . Thus , like Jesus , is she " made perfect through sufferings . " In this manner does religion become , with her , the medium of continual Improvement . Mental culture is one invaluable part of female education . The social graces are a chain of pearls about her neck . But her permanent being consists of a spiritual principle . Unless that be called into action she lives but an ephemeral life . Let her pious capabilities be awakened , let the love of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behest , be the joy of her heart , and she enters that path , which conducts , eternally , toward holiness in perfection . She who has a true reverence for her nature , and who comprehends the powers of her sex , will never rest content with present attainments . She will study , and unfold her intellect , because God hath endowed her with Mind , and his glory calls for her mental progress . Her domestic duties will be discharged in the love of Him , who " setteth the solitary in families . " No event will be lost on her watchful spirit . Each day 's cares and trials will nurture in her a new patience , benevolence , and active piety . Thus will she build up a character , resting , like the pyramid in the East , on a basis so broad , and of materials so solid and enduring , that the ages can not move its foundation . Chapter XIV . ENCOURAGEMENTS . What woman has done . Zenobia , Isabella , Pocahontas . The Catholics . Facilities for Improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illustrious catalogue . Constitutional Susceptibilities . Domestic Habits . Means . Self-observation . The Scriptures . Prayer . The life of the soul , how glorious . In approaching the conclusion of these Chapters , I can not doubt that some of my female friends will inquire , " Who is sufficient for these things . How is it possible for me to reach the high standard now set before me ? " We reply briefly , that the first thought to be presented in this place is , That you should contemplate what your sex has actually accomplished in the Past . The Scriptures , the oldest records of our race , contain a long catalogue of female names , illustrious for the virtuous and pious associations , that cluster around them . Greece and Rome abound in examples of women of intellectual , and sometimes , of moral , distinction . Zenobia , queen of the East , stands forth a pattern of excellence , in whom were combined an enlarged understanding , singular refinement , courage , prudence , and fortitude . Modern Europe has exhibited more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced that female , to whom the discovery of this continent might be almost directly traced , one who had rare talents and strength of mind , yet no arrogance , or despotism , like the renowned queen of England ; one " who possessed the grace , the gentleness , and feminine accomplishments , of Mary Stuart , without her weakness , who joined to Castalian pride , as a queen , extreme sensibility and softness of deportment , as a woman . " If we turn to the records of this country , we find , among the female portion of its aboriginal inhabitants , proofs of no despicable qualities . Looking at the red man 's race , who can fail of admiring the noble , self-denying spirit of Pocahontas , the friend of our fathers , the victim , in her prime , of civilized life ? Within the present century , when the men of the Mohawk tribe were debased by Intemperance , and embroiled in sanguinary wars with their brother Indians , the females called a council , by themselves , and so did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , to bring sobriety and peace within the borders of their people . Such being the power of Pagan woman , what might we not anticipate from this sex , where the mild gospel of Jesus had appeared ? It was for conscience ' sake that females , like the lady Arabella , left homes of peace and plenty , and often families of noble rank , and came to these shores with the Pilgrim band . How many of this sex once fled to this land , from the religious persecutions of France , and chose danger , privation , and death , rather than subscribe creeds hostile to their faith . What sacrifices have they made in the Catholic Church . The Convent may be the fruit of erroneous opinions , yet it has shown forth gloriously the power of woman . Such self-denial , such unwearied devotion to prayer and the ceremonies of a church , such offices of charity , furnish proofs of the moral capacity of this sex , misled as they often have been , on which the Protestant believer may dwell with grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be found in the general Facilities for Improvement in our age . Education is receiving more thought , than in any former period of the world . She , who desires it , can enjoy higher literary advantages , better instruction , more useful manuals , and other aids in the school-room , than were ever before possessed in any community . The pulpit is emitting new light for the spiritual man , and the press is redolent with a moral fragrance . Such is the progress of society , that conversation , social manners , and the incitements of example , now combine in furtherance of personal culture . Our Political Institutions present , likewise , eminent incentives to a higher self-training than has ever yet been witnessed . The republican principle not only gives scope for individual freedom of thought and action , but awakens associated effort . We have , hence , Female Societies for benevolent purposes , Maternal Associations to assist the female parent in her responsible tasks , and Young Ladies Circles for reading and intellectual sympathy and mutual enlightenment . These are a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an healthful atmosphere , and , associated as they are with the memory of their noble founders , they utter to woman the inspiring summons , " Through thy veins The blood of Heroes runs its race ! And nobly shouldst thou brook the chains That , for the virtuous , Life prepares , The fetters which the matron wears , The Patriot Mother 's weight of anxious cares . " The growing elevation of your sex in popular estimation should also encourage you , my friends , to untiring devotedness , and patient self-culture . She , who was once regarded as but the satellite of a proud planet , is now herself marked in the catalogue of heaven 's luminaries . Already are the names of Madam de Stael , Edgeworth , Jameson , Martineau , and Hemans , abroad , and of Sigourney , Sedgwick , Child , Lee , and others , in our own land , enrolled on this bright register . Nor is the moral advancement of woman less remarkable than her literary attainments . The Alcoran may exclude her from Paradise , and teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not literally , it has done this . But Christianity places her in the same high rank with man . She is an heir of the Redeemer 's kingdom . In the social edifice , she is viewed as the rich tracery of its massive frame-work ; the more graceful and delicate part , yet as essential to the completeness of the structure , as its giant pillars and solid masonry . In her Constitutional Susceptibilities woman should find motives for signal excellence . Philosophy teaches that sensibility alone will prompt to the kind offices of Christian beneficence . Why does man pass so often , in passive indifference , the helpless child of woe ? Because nature has not gifted him with a tender heart . He was formed to buffet the storms of public commotion . Extreme sensibility would have made him shrink from the encounter . But woman was endowed with a sensitive spirit , that she might feel for the sufferer , and an active imagination , to picture his troubles , and an ardent love , to relieve them . How can she fail of perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . St. Augustine calls hers the " devout sex . " And meet is the appellation . For her weakness teaches her to lean upon an Almighty arm ; and her trustfulness ,  --  so striking , that to doubt , suspect , and despond , come , in her , only from peculiar physical infirmity , or from a most erroneous education ,  --  leads her to confide in God . Add to these the earnest affection of this sex , and we have a moral predisposition to religious sentiment . To them is given a vantage ground , which they should joyfully and gratefully occupy . She , on whom the heavier burden is laid , is gifted with superior powers of endurance . Virtue is the prize of humanity , and she is placed nearer than man to its goal . Piety is the crown of our life , and for her brow is it pre-eminently fashioned . The divine Spirit , dwelling in all souls , is yet imaged to our minds , in Scripture , and in Nature , as " a still , small voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarly congenial to the soul of woman . Her Domestic Habits furnish the final encouragement of woman to constant self-improvement . In the sequestered paths of home , having hours and days , in which the needle is her quiet employer , how may she meditate on the touching and lofty themes of human concern . Why should she wander from the ways of truth , integrity , and purity ? She has her temptations it is true . In some situations they may be greater than man 's . But , taking our whole mortal existence , and the usual occupations of the sexes , it will hardly be denied , that woman may , if diligent in attention , hear those voices of admonition , which are drowned in man 's ear , by the world . She may enjoy seasons for communing with her soul , and surveying the riches of the interior world , and for estimating the vanity of sensual , and the glories of spiritual things , such as are seldom granted to man . She walks , ever , as it were , beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to proclaim his hallowed presence . Can she withdraw her eyes from it , and look downward , and become a servant of time ? Will she ,  --  will one thus nobly privileged ,  --  surrender her birth-right ? If she comprehends its value , she can not be other than an aspirant for the prize of life eternal . But how shall this prize be obtained ? Let the young woman understand that religion is not a strange thing , disconnected from this world , out of herself , and to be introduced by some mysterious influence . It is the unfolding of a principle within her . You must study self , and seek the kingdom of God in your own soul . There only will you ever find , and establish , it . Religion consists in giving the heart ,  --  this very heart which beats with emotion at the objects around you ,  --  unto spiritual pursuits . So directed , it will flow out on your fellow beings , and spring upward to the Father . Search the Scriptures . Use them chiefly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dwell on the writings of the Psalmist . They speak to human experience as few books , even in the sacred volume , address us . You will feel no joy , for which they have not the language to express your gratitude . No sorrow will so deluge your heart , that God will not , through them , send a holy wind , to assuage the waters . Peruse especially the life of Christ . There is your model , an incarnation of the Divinity . Rest not until you also have begun to grow in the image of God . Do you love what he loved ? Are you living as he lived ? Have you the same high purposes , to " please your Father , " and to " go about doing good ? " Pour out your soul before the Lord . Prayer is our spiritual aliment . It teaches us humility . For who can carry self-important and haughty feelings to the throne of Infinite Purity ? Prayer will teach you to see the hand of Providence in all that befalls you . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disturb and distress you . Submission is the fruit of devoutness . " Thy will be done , " be this your petition , and it will not only reconcile you to those overwhelming events , which would else prostrate you in the dust , but it will be a daily sedative amid the disquieting cares of your lot . And , though you feel burdened with guilt , do not restrain prayer before God . He is the friend of the penitent . Nor let a cold heart keep you back from this service . The habit of being instant in prayer is indispensable to salvation . Besides , who can tell that , even while you are speaking , the cloud will not roll off , and the face of your Father , a view of his love , deep , unutterable , and divine , and the sense of his precious presence , revisit your soul ? You are now in the prime of your being . Commence to-day the life of the soul , and you will enter on that course , which leads to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to it your noblest energies ? This world is but a passing shadow . Oh , do not consent to build your dwelling , as if the suns , that scorch and blast the soul , could not strike you . That Being , in whose hand is your breath , has placed you , for a few swift-winged years , on a vessel , propelled by fearful elements . In an hour you least imagine , that , which now bears you brightly onward , may burst its confines , and scatter on the wild waves the black fragments of all that is mortal . Yet fear not death ; FEAR LIFE . Live as you ought ; leave the rest with God . Calmly may you then lean on Him ; peacefully will you pass the strange ongoings of earth . Through tears , and through smiles , in the body , or parted from it , live as you ought , and heaven is gained . Wait upon the Lord , and while worldlings , living to earth 's pleasures , dead while they live , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you shall renew your strength ; you shall mount up with wings as eagles ; you shall run and not be weary , and you shall walk and not faint .
