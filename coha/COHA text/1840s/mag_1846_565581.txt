txt OUR criticisms hitherto have had respect to the subjects brought to view in Mr. Hetheringtor* 's hook . We will now speak briefly of the merits of the work itself . We gi*1e Mr. H. the praise ( and in these days it is no slight encomium ) of having ma ( le a book for the legitimate end of bookmaking . He evidently aims at having his book read and not merely sold . He is looking , not at the pockets of men , but at their minds . He is more concerned to have gold in his book , than gold-leaf on it . Its place is not on the parlor table , but on the study table . And he has given us materials for thought , on which a wakeful mind may dwell long and profitably . And we must commend the clearness and order , with which the facts and principles , embraced in a tangled discusssion of five years continuance , are brought distinctly before the mind of the reader . We rejoice also , to perceive that warm attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a true disciple , and admirer of John Knox . Such qualities as these demand our commendation . But there are some features of the work , which require an equally significant censure . Mr. Hetherington is not disenthralled from some principles , which , * Continued from page 264. we had supposed , spiritual Christians would agree to consider obsolete . He is evidently in favor of a national church , having a coercive power over its subjects , and inflicting pains and penalties on the disobedient . He attempts to show , that the Independents at one time , admitted what the Presbyterians claimed- " power and authority from Christ , in the Presbytery , to call the ministers and elders , or any in their bounds , before them , to account for any offense in life or doctrine , to try and examine the cause ,  --  to admonish and rebuke ; and if they be obstinate , to declare them as heathens and publicans , and give them over to the punishment of the magistrates . " And he speaks of points of government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction of the civil authority , for their full efficiency . " Lie also opposes , directly , the principle of requiring personal religion , as a necessary qualification for church membership . This system , he says , " tended to encourage spiritual pride in those , who , in being admitted , were recognized as truly regenerated persons . " Mr. H. , we believe , is now a minister of the Free Church of Scotland . Is the communion of that church open alike to regenerate and unregenerate men , making no distinction between the precious and the vile ? We can apologize for such sentiments in the mcii of 1647 . They belong to the darkness of that // age . But when we find an evangelical minister of our own day , gravely arguing for such principles , we feel inclined to ask him if he does not believe that the earth is a broad plain in the center of the universe , and that the sun and stars revolve around it . He betrays also , to our apprehension , an overweening fondness for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vindicating the principles of his denomination . It was natural for him to do so , and it was right . If a man does not think his own distinctive principles worthy of being maintained ; if he does not grow fervent , and even eloquent in pleading for them ; it costs us some stretch of charity , to believe he has any principles . There is no feature in the history of the period , concerning which Mr. H. writes , which compels our admiration more than the downright earnestness with which the different parties maintained their respective peculiarities . It does not impair our confidence in a man 's piety , nor respect for his intellect , to find that he puts an high estimate on the distinctive principles of his denomination , whatever it may be . It rather indicates a strong adherence to religious principle , which we can not but reverence , even when we consider it a mistaken principle . We are far from being displeased to find Mr. H. , even as a historian , eager to prove that Presbyterianism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are far from being dipleased , to find an Episcopalian eager to prove , that Episcopacy is right , and will bear to be tested by Scripture ; ' nor would we be , although he should carry the argument even to the fashion of the surplice and the lighting of six wax candles . But our complaint of Mr. H. is , that his zeal for Presbytery disturbs the course of fair historical narration . Over and again he boasts of the overwhelming force of the arguments , advanced in behalf of Presbyterian peculiarities , although , when he gives us examples of such arguments , we are quite unable to discover wherein their overwhelming potency consists , and when he sees fit to withhold them , we strongly suspect , that , if not designedly , it was at least , prudently done . We are afraid of the historian , who seems resolved to raise the shout of victory , always on one side , even before he lets us see the positions of the conflicting parties . The professed controversalist , is expected to claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . But it is incumbent on the historian to lay the facts and arguments before his readers , and leave them to judge of the merits of the case . He is a witness , and we do not care to see a witness on the judge 's bench . We think that Mr. Jletherington 's unchastened zeal for high Presbyterianism , will impair the force of his testimony as an historian . We think him amenable to criticism also , in another respect , and that of a more serious character . He betrays a disposition to asperse the characters of those whose principles he disapproves . He says hard things of the Erastians , especially those in the Parliament , and , in our judgment , without any reason . The Westminster Assembly was called by the voice of Parliament , and obeyed that call , acting in professed subjection to the authority , by which it was constituted ; and yet , in the result , it aimed to set up a system of government by the side of the civil government , extending its power over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every living soul in it , which should he , in its operation , wholly independent of the civil magistrate . The Erastians insisted , that the subjects should have the privilege of a final appeal to Parliament . As our author himself informs us , " the kingdom had // suffered so much severe and protracted injury , from the usurped authority and power of the prelates , that the assertors of civil liberty almost instinctively shrunk from even the shadow of any kind of power , in the hands of ecclesiastics . " And , verily , we think these Erastians were in the right , so far as there could be any right , in such an unhallowed alliance . If a church claims to be established by law , and to govern a nation by force , and to_the he maintained at the expense of the state , then it ought , in all reason , to be in subjection to the power that gives it its being . An established church is , of course , and ever must be , an Erastian church , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom , is to renounce its alliance with the state , and trust in its spiritual head , whose kingdom is not of this world . We regard the hard sayings of Mr. H. against the Erastians , therefore , as altogether unreasonable . But , the independents are treated with still greater injustice , and the more glaringly so , as the author himself acknowledges them to be men of considerable talent and learning , and of undoubted piety . " Such expressions as , " disingenuous , " " duplicity , " " intriguing policy , " " pertinacious obstinacy , " do not fall like sweet tones of heavenly music upon the ear , when used of men " highly esteemed for their piety and talents . " But we especially think Mr. H. guilty of injustice to the Independents of the Assembly , in respect to the very transaction in which he finds occasion for the loudest condemnation . When it became evident , that the Assembly were determined to make Presbytery , in its most rigid peculiarities , an establishment in England , and of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parliament , giving a short account of their principles , and asking a toler ation . In this paper , there was not a single harsh expression . It had , as Mr. H. well describes it , " a calm , plausible and stately tone , " and yet he asserts , that through this , " a bitter warfare was begun by the Independents , and that they are justly chargeable with all the consequences of the fatal feud ; " and he elsewhere terms it " that most ill-omened production . " But we would like to ask , wherein consisted the atrocious wickedness of these men ? A church establishment was about to be put on the throne , which thing was directly opposed to some of their own settled principles . They had no good reason to expect any toleration from that eslablishment. * Mr. H. acknowledges , that the Presbyterians , " were led to regard with considerable distrust , the requests of the Independents for toleration , and that they were excited to use the language of intolerance ; " and we learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty with the king , " they insisted on Presbyterian uniformity , without making the least provission for liberty of conscience . And Mr. Baxter acknowledges that " the Presbyterian ministers were so little sensible of their own infirmity , that they would not have them tolerated , who were not only tolerable , but worthy instru* meats , and members in the churches . " In this exigency , what were the Independents to do ? One of three thirigs ,  --  either to stifle the voice of their own consciences , and submit to the establishment ; or " be punished as sectaries , and driven out of the land , " as those in the army were explicitly told they should be ; or finally to appeal to the Par- * While the Assernhly was yet in the midst of its discussions , Mr. Goodwin , one of the most prominent of those five Independents , was ejected from his liv . ing , for refusing ha ptism and the Lord 's Supper to all the people in his parish , indiscriminately. - See . JVeal 's Hist. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liament , and ask for a toleration They took the last named course , pursuing as they declare , " no other design , but a subsistence , be it the poorest , and meanest , in their own land , with the enjoyment of the ordinances of Christ , as not knowing wht4e else , with safety , health and livelihood , to set their feet on earth . " This was their offense . That the eager partisans of the day should have attempted a " most ungracious refutation of their main position , " is not strange ; hut that a good evangelical minister of a persecuted church , in the nineteenth century , should attempt for such an act , to stamp infamy upon the characters of acknowledged christian brethren , on the page of history , we marvel and we mourn . XATe find reason to marvel also , at the aspersions cast upon the churches of New- England , where he says , " the Independents showed themselves to be as intolerant as any of their opponents , " adding too-in such a connexion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , " that they would not admit Presbyterians to communion with them , unless they were willing to abandon Presbyterianism , and become Congregationalists ; " and again , that " the ecclesiastical system introduced into New England , was found to be absolutely incompatible with the peace and good order of society . " Truly , we should marvel at such statements , if we had not found so many calumnious rel ) orts concerning the New England fathers current in our own country , and circulating among their own children . We can readily forgive a foreigner , for saying what he and every other intelligent man ought to know to be false . We hope that the substantial sympathy manifested in New England for his own noble church in the day of her need , will constrain Mr. H. to read the history of Congregationalism with a little more care , and to write of it with somewhat more candor . At this point , our review of the work before us might be terminated ; but there are some matters suggested by a glance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this connexion . A brief review of the tremendous concussions of these conflicting systems , must give an interest to the inquiry , as to what was the real nature of the ecclesiastical government which was contended for in those days ? Mr. Hetherington objects to the plan of the Independents , as tame and inefficient , alledging that " they practically admitted no censure , hut admonition , " and that " that can not properly be called excommunication , which consisted , not in expelling from their body an obstinate offender , hut in withdrawing themselves from him . " What more was considered necessary to constitute an efficient church government , we learn from other sources . Mr. Neal infbrms us , that the Independents , in the Westminster Assembly , objected to the high powers claimed by the Presbyteries , and gives as an example , " the right of admission , and exclusion from the Christian church , with pains and penalties . " Mr. Baxter gives us further information . " I disliked , " he says , " the course of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of Prelacy , by grasping at a kind of secular power , not using it themselves , but binding the magistrates to confiscate , or imprison men , merely because they were excommunicated , and so corrupting the true discipline of the church , and turning the communion of the saints into the communion of the multitude , that must keep in the church against their wills , for fear of being undone in the world . " Truly , this is a sad account to be given of those good men ; and that by one of their admirers ; and we should be ready with a loud voice // of condemnation , were it not for the recollection , that even this was a system of dove-like gentleness , in comparison with that for which it was to have been substituted ; and that the emergence , even of great minds from midnight darkness , into the light of perfect day , is almost of necessity , gradual . The Assembly proposed to abandon a vast amount of ecclesiastical power . Among other things , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the cognizance and examination of all capital offences , shall be reserved entire to the magistrate ; " and again , that " the Presbytery or eldership shall not have cognizance of anything relating to contracts , payments , or demands , or of any matter of conveyance , title , interest or property , in lands or goods . " These concessions will show , to some extent , what was understood by ecclesiastical government , under the dominion of the bishops . Accordingly we are informed by Neal , that at some periods , as much business was transacted in the ecclesiastical , as in the civil courts ; and the boasted successors of the apostles , in whom resides " the sole power of government , " were accustomed to feed the flock , over which they claimed that the Holy Ghost had made them overseers , by confiscating the estates of ministers and people , by cropping their ears , locking them up in the dungeons of the Fleet , and of other prisons , for years together , without trial , to die of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlived all this , to browbeat them in their Episcopal courts , to entangle them by an inquisitorial examination , and then , often without the testimony of a single witness , to heap upon them the severest and most ignominious punishments . This was the nature of church government , in the days of Whitgift and Bancroft and Laud . The Presbyterians said to this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; and we are dis posed to censure them sparingly , if , having done this , they still left here and there a mole-hill . And yet , we can not sympathize with Mr. H. in complaining of the Parliament for their watchful jealousy of the Presbyterial claims . When they had brought Dr. Leighton out of his prison , and had gathered around him with burning souls , to wonder at the sight of the man whose ears had been sheared off , and whose nose had been gashed open on each side , and whose cheeks had been branded with a red-hot iron , and whose back had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame was worn out with disease induced by a ten years ' incarceration , and all for having dared to utter the convictions of an ardent mind respecting the conduct of his ecclesiastical rulers , we do not wonder at the determination of the high-son led men in the Long Parliament , never to put it in the power of ecclesiastical rulers of whatever name , to imitate , even in a very humble degree , the enormities of this hierarchical flock-feeding . We honor those statesmen for assuming the power they did assume over the church . This brings us directly to the question , how far the embarrassments and persecutions , to which the Christian church has been subjected by civil governments , have been caused by unscriptural features in the organization of the church itself . We know well , that for many ages , civil rulers were engaged in a constant , and , much of the time , in an unsuccessful struggle , to preserve their own prerogatives from the encroachment of the ecclesiastical powers . It was , then , perfectly natural , that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bind , with fetters of iron , the enemy that they had encountered in so desperate a struggle . And the result would be , to give up the church into the hands of those men , who would be most unscrupulously submissive // to the will of their masters ; and *vherever there was a living , conscience , and a heart panting after the liberty of the children of God , there would be felt the galling of the iron chain . The claim of the soul to be governed by the words of Christ , would be mistaken for a rebellious purpose to be no longer subject to the civil authority ; and the annihilation of men 's consciences would be regarded as th' preeminent duty of the civil ruler , If there is any truth in this view of the subject , it forcibly suggests to us the further question , whether a large compact ecclesiastical organization is not necessarily fitted to attract the jealousy , and , unless linked in with the state , the hostility , of the civil government . When the decree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into a thousand ramifications , reaching the hearth-stone , and the conscience too , of the humblest and the most remote member of that great confederation , it is a power not to be despised . It is a power not to be overlooked , by the rulers of this world , whether they rule under the shadow of the throne , or under that of the ballot-box . And what is to be expected , hut that such civil rulers will either bribe such a church into a state of harlotry , as in England , or persecute it into a state of outlawry , as in Scotland ? Will not thinking men be led to inquire , whether these dangers might not be avoided by suffering the Christian church to take an unpretending form , its multiplied congregations being left , each to move in its own quiet sphere , and bound together by no other ties than those of mutual fellowship and love . We might have suggested , as one probable reason for the high tone of church government which the Assernbly proposed , the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , into which they expected it to be incor pointed . The history of the Christian world shows a tendency , both in the civil and ecclesiastical governments of a people , to assume a mutual resemblance to each other . Taylor , in his Natural History of Society , asserts that the Greek and Latin churches both took their forms of government from the political forms , by which they were surrounded . And the prevalent argument urged in the presence of monarchs , in behalf of the English hierarchy , was its adaptation to operate , in harmony with absolute monarchy . This argument made a proselyte of James First , from his early Presbyterian principles . Under the direction of Archbishop Laud , the wholehearted sons of the English church preached , as the two cardinal doctrines of religion , passive obedience to the bishop , and passive obedience to the king . " They were employed to prove , that the absolute submission of subjects to the royal will and pleasure , was authoritatively taught in the Holy Scriptures . " These doctrines were of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Such men were inevitably alienated from the church that taught them . Yet they still believed in the divine right of monarchy to exercise dominion in its appropriate sphere , and under measurable restraints ; but they would have a predominating influence given to parliament . And by this process arose the Presbyterian system . The Independents found themselves constantly tending towards republican views . IRapin says , " They abhorred monarchy , and approved of none but a republican government . " To them is generally ascribed the introduction of the commonwealth in England ; and beyond all doubt , anti-prelatical principles and republican principles , are mutually cause and effect in this country . There was much significancy in the saying of Archbishop Whitgift , that the // government of the church must he according to the form of government in the commonwealth . A correspondence between the two , there certainly xviii be , to n great extent . And it is a question of some interest , which is the cause , and which is the effect . It is a question , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems of church polity are struggling for the preeminence . Now , it is unquestionable matter of history , that the Puritans , for a long time , professed an entire and willing submission to the royal authority in civil affairs , while they strenuously claimed exemption from the domination of the bishops . And it is equally certain , that political puritanism was the offspring of religious puritanism . Men endured patiently the oppression of the magistrate , long after they revolted against the oppression of the church . As a matter of fact , then , religious liberty was recognized , as a right , and contended for , quite in advance of any claim set up for more civil liberty . And on this point , the decision of philosophy corresponds . with the testimony of history . Civil liberty is a matter of inference from the great principles of the Bible . Religious liberty is proclaimed in the most express terms , and is essential to the fulfillment of Christian obligations . " Be not servants of men . " And thus , while civil liberty affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort of men 's lives , religious liberty is indispensable for the discharge of their most sacred duties . The deepest convictions of conscience drive religious men to resist the decrees of ecclesiastical tyrants , who command them to sin against God . And men , who fear God , will take submissively , if not joyfully , the spoiling of their goods ; and yet go to the stake , rather than take the spoiling of their consciences . And thus , in the ordinary course of things , religious liberty comes first in the order of nature , and in the order of time ; and civil liberty follows in its train ; although it is not to be questioned , that the latter also reflects a powerful influence on the former . But we proceed to remark further , that , not only the forms of ecclesiastical polity , but the practical workincr of those forms , will , in a degree , a correspond with the forms of civil government and the state of society , with which they are in contact . The ecclesiastical systems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of the Long Parliament , are , neither of them , at this day , and in this land , what they were two centuries ago , at Westminster and at Lambeth . The Presbyterian church desires now no aid of the magistrate , to enforce its discipline by the terrors of confiscation and imprisonment . Every where in this country , the received doctrine of that church is , that a spiritual regeneration is an indispensable qualification for admission into the church ; one of the very doctrines for which the Independents at Westminster suffered reproach from their brethrer* . The will of the brotherhood is , in some sort , acknowledged to be an element of power , in the administration of its concerns . And its republican heart gives many signs of impatience , under the rule of elders , holding the keys for life . Rotation in office , which is the established rule in civil life , is beginning to be demanded in the church . These democratic tendencies in the Presbyterian church , have been ascribed to a New England influence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather the spontaneous movemeats of intelligent minds , expanding under the influence of republican institutions . The Episcopal church , also , has become modified in this country , by its contact with republican forms . Its bishops , claiming , by divine right , the sole power of government , are // fain to ask the sanction to important measures , even of a lay representation , in their great convocations . How scandalized would the " martyred Laud " have been , at the proposal of so unapostolic a measure ? rhe wishes of the people are consulted , also , in the appointment of their spiritual guides ; an innovation so great , that , when the Puritans made the like proposal , in the palmy days of hierarchical domination , it was treated as an intolerable impertinence . " The Episcopal church harmonizes completely with the freest civil institutions . Let any one sit down and examine the governrnent of the Episcopal church , in this country , and he will , if unacquainted with the subject , be surprised to find what a model of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entitled " Reasons why I am a churchman , " in flat contradiction to the wise men of the days of James the First , who made that Solomon believe in " the excellence of the English hierarchy , as best suited for a monarchical government . " Episcopacy is here avowedly opposed to Romanism . " No union with Rome , " says Dr. Jarvis . And says the pamphlet just named , " Let the charge never again be made , that the Episcopal church does not essentially differ from Romanism . " Both these sayings are absolute heresies , if measured by the Laudean standard . " I confess , " says that distinguished prelate , " I have often wished a reconciliation between the churches of England and Rome . Our religion and theirs is one in essentials . " The Episcopal church here , allows that dissenters may possibly be saved by the uncovenanted mercies of God ; whereas " Laud and Neill thought that there was no salvation for Protestants , out of the church of England . " La this country , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ministers capable of preparing their own discourses , thus rendering almost obsolete the book of homilies , which Cranmer caused to be prepared for the use of clergymen , whose best qualification for their office , was the ability to read the homilies put into their hands. * The Prayer-book , which was provided very considerately for those who were wholly incapable of composing decent and appropriate prayers for their own use , in those days of ignorance , is still retained in the American church ; and yet , we believe , that on some occasions , its ablest and best ministers lay aside the form , and pour forth the unrestrained gushing of their own hearts unto God . And the ruling spirits of that denomination having now the charity to allow the Christian name , and to make the proffer of fraternal fellowship to a church that worships the Virgin Mary , under the guidance of the three orders , it can not require a very great advance of liberality , to recognize , as Christian churches , those that worship God , in spirit and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs , that the spirit of American liberty can not be excluded even from the stereotyped religion of reverend antiquity . * We have the authority of Brande 's Encyclopedia for saying , that , " up to the fifth century the practice of preaching was confined to the bishops , and that the only homilies extant are of their composition . ' It seems , that to them belonged the sole power of instruction as well as of government , and thus primitive Episcopacy would make the second and third orders of no earthly use , but to echo the solemn voice of their bishop . They would , then , need but little higher qualifications , than many of those orders possessed in the days of Elizabeth , who could read , indeed , but in a very indifferent manner , arid " were such poor scholars , that many of them could hardly write their names ; " so that " in the county of Cornwall there were one hundred and forty clergymen , not one of whom was capable of preaching a sermon . // Even Puseyism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pilgrims , eats its own fundamental principle , by calling in question the decisions , given under apostolical authority , of its own orthodox bishops . We do not wonder , that these tendencies towards Christian liberty in the Episcopal church , should alarm a certain class of her membersnamely , the madmen , who adore despotism , and sigh for the dark ages ; but to reverse the motion of the world , and make the sun go backward ten degrees , as on the dial of Ahaz , and so to lead their church back to its iron age , will cost them no playful effort . The deep tide of Popery will soon meet them , and swallow them up . With so many men of such a cast , in its bosom , the Episcopal church in this country , is verily in a strait betwixt two . Its position in a land of freedom and light , must compel it , either to go backward , fraternizing with the Laudean principles of bishop Southgate and the Armenian Patriarch , and ultimately annihilating itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking a modest place among the sisterhood of Bible-teaching churches . That it will choose the latter alternative , notwithstanding its present vibrations , we are still inclined to hope . But not on Protestant churches alone , has civil liberty , together with the state of society it cherishes , a liberalizing influence . Even the immutable church of Rome feels its effect . Intelligence , discussion , habits of independent action , are altogether unfavorable to its grossest impostures , and its most arbitrary exactions . It is forced to hide its saints ' bones and seamless coats , and to disclaim the power to work miracles and to forgive sins ; and to deny its hostility to the Bible , and to the instruction of the people . Its tyranny over its subjects is thus greatly abated ; and its iron rule being once relaxed , all the impulses generated by civil liberty , will combine to perpetuate among the people the advantages once possessed . If republican freedom is preserved in this country , Popery in America will never be the same thing with Popery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will of parish priests ; and it will require but another breath of the air of freedom , to embolden these wardens to dispute the sovereign decrees of bishops and of popes . Thus powerfully do the forms and the spirit of civil and ecclesiastical organizations , tend to assimilate to each other . If our religious principles are conformed to the Scripture , they will secure our civil liberty ; and if our civil liberty is perpetuated , we shall be in no great danger of ecclesiastical despotism . The men who can trample upon a throne , will not turn pale before a mitre . These last remarks strongly invite us to inquire what , in general , are the prospects of the Christian world , with respect to the religious principles and organizations in which the welfare of mankind is so essentially involved . Mr. Hetherington observes , that " all human events move in revolving circles . " Are then all the controversies , the efforts , the toils , the sufferings , of one generation , only to bring the human family around to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are our grandchildren only to stand at the same point in the circle , where our grandfathers stood ? Is the moral world , like the earth on its axis , only to move round in an eternal revolution ? We do not so understand the signs of the times . The movement of human society , in its religious as well as in its civil and social aspects , is not circular , but spiral . It goes round the cycle , but , at every successive revolution , it reaches a higher position than that from which it began . In the progress of that cycle , which has come // round since the calling of the Westminster Assembly , several objects have been accomplished , of great value to the welfare of society . In the first place , the truth of certain great principles has taken hold of the convictions of men , so that those principles now hold the throne , and are to work out their effect upon the world . Among these great principles , a prominent one is this , that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without exposure to punishment on account of it . This doctrine was never acknowledged to any extent , until after the days of the Westminster Assembly . Even the good Richard Baxter expressed his utter abhorrence of unlimited toleration in religion . " The Independents , " according to Mr. Hume , " were the first , who , alike in their adversity and in their prosperity , always adopted the principle of toleration . " The testimony of Rev. Johnson Grant , an English Episcopalian and historian , is , that " all the world will allow , that in point of religious liberty , their conduct when in power , fulfilled the promises made when they were in obscurity . " This doctrine was wrought out , if we may so speak , in the tortures of the martyrs ; in the fires of Smithfield , and the jails of Newgate and of Bedford . But the human mind has at length firmly grasped it ; and to question the right of any man now to choose his own form of religion , under his responsibility to God alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigotry . Freedom to worship God , belongs now among the first principles in the science of human rights . Another great principle , which is taking fast hold of the convictions of men , is , that ecclesiastical organization may exist , disconnected from the control of the state . The great controversy for a long time was , whether ecclesiastical rulers should have preeminence above civil rulers . That was the claim of the papists . After this came the question , whether civil rulers should control the doings of ecclesiastical officers and churches , as such , in the administration of their religious affairs . That principle made religion the creature of the civil government , and took its heart out of it . It is a vast advantage gained to the world , when religion is left to act free and unincumbered , in its own sphere ; to convey life and*salvation to men by its own divine energy . Again , the question of the irresponsible divine right of kings , is now settled forever . Ten years after the dissolution of the Westminster Assembly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Second , with . out the slightest guaranty for their civil or religious rights , although they well knew him to be a bigot and a tyrant , and many of them fully expected to be persecuted , and grotind to the dust by his vindictive cruelty . And yet they thus received him , and laid their bleeding country under his heel , because they thought that the son of a king had a divine right to reign , whatever miseries might be endured by the oppressed people ; and that to defend the rights of man kind against royal oppression , or the religion of Jesus Christ a *inst royal persecution , would be rebellion against God . This puerile superstition the human mind has now generally thrown off . Such an event as the restoration of the Stuart family , in such circumstances ; an event so disastrous beyond all computation to the interests of religion and human happiness , will never take place again while the world shall stand . Christians will be subject to the civil government under which they shall live , whatever may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will they feel bound in conscience , spontaneously to offer their own necks to the bloody sword , either of civil // or ecclesiastical despots . It is coming to be an axiom in the world , not that people exist for the sake of rulers , but that rulers exist for the sake of the people . It is a great triumph of human nature over its chains , when the principle is irrevocably established , that royal prerogative can never have the right to prevail against human happiness . The irresistible force of this great truth is moving steadily onward , to emancipate the nations . And in connexion with the prevalence of these and kindred principles , we are to observe the fact , that power , both in civil and ecclesiastical affairs , has gone down , and is steadily going down , more and more , among the people . Either in form , or , at least , in effect , in every church , and in every state , that deserves a name in the civilized world ; the voice of the people is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicitude , in the decision of great questions . It is not hereafter to be determined in the palaces of Archbishops , and at the council tables of princes , what the millions shall believe , and how the millions shall worship ; but it is to be determined by the recitations of the sabbath-school , and the reflections of the closet , and the discussions of the fireside , how the church shall be organized , and how the Jaws shall be administered . The millions are to be elevated in the scale of existence ; and to have it in their power to provide for their own security , and social and moral welfare . And to crown all these other advantages , the means of obtaining and spreading abroad useful knowledge , are vastly increased . The tyrannous policy of using the press to spread abroad falsehood , and of silencing it when it would speak the truth , will no more be endured in the Protestant world ; nor will it long be endured any where . A man may reveal to the world the infamous intrigues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelations hewed off by the hangman , like that of John Stubs , in the days of Elizabeth ; or he may discuss the doctrine of the apostolic succession , without being sentenced to death , and then left to perish with want in a loathsome dungeon , like John Udal , under the pastoral supervision of Arch bishop Whitgift . Human advancement can not now be kept back , by licensing error , and chaining the truth . And as surely as the art of printing can never be lost , so surely no revolution of human affairs can ever carry the world back again to the state it wa* in , before knowledge began , by this means , to be extensively increased . These are some of the advantages , which the last revolution of the cycle , of which Mr. Hetherington speaks , has given us for the advancement of the social and religious well-being of mankind . The movement in future , may be much slower than we could wish ; for the light of knowledge is not like the light of the rising sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the causes exist , which make it absolutely certain , that the movements of the world will never bring it back again to the condition of past ages ; nor is it in the power of the mighty , to arrest its onward progress . All princes , and all prelates , may take up the words of the wise king of Prussia and say , " PROGRESS is stronger than I am . " The generations to come , will behold vast and splendid revelations . Society will be disenthralled from the chains that have impeded its onward movement . Religion will strip itself of the deformities , which the man of sin has bound around it , and , in its native beauty , will become the admiration of the whole world .

It appears from the Journal of the Grand Lodge of the U. S. that the fraternity in this country , in a correspondence had with the parent society , preferred an humble request , that official infor // mation should be communicated to the order in this country , respecting the origin of this worthy institution . Their words were ,  --  " No matter how humble or obscure may have been its beginning-no matter for what purpose instituted-let us have the period and circumstances of its origin , that it may be preserved in the archives of the order in America . We are neither ashamed nor unwilling to expose to the public gaze what we have been , since we are prepared to exhibit what we are ; and thus , by instituting the comparison , claim the rank among the benefactors of mankind to which our works justly entitle us . " From another communication , addressed to the same society , we learn that the brotherhood in this country , had a tradition that the order originated with some few persons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchester in England . And it is further , and properly remarked , that if it should prove true , as tradition intimated , that the Association had a mean origin ; still , some authentic knowledge of the fact is to be desired , inasmuch as the truth in the case , will only serve to increase their estimation of the nature and claims of an order , which has advanced so rapidly , from the lowest to the most dignified position in public estimation . But the parent society seems to have been very wary in this matter ; and in reply to their humble and fervent petition , endeavors to amuse them with some fanciful and fictitious history of the time , place and circumstances in which the order sprang into existence . What is somewhat singular in this connexion , is that the individuals in this country who formerly belonged to Manchester Unity itself , and who might be supposed to have had free access to the book of Records , were not able to furnish the fraternity with any official , or reliable account , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country existed in detached associations , in the cities of Boston , New York , and Baltimore , antecedent to the close of the last , or early in the commencement of the present , centuryThese obscure and independent associations of Odd-fellows , were composed chiefly , of the members of the order coming from England ; but the order had no noticeable being as a growing fraternity , until one Thomas Wildey , living in the city of Baltimore , entered seriously upon the work of making it a widely extended society . For this purpose , he issued an invitation , in the papers of the day , for the members of the order to meet at the house of Win . Lupton , " sign of the seven stars , " in the city of Baltimore , in which place , on the 26th day of April , 1819 , he proceeded , as N. G. or Noble Grand , to constitute , " Washington Lodge , No. 1 . , , Through the untiring zeal , energy and wisdom of Mr. Wildey , who is commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " old associations were speedily revived or new ones formed , in Boston , New York , Philadelphia , and Charleston-as also in some of the smaller cities of this country . The growth of the order , was very limited for some years-few persons joining it , except emigrant Englishmen . This resulted , no doubt , from the high and extended position maintained at that period of time , by the fraternity of " worthy and accepted masons . " For a time , Odd-fellowship was overshadowed by the Masonic order ; but when , upon the death of Morgan , this institution exploded and was broken into pieces , the new order soon bad the ground entirely unoccupied , and had a clear course , for running in the race of public favor . But this order experienced the shock of the explosion of Masonry , and suffered not a little from the violent antipathy excited in the public mind by the revelations of // those who seceded from the Masonic order . In the states of New York and Massachusetts , the fraternity was much divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors of Mr. Wildey and his associates , the order was resuscitated in a measure ; and as the popular excitement against Masonry declined , this new order began to grow with great rnpidity . In 18 ' 22 , the Grand Lodge of the United States was duly organized in the city of Baltimore , when the order assumed the aspect which , with some slight modifications , continues to the present time . In 1833 , a Constitution and system of By-laws were adopted by this superior association . In 1841 , an act of incorporation was obtained from the General Assembly of Maryland , allowing the body to " hold or possess property , real , personal or mixed , not exceeding in annual value the sum of twenty thousand dollars . " At the close of the year ending June 30 , 1845 , the Grand Lodge of the U. S. , report the existence of 686 minor Lodges spread over the face of the country in the following manner . In the state of Maryland , 26 minor Lodges ; Mass. , 78 ; N. Y. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 ; Del. , 5 ; Ohio , 34 ; Louia. , 6 ; N.

Island , 9 ; N. Hampshire , 11 ; Michigan , 9 ; Arkansas , 1 ; Iowa , 4 ; Wisconsin , 3 ; Florida , 2 ; Vermont , 2 ; Province of Canada , 5 . Total number of Lodges 686 ,  --  including not far from 100,000 members , of whom 22,894 , were initiated during the year then closed . The revenue of these several lodges during the same year , was $455,977 , from which there was paid for the relief of Brothers $98,179-for Widows and families $10,072-for the education of orphans $3,285-for burying the dead $13,820-total $125,361-which deducted from the revenue $455,977 , leaves a balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , or to be expended in other ways than those specified in the reports . From the foregoing statements , it will be seen ihat the order has extended itself with unexampled rapidity , and has command of a large amount of pecuniary interest . The wonderful success which has hitherto attended the labors of the friends of this Institution , is to be attributed chiefly to the dismemberment of most of the Lodges of the Masonic order  --  the reaction in the public mind , consequent upon the subsidence of the antimasonic excitement ; and the efforts made to allay public suspicion , respecting the new order , by giving publicity to the several constitutions and by-laws of the minor associations . There is an appearance of frankness , in suffering the public to know all that it seems expedient should be known . By this means , the antipathy to secret associations has been partly obviated . The success attending the labors of the friends of this order , has given rise , within a short time , to the formation of the order of Rechabites , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are secret societies , based on the principle of total abstinence from intoxicating drinks . It appears from the names given to the officers in these secret temperance societies , that they have abstracted from the order of Odd-fellows , ( to which no doubt some , if not all , of the original members belonged , ) some important matters respecting the form of the initiation of members , and the installation of officers . In a recent address , made by a right worthy and Reverend member of the order of the Sons of Temperance , in a neighboring city , before the association gathered in that place , it is stated that " within less than four years there have been estab // lished in twenty-three states of the Union , more than six hundred and fifty divisions of the order , endosing within these sentry guarded palladiurns , near 50,000 members . Half of this membership , and twothirds of this number of divisions have been the increase of the past year . " * From the best information had , it would appear , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for feasting and Bacchanalian revelry . in process of time , it was found that this practice at the meetings was a barrier to the spread and prosperity of the order ; and the most , if not all of the lodges agreed to reform in this particular . Feasting is no longer allowed in the lodge-room , during the time of meeting . This change was found to work such wonders in the public mind , allaying suspicion , and making converts to the order from among the moral and serious portion of the community , that the Grand Lodge of the U. S. in a letter addressed to the Manchester Unity in England , requests them to consider the propriety of adopting a similar measure there , as a means of greatly extending the order in that country . But the parent society , with its one thousand minor lodges , did not see fit to notice this filial counsel . On the contrary , there has arisen between the parent and offspring , a feeling of jealousy , if not of hostility , excited in consequence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent ; or because the parent society , in the plenitude of its wisdom and pride , proceeded some years since , to change the signs , grip , and pass-words , without so much as notifying the order in this country . John Bull is a lover of beer and beef , and in his heavy way a lover of fun and frolic ; and woe to him who dares to interfere with the indulgence of his John Bull appetites . In consequence of this hostility , and the changes of the original language of the order , both fraternities are placed in an unhappy condition . Fraternal intercourse is completely interrupted . An Oddfellow , going from this country to England , can not speak the new language there adopted , and he is a barbarian to them and they are barbarians to him-consequently he may be sick and have no help , or die and be buried by other hands than those of the brotherhood . To meet this exigency , our American order , in the true spirit of Yankeedom , are now engaged in the enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manchester Unity . There is already a lodge , subordinate to the Grand Lodge of the U. S. , in the Principality of Wales , having a number of minor associations . Others are soon to be established at Liverpool and London in England , as also in France , Spain , Portugal , Italy , and in the Germanic nations . One or more branches , it is believed , may now be found in most , if not all , of these countries . The " London Union " and " Manchester Unity " will soon be overshadowed by the genius of American enterprise . They may live to regret having esteemed more highly the beer and revel of their lodge-rooms , than the counsel and affection of the young order they have planted in this new and enterprising country . The association of Odd-fellows in this country , is wisely affiliated and compacted in a fashion bearing some resemblance to the form of our civil constitution . Its genius , however , unlike that of our civil government , is the genius , not of state rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the several states and territories , are subject to the supervision of the Grand Lodges ; Address of Rev. Mr. Stone before members of Harmony Division , No. 5 , of Sons of Teniperance , Middletown. // and these again are subordinate to the Grand Lodge of the U. S. The primary source of power and legislation resides in this latter body . Phis Superior Grand Lodge is composed of representatives from the Inferior Grand Lodges , together with the following officers , ( who constitute the executive department of the order , ) viz , the Grand Sire , Deputy Grand Sire , Grand Recording Secretary , Grand Corresponding Secretary , Grand rPreasurer , Grand Marshal , Grand Guardian , and Grand Chaplain . According to the 1st article in the constitution , this Superior Grand Lodge " is the source of all true and legitimate authority in Odd-fellowship , within the United States of America . All state , district , and territorial Grand Lodges and Encampments , assemble under its warrant , and derive their authority from it . It is the ultimate tribunal , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its decision thereon shall be final and conclusive . To it , belongs the power to regulate and control the work of the order , and the several degrees belonging thereto ; to fix and determine the customs and usages in regard to all things which concern Odd-fellowship . This Grand Lodge has inherent power to establish lodges and encampments in foreign countries . Such lodges and encampments shall work by virtue of a warrant granted by this Grand Lodge. *** Every minor lodge is required to make quarterly returns of all business done , to the Grand Lodge of the state or territory , and this again to the Grand Lodge of the U. S. , so that the executive department is correctly and constantly informed in respect to all the proceedings of the inferior lodges spread over the face of the country and extending into foreign lands . The principal business and obArticle 1st , Const . C. L. of ' U. S. jects of this association , so far as they are made public , are to provide a weekly allowance for a brother when sick  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of those holding certain offices , who are allowed $8 per week-an appropriation of $30 to cover the funeral expenses of a brother , or half this amount if the brother is called to bury a wife . There is also some small provision made for the education of the orphan children of Odd-fellows . Inasmuch as this is not a matter regulated by law and statute , we know not how much such unfortunate children may or may not receive . It is also contemplated by means of these lodges , to promote among the members a high degree of friendship , of which every member may avail himself at home and abroad . To accumulate a fund , adequate to cover the expenses constantly occurring , the association demands of every member a proposition fee of $1 , initiation fee of $5 , $1 for each of four different degrees , and $* for another . rfhre are also small weekly or monthly taxes or dues , which every member is required to pay , besides two " intermediate degrees , " as they are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the amount is unknown to us , and we think not specified in any of their printed constitutions . The Superior Grand Lodge receives its funds chiefly by a tax of $30 for charters given to minor lodges and encampments ; also from what is charged as " expenses " and " per percentage on reports , " from tax on representatives , profits on the sale of books , cards , &amp;c . To prevent too great and sudden drafts upon the treasury of the order , it is directed in the several constitutions , that the association be composed exclusively of male members , of a sound bodily constitution , and under forty five years of age ; and if one is admitted beyond thisage , // an additional fee is charged of $1 for each supernumerary year , so that if he is seventy years old , his initiation fee will be $30 . The first lodge in the state of Connecticut , was instituted by Mr. Kennedy , Grand Master of the state of New York , September , 1839 . A charter from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . This lodge is known as the Quinipiac Lodge , No . I. , and its local habitation is in the city of New Haven . It appears from the introduction to the printed constitution of this lodge , that the worthy gentlemen in New Haven who originated the enterprise in this commonwealth , had some " fears for its success . But the first term ( when they had one hundred and inne members ) dispelled all doubt , and gave assurance , which time has continued to strengthen , that the moral soil of Connecticut was peculiarly adapted for the spread of the benevolent principles of Oddfellowship . " The ground of their fears , we suppose to have been the somewhat recent explosion of the Masonic fraternity . But it appears they have been disappointed in the exI ) ectation reasonably entertained , that the sobriety , the moral principle , and the religious habits that characterize the good people of Connecticut , would present an insuperable barrier to the spread of their order in other places than the cities and a few of the larger villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than four thousand young men , of good moral character , and having some pretensions to education , could be so readily drawn into a secret fraternity , under any pretenses whatever ; at least , so soon after the revelation made of some of the " mysteries " belonging to the order of worthy and accepted masons . At this present writing , there are thirty two minor lodges in this commonwealth , subordinate to the Grand Lodge of the state . The Grand Lodge obtained its charter in 1840 . Soon afterward , an unsuccessful application was made to the General Assembly , for an act of incorporation . The application was renewed , year by year , until the friends of the mea ore could show to the two l ) olitieal parties represented in that assembly , quite an army of members already received into the several minor lodges , making it dangerous , at least for the dominant party , any longer to refuse their petition . Accordingly , in the spring of 1845 , an act of incorporation was duly obtained , allowing the Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shall not exceed $2000 . This association , then , has become somewhat formidable , if we regard the number of its members , the rapidity with which they have been drawn together , the secret bond by which they are held , and the great number of towns and villages in which they are located . There arise then some serious and important questions respecting this institution . What claims has it to public favor ? Should it be strenuously opposed ? What are the objections which may and should be urged against this grotesque and yet somewhat imposing fraternity ? We will candidly state our objections to this new order ; and will do what we can to assist our aders in ' placing a just estimate upor* its pretensions and claims . Our first objection to this institution is , that it proposes and professes to establish an unnecessary and unbecoming friendship among all its members  --  a friendship resting upon essentially unworthy grounds . the first great pretension of the institution is , that it is a fellowship , or fraternity , and that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , love and truth . " We will admit , that it is all it pretends to be in this respect , and that its members are linked to each other // by bonds and pledges , and by actual affection , as a brotherhood of friends . But it is to be remembered , that all friendships are not equally worthy and becoming , or equally desirable . The young man who contracts a sworn friendship with unworthy persons , is none the better for it . There may be , and often is , a fellowship among unworthy men , for unworthy purposes ; and even worthy objects , if pursued in-an unlawful or unbecoming manner , ( as has frequently been seen , in the acts of the secret order of the Jesuits ) can not make the friendship thus originated , worthy or desirable . We will not affirm that in all cases , or that even in most cases , the friendship among brothers in this order , is an unworthy or undesirable friendship ; for it would be very strange , if in an association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom makes some pretension , at least , to good moral character , there should not spring up some pleasant intimacies , ripening in time into real and profitable friendship . But this may take place as well by association in agricultural meetings , or in meetings and intercourse of any other kind , as by attendance upon the m*etings of " the order . " But what we understand this society to claim , is , that as soon as a person unites with the association , he is immediately , and for no other reason , encircled with a company of men who are all solemnly pledged to he , and who do certainly become , in fact , his friends , and whose friend he is in return . The same claim is set up by most secret societies generally , if not universally , as their first and great recommendation . Such a pretension , instead of recommending the institution to us , is the very point of our objection . It professes to establish friendship on grounds altogether independent of the fitness or unfitness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time immemorial , the common sense of men has judged that true friendship is formed on the ground of personal fitness ; that in order to a real friendship , there must be congeniality of tastes and disposition , something like an agreement in habits , feeling and character . But this association , in commoa with other secret societies , determines that the mere fact of membership in the order shall be the ground-yes , the exclusive ground , of the affection and friendship that is to exist among the members of the society . The ability to give the required sign , grip or pass word , claims and secures the recognition of friendship . In all this there is as obvious a violation of propriety and common sense , as if a company of men should agree to regard as particular friends and companions all those persons who should xvear a coat with a standing collar , or who should close one eye , in order to see tnore distinctly with the other . Common sense affirms that " he who bath , " or would have " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this society says , let him join our order , and he secures the object at a leap , with a slight tax upon his attention , and a tax not quite so slight upon his purse . It is of pernicious moral tendency , to disregard , or break down , the rules of propriety and common sense in this matter . The rule of caution and discrimination in the selection of friends , is one of the most important of prudential rules to all men , and most of all to young men . But this rule and all others of the same kind , the society breaks down at the threshold of entrance to its mysteries . Thus far , we have argued with the tacit admission that the men , among whom these pledges of friendship are interchanged , are all men of unexceptionable moral character , as is claimed by the friends of the order . But we have now to remark , that the friendship in this brotherhood is unnatural and undesirable , because it // requires that immoral and unworthy persons should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite character . We do not deny that the members of the lodges , especially in New England , desire to admit none but strictly moral men ; but the fact is , that they have admitted , and it is plain that they can not fail to admit , not a few persons who are morally unworthy . They do not fail to exclude the habitual drunkard ,  --  because such men are not to be trusted with any secret , and may soon become a bill of expense to the society ; - for the same reason they fail not to exclude the man far gone in licentiousness ; but vices and immoralities , which do not expose the association to pecuniary damage , are not , and can not be , very rigidly scrutinized . It must be so . A young man whose moral character does not expose the order to speedy pecuniary loss , may have his particular friends in the lodge , who are anxious that he should be associated with them . He is proposed as a candidate for admission  --  a committee of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they judge best , he is by them recommendedwhereupon the Noble Grand , or chairman , announces the fact in open meeting ; the box is placed to receive the balls or votes of the members , and if there be no more than three black balls he is duly elected . It is , and must be , somewhat difficult , to black-ball the character of a young man , , who has many friends already attached to the society ; and it must be a somewhat delicate , as well as difficult business , to enterlain a very free or faithful examination of his moral character , in the presence of personal friends and relatives . Moreover , the society has hitherto been so anxious to secure additions to its numerical and pecuniary strength , that many of the minor associations have winked at some departures from the rules of the body , touching this matter . Nor should it be forgotten in this connection , that very much depends upon the standard , by which we determine what is a good moral character . We find no definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order ; but in the several printed constitutions of the minor societies is the following regulation . " Any member guilty of habitual drunkenness , or of a heinous offense against the laws of the land , or of feigning himself sick , with a view to abuse the benevolent intentions of the order , shall be expelled . " It is fair to presume , that a person not likely to commit these several offenses , or some other offenses of the same kind , sustains , in the judgment of Odd-fellowship , a good moral character , and is not unworthy to be regarded and treated as a sworn friend . But how far do the lodges succeed in preventing the admission of unworthy members , even according to their own standard of worth ? The number of expulsions and suspensions in the order gives rather a sorry answer to this question . During the the year 1845 , there were reported to have been 365 expulsions , and 2005 suspensions . Among the offenses specified as the grounds of such acts of discipline , are habitual drunkenness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust and falsehood , conduct unbecoming an Odd-fellow , violation of the laws of the state , licentiousness and murder . This last was the case of Potter , who recently suffered the sentence of the law , in the city of New Haven . These persons have all been received with open arms by the brotherhood electing them to membership ; and the brotherhood elsewhere and everywhere , were all pledged to receive them with open arms . Certainly we have here a cemented , pledged friendship , resting on very loose and unworthy grounds . We have said furthermore , and we would have it observed distinct- // 514 Odd-Feilowsltip. qwq of young men , has drawn so many into the association , shows conclusively , that they all feel the necessity of making some provision for the day of need , sickness and death . A feeling of this necessity has hitherto operated strongly and favorahly upon our young men , engaging them in profitable occupations , and making them industrious , prudent and frugal . Odd-fellowship proposes to remove the feeling and pressure of this necessity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to qualify n young man to become a voter ; and this operated as an inducement to poor young men , to be industrious and economizinghut in the progress of political improvemerit this stimulus has been removed . Other wants remained . No constitutional changes in the State could make effectual provision against sickness or death , save in the case of paupers . The chances then , of such calamities , every young man must needs anticipate ; and those chances are God 's arrangement-nature 's great incitement , to make every young man , if he has any regard for those naturally dependent on him , rise early and work late , and eat the bread of carefulness . But the benevolent order of Odd-fellows , anxious to do good , proposes , in the magnificence of its charity , to remove from the minds of its members this needful stimulus . And it does actually remove the stimulus , most completely from the minds that need it most . When we have urged this objection **n conversation with members of this order , we have seen its impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have replied , by disparaging the beneficial aid the society proposes to give to its members ;  --  the sum proffered , they say , is too small to have much effect upon the minds of the members . But be the sum more or less , it has been a grand consideration with not a few who have been drawn into this fraternity ; - it is all that , in the judgment of the order , is necessary to fulfill its magniloquent promises of effectual provision against the time of need . If the promised aid - if the aid actually afforded , does not amount to this , then the great pretensions of being a beneficial association , are empty and deceitful . No , the strongest plea urged in behalf of the order  --  the plea which wins into the lodge many a wonder-stricken , gaping proselyte , as the promised bounty-land wins the recruit into the army-is the provision thus made for future necessities ; and this element in the institution , is one which , so far as it operates at all , can not fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divine organization of society , which requires young men to be diligent , sober and provident , in view of the fearful contingencies before them in life . Not knowing how soon the bed of sickness may require drafts upon the stores of former years of toil and frugality , the young man becomes more manly , his arm is nerved with strength , and his mind stimulated to labor and wholesome economy . But this society does what it can to cut the nerve and to remove the natural stirnul us . It virtually says to its young members ,  - -  you may spend as you go , you may consume your earnings as you pleasd , except the weekly payments to be thrown into our treasury ; you need give yourselves no fear respecting the future , for whether at home or abroad , this society will hold over you an impenetrable shield , to guard you from all natural calamity . It should also be remarked in this place , that sobriety , industry and economy , with the ordinary blessing of Providence , will secure every young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable , and will do it in a way much more honorable and beneficial , than that contemplated // by the system of Oddfollowship . The cases are rare ( we believe are never known , at least in New England ) in which a young man of good moral character , industrious habits , and possessing or even not possessing a moderate share of judgment , suffers from destitulion when sick ; - certainly neither such men nor their wives are left , to rot above ground when dead , or are denied a decent Christian burial . It is insulting to them , to their friends and to our common country , to suppose the contrary . But this is supposed by the fraternity , as is shown in every attempt which is made to set forth the merits of the Institution . One would think ( if we were not better informed ) that it was a common thing , for meritorious young men when sick , to be left of their friends to starve and die ; and when dead , to be cast into the highway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , all carry with them this miserable and scandalous imputation upon the character of the American people . A man in China reading one of their printed constitutions , would imagine that we were more barbarous than his own countrymen , who leave the aged to perish with hunger , and not a few to moulder to dust by the way-side . But who are such barbarians in New England , nay in any region of cur country ? Another strong objection to this order is , that it is a secret society , without any reasonable plea of necessity or propriety for being such . There is no imaginable necessity for veiling the proceedings of this fraternity , from public view . We have looked of late at some of the written defenses of the society , to discover if possible , the reason or necessity of this feature of the institution ; and we confess not a little surprise , at finding the apology so weak and unsatisfactory . We have neither time nor space at present , to notice in detail the several reasons for maintaining this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what some of the friends of the order in Connecticut have written on this point , may find some instruction by reading the introduction to the printed constitution and by-laws of Fenwick Lodge No. 20 ; and also an article signed " Clericus , " contained in the Religious Herald printed in Hartford , July 11th , 1846 . We have carefully looked at every source of information on this subject ; and we avow the firm belief , that the reason , and the only reason for secrecy , in regard to this and kindred institutions , is the miserable farce of the initiation of membersthe installation of officers , and the " work " engaging the hands of the members . This is , and must be a secret , or all the beauty and power of the Institution would vanish in an hour . These are the " mysteries , " which none but the initiated can understand . The cabalistic signs and pass-words , are the instruments by which the members work their way through the labyrinths of the mystic order of Odd-fellowship . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for secrecy , inasmuch as the order is very careful to keep this matter completely veiled from public view . They inform us respecting their pretended charities-the manner of electing and selecting members ; but how they are initiated is a " mystery , " and is veiled in secrecy . If any brother should disclose to one uninitiated any of the secrets touching this matter , ( as has been done in one or two instances in this State )  --  the most intense excitement is created among the brotherhood , and some needful step is promptly taken to counteract the evil . It is our firm conviction , that could the style of initiation be known , the fraternity would be broken into fragments in less than s*x months . // But aside from the intrinsic preposterousness of the thing , this feature of the Institution has some mischievous tendencies which we shall state as briefly as possible , and which we commend to the candid consideration . of Odd-fellows and of those who are invited to become such . The first of these mischievous tendencies is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practise deception and falsehood in preserving their mystery , or secret . in the written apologies for this feature of the fraternity , which we have perused , we have detected the operation of this pernicious influence . We have been pained by seeing decided qncroachments upon the bounds of truth and honesty . This disposition has its first exercises in the puerile fictions , with which the members of the order entertain each other , at their lecture meetings , respecting the antiquity of the order . Like kindred associations , this society must have a long period of history-extending back to the days of Adam , Moses , arid the Pharaohs ; or to the times when BabyIon , Ninevah , Jerusalem , iRome , and Athens , were in their glory . Grand Sire Wildey , when in London , attending the Lodge rooms , discovered on the walls of the said rooms a beautiful symbol of Adam " laying the corner stone , " and being pleased with the device he purchased a copy and presented it to the Grand Lodge of the U. S. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually assembles . By long indulgence in this pernicious habit of uttering humbug in the form of historical fiction , the members may easily mystify their consciences till they fall into the practice of deception and falsehood in respect to the secrets of the order . It will occur to some of our readers , that the land groaned with the willful falsehoods uttered by not a few of the masons , upon the explosion of that order . Another evil of secrecy is , a tendency to make the members of the order restive under the free discussions and rigid scrutiny , to which such an Institution must be subjected in this country . A free press and freedom of speech  --  the pleasure and boast of our citizens-will , of course , be employed to the utmost , in canvassing the merits or exposing the follies of this new and formidable Institution . We shall be disappointed , if most of the members of the fraternity do not become restive , or even angered , under the exercise of the liberty which every citizen has of uttering his views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institution making similar pretensions and setting up similar claims . We have already detected the operation of this influence ; and we shall not be much surprised , if even the few lines we have now wiMtten should excite some , yea , many of the friends of the order , to ill-will not very moderately expressed . If it shall be so , we shall be sorry for their folly , and shall be the more confirmed in our judgment respecting the tendency of secret associations to inflame the mind , and make the members peculiarly restive under free and manly discussion . Secrecy also gives to the association a capacity of becoming exceedingly injurious to the public . The society has a dangerous power , which , unless history deceives us in respect to the weakness of our nature and the workings of human corruption in such circumstances , it will employ , with terrible effect upon the public interest , so soon as its power shall be sufficiently extended and established . Already , in not a few places , a young man engaging in mercantile or mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fail of having a reasonable share of public patronage . This consideration has driven not a few young men into a connection // with the brotherhood ; and the more numerous the members of the order , the more powerful and the more injurious is this influence . This fraternity , like the Masonic fraternity in other days , is a clanship , tacitly obligated to bestow patronage exclusively upon the members of the brotherhood ; and , like that institution , we fear , will ripen into a hotbed of ambition , pride , infidelity and selfishness . Again , the secrecy of the order has a pernicious influence upon domestic happiness . Some may smile at the suggestion , others may sneer at it ; but it is worthy of a serious attention . Let the young man think of it in reference to the sensibilities of his wife-sensibilities , without which , she could neither love him , nor be worthy of ' his love . One engagement every week , takes him away from his home , his children , his wife , for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ; and when he comes home , the details of that engagement are a secret , which he may not bienthe even into the ear of his wife . Is this the way in which a young man ought to treat the wife whom he has sworn to love , and who has committed all her happiness to him , in the just expectation of receiving his unlimited confidence in return ? Not only may the wife justly corn plain at being forsaken in this manner ; but the spirit , if not the letter , of the marriage covenant is broken , by the inviolable secrecy which must be maintained , in respect to all the proceedings of that one night every week . Though by God 's appointment they are " no more twain but one flesh , " this society requires the husband to keep the wife in ignorance of all that is transacted in the lodge room . By the constant irritation of this pitiful secrecy , jealousy , suspicion and distrust are naturally excited , to the destruction of domestic peace . Another evil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public mind . With the knowledge had of the works of evil and darkness , once done in the lodge rooms of the Masonic fraternity , the public is justified in cherishing suspicion arid distrust respecting this new order , which is so much like the older society in every essential feature . We affirm that the public has a right , nay , is bound to be suspicious of ' the doings of this secret association . It is for themembers of the order to remove the ground of this suspicion . rfiis can be done only by throwing open the doors of the lodge room . But they know , and we know , that whenever this is done , the Institution is ruined . Nevertheless this must be done , or the public will have a suspicion of wrong.doing , within those " sentry guarded " doors . Our last objection to this society is , that it makes great but groundless pretensions to Christian liriricipIe . It is these pretensions which have given so rapid a growth to this exotic plant , in the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tone and style of argument employed by the defenders of Oddfellowship , they evidently believe that their fraternity is equal , if not superior , to every other association , in its charitable and virtuous character . To show what we mean , we quote afew expressions from written defenses , as a sample of what may be found plentifully scattered through all their publications . The members of Mercantile Lodge , Hartford , in the introduction to their printed Constitution and By-Laws , speak on this wise : - " To us who have entered within the veil , and traced Odd-fellowship to the pure * In country places , it is not uncommon for the members of the order , to go some miles to attend tt , e lodge , and to he absent from their families , the most , if not atl of the night . // fountain of its existence , it is still hallowed by the sweet charities and virtuous principles it inspires . * * XVhen afflicted and oppressed* it leaves us not to the cares of the heartless , but leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends the deserving brother empty away where charity veils in secrecy the good she does ; arid admonishes us that there are joys as well as sorrows , which should be known only to those who partake of them . * * To the benevolent , who would drink at the pure fountain of virtue and truth , the invitation is , ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you . ' " This last sentence has in it the cant of a mawkish infidelity , which knows no distinction between things clean and unclean , sacred and profane . The previous sentence contains the common but slanderous insinuation , that the charity of those who are not of this order , is heartlesr and unworthy . Say the members of Fenwick Lodge , " We avow it as our firm conviction , that there is no institution on earth , which has done and is doing more , in proportion to its numbers , for the b6nefit of the distressed and poor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of every sect and party ; and as they mingle from week to week , the rough corners of prejudice are sure to be battered off , and the sharp features of hard-faced bigotry to be smoothed and softened . Men thus learn that there is virtue in every sect and every party . * * The order has a tendency to make its members better men and better Christians , for they will imbibe more of that first and greatest of all graces , charity , ' that thinketh no evil . ' " It is claimed , then , by the Oddfellows , if these documents do not deceive us , that they have , by virtue of their union with the order , the principle of Christian charity . But is the principle of this fraternity-is the spirit on which it was founded , and which directs its proceedings-any thing of the nature of Christian charity ? What is Christian charity ? In the most appropriate and comprehensive sense , it is nothing else than the fulfilling of that law , which says , Thou shalt love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor , not your clansman , not your sworn confederate , not your associate of the lodge who has paid his fees and weekly dues , not your Odd-fellow , who , by grip and pass-word , shows you that he is a member of the order , but your fellow man , whoever he may be , and wherever you may find him . In another and more limited sense , charity , among Christians , is a specific mutual affection  --  a love to the Christian brotherhood , because of their moral excellence-for the sake and in the flame of a common Redeemer and Sanctifier . But does the brotherhood of Odd-fellows icgard tt all , the character of personal holiness , or the profession of such a character , or*the part of its members , as the basis of their boasted fraternal attachment ? By no means . On the contrary , all required to constitute any person a worthy subject of this elevated attachment , is membership in the order ; and this one thing , the initiation into the lodge , is supposed to impart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every member , as soon as initiated , has the grace of Christian charity , just as , in some people 's theory of the Gospel , every baptized person has received the grace of regeneration . in a vague and popular use of the term , charity is identical with alms-giving , and means simply the gratuitous imparting of relief to the poor . But the vaunted relief of Odd-fellowship to its needy brethren , so far at least as it consists in pecuniary allowances , is not charity even in this sense ; for the relief is extended only to those // who have paid for it beforehand , and who have paid much more for it than if they had bought it at an insurance office . The difference between the charity ( so called ) of Odd-fellowship and Christian charity , deserves a little more illustration . Observe , then , these particulars . In the first place , the rules of the order require an indiscriminate appropriation of the funds to its members . The rich and avaricious member may claim and receive his weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How gross the perversion of language , when such a distribution of money is called charity . The institution , in plain English , is a mutual insurance company , in which the members are insured at the most exorbitant prices . Then why not call it what it is , and cease this endless iteration of cant or something worse , about the heartlessness of other people , and the wonderful Christian charity of the Independent drder of Odd-fellows . Next , observe 1*at this charity ( so called ) is dispensed only to the members of the order . Our Savior directed his disciples to love their enemies , inquiring , " if ye love those who love you , what reward have ye , do not even the publicans the same ? " He directs them to give to those who can not or will not requite them , and look to heaven for their reward . " Do *good unto all men as ye have opportunity , " is the teaching of an apostle . flow different is all this from that inflated , yet stinted charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indiscriminately upon the rich and the poor . The description of this pretended and vaunted benevolence is completed , by remembering that it is all paid for in advance . The whole thing is a mere mockery of charity . On the part of the contributors , it is the simplest , baldest selfishness . The brother joins the order ,  --  why ? to help his wife or children ? to assist the needy  --  the old and young , male and female ? Oh , no ! The whole movement points to his own precious self . If he is sick , he has a weekly benefit ; if he dies , he is buried  --  or if the wife dies , he is assisted in giving her a decent burial . The small and uncertain provision for orphans , is hardly a hair 's breadth above the same selfish arrangement . From beginning to end , the charity of the order , instead of hearing any resemblance to Christian principle , is purely selfish . The alledged Christian character of this Institution , is sufficiently disproved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bonds of brotherhood , not only men of every form of Christian doctrine , but also men of no Christian profession . The infidel and believer are partakers in the same charity , and to the same extent . Originally , and for some years , the society held its meetings on the sabbath day . The journals of the order have the effrontery to speak of ' Heaven , as the celestial lodge ; and , in more instances than one , the great Creator is styled , the Grand Sire of the Universal lodge . tI'he fellowship of this order is claimed to be peculiarly Christian , because it embraces persons of every sect and party ; and it is said " to wear off the sharp features of hard.faced bigotry . " Yes , but how is this done ? Is it by eradicating from the breasts of the members , all feelings of bigotry and party animosity , and establishing in place thereof , more generous Christian feelings and principles ? Far from it . The only change we conceive to be effected , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Odd-fellowship bigotry . It infiames the mind with zeal for a new sect , party and fraternity . Is , then , the bigotry , sectarianism and partizanship of this new order , less // " hard-faced , " or truly selfish , than that which it proposes to remove ? By no means . All this is much like the flaming zeal of some religionists of the " no sect , no creed " party ; which , of all parties , is the most bigoted , and of all creeds , the most narrow . We have not seen , at least in Connecticut , the full extent of the evil we are now considering-as we fear we shall see it , when the order is more firmly established , and the multiplication of these secret societies shall remove the fear , at present existing , of popular jealousy and hatred . When once able to bid defiance to our Christian churches and the Christian ministry , and to the political parties at present existing ; then , unless we have read history in vain , this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free Masonry , and will be , in no respect , less bigoted , less injurious in its influence on its own members , or less dangerous in its bearing on political and public interests , than the exploded order , whose parental relation to itself Odd-fellowship renounces . The time may come , when this infant will measure strength with the strongest ; and , with her myriads of affiliated and nicely compacted societies , extending into every nook and corner of the land , will no longer employ the soft and delicate language of persuasion , but the tones of rebuke and command ,  - -  when those who dare oppose the progress of the institution , or question its high pretensions , will be made to feel- the force of weapons forged by unseen hands , and wielded under the impenetrable protection of the mystic - order . If such is not the result , it will be because S*iy brook . the good sense of thepeopie , warned by former experience , is on its guard against* the growth of such an Institution , and against its acquisition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which it will perhaps use disastrously . When the Institution shall have attained such an ascendancy as shall make it immediately formidable , it may have its Morgan . Its secrets may be exposed to the ridicule of the uninitiated , while some outrage , committed by misguided men under the shelter of its " sentryguarded " lodges , agitates the public mind into a storm of wrath and horror . We hnd designed , before closing this article , to show the further evil of this order , inasmuch as it is apparently designed to supersede , among its members , the claims of the Christian profession . The language employed in describing and defending the order , shows clearly that this association is meant to be a substitute for the Christian church ; embracing in its capacious bosom , every style of character ,  --  infldel and believer , the religious and irreligiou s ,  --  - transforming one and all into a mass of selfish and inflated Pharisaism . Reserving our remarks upon this and a few other points for another occasion , ( if there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we commend what we have now written , to the candid consideration of the more serious and intelligent portion of the fraternity ; assuring them that we have aimed to be ourselves candid , and to preserve as much gravity as possible , in the discussion of the claims of this frivolous Institution.
