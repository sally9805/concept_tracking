txt ArnDST a universal conflict of opinion , perhaps the most remarkable which has occurred in the history of Christianity , there is one idea pervading all Christendom , and intimately incorporated with the religious thinking of the adherents of every hierarchy and every creed . That idea is , that the whole world is to be converted to the Christian faith : and the belief is very general that the time when that hope is to be realized is near at hand . But the conceptions of different bodies of nominal Christians as to what is implied in a conversion of the human race to the Christian faith , and as to the means by which such an event is to be brought to pass , are widely diverse from each other , presenting all possible gradations between the widest extremes of dissimilarity. // The Papist sees in the anticipated event of the world 's conversion , the great schism of the Reformation healed , and the infallible authority of his Holiness acknowledged with reverence and submission by the whole human family . In his eye the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very simple , though the enterprise must certainly be esteemed little less than infinitely arduous and difficult . It is nothing less than to induce all Protestant Christendom to relinquish that liberty of conscience for which such agonies have been endured , and so much blood has been shed at the stake and on the scaffold , to forget her XValdenses and Huguenots , her Wickliffs , her Luthers , her Latimers , and give hack her conscience , her Bible , and her hopes of heaven , to the keeping of the Pope and of his swarming monks and crafty Jesuits . The means on which she relies for gaining these ends are the captivation of the imagination by the splendors of her architecture , her paintings , her music , her ritual and her priestly vestments ,  --  the terrors which superstition always inspires in ignorant , degraded and guilty minds ,  --  and the intimidation of that political power , which she wields by virtue of her alliance with the civil arm . This , thank God , is not our Christianity-this is not our enterprise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its accomplishment . It is however to be feared that the conception of this subject , which obtains in most Protestant communions , is by no means true to fact , or adequate to the necessities of the church or of a perishing world . Each of our Protestant communions embodies in its organization , some peculiar conception of a complete view of the gospel , and of a perfect state of Christian society . Such a conception can never fail in every instance to modify our ideas of the nature of this great enterprise , and of the means by which it is to be accomplished . Precisely to the extent that the adherents of any sect are pervaded by the conviction that their own system of divinity , exclusively , is a complete exhibition of the gospel , and their own mode of organization , that which a perfect state of Christian society requires , just to that extent does the enterprise of the world 's conversion resolve itself into the universal prevalence of the peculiarities of their doctrine and organization ; and the means necessary to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand fold greater moving power , to the peculiar moral machinery which their sect itself provides . They are sure that they have the true model of the machine and only need to construct it on a larger scale-or , to change the figure , they are sure that they have found the true center of the circle , and only need to enlarge the circumference till it embraces the globe . That this is a true and fair representation of the conception of the world 's conversion , which obtains in the minds of vast multitudes in most or all the Protestant sects , will not probably be denied by any observing man . Much less can it be successfully denied , when we consider the pertinacity with which most of our sects insist on carrying all their sectarian peculiarities into all their efforts at evangelization . This idea , that the whole work of the world 's conversion is to be accomplished , siInply by imparting new vigor to the movements of existing machinery , is exerting its influence on the great mass in all our Protestant communions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church to give a thousand times as liberally to the cause of Christian benevolence and send out into the various fields of Christian labor a thousand times as many men , the world would be converted to God in a few years . Multitudes in various communions are practicing an // 196 Something wanting to the World 's Conversion . exemplary , and in some instances an extreme self-denial , for the sake of giving to the cause of missions , whose sensibilities would perhaps be wounded by the suggestion that any thing more is needed to secure the world 's conversion , than merely to apply the requisite power to this part of our machinery . Now far be it from us to speak lightly of such self-denial , or of the object for the sake of which it is practiced . It is indeed true that a great increase of a self-denying and liberal spirit is an indispensable condition of success in the great work . And at this hour , when every good enterprise in our land is in embarrassment from the lack of funds , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these enterprises are saved from extinction . But still we must and do maintain that the conception of our great enterprise which contemplates no other means of its accomplishment , than the application of increased moving power to the existing forms of religious machinery , is imperfect and delusive . The means of the world 's conversion are twofold  --  the intellectual and the executive : and it is a great calamity to the church and to the world , that while the executive part of this process has been deliberately and solemnly undertaken , as the great enterprise of modern Christendom : the progress which has been made in the intellectual part , has been only by the reaction of the enterprise itself upon prevalent habits of thinking , or by other indirect influences in the providence of God , and too generally in opposition to the wishes and sentiments of the great majority of the nominally Christian world . The necessity of this part of the process is not seen , nor has the church it i this or any other country ever to any extent undertaken its performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearing the middle of this boasted nineteenth century , that the man who undertakes solemnly and candidly to make a fresh comparison of the doctrinal system , or the principles of organization held in any one of our communions , with the acknowledged infallible standard , may certainly anticipate that the great mass of that portion of the church will be against him , and regard his speculations as arrogant , unnecessary , and pernicious . This is not the temper which the present condition of the world calls for . It is not the spirit which God requires of his people . We propose therefore to show , that there is an intellectual work to be done in Christendom , as an indispensable preparation for the world 's conversion , and therefore requiring the solemn , deliberate and immediate effort of the church , as truly as the sending of missionaries to the heathen , or the dissernination of the Bible . That every doctrine of every sect is to be again and again examined , and every principle of organization to be again and again compared with the direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of God . 1 . This we argue , from the most obvious consideration , that by far the greater portion of us must , from the very nature of the case , be more or less in the wrong . Of several conflicting views of the same subject , only one can be right ; all may be wrong ; and all but one must necessarily be so . Let us now leave out of our estimate all the sects whose numbers are inconsiderable , and all those whose claim to the evangelical character is considered as doubtful . We shall still have some ten organized bodies of Christians-which we leave each reader to reckon up for himself . Of these ten sects-differing from each other in various degrees , yet constituting in effect one body , as opposed to Rationalism on the one hand and to Romanism on the other - it is too certain to require any argument , that at least nine are // more or less in the wrong in their modes of organization , or their doctrines . Nor are the matters at issue between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important ; and no man can decide to what extent mischievous consequences may result from the denial of one truth which God has revealed , or from the maintenance of one principle which is either in theory or in its practical operation , at variance with truth , nature and the government of God . No man is xvise enough to warrant him in the assertion that none of the points at issue between these various sects are of any serious importance to the World 's conversion . Indeed to make such an assertion , would be a mark of folly , not of wisdom . What Christian in his senses believes that it is of no consequence to the world , whether society be organized after the Episcopal , the Presbyterian , or the Congregational model ? Or whether the doctrinal notions of John Wesley or John Calvin , become the current opinions of mankind ? Does any one doubt then that an essential part of the means by which the millennium is to be introduced , lies in a fresh investigation of existing systems of doctrine and organization ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very face of modern Christendom , that at least nine in ten of our sects , embracing of course a vast majority of all the disciples of Christ in this nation , are certainly involved in important error , from which they can be delivered only by a fresh comparison , not only of their own but of all other systems , with the word of God . And when he has fairly met this fact , and weighed it , and pondered it , as its magnitude deserves , then let him judge whether the coming of the millennium can be hoped for in this land , without the performance of a work of religious investigation , more thorough , searching and radical than has ever occurred in any former period of the history of our religion ; and whether he who is honestly and in the fear of God engaged in this work , is not as truly laboring for the world 's conversion , as he who is preaching the gospel in Palestine or in Burmah . There is only one mode of avoiding this conclusion ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant Christianity is to exist in the last days of the church , and is consistent with the most perfect state of Christian society . We are aware that many intelligent men and good Christians entertain this opinion . It is sufficient here to say of it that such an idea shocks all our sense of moral symmetry and beauty , and makes us feel that such a millennium would be hardly worth our prayers and our efforts : it undermines all confidence in every form of religious opinion , either by maintaining that there is no appreciable difference between religious truth and rel&gt;ious error , or that the minds of Christians , even in that golden age of evangelical truth and power , will not have the discernment to distinguish between them . But the utter impracticability of this view of the case will more fully appear as we proceed . 2 . We argue the truth of our position again , from the actual daily experience of the church in the present age . The machine is constructed , we are told , after the correct model , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In vain do we urge that the machine is encumbered with a great amount of unnecessary friction . " All that is necessary , " we are again told , " is the application of sufficient power-let us only have a style of Christian character sufficiently intense and energetic , and the friction you complain of will be easily overcome . " Give me a place where I may stand , said the philosopher of Syracuse , and I will move the earth . A grand // 198 Something wanting to the World 's Conversion . conception , indeed , but we have never heard that he found the place where he could stand , and hence philosophy has never yet pried the earth out of its orbit . rpliere is upon a waterfall of given power , a piece of machinery which has been constructed at immense expense and trouble to its proprietor . Years have been wasted in unsuccessful efforts to make it so operate as to produce thc desired result . At length the advice of a machinist is called for . He examines the construction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bad construction , occasioning an immense unnecessary friction . " Oh , " says the proprietor , " if that is all , the remedy is easy-it is only necessary to apply the more power . " " But , " says the machinist , " have you not been trying these twenty years to apply more power without success ? And are you not aware that you have long since applied the full power of your waterfall , and that you have therefore no more power to apply ? " " Ah ! " replies the proprietor , " I think it a dangerous experiment to attempt any reconstruction of the machine-we might make it worse ; I would rather rely on the application of more power . " " But , " says the machinist , " why do you fear that we shall make it worse ? Do you suppose such a machine as this to be constructed at random , and without any rules or fixed principles by which to be governed , so that getting it right is a mere matter of accident ? Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on the application of more power to this machine , is simply the same thing as to abandon the hope of the intended result ? You can not apply more power ; you have been trying to do that these twenty years and always failed . " " Ah ! " says the proprietor again , " if we can get more power , we can overcome the friction . The machinist who built this machine had great skill in his profession ; we have not his equal in our day . I do not think we can expect to improve upon his model . I would rather try to apply more power to the machine as it is . " Now this does but too justly represent the predicament of the modern church with reference to her great enterprise of the conversion of the world to God . Her pro* , ress in heathen lands within the half century since the commencement of the modern missionary movement , has been in general slow and toilsome ; and she has now arrived at a point where there are many indications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To say nothing of enlargement or extension , it is becoming questionable whether existing missions must not be abandoned , for the want of power to sustain them . And yet , who is preaching the Gospel to the three hundred and fifty millions of China ? How many to the one hundred and twenty millions of Hindostan ? How many in the whole vast continents of Asia and Africa . Meanwhile , how is the church advancing at home ? We do not , indeed , mean to deny that true Christianity has made real progress in Protestant Christendom during the last half century . In some respects her progress has been wonderful , considering the disadvantages of her position ; no candid mind can contemplate it without yielding to the conviction that this work is of God . Indeed the very fact of the continued existence of Christianity among the prominent intellectual elements of the nineteenth century , under all the disadvantages of divisions and contentions among Christians , is a most affecting proof of her immortal energy . No other system of religion or philosophy-assailed from various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the keenest and most malignant hatred-and weakened and disgraced , // as the Gospel has been , by the factions that divide its friends and advocates-could have stood its ground evcn up to the present time . The sway which in such circumstances the religion of Christ exerts over the purest and most enlightened portion of the world , is a fact which ought to fill every unbelieving heart with trembling . Like the bush which Moses saw , the church of Christ , though burning , is not consumed ; its leaves are still green upon it . But while there are points at which it were easy to demonstrate , beyond contradiction , the progress of the Gospel in our age , it concerns our present purpose to remark , what is equally demonstrable , that the progress is by no means such as ought to satisfy our expectations . Why is it that while Protestant Christianity is engaged in an effort for the establishment of a universal moral empire of truth and holiness , she is every where met at her own doors by malignant infidelity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in our own republic , where religious liberty has been so long enjoyed , where the Bible is free to all , and has actually been placed in every family , and where the Gospel is fairly disburdened of all the incumbrances from political interference , which have pressed it down in other ages and countries , and is therefore at liberty to exert its full power upon society , and has been so for more than a half centurywhy is it that in such a country , so large a portion of the entire people are either the avowed advocates of some form of infidelity , or in practice utterly negligent of all religion ? Why is it , that in the very midst of this effort for the universal extension of Protestantism , the Papacy is collecting and wielding throughout Christendom a power which it has not possessed before since the Reformation ? Have we but one answer to make to all these inquiries ? Have we only to say , that our religious machinery must be worked with greater energy ? To this a conclusive reply has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies on the very surface of society , and which no man can contradict , to wit , that the great mass of Protestant Christians have not a full conception of the Gospel , and are not organized in accordance with the will of our great Master in heaven . Prom such a state as definite in the moral as in the material world ; and a bad system of moral arrangements will no more produce the legitimate fruits of a good one , than a badly constructed machine will do the work of one constructed with the highest degree of skill , and in complete accordance with the laws under which it is to act . Is it still said , that " we only need to apply more power ? " Do we still hear the argument , " let Christians take hold and work , and they will overcome the friction ? " We ask , How can we apply more power ? He who can answer this question speaks to the purpose ; he who can not , says nothing to the purpose , however good his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant Christendom , of the age , of the missionary enterprise . We know how to respect the feeling which shrinks from such ideas as that which we are proposing . We are not unconscious of that feeling in ourselves . But still we are constrained to look our proposition in the face , and to present it to the consideration of our Christian brethren . Who is there to deny that the ecclesiastical systems of Christendom generally , must be in various degrees reconstructed , before the Gospel shall achieve its promised triumph ? We ask , then , is it to be supposed that those corrected sys // tems either of doctrine or of organization which are to be constructed for the expected age of the Redeemer ' s universal victory , will be constructed without study and counsel and effort , expressly directed to that end ? Is it a mere accident , whether we get them right or wrong ? Is there no standard of moral truth or fitness , other than the stereotype plates from which our own favorite systems are struck ? so that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no fixed standard or model by which the system could be reconstructed ? Thanks to God , we have n common standard upon which we are agreed , divinely inspired , and if followed , quite adequate to enable us to distinguish between the true and the false , the right and the wrong . The thing to be done in our effort to prepare the church for her final conquests , is not a leap in the dark : it is a simple , candid comparison of all our systems with this infallible standard . If our systems are right , the result of such a comparison can be nothing else than to reaffirm them-if wrong , to correct them . To doubt this , is to question the authority of all our religion , to distrust God and his Spirit . But we shall hear it said , on every side , " The men who devised our existing systems were highly gifted of God , such as the present age can not produce : there is little hope that we in this degenerate age can improve upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who devised and constructed the existing systems of Protestant Christendom-from Luther to Wesley-were highly gifted of God ; and each had his mission to fulfill . The heroic reformer of XVittemberg , the patriot martyr of Zurich , the wise theologian of Geneva , the leaders of the Westminster Assembly , the authors of the Cambridge Platform , the apostle and lawgiver of Methodism-were men to be held in everlasting remembrance . But to say that what they did is never to he in any way improved upon  --  to say , that the several varying and conflicting systems constructed by them in their several spheres of action , must stand forever , without any attempt to modify them and to bring them into harmony , is a slander both upon the word and the providence of God . What ! had the imprisonment of the Bible for a thousand years produced no darkness of the human mind ? Or did the Reformers , at the first movement , emerge from the depths of that darkness into so full a refulgence of light , that their interpretations of God 's word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent ages ? 1-lave the freedom of the Bible for three hundred years , and the stately movements of God 's providence in connection with it during that brightest period in the history of human knowledge , thrown no light upon the system of the Gospel , and the organization of Christian society ? We might as well insist on going back for our knowledge of steam power or astronomy , to a date anterior to Watt and Fulton , or Newton and Kepler . The position of the diligent and candid student of the Bible in our own generation , is as certainly more favorable to a correct conception of the system which it teaches , than that of the best of the Reformers , as the position of the student of physical science is more favorable to an understanding of the laws of the material world , than that of Galileo or Copernicus . The intellectual work done by the Reformers bore a very close analogy to that of the great pioneers of modern science . The dark system which had been superinduced upon the Bible , had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of restoring to each portion of the Bible its own proper meaning , is // 201 closely analogous to that of discovery in physical science ; and it is not more certainly true , that the human mind has made great progress in one of these branches of knowledge in the last three hundred years , than in the other . And are we then to be told , when we exhort the church to re-examine , and if need be to reorganize her systems , in preparation for the battle of the great day of God Almighty , that her systems as they are , have the sanction of Luther , and Calvin , and Knox , and Edwards , and Wesley ? Great and good men were these , of whom the world was not worthy . But they were never commissioned to make a Bible for us , or to give any authoritative interpretation of that which we have . They had not seen the word of God illustrated by his providence and his Spirit for the last one hundred years : and let no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providence of God , say , that that is a lesson of no value . It is indeed true , that what the church needs , and all which she needs , is a more elevated and influential piety . But how is this want to be supplied ? If it could be shown that piety is entirely indifferent to systems , both of doctrine and organization , and will flourish as well under falsehood as under truth-under spiritual despotism as under the liberty of the Lord , there would then be some wisdom in proposing to desist from all farther examination of systems , in our efforts for the conversion of the world ; and nothing would be required of us but to cry out for a more elevated piety . But what Christian believes that this is a true doctrine ? It is a doctrine received by none of us . We are at least agreed in this , that systems both of doctrine and organization are important-vitally important to the great enterprise ; else we can never justify the tenacity with which we severally adhere to our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a re-examination and reconstruction of existing systems , is not an indispensable means of attaining those high degrees of holiness which we all acknowledge are needful ? There is indeed but one possible way of showing it ; and that is , by showing that the present condition of Protestant Christendom , both with reference to doctrines and organizations , is in accordance with moral symmetry and the revealed will of God . To prove this , would surely be no easy task . There are probably many who would be willing to undertake the work for their own particular sect . But we must bear in mind , that one sect embraces only a minority of the true disciples of Christ , and that the work in which we are engaged is a great one , and needs the co-operation not only of one sect , but of all the faithful . If then all we are willing to attempt to prove-even those of us who are best satisfied with the present organization of the spiritual host , is , that one in ten of our sects is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong , on points of so much importance as to justify our remaining in separate communions , it is surely needless to argue this point any farther . If these things are so , the re-examination and reconstruction of systems of doctrine and order , is a most important part of the work to be done in our effort to convert this world to God . An order of things which thus involves four-fifths , and perhaps nine-tenths of all the disciples of Christ on earth , in serious and important religious error , must dim the light of divine truth , impair the power of religious motives , and impede the cultivation of piety . Nor let us flatter ourselves that through the supposed purity of our own system , we are to escape entirely the deleterious consequences of this adulteration of the sincere // milk of ' the word in other Christian comrnunions . The church of Christ is one body , and has one head , and " if one member suffers , all the members suffer with it . " Let not then one member boast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides is diseased . Let us rather acknowledge the ties , which , uniting us all to the same glorious Head , unite us also to each other ; and thus let us address ourselves at oace to an honest effort to restore health to the whole body . From this duty of re-investigating systems , which at this stage of our argument we may fairly assume to be binding on the great mass of the followers of Christ in our age , some may consider themselves and the adherents of their own sect exempted , on the ground that they are satisfied with their system , and willing to undertake its defense at all points . Their duty they conclude , lies in a simple effort to convert the greatest possible numbers to their views of doctrine and order , while those views themselves ate regarded as unchangeable , and sacred from the touch of investigation . Such men should remember , that there are others as pious and as capable of interpreting the Bible as themselves , who are equally ready to advocate systems which , in many points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that one is perfectly ready so far as himself is concerned , to take the responsibility of stereotyping his system for the millennium , and for eternity-has he no wish to secure his Christian brother from important religious error ? And how is he to do this ? There is but one way which affords any rational hope of success . Both parties must consent to a recomparison of their respective systems with a common infallible standard . He who refuses to do this , has great reason to suspect the sincerity and the purity of his own zeal for the truth . The April , temper which he manifests is , at all events , not that which results from a simple reliance on the word and Spirit of God . He who is sustained in his religious opinions only by such a reliance , will ever be ready to re-examine any article of his faith upon the suggestion of a possible error , and will never fear the result of such an investigation , so long as his only infallible guides are at hand to conduct him safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistency , nor the infallibility of a favorite system , but the truth as it is in Jesus . He sincerely believes that this is found in God 's word , and that God will guide to a knowledne of it , all those who honestly and prayerfully seek it there . 3 . We argue the truth of our proposition , from the necessity of the case under that constitution of things which God has adopted . The law of religious influences does not differ essentially from that of the other intellectual influences which govern society . If this be true , then it follows of necessity , that in the introduction of the gospel among the depraved elements of human society , action and reaction must go together-that while Christianity , in its first reception among men , would act , to a certain extent , with a purifying efficacy upon society , it would also , as received , understood , and interpreted among men , be itself acted upon ; to a certain extent it would be corrupted by the influence of the putrescent masses upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , incapable of producing its appropriate fruits . It would therefore never exhibit its full power to bless mankind , till it should have been purified from that corruption , by the successive developments of the human mind , under the overruling providence and guiding Spirit of God . We will illustrate this point by a Something wanting to the World 's Conversion . // parallel case . The doctrines of our declaration of independence were generally received by the Mexican and South American republics , at the era of their respective separations from their mother country and the political systems which they constructed , were close imitations in form , of our federal and state governments . It can not be doubted , indeed , that many of the fundamental doctrines of free government have become thoroughly incorporated with the Hispano-American mind . But there are other and false notions , both of religion and government , not re-examined , and still retaining their hold on the national character . These false and despotic doctrines amalgamate with the free principles derived from the United States , or rather meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces that confusion , that constant tendency to revolution , which at present characterize the Llispano-American governments . This feature in their condition , is analogous to the state of the church in those dark and corrupt centuries , which immediately preceded the systematic organization of the papal despotism . It is not improbable that there will yet be in those countries , a systematic and settled form of despotism , made up of some sort of amalgamation of these now conflicting elements , which will be neither the monarchical system of Europe , nor yet the republicanism of the United States  --  but a despotism still , and perhaps a very cruel and rigorous one . It is not however probable , that the principles of liberty and equality can ever be eliminated from the Hispano-American mind and it may be confidently hoped , that the successive developments of divine Providence will give to those principles a continually increasing power in the body politic , until they shall at length throw off from the political combination the elements of despotism , and confer on those unhappy countries the blessing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prediction-they may , and we would hope will , reach the goal of freedom by a shorter and a happier route . But if they do , we think that route will still be one , which will equally illustrate the principle we would insist on-the corruption of a true system by its being mingled with a false one , and its subsequent purification , by the development of the human mind , guided by the providence of God . If we are right in our assumption , that the Christian religion in its influence upon the world , is subject to this general law of action and reaction , then the progress and ultimate destiny of the Gospel in the world , must follow the general analogy of other moral influences . At first the Gospel spread rapidly ; and in a little more than two hundred years , it had diffused itself through the most extensive and compacted mass of moral corruption which had ever existed on earth  --  the united Grecian and Roman empires . Its corruption was inevitable . The forms and legends of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of Christianity were substituted in their place . But the human mind was not radically and thoroughly regenerated . The leaven was mingled with the mass , but had as yet done little to change its character . That was to be a progressive work , to go forward for ages and yet he incomplete . False principles in philosophy , in morals , in government , in education , were inwrought into the very texture of the minds of that age , and were not thrown off by the mere adoption of the names and forms of Christianity , and abjuring the forms of the old superstition . they blended with the new religion , and materially changed its character ; and the resulting com // pound , though not Christianity , nor even bearing more than a faint and distorted resemblance to it , was handed down to subsequent generations as the genuine Gospel . It is through this corrupted stream , that the nations of modern Christendom have received the forms and systems of the Christian religion as they actually exist . It is obvious then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless the world-with the full power of the Gospel , till these foreign ingredients are quite removed from their actual Christianity ; and their entire system , whether of doctrine or order , is conformed to the true spirit of the Gospel , as it proceeded from the lips of its Divine Author . Is then the work of purging out the old leaven of these early and inevitable corruptions complete ? It is gloriously begun ; but that it is complete , we think a wise man will not assert . There are indeed some , laying claim to no small share of wisdom , who assert , or seem to assert , that it was completed by the Reformers . But what is the evidence on which such an assertion is to be credited ? Surely , no such evidence is found either in the nurnerous errors which the progress of inquiry has already detected in those great and good yet fallible men , or in the multiform and flagrant abuses which they never attempted to correct , or in those dissensions of theirs among themselves , which brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to so great an extent on their successors , in the form of modern sectarism , have disgraced the church , and held back from the world the full blessings of the Gospel , even to this day . No : it is not to the days of Luther , nor to the entire period from Luther to Wesley , that we are to look for a full and final reforrnation . A partial deliverance has been wrought out for the church , but as yet it is only partiaL Prin ciples have been evolved , which are destined to conduct her quite out of the wilderness ; but the application of those principles has thus far been limited and incomplete . That work is mainly yet future ; and it is not only an essential means to be employed for the world 's conversion , but it is the main work to be done . Let us have the Gospel , the whole Gospel , and nothing but the Gospel  --  a true conception of the true system of the Bible , and we shall soon find the church filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes will soon feel her benignant influence . " Kings shall come to her light , and the nations to the brightness of her risino " " The sons of strangers shall build up her walls , " and " all they that afflicted her , shall come bending unto her . " 4 . We argue the truth of our position , from the history of the past . Why has not the world long since been converted to God ? At the end of more than eighteen hundred years from our Savior 's appearing , why have infidelity , idolatry , and superstition , still a place on earth ? Or rather , why do they embrace in the number of their adherents , more than three fourths of the human family ? Is not eighteen hundred years long enough for an experiment ? Is it said that the effort has not been made ? This will be denied . Effort has been made , in one form and another , enough to have converted this whole world to God . This great enterprise , vast as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christendom , than was done to sustain the Crusades , or the enormous extravagances of the papacy . But grant that the effort never has been made-why has it not been made ? Why has the Gospel never had power encugh over its followers , to induce them even to make the effort to impart its blessings to every creature ? With such conceptions // 205 of the Gospel as glowed in the hearts of Paul and Peter , of James and John , could eighteen hundred years have rolled away , before there was even an adequate effort made to " disciple all nations ? " We can not avoid the dilemma , that either the true conception of the Gospel has been , during that long period , very imperfectly and indistinctly apprehended by the church ; or else , that this conception is not one of sufficient power to obtain for it any thing beyond a very limited prevalence over the hearts and minds of men . Which side of this dilemma do we take ? If the latter , then our hopes are at end ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstition , ignorance , and barbarism . But if we choose the former , then no business is more important to the church , in preparing for and hastening on the golden ages which are in reserve for her , than the business of investigation -- thorough , unsparing , radical investigation -- an investigation which shall recognize nothing as sacred but truth , and no standard of truth but the word of God . In the present age of the world , motives of infinite strength urge us , to enter at once upon this work , and to accomplish it with the least possible delay . What Christian philanthropist is not filled with anxiety and even sadness , in view of those tendencies to an indiscriminate rejection of all forms of religious faith , which are apparent in so many quarters ? What Christian father does not look with deep and painful solicitude on his sons , who are growing up within the reach of those very influences , which have heretofore delivered over so many youthful minds to the dark dominion of infidelity ? an infidelity which leaves the soul no God-no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a matter of unspeakable interest to every believer to know what those influences are . They are doubtless numerous ; but in our opinion , by far the most important of them may be embraced in one statement . The intellect of the age , awake to the subject of religion , and intensely stimulated by the love of innovation in opinion , and the reaction of depravity against religious restraint , is called to act upon religious systems , which in their apparent mutual repugnances , and in their respective combinations with more or less which is erroneous , present many vulnerable points-many violations of moral symmetry , whether their past history be regarded , or their present condition . The point on which we have just been insisting , affords a striking illustration of this sort of influence . Infidelity argues from the history and actual position of outward Christianity . She asks , " Is not a period of eighteen centuries , long enough for an experiment ? " Guided by the implacable enmity of the human heart against the restraints of religion , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforming , but that it is a delusion . Taking her captivated listener along the dark pathway of papal superstition , tyranny and blood ,  --  " These , " she exclaims , " are the fruits of your boasted gospel of peace . " When her pupil , not yet quite divested of his scruples , suggests that this was a corrupt and false Christianity , she changes the scene ; she conducts him through the mazes of Protestant dissension ; she portrays the strifes , the bigotry , the intolerance by which , earlier or later in their history , most of the Protestant communions have been dishonored ; she shows the picture of sectarian distrust , jealousy and confusion , and she asks with a sneer , " Is this your boasted Christianity ? Is this the gospel of peace ? " Christians in this age , must give to this question a practical answer in the negative , or infi // delity will still lead our children captive . It is not enough for the ministers of religion to demonstrate the fallacy of this argument : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible . And while an argument , so sweeping and so plausible , is ever at hand , and ever appealing to the strong prejudices of human depravity , it will prevail with thousands of unstable souls . Such an argument must not only be syllogistically answered ; it must be abolished , by the exhibition of a more efficacious Christianity , recommending itself by more abundant and better fruits . How is this to be done ? By rallying in sects and factions , around our various systems , and putting forth our full strength to prop up every tottering pillar , with whatever strength of argument assailed ? crying out meanwhile against the prevailing infidelity , and calling on our fellow Christians for more effort ? " Non tali auxilio , nec defensoribus istis Tempus eget . " If the Bible can not be trusted , abandon it , and with it our religion and our hope of heaven . But if it can be trusted , bring it forth to the light : let loose its whole power . This wavering conflict between Christianity and infidelity , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that all is not right with him . Saving truth and fatal error are not so equally matched , that meeting each other on equal terms , in open combat , the contest can long be doubtful . The Christian warrior in such circumstances , should carefully examine his weapons , and see to it that they are after the true model , and of the true celestial temper . He should look well to the organization of the host , and be sure that the serried ranks stand in their appointed places . It is time we draw to a conclusion . The Christian church it is plain has but just begun her work . For all the executive energy she has exhib ited and is still exhibiting , we rejoice and thank God . Nor would we be understood to imply that its results are not , both actually and prospectively , of great importance to her cause . If the modern efforts for the world 's conversion , have accomplished nothing more than to demonstrate to the church her real weakness , and to convince her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just and inspiring conception of those great spiritual realities on which she rests ; that would be of itself a grand result , amply repaying the toil and treasure it has cost . But these efforts have accomplished much more than this ; they have translated the Bible into languages spoken by hundreds of millions ; they have blessed many a darkened pagan with heavenly light ; they have taught thousands that new song which they shall sing forever before the throne of God and the Lamb . Nor should such efforts be suspended or abated ; they should be increased to the greatest possible extent and energy . While we deeply feel that Protestant Christendo*n is but ill prepared to meet the great crisis in the religious history of our world , which is evidently at hand , we have no sympathy with those reformers , who tell us " There is no use in sending a sectarian Christianity to the heathen . Let the church first Christianize herself before she attempts to Christianize others . " We have God 's holy word , and surely it is the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impart it to every creature . The church has had , and still has , even in these days , men of a truly apostolic spirit ; and when such men would go to the heathen , God forbid that the church should add to all her other sins that of refusing to send them forth , or to sustain them in their self-denying work . Besides we firmly believe that the missionary enterprise has been under God the principal means of kindung // up that degree of vital energy , which the gospel is exhibiting in our day , as well as the principal source of those reforming tendencies , which are beginning to be developed , and which are casting upon the future the cheering light of a better hope . It would be interesting did our limits permit  --  and certainly it would be easy  --  to trace up many of these catholic and hopeful tendencies to their origin in the great missionary enterprise . But while we joyfully thank God for the executive energy which the church is exhibiting , we must urge that she enter immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long neglected . One thing seems to be settled by experiment-the church can not obtain the moral empire of the world with her present conceptions of the gospel and forms of organization . She must readjust them , or give up her enterprise . Does she shrink from this work of readjustment ? Why ? Has she no Bible ? No Holy Spirit ? Or has she lost confidence in them both ? That even Protestant Christianity is too deficient in respect to confidence in the word and Spirit of God , can not be denied , without shutting our eyes to a thousand facts which lie on the very surface both of her history and of her actual condition . The Papacy taught men to put no confidence in the Bible , and all conIldence in a supposed infallible and unchangeable human authority ; and Christianity under the forms of Protestantism has not yet fully unlearned the baleful lesson . There has always been a tendency in Protestantism , from the very beginning , to stereotype each existing form of doctrine and of organization , to write even the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation . Hence the sectarian divisions among those who agree in holding the head . It is time this great stumbling block were taken out of the way . Let the church rise and be doing her whole work . Let her open an unobstructed pathway for her ministers and her members quite up to the fountains of revealed truth . Let her no longer depend for the permanency either of her opinions or her forms , on any thing else than their demonstrable agreement with the word of God . Let the fires of argument and investigation play upon them , and if they are thus proved to be wood , hay , stubble , let them burn . Let us give up the chimerical attempt to secure a detailed and absolute uniformity . We have a common Bible , a common fountain of religious truth ; and where men show us that they love the Bible and form their opinions by its dictation , there to insist on speculative uniformity as essential to unity in Christ , or as a condition of cooperation or communion , is absurd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here be raised ,  --  What ? would you throw away all our creeds and formularies of doctrine , and cut us loose from all our " standards ? " Far be it from us to cut the church loose from her standard that is the Bible . To what extent and for what purposes particular churches , or confederacies of churches , may usefully and lawfully employ creeds , our limits will not permit us here to discuss . But whatever opinions we may form on that subject , one principle is certain . Any use of a creed , or a constitution , or a church court , or a council , tending to discountenance the free investigation of the Bible on any and every article whether of belief or of practice , or to shield any portion of the church against those changes to which she ever has been and still is constantly liable from the progressive advancement of biblical knowledge , is a usurpation of the rights of God over the consciences and understandings of men . It is religious despotism under whatever specious forms it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest contention for the faith once delivered to the saints , it may be advocated . And we call on the man whoever he may be , and on the body of men whatever they may be called , who are doing this ( and let every one interrogate his own conscience in the presence of God ) to desist from these unholy deeds . They are not only lording it over God 's heritage , and depriving their brethren-nay their own souls-of rights guarantied to them by the eternal constitution of God 's empire ; but they are arresting the river of the water of life in its course to bless the nations . They are shutting out the beams of the sun of righteousness from the darkened human mind . They have taken away the key of knowledge ; the yneither go in themselves , nor suffer them who are entering to go in . Of crimes like these let the church of Christ no longer be , guilty . May the bygone ages of her darkness and corruption suffice and more than suffice-fill her with shame and sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become herself a bright and polished mirror without one dark spot or stain , to reflect that light on earth 's benighted millions . May the Lord he her everlasting light and her God her glory.
