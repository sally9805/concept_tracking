txt JOHN ADAMS , second President of the United States , died at the age of ninety-one , at the ancient seat of his family in Quincy , Massachusetts , on the 4th day of July , 1826 , a half century from the day on which he had affixed his signature to the Declaration of American Independence . Eight years before his death , after a union of fifty-four years , he was bereaved of his wife , one of the illustrious women of New England , in that great day of its heroes and heroines . The work before us is a small selection from her letters . Prefixed to them is a Memoir , which , while it is a beautiful specimen in that department of writing , affords valuable illustration to the contents of the volume . Mrs. Abigail Adams was the second daughter of the Reverend William Smith , the Congregational clergyman of Weymouth , a village on the coast of Massachusetts Bay , bordering * Since writing the preceding pages , we have been favored by a literary friend with a biographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and we do not feel disposed to alter it . But the following dates may , per . haps , not be uninteresting . Manzoni is a grandson of the celebrated Beccana . He was born in 1784 , and was married in 1808 to a Protestant lady of Geneva , who subsequently embraced the creed of her husband . His first publications were two short poems in blank verse . In 1810 he published his " Inni Sacri , " five sacred lyrics , of which two at least are of a very high order ; in 1820 , the " Conte di Carmagnola , " and , in 1823 , the " Adelchi , " two tragedies which have been more admired by foreigners than by Italians . An Ode upon Napoleon , which we shall not hesitate to call the finest that ever has been written upon that difficult subject , was published about the same time . He has also written a defence of the Catholic religion in reply to some passages in Sismondi , and a disquisition on some questions in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now married to a second wife . // upon Quincy , and about twelve miles from Boston . Educated at a time when there was no public provision in the colonies for the instruction of females , her opportunities for intellectual culture were only such as could be found in private reading , and the society of her family friends . " I was never sent to any school , " she says to one of her correspondents ; " and female education , in the best families , went no further than writing and arithmetic ; in some few and rare instances , music and dancing . " In her twentieth year , in October , 1764 , she was married to Mr. John Adams . He was a young lawyer of rising reputation ; but , so far were her high destinies in this union from being anticipated , that it appears the disparity of rank between the minister 's daughter and the legal aspirant , presented some interruption to the course of that true love , which , for one reason or another , has never yet been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams , " we quote from the Memoir , " was a pious man , with something of that vein of humor , not uncommon among the clergy of New England , which ordinarily found such a field for exercise as is displayed in the pages of Cotton Mather . He was the father of three daughters , all of them women of uncommon force of intellect , though the fortunes of two of them confined its influence to a sphere much more limited than that which fell to the lot of Mrs. Adams It is an anecdote , told of Mr. Smith , that , upon the marriage of his eldest daughter Mary , he preached to his people from the text in the forty-second verse of the tenth chapter of Luke , And Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not he taken away from her .

Besides this , the family of Mr. Adams , the son of a small farmer of the middle class in Braintree , was // thought scarcely good enough to match with the minister 's daughter , descended from so many of the shining lights of the colony . It is probable that Mr. Smith was made aware of the opinions expressed among his people ; for he is said , immediately after the marriage took place , to have replied to them by a sermon , the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers , was drawn from Luke vii . 33 ; For John came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and ye say , He hath a devil . ' * " - Memoir , pp. xxxiv , xxxv . The first ten years of Mrs. Adams 's married life were passed in tranquil domestic happiness . In August , 1774 , her hushand , entering on that course of distinguished public service , which occupied him for nearly thirty years , repaired , as a delegate from Massachusetts , to the General Congress , while she remained at home , a witness and sharer of the severe sufferings of Boston and its neighhourhood in the early period of the revolutionary struggle . In the winter of 1777 - 8 , having made in the interval a few short visits to his family during the recesses of Congress , Mr. Adams sailed for France , as one of the commissioners to negotiate a treaty with that power , and remained abroad during the war , with the exception of a few weeks in the autumn of the following year . In 1784 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commerce , Mrs. Adams joined him there , and was introduced at court , the first female representative of her country in the diplomatic circles . Mr. Adams returned from Europe on the adoption of the Federal Constitution , and , having been elected Vice-President , fixed his winter residence for the sessions of Congress , first at New York , and then at Philadelphia . When , with the downfall of the Federal party in 1801 , he was superseded in the Presidency , he retired to finish his days at his early home . The small property , accumulated in his few years of professional practice , had been so judiciously administered hy his wife during his devotion to public duties , as to make the retreat of his declining years the seat of an easy independence , and of a modest hut liberal * * As this anecdote rests entirely upon tradition , it has been differently told , and it is here admitted in this form , rather as a characteristic feature of the age , and of the individual , than from any positive reliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants of Weymouth and Hingham , many stories of Mr. Smith 's application of texts , in a similar manner , to the events of the Revolution ; which render the truth of this far from improbable . " // hospitality . Mrs. Adams lived long enough to see her eldest son employed in some of the highest public trusts , though not to witness his elevation to the chief magistracy of the Union . The selection from her correspondence before us consists of letters written at different times between the years 1761 and 1814 . Most of them are addressed to Mr. Adams , two before their marriage , and others during his absence , in Congress , and abroad upon the public service . There are a few to her son , Mr. John Quincy Adams , while a child and youth , and the rest , with a small number of exceptions , are to her sisters and nieces in New England . They are charming specimens of epistolary composition ; and the last , by a matron of more than threescore and ten , does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vivacity , - in a comparison with the first by a girl of seventeen . But their chief value is of a different kind , and one which we should do injustice to indicate in any other words than those of the author of the Memoir . In every instance of domestic convulsions , and when the pruning-hook is deserted for the sword and musket , the sacrifice of feelings made by the female sex is unmixed with a hope of worldly compensation . With them there is no ambition to gratify , no fame to be gained by the simply negative virtue of privations suffered in silence . There is no action to drown in its noise and bustle a full sense of the pain that must inevitably attend it . The lot of woman , in times of trouble , is to be a passive spectator of events , which she can scarcely hope to make subservient to her own fame , or to control . " If it were possibW to get at the expression of feelings by women in the heart of a community , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently designed to be secret and confidential , this would seem to present the surest and most unfailing index to its general character . Hitherto we have not gathered much of this material in the United States . The dispersion of families , so common in America , the consequent destruction of private pa ers , the defective nature of female education before the Revolution , the difficulty and danger of free communication , and the engrossing character , to the men , of public , and to the women , of domestic cares , have all contributed to cut short , if not completely to destroy , the sources of information . It is truly remarked , in the present volume , that instances of patience , perseverance , fortitude , magnanimity , courage , humanity , and tenderness , which would have graced the Roman character , were known // only to those who were themselves the actors , and whose modesty could not suffer them to blazon abroad their own fame. ** The beroism of the females of the Revolution has gone from memory with the generation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the ear of the young of the present day , but the faint echo of an expiring general tradition . There is , rnoreove r , very little knowledge remaining to us of the domestic manners of the last century , when , with more of admitted distinctions than at present , there was more of general equality ; very little of the state of social feeling , or of that simplicity of intercourse , which , in colonial times , constituted in Ne*v England as near an approach to the successful exemnplification of the democratic theory , as the irregularity in the natural gifts of men will , in all probability , ever practically allow . C It is the purpose of the present volume to contribute something to the supply of this deficiency , by giving to tradition a form partially palpable . The present is believed to be the first attempt , in the United States , to lay before the public a series of private letters , written without the remotest idea of publication , by a woman , to her husband , and others of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fact , susceptible of no misconception , that they furnish an exact transcript of the feelings of the writer , in times of no ordinary trial . Independently of this , the variety of scenes in which she wrote , and the opportunities furnished for observation in the situations in which she was placed by the elevation of her husband to high official positions in the country , may contribute to sustain the interest with which they will be read . " - pp. xxiv - . xxvi . We select , for our first extract , a letter to Mr. Adams of May 24th , 1775 , five weeks after the battle of Lexington and Concord . It conveys a vivid idea of the disturbed state of things , which continued throughout that year in the writer 's neighbourhood . " I suppose you have had a formidable account of the alarm we had last Sunday morning . When I rose about six o'clock , I was told , that the drums had been some time beating , and that three alarm guns were fired ; that Weymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ringing . I immediately sent off an express to know the occasion , and found the whole town in confusion . Three sloops and one cutter had come out and dropped anchor just below Great Hill . It // was difficult to tell their designs ; some supposed they were coming to Germantown , others , to Weymouth ; people , women , children , from the iron-works , came flocking down this way every woman and child driven off from below my father 's ; my father 's family flying . The Doctor * is in great distress , as you may well imagine , for my aunt had her bed thrown into a cart into which she got herseig and ordered the boy to drive her to Bridgewater , which he did . The report was to them , that three hundred had landed , and were upon their march up into town . The alarm flew like lightning , and men from all parts came flocking down , till two thousand were collected . But , it seems , their expedition was to Grape Island for Levett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for want of boats ; but the sight of so many persons , and the firing at them , prevented their getting more than three tons of hay , though they had carted much more down to the water . At last a lighter was mustered , and a sloop from Hingham , which had six port-holes . Our men eagerly jumped on board , and put off for the island . As soon as they perceived it , they decamped . Our people landed upon the island , and in an instant set fire to the hay , which , with the barn , was soon consumed ; - about eighty tons , it is said . We expect soon to be in continual alarms , till something decisive takes place . We wait , with longing expectation , in hopes to hear the best accounts from you , with regard to union and harmony , &amp;c . We rejoice greatly on the arrival of Dr. Franklin , as he must certainly be able to inform you very particularly of the situation of affairs in England . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as particular as you may , when you write . Every one hereabouts comes to me , to hear what accounts I have . I was so unlucky , as not to get the letter you wrote at New York . Captain l3eale forgot it , and left it behind . We have a flying report here , with regard to New York , but can not give any credit to it , as yet , that they have been engaged with the ships , which Gage sent there , and had taken them , with great loss upon both sides . " Yesterday we had an account of three ships coming into Boston . I believe it is true , as there was a salute from the other ships , though I have not been to learn from whence they come . I suppose you have had an account of the fire , which did much damage to the warehouses , and added greatly to the distresses of the inhabitants , whilst it continued . The bad Dr. Cotton Tufts , of Weymouth , well known for many years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had married a daughter of Colonel John Quincy 's , and , therefore , a sister of Mrs. Adams 's mother . " // conduct of General Gage * was the means of its doing so much damage . Our house has been , upon this alarm , in the same scene of confusion , that it was upon the former . Soldiers coming in for a lodging , for breakfast , for supper , for drink , &amp;c . Sometimes refugees from Boston , tired and fatigued , seek an asylum for a day , a night , a week . You can hardly imagine how we live ; yet To the houseless child of want Our doors are open still ; And , though our portions are but scant , We give them with good will . ' " My best wishes attend you , both for your health and happiness , and that you may be directed into the wisest and best measures for our safety , and the security of our posterity . I wish you were nearer to us ; we know not what a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw us into . Hitherto I have been able to maintain a calmness and presence of mind , and hope I shall , let the exigency of the time be what it will . Adieu , breakfast calls . " - pp. 32-35 . Her woman 's heart does not fail her in all these distresses . Courage , " she writes in the next letter , " I know we have in abundance ; and conduct , I hope we shall not want ; but powder , - where shall we get a sufficient supply ? I wish we may not fail there . " The following relates to the battle of Bunker 's Hill . " Sunday , 18 June , 1775 . " DEAREST FRIEND , " The day , - perhaps , the decisive day , - is come , on which the fate of America depends . My bursting heart must find vent at my pen . I have just heard , that our dear friend , Dr. Warren , is no more , but fell gloriously fighting for his country ; saying , better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallows . Great is our loss . He has distinguished himself in every engagement , by his courage and fortitude , by animating the soldiers , and leading them on by his own example . A particular account of these dreadful , but I hope glorious days will be transmitted you , no doubt , in the exactest manner . The race is not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong but the God of Israel is he , that givetli strength and power *I* He had taken the engines under guard , in consequence of a report , that the liberty party inteuded to lire the town .

The battle began upon our intrenchments upon Bunker 's Hill , Saturday morning about three o'clock , and has not ceased yet , and it is now three o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over the Neck to-night , and a dreadful battle must ensue . Almighty God , cover the heads of our countrymen , arid be a shield to our dear friends How many have fallen , we know not . The constant roar of the cannon is so distressing , that we can not eat , drink , or sleep . May we be supported and sustained in the dreadful conflict . I shall tarry here till it is thought unsafe by my friends , and then I have secured myself a retreat at your brother 's , who has kindly offered me part of his house . I can not compose myself to write any further at present . I will add more as I hear further . " Tuesday Afternoon . " I have been so much agitated , that I have not been able to write since Sabbath day .

I must close , as the Deacon waits . I have not pretended to be particular with regard to what I have heard , because I know you will collect better intelligence . The spirits of the people are very good ; the loss of Charlestown affects them no more than a drop of the bucket . " - pp. 39-41 . Mrs. Adams 's first impressions , from an interview with the Commander-in-chief , soon after his arrival , are recorded in the following terms . " I was struck with General Washington . You had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I thought the half was not told me . Dignity with ease and complacen // cy , the gentleman and soldier , look agree ably blended in him . Modesty marks every line and feature of his face . rfhose lines of Dryden instantly occurred to me Mark his majestic fabric ! he s a temple Sacred by birth , and built by hands divine ; His soul s the deity that lodges there ; Nor is the pile unworthy of the god . ' " - pp. 51 , 52 . In the autumn of this year , the horrors of pestilence in the lately peaceful and happy neighbourhood , were added to those of war . An epidemic dysentery , which first appeared in Boston , extended its ravages through the adjoining towns . Mrs. Adams was severely attacked , and only recovered to become the sole nurse of three persons under her own roof . A domestic died , and about the same time her mother , to whom she was tenderly attached . The severity of this latter affliction may be judged from the language in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon me . Have pity upon me , 0 thou my beloved , for the hand of God presseth me sore . " Yet will I be dumb and silent , and not open my mouth , because thou , 0 Lord , hast done it . " How can I tell you , ( 0 my bursting heart ! ) that my dear mother has left me - this day , about five o'clock , she left this world for an infinitely better . " After sustaining sixteen days ' severe conflict , nature fainted , and she fell asleep . Blessed spirit ! where art thou ? At times , I am almost ready to faint under this severe and heavy stroke , separated from thee , who used to be a comforter to me in affliction ; but , blessed be God , his ear is not heavy that he can not hear , but be has bid us call upon him in time of trouble .

My sisters send their love to you , and are greatly afflicted . You often expressed your anxiety for me when you left me before , surrounded with terrors ; but my trouble then was as the small dust in the balance , compared to what I have since endured . I hope to be properly mindful of the correcting hand , that I may not be rebuked in anger . " You will pardon and forgive all my wanderings of mind , I can not be correct . T is a dreadful time with the whole province . Sickness and death are in almost every family . I have no more shocking // and terrible idea of any distemper , except the plague , than this .

" Saturday Evening , 2 March , 1776 . " I dare say there would be no difficulty in procuring a vote and instructions from all the Assemblies in New England for Independency . I most sincerely wish , that now , in the lucky moment , it might be done . " I have been kept in a continual state of anxiety and expectation , ever since you left me . It has been said to-morrow ' and to-morrow ' for this month , but when the dreadful to-morrow will be , I know not . But hark The house this instant shakes with the roar of cannon . I have been to the door and find it is a cannonade from our army . Orders , I find , are come for all the remainino militia to repair to the lines Monday night by twelve o'clock . No sleep for me to night . And if I can not , who have no guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall the miserable wretches , who have been the procurers of this dreadful scene , and those who are to be the actors , lie down with the load of guilt upon their souls " Sunday Evening , 3 March . " I went to bed after twelve , but got no rest ; the cannon continued firing , and my heart beat pace with them all night . We have had a pretty quiet day , but what to-morrow will bring forth , God only knows . " Monday Evening . " Tolerably quiet . To-day the militia have all mustered , with three days ' provision , and all are marched by three o'clock this afternoon , though their notice was no longer ago than eight o'clock , Saturday . And now we have scarcely a man , but our regular guards , either in Weymouth , Hingham , Braintree , or Milton , and the militia from the more remote towns are called in as seacoast guards . Can you form to yourself an idea of our sensations " I have just returned from Penn 's Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cannon , and from whence I could see every shell which was thrown . The sound , I think , is one of the grandest in nature , and is of the true species of the sublime . T is now an incessant roar ; but 0 the fatal // ideas , which are connected with the sound ! How many of our dear countrymen must fall Tuesday Morning . " I went to bed about twelve , and rose again a little after one . I could no more sleep , than if I had been in the engagement ; the rattling of the windows , the jar of the house , the continual roar of twenty-four pounders , and the bursting of shells , give us such ideas , and realize a scene to us of which we could form scarcely any conception . About six this morning , there was quiet . I rejoiced in a few hours ' calm . I hear we got possession of Dorchester hill last night ; four thousand men upon it to-day ; lost but one man . The ships are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more terrible scene still . I sometimes think I can not stand it . I wish myself with you , out of hearing , as I can not assist them . I hope to give you joy of Boston , even if it is in ruins , before I send this away . I am too much agitated to write as I ought , and languid for want of rest . " - pp. 88 - 90 . The letters of Mrs. Adams , which hitherto we have extracted , were all addressed to her husband . The following , to her son John Quincy Adams , who , then a boy in his eleventh year , accompanied his father to France in 1778 , reveals her admirable character in a not less interesting aspect . *CMy DEAR SON , " T is almost four months since you left your native land and embarked upon the mighty waters , in quest of a foreign country . Although I have not particularly written to you since , yet you may be assured you have constantly been upon my heart and mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear son , for a tender parent to bring her mind to part with a child of your years going to a distant land ; nor could I have acquiesced in such a separation under any other care than that of the most excellent parent and guardian who accompanied you . You have arrived at years capable of improving under the advantages you will be likely to have , if you do but properly attend to them . They are talents put into your hands , of which an account will be required of you hereafter ; and , being possessed of one , two , or four , see to it that you double your numbers . " The most amiable and most useful disposition in a young mind is diffidence of itself ; and this should lead you to seek advice and instruction from him , who is your natural guardian , and will always counsel and direct you in the best manner , both foVyour present and future happiness . You are in pos // session of a natural good understanding , and of spirits unbroken by adversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful knowledge and virtue , such as will render you an ornament to society , an honor to your country , and a blessing to your parents . Great learning and superior abilities , should you ever possess them , will be of little value and small estimation , unless virtue , honor , truth , and integrity are added to them . Adhere to those religious sentiments and principles which were early instilled into your mind , and remember that you are accountable to your Maker for all your words and actions . " Let me enjoin it upon you to attend constantly and steadfastly to the precepts and instructions of your father , as you value the happiness of your mother and your own welfare . His care and attention to you render many things unnecessary for me to write , which I might otherwise do ; but the inadvertency and heedlessness of youth require line upon line and precept upon precept , and , when enforced by the joint efforts of both parents , will , I hope , have a due influence upon your conduct ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much rather you should have found your grave in the ocean you have crossed , or that any untimely death crop you in your infant years , than see you an immoral , profligate , or graceless child . " You have entered early in life upon the great theatre of the world , which is full of temptations and vice of every kind . You are not wholly unacquainted with history , in which you have read of crimes which your inexperienced mind could scarcely believe credible . You have been taught to think of them with horror , and to view vice as a monster of so frightful mien , That , to be hated , needs but to be seen . ' " Yet you must keep a strict guard upon yourself , or the odious monster will soon lose its terror by becoming familiar to you . The modern history of our own times , furnishes as black a list of crimes , as can be paralleled in ancient times even if we go back to Nero , Caligula , or C*esar Borgia . Young as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been compelled by the haughty tyrant of Britain and the bloody emissaries of his vengeance , may stamp upon your mind this certain truth , that the welfare and prosperity of all countries , communities , and , I may add , individuals , depend upon their morals . That nation to which we were once united , as it has departed from justice , eluded and subverted the wise laws which formerly governed it , and suffered the worst of crimes to go unpunished , has lost // its valor , wisdom , and humanity , and , from being the dread and terror of Europe , has sunk into derision and infamy . But to quit political subjects , I have been greatly anxious for your safety , having never heard of the frigate since she sailed , till , about a week ago , a New York paper informed , that she was taken and carried into Plymouth . I did not fully credit this report , though it gave me much uneasiness . I yesterday heard that a French vessel was arrived at Portsmouth , which brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wants confirmation . I hope it will not he long before I shall be assured of your safety . You must write me an account of your voyage , of your situation , and of every thing entertaining you can recollect . " Be assured Lam most affectionately yours . " - pp. 122-125. * * * * " Your father 's letters came to Salem , yours to Newburyport , and soon gave ease to my anxiety , at the same time that it excited gratitude and thankfulness to Heaven , for the preservation you all experienced in the imminent dangers which threatened you . You express in both your letters a degree of thankfulness . I hope it amounts to more than words , and that you will never be insensible to the particular preservation you have experienced in both your voyages . You have seen how inadequate the aid of man would have been , if the winds and the seas had not been under the particular government of that Being , who stretched out the heavens as a span , ' who holdeth the ocean in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings of the wind . ' If you have a due sense of your preservation , your next consideration will be , for what purpose you are continued in life . It is not to rove from clime to clime , to gratify an idle curiosity ; but every new mercy you receive is a new debt upon you , a new obligation to a diligent discharge of the various relations in which you stand connected ; in the first place , to your great Preserver ; in the next , to society in general ; in particular to your country , to your parents , and to yourself . " The only sure and permanent foundation of virtue is religion . Let this important truth be engraven upon your heart . And also , that the foundation of religion is the belief of the one only God , and a just sense of his attributes , as a being infinitely wise , just , and good , to whom you owe the highest reverence , gratitude , and adoration ; who superintends and governs all nature , even to clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravens when they cry ; but more particu // larly regards man , whom he created after his own image , and breathed into him an immortal spirit , capable of a happiness beyond the grave for the attainment of which he is hound to the performance of certain duties , which all tend to the happiness and welfare of society , and are comprised in one short sentence , expressive of universal benevolence , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . ' " " Justice , humanity , and benevolence are the duties you owe to society in general . To your country the same duties are incumbent upon you , with the additional obligation of sacrificing ease , pleasure , wealth , and life itself for its defence and security . To your parents you owe love , reverence , and obedience to all just and equitable commands . To yourselghere , indeed , is a wide field to expatiate upon . To l ) ecome what you ought to be , and what a fond mother wishes to see you , attend to some precepts and instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive but your welfare and happiness , and who wishes in this way to supply to you the personal watchfulness and care , which a separation from you deprived you of at a period of life , when habits are easiest acquired and fixed and , though the advice may not be new , yet stiffer it to obtain a place in your memory , for occasions may offer , and perhaps some concurring circumstances unite , to give it weight and force . Suffer me to recommend to you one of the most useful lessons of life , the knowledge and study of yourself . There you run the greatest hazard of being deceived . Self-love and partiality cast a mist before the eyes , and there is no knowledge so hard to be acquired , nor of more benefit when once thoroughly understood . Ungoverned passions have aptly been compared to the boisterous ocean , which is known to produce the most terrible effects . Passions are the elements of life , ' but elements which are subject to the control of reason . Whoever will candidly examine themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or obstinacy in their natural tempers . You will seldom find these disagreeable ingredients all united in one ; but the uncontrolled indulgence of either is sufficient to render the possessor unhappy in himself , and disagreeable to all who are so unhappy as to be witnesses of it , or suffer from its effects . " You , my dear son , are formed with a constitution feelingly alive ; your passions are strong and impetuous ; and , though I have sometimes seen them hurry you into excesses , yet with pleasure I have observed a frankness and generosity accompany your efforts to govern and subdue them . Few persons are so subject to passion , but that they can command themselves , // when they have a motive sufficiently strong ; and those who are most apt to transgress will restrain themselves through respect and reverence to superiors , and even , where they wish to recommend themselves , to their equals . The due government of the passions , has been considered in all ages as a most valuable acquisition . Hence an inspired writer observes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mighty ; and he that ruleth his spirit , than he that taketh a city . ' This passion , coL*perating with power , and unrestrained by reason , has produced the subversion of cities , the desolation of countries , the massacre of nations , and filled the world with injustice and oppression . Behold your own country , your native land , suffering from the effects of lawless power and malignant passions , and learn betimes , from your own observation and experience , to govern and control yourself . Having once obtained this self-government , you will find a foundation laid for happiness to yourself and usefulness to mankind . Virtue alone is happiness below ; ' and consists in cultivating and improving every good inclination , and in checking and subduing every propensity to evil .

" MY DEAREST FRiEND , " The family are all retired to rest ; the busy scenes of the day are over ; a day which I wished to have devoted in a particular manner to my dearest friend ; but company falling in prevented it , nor could I claim a moment until this silent watch of the night . " Look , ( is there a dearer name than friend ? Think of it for me , ) look to the date of this letter , and tell me , what are the thoughts which arise in your mind ? Do you not recollect , that eighteen years have run their circuit since we pledged our mutual faith to each other , and the hymeneal torch was lighted at the altar of Love ? Yet , yet it burns with unabating fervor . Old Ocean has not quenched it , nor old Time smothered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ; it comforts me even in the gloom which sometimes possesses my mind . " It is , my friend , from the remembrance of the joys I have lost , that the arrow of affliction is pointed . I recollect the untitled man , to whom I gave my heart , and , in the agony of recollection , when time and distance present themselves together , wish he had never been any other . Who shall give me back time ? Who shall compensate to me those years I can not recall ? How dearly have I paid for a titled husband Should I wish you less wise , that I might enjoy more happiness ? I can not find that in my heart . Yet Providence has wisely placed the real blessings of life within the reach of moderate abilities ; and he who is wiser than his neighbour sees so much more to pity and lament , that I doubt whether the balance of happiness is in his scale . " I feel a disposition to quarrel with a race of beings who have cut me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only society I delighted in . Yet no man liveth for himself , ' says an authority I will not dispute . Let me draw satisfaction from this source , and , instead of murmuring and repining at my lot , consider it in a more pleasing view . Let me suppose , that the same gracious Being , who first smiled upon our union and blessed us in each other , endowed my friend with powers and talents for the benefit of mankind , and gave him a willing mind to improve them for the service of his country . You have obtained honor and reputation at home and abroad . 0 ! may not an inglorious peace wither the laurels you have won .

The early possession you obtained there , and the absolute power you have ever maintained over it , leave not the smallest space unoccupied . I look back to the early days of our acquaintance and friendship , as to the days of love and innocence , and , with an indescribable pleasure , I have seen near a score of years roll over our heads , with an affection heightened and improved by time ; nor have the dreary years of absence in the smallest degree effaced from my mind the image of the dear , untitled man to whom I gave my heart . I can not sometimes refrain considering the honors with which he is invested , as badges of my unhappiness . The unbounded confidence I have in your attachment to me and the dear pledges of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your absence more supportable ; for , had I loved you with the same affection , it must have been misery to have doubted .

I recollected myself a moment , and then spoke the real dictates of ray heart . If I had known , Sir , that Mr. Adams could have effected what he has done , I would not only have submitted to the absence I have endured , painful as it has been , but I would not have opposed it , even though three years more should be added to the number , ( which Heaven avert ! ) I feel a l ) leasure in being able to sacrifice my selfish passions to the general good , and in imitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family but as the small dust of the balance , when compared with the great community .

' My imagination was wandering to Paris , ruminating upon the long , long absence of my dear son and*his parent , so that I was rather inattentive to what he said , until he repeated , // ( J have letters for you from abroad . ' The word abroad , ' roused my attention , and I eagerly seized the letters , the handwriting and seal of which gave me hopes , that I was once more about to hear from my young wanderer ; nor was I disa ) ointed .

Four years have already passed away since you left your native land and this rural cottage ; humble indeed when compared to the palaces you have visited , and the pomp you have been witness to ; but I dare say , you have not been so inattentive an observer as to suppose , that sweet peace and contentment can not inhabit the lowly roof and bless the tranquil inhabitants , equally guarded and protected in person and property in this happy country as those who reside in the most elegant and costly dwellings . If you live to return , I can form to myself an idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting every place your early years were accustomed wantonly to gambol in ; even the rocky common and lowly whortleberry bush will not be without their beauties . My anxieties have been and still are great , lest the numerous temptations and snares of vice should vitiate your early habits of virtue , and destroy those principles , which you are now capable of reasoning upon , and discerning the beauty and utility of , as the only rational source of happiness here , or foundation of felicity hereafter . Placed as we are in a transitory scene of probation , drawing nigher and still nigher day after day to that important crisis which must introduce us into a new system of things , it ought certainly to be our principal concern to become qualified for our expected dignity .

Be thankful to a kind Providence , who has hitherto preserved the lives of your parents , the natural guardians of your youthful years . With gratitude I look up to Heaven , blessing the hand which continued to me my dear and honored parents until I was settled in life ; and , though now I regret the loss of them , and daily feel the want of their advice and assistance , I can not suffer as I should have done , if I had been early deprived of them .

" I received letters from your father last evening , dated in Paris the 10th of September , informing me of the necessity of his continuance abroad this winter . The season is so far advanced that I readily sacrifice the desire of seeing him to his safety ; a voyage upon this coast at this season is fraught with dangers . He has made me a request , that I dare not comply with at present .

If I should find your father fixed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two longer , the earnest desire I have to meet him and my dear son might overcome the reluctance I feel at the idea of engaging in a new scene , and the love I have for domestic attachments and the still calm of life .

In the summer of 1784 , as we have already mentioned , Mrs. Adams left home to join her husband , who had been appointed minister to England . On hoard ship , though almost disabled by sea-sickness , and incommoded by more than a common share of the other d*sagn*mens incident to a passage across the Atlantic in those days , she , with her habitual industry and consideration for the happiness of bet friends , began a journal , which was continued through several weeks . It is given entire in the present volume , and is followed , by several long letters , principally addressed from England and France to her female friends , communicating , with a sort of continuity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make one of the most agreeable records of a traveller 's experiences in a foreign country that are to be found in print . Mrs. Adams would anywhere have been a quick observer , arid lively delineator , of life , scenery , accidents , and manners ; but the interest of her journal is much enhanced by the peculiarity of that position , from which ( experienced in life , but new to courts , - exalted in station , but a novice in society ,  --  highly intellectual , but simply bred ,  - -  the New England village wife of one who had shaken the thrones by which they now stood together , ) she made her observations upon foreign men , modes , and institutions ; and that too at a period , which has already become historical , and of which perhaps no other such record remains from the pen of an American observer , - certainly none from any observer occupying the same advantageous point of view . We can not undertake to indicate the most attractive portions of what is throughout highly entertaining or instructive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day are brought before the view , and now modes of dress and ceremony are sketched with a distinctness , of which only the female hand is capable . We must , however , give our readers one glance at the octogenarian sage , who " Eripuit crab fulmen , sceptrumque tyrannis. " // As to the people here , " writes Mrs. Adams , " they are more given to hospitality than in England , it is said . 1 have been in company with but one French lady since I arrived for strangers here make the first visit , and nobody will know you until you have waited upon them in form . " This lady I dined with at Dr. Franklin 's . She entered the room with a careless , jaunty air ; upon seeing ladies who were strangers to her , she bawled out , Ah mon Dieu , where is Franklin ? Why did you not tell me there were ladies here ? You must suppose her speaking all this in French . How I look said she , taking hold of a chemise made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lutestring , and which looked as much upon the decay as her beauty , for she was once a handsome woman ; her hair was frizzled ; over it she had a small straw hat , with a dirty gauze half-handkerchief round it , and a bit of dirtier gauze , than ever my maids wore , was bowed on behind . She had a black gauze scarf thrown over her shoulders . She ran out of the room ; when she returned , the Doctor entered at one door , she at the other ; upon which she ran forward to him , caught him by the hand , Helas Franklin ; then gave him a double kiss , one upon each cheek , and another upon his forehead . When we went into the room to dine , she was placed between the Doctor and Mr. Adams . She carried as the chief of the conversation at dinner , frequently locking her hand into the Doctor 's , and sometimes spreading her arms upon the backs of both the gentlemen 's chairs , then throwing her arm carelessly upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly astonished at this conduct , if the good Doctor had not told me that in this lady I should see a genuine Frenchwoman , wholly free from affectation or stiffness of behaviour , and one of the best women in the world .

I own I was highly disgusted , and never wish for an acquaintance with any ladies of this cast . After dinner she threw herself upon a settee , where she showed more than her feet . She had a little lap-dog , who was , next to the Doctor , her favorite , and whom she kissed . This is one of the Doctor 's most intimate friends , with whom he dines once every week , and she with him . She is rich , and is my near neighbour but I have not yet visited her .

I asked him after Hurnphreys , from whom I knew he had received despatches a few days before . He said that he was well , and at Lisbon .

On the 8th day of Fehruary , 1797 , Mr. Adams , as President of the Senate , was to count the votes of the electoral colleges , and announce himself President elect of the United States .

We are not satisfied with this volume . We are not satisfied , because it gives us a sharp appetite for more of the same kind . As a picture of past times , as an exhibition of an extraordinary character , as a contribution to the public history of the country , it has great attraction and value . We trust that the Editor will not fail to increase his claims upon the gratitude of the readers of this selection , by greatly extending it in a future edition@@184058878.txt THE previous writings of Mr. Fay had not prepared us for the superior merit of the work before us . He has been favorably known as a contributor to the pages of the New York " Mirror , " that magazine of agreeable but very light literature . His writings were always pleasing , sometimes pointed and sprightly , but never powerful . They were very good for whiling away a half hour 's leisure , in the intervals of some laborious occupation ; they refreshed the wearied spirit like the afternoon siesta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never rose above a comn ) onplace purity and precision , which neither roused a lively interest , nor shocked a fastidious taste . The reader never thought of resorting to Mr. Fay for animated description , profound sentiment , or vigorous delineation of character . We were never thrilled by a brilliant expression that betrayed , like a flash of lightning , the depths of a fervid genius , or by a new and sparkling combination of thought , through which shone the radiance of a poetic soul , " of imagination all compact . " But we never threw aside his writings , disgusted by those fantastic barbarisms of speech which deform so many popular works of the day , or by those moral paradoxes , which are as offensive to the judgment and principles of sober-minded men , as they are fascinating to the perverted feelings and crude conceptions of the small-brained and long-haired young gentlemen , who set up , with the most entertaining self-complacency , and the most oracular unmeaningness of language , for the arbiters of taste , philosophy , and poetry . His powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of literature and society , but not for diving into the depths of life , and bringing up the priceless pearls of thought ; and his style was well adapted for the graceful utterance of superficial observation , and for the slight and rather water-colored descriptions with which his works abotinded . His command over the resources of the English language appeared to be extremely limited . The ornaments of a copious vocabulary never seemed to be within his reach . His sentences were short , unimaginative , and dry . We were never roused by // an eloquent paragraph , whose majestic sweep of words , and brilliant array of imagery , carried us away like a fine sti'ain of organ music . Our feelings were never raised beyond a state of comfortable repose , nor ever sunk much below it . Thus the general character of Mr. Fay 's writings seemed to place him among those who contribute to the amusement of the moment , without leaving a permanent trace of their minds upon the literature of their country and age ; who pass , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to be seen for a day , and forgotten for ever ; graceful figures in the panorama of contemporary literature , but too insignificant to be included in the great historical picture which transmits to posterity the mighty intellectual representation of an age . But Mr. Pay 's literary powers have produced fruits much richer than their early promise . Longer experience of life , greater practice in composition , and increased familiarity with the best models of European literature , have given him a vigorous impulse , and unfolded his talents in a surprising manner . His observations have gone deeper , his reflections are more weighty , and his power of conceiving and representing the successive scenes of a narrative has grown stronger than we had any reason to anticipate . In forming the idea of a character also , and in setting it forth by appropriate action , he has shown a remarkable progress . Formerly his characters were faintly-drawn , unsubstantial figures , flitting before his reader 's mind , and vanishing away like the unreal mockery of a dream . Now they are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tremble with the passions , of natural men and women ; they show the real qualities which living beings display to the observer , and act from the real motives which form the springs of conduct in social life . His narrative is animated and interesting ; the incidents are well selected , and judiciously arranged ; and the plot is put together with a more instructed eye to the proper combination of parts , and to the general effect . We are the more gratified to notice this progress , because Mr. Pay has always manifested a high moral sense ; and we have entire confidence that his powers , to whatever point they may he unfolded , will never be desecrated by ministering to the cause of vice ; that he will never render the artistic talent he possesses the means of embellishing voluptuous sentiment , or imbecility of heart ; and that whatever comes from his pen will breathe the spirit of manly virtue . // " The Countess Ida " is a work , we think , which will give iMr . Fay a triuch higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this interesting tale has suggested the observations which we have just made ; and we think our readers , who shall examine the book , will sustain our opinion of the great increase of power which he has manifested in its composition . The intention of the writer , as stated in his short Preface , was " to illustrate a principle , and to record his protest against a useless and barbarous custom , which , to the shame of his own country , exists there in a less modified form , than the good sense and good taste of lEtiropean communities , to say nothing of their moral and religious feeling , would sanction elsewhere . " The custom alluded to is that of duelling ; and the plot of the novel is constructed for the purpose of showing the wickedness and horrors of the system , and the possibility of resisting a practice founded upon a false sense of honor , and of meeting calmly , hearing patiently , and conquering triumphantly the reproaches , the taunts , the contempt , and the infamy which a conscientious obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooted prejudices of society , never fails to hring down upon the bead of the brave man who dares to be called a coward . The story is managed with considerable art ; the incidents are generally well devised ; and the catastrophe does ample poetic justice all round . Some scenes in the course of the narrative show a masterly skill in the grouping of terrific circumstances , which make one 's hair stand on end ; some of the perils to which the bero is exposed , and some of his niarvellous escapes , border too closely , perhaps , on the impossible . We may as well remark , before we proceed to a closer examination of the structure of the novel , that , in common with all works of fiction designed to illustrate a principle , it betrays here and there the forcing l ) i'ocess by which things are artificially compelled to bear upon the moral or dogmatic aim of the author . This is a defect , which it would seem almost , if not quite , impossible for an author to escape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trains of incident in his plot straight forward to a didactic conclusion ; and it really injures the moral effect of the work as much as it detracts from its beauty as a work of art . All the bad characters of such a work are very apt to be insufferably bad // all the good characters to be insufferably good . All the bad characters turn out so badly as to be an " awful beacon " to the rising generation , and all the good characters turn out so well as to offer a handsome premium upon virtue to all the nice little boys who are favored by its perusal . Miss Edgeworth 's " Patronage " is a good illustration of the truth of this remark . The good family are all too good ; and the bad are really too bad ; arid the result to both bears an exact mathematical proportion to their respective virtues and vices . It is arrived at by solving the problem of the story upon the principles of a sort of moral Rule of Three . In the one family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young doctor is sure to cure the disease , or to operate successfully upon the broken leg intrusted to his care ; and the young ladies we know from the first will inevitably be splendidly and happily married . The other family is the exact reverse of all this . We can take our oath at the outset that the son will turn out a dishonest blockhead , the daughter will wed miserably , and the whole family will go to perdition . Mr. Fay 's novel is chargeable with this same defect . One class of characters are encircled with a halo of preternatural light ; and another wrapped in the fold of preternatural moral darkness . The virtuous personages , after a period of dreadful suffering , are rewarded with a degree of happiness and of worldly prosperity , by which we feel that their past woes are more than counterbalanced ; the villains are plunged into an abyss of retributive misery , which almost obliterates the sense of their damning misdeeds . But this does not mark the hook so distinctly , as the corresponding trait characterizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many parts of Mr. Pay 's novel are conceived and executed with a freedom and spirit , which show that truth to nature was the author 's only guide ; many scenes and descriptions are thrown off with a vigor of coloring that expresses only the rapid movement , and the unbiassed , unconscious impulse , of the inspiration of genius . And these are certainly the best pairs of the novel ; best , because we feel them to be the truest representations of human life and human nature . For the actual events that pass around us , though they never fail to inculcate moral truth , yet never do this broadly and directly . The instructions furnished by them are drawn from hints , and intimations , more or less distinct , but // never set forth with the formality of a systematic code . We find nowhere in human life a series of events arranged with an apparent moral plan , forming a scheme of logical completeness , and winding up with a moral truth , so pointedly uttered , that there is no gainsaying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative of nature and life , since its means are limited , and human powers work within a comparatively narrow range , while nature and life sweep through all ages , yet the poet and writer of fiction ought to conform , as much as circumstances admit , to their prototype ; they must not let the element of art , which they add to nature , predominate over the great basis of all works of poetry and fiction , nature itself . This is just the danger , to which the creations of fiction constructed to illustrate a principle are most exposed , and from which no author , who has written after this method , has wholly escaped . The time of the opening of this story is the year 1790 . Several of the most important characters are brought together in the diligence , which ran between Hamburg and Berlin . A handsome young man , a respectable middle-aged lady , and a family of vulgar English travellers , find themselves fellow-passengers on the journey to the Prussian capital . Nothing very special happens to them on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been many times before , and has been many times since . A conversation of some interest , however , springs up between the handsome young man and the respectable middle-aged lady , from which it appears , that she is closely connected , whether by relationship or by some other tie does not yet appear , with a noble family in Berlin , to the head of which our young gentleman had letters of introduction . It turns out , however , that the lady has been for many bearing , at the period of the commencement of the story , the name of 1'v'ladame Wharton . Our hero 's name , it should be mentioned , is Mr. Wyndham . In the course of conversation , the interesting and important fact is brought to light , that Count Carolan has a beautiful daughter , at the enchanting age of eighteen ; and that she is already engaged to a young English nobleman , Lord Elkington , " about two-and-twenty ; a fashionable , elegant young man , of distinguished manners , and very fond of Ida , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades of night descend // upon the &amp;hnellzvagen , and the passengers very unceremoniously go to sleep , " nodding and bobbing to each other in the dark , not greatly disturbed by the frequent change of horses , the sounding horn , and the various other noises which one might suppose sufficient to drive tired nature 's sweet restorer from any eyelids . " Our hero arrives at Berlin , and becomes at once a distinguished ornament of the highest society in that aristocratic capital . Among the visiters there , are Lord Elkington , and his mother , the Countess of Beverly , the former being , as before stated , the suitor of the beautiful Ida . The plot begins immediately to thicken . Lady Beverly is seized by an unaccountable and uncontrollable emotion upon seeing Mr. Wyndham . Mr. Wyndbain , notwithstanding sundry grave admonitions from Madame Wharton , who has been led on by a mysterious feeling to take the deepest interest in his fate , falls desperately in love with Ida ; and Ida herself experiences very strange feelings , such as she never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Elkington , she falls in love with our hero too , without knowing what is the matter . Things are now in as fine a train as heart can desire . The entanglement increases , and the real qualities of the personages in the tale are gradually , and not unskilfully brought to light , as the successive events come forth . Lord Elkington turns out a cheat at cards , a ruffian , a debauchee ; in short , every thing that is bad . Wyndham , a man of high honor , undaunted courage , and deep piety . But a mystery hangs over his birth , which he has never been able to fathom . He has been educated by the kindness of a friend , and is now supported by some person unknown , who lodges at a banker 's an annual allowance of five hundred pounds . By degrees , through the malice of his enemies , suspicions are thrown upon his character ; his fair fame is slandered , and he refuses to call the offender to account in the mode adopted by gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he is branded both as a coward and an impostor , he is shunned by the fashionable friends who were so obsequious to him before , and is doomed to meet even " altered friendship 's half-averted eye . " He bears up heroically tinder these accumulated sufferings , and finally receives a blow from his inexorable enemy , Lord Elkington , xvbo has observed the feelings of mutual , though unconscious , attachment between Ida and him , and who is determined to drive him into a duel . For a moment , his // resolution is staggered . The stunning sense of personal dishonor almost uninans him , and the passage wherein this is described is one of decided power . A blow . This was the blasting thought which filled Claude 's mind as he bent his steps he scarce knew whither . He was in a state of agitation which he had never experienced before . He had no longer any power over his reason . His thoughts were tossed to and fro by a whirlwind . He felt , for the moment , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart out of Elkington 's bosom ! He did not recognise himself . He appeared in his own eyes a dinon , so dreadfully does unrestrained passion metamorphose even the most rational . All his calm grandeur , - his sense of right , - his reasoning powers , - his resolutions of duty , - his dependence on God , - they were all gone . There was the same difference between his mind then , and as it usually was in its peaceful moments , as between the tall and gently advancing ship , with sails set , each rope in its place , obedient to the helm , and rising and falling on the summer waves ; and the same vessel in a fearful tempest , its sails rent to pieces , its masts down , its rudder broken , and its deck swept by huge waves which threaten instant destruction . He could only think one thought , - he could only breathe one word , - .12 blow ! He thought to seek Elkington and sacrifice him on the spot . " He resolved to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . He went to his room , he flung himself on his bed , but it heaved beneath him , and fire flashed from his eyes and temples , and faces of a laughing crowd jeered and grinned around , and the finger of the scornful Elkington pointed at him , and people shouted in his ear in all sorts of tones , A blow a blow The voice of hate muttered it ; it was shrieked as if by despair ; friendship seemed to utter it with an inflection of inquiry and incredulity ; it came to him with the laugh of childhood and from the scornful lips of women , - .12 blow ! a blow ! ' It is a dream ! he murmured , and he arose from his bed . The heat in his body was intolerable . The very air he breathed seemed hot and burning . He threw off his coat , his vest he unloosed his cravat and shirt-collar , and sat down by the open window . But he could not sit still , - he could not lie , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its limits ; and he strided to and fro , turning against the walls as a wearied and enraged lion paces the small floor of his iron cage , with a tread and a heart that should be upon the burning desert , or the unexplored , unbounded wood . At length he threw himself upon the naked floor , conscious that movement only fanned the fire within him . // " A blow ,  --  a blow ! Let me think of it ! ' " And , for a moment , the whirl and tumult of his mind subsided a little , and gave place to something like continuous reflection . " No , ' he thought , it is a dream , - that blasting stroke upon my brow , - a dream ? He raised his band to his face . He became conscious of a dim sense of pain now for the first time , and , on passing his fingers over it , he found the eye much swollen . He closed the other , and looked out of the *vindoxv with that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague appearance of light was all he could distinguish . The beautiful transparent air , - the bending sky , - the moon riding calmly over all the shocks of earth , - they were lost and fused together , without beauty or separate distinctness . The idea struck him that perhaps the wound was irreparable ; perhaps the eye was blind . No ! no ! it was no dream ! It was a bitter , deliberate , public , burning insult . It was the most blightlag act of scorn and shame , - the fullest of humiliation , - the most palpable and memorable , - that which could be the least overlooked , or pardoned , or forgotten by mankind , - of all the wrongs that one human being could inflict upon another . It was irreparable . He who bestowed it could not undo it . Time , - distance , - virtue , - could not wash it out . It was a stain eternal . All great Neptune 's ocean could not clean its blackened traces , - there was but one thing  - -  He started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that great , mysterious , sacred specific , the touch of which blasts ordinary hands , - the very half-forgotten stain of which betrays ancientest crime , - drags the murderer to light , - raises the very dead out of their fleshless graves , till vengeance has had her banquet . The spot upon his forehead could only be effaced , - the flame in his heart could only be quenched , - by blood ! " And he sat down and rested his elbo*vs on a table , and leaned his throbbing temples on his fists . Oh God ! he suddenly exclaimed , dropping on his knee ; teach me , - guide me , - save me , - my heart is wild , - my hand is lifted , - give me some sign " lie strove to pray , - as was his custom on occasions where his own sense of right wavered . But his heaving imagination could form no address to the Supreme Being . That serene power that sits above the clouds seemed itself to have deserted him in his deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive one . Strange things flitted before his eyes , and flapped their wings in his face ; and laughter , arid shrieks , and hisses rose once more around him , till the dark room seemed crowded with evil spirits , in the full ecstasy of their orgies // over a lost one . He leaned again his forehead upon the table , when suddenly a voice , as if of one of these fiends , seemed to say , " Yes , you are a coward ! It is craven fear that holds your hand . You are a canting , trembling hypocrite . You deceive yourself with names of virtue and illusions of religion , - abject , - disgraced , - wretched creature No one else is deceived . Elkington is a gallant fellow . You injured him like a scoundrel , and then fled from him like a coward . You are afraid to fight a duel . An unmanly sensibility and womanish effeminacy is the secret of your convenient principles , - your puny virtue . Who made you a judge , - a reformer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , what none of the wise , - the brave , - the great can see Who teaches you to distinguish between what is right and what is not , - between what God commands and what he forbids ? Why not fight a duel ? It is the custom It is a good custom . It is brave and manly . It unmasks cowards and sneaking hypocrites . Fool look into your own heart , and see what its honest dictates tell you of a blow . Every fibre of your trembling frame quivered with it . Every faculty of your shrinking soul fainted at it . Nature rose against it . A blow Since time began it is the badge of insult ,  --  the mark of shame . It is a curse full of the accumulated infamy of ages . The very beast turns at it . Its bodily pain is but a type and faint shadow of its moral ruin . Bear this one , and you will receive another , - and another , - and another . Who hereafter will honor you ? who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is water , - your heart is faint , - you are not a man , - you have borne a blow ! ' But I have not borne it , ' said Claude . " He rose and reached from his bookcase a pair of travelling pistols , and , placing them in his bosom , rushed from his house into the street . At first he knew not whether it was dark or light , whether the weather was fair or cloudy , nor had he any precise idea of what he intended to do , or where he meant to go . He had not walked far when he saw a man . He was a sentinel . For the first time in his life he felt unable to bear the eyes of a fellow-being . The swollen wound upon his face seemed a mountain , and he forgot every thing but the desire to withdraw himself into solitude , - darkness , - and silence , - away from the gaze of all , - even were it'inlthe grave . Then there came to him again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death could relieve him from the agony of his heart . He cast his eyes about himupon the surrounding objects , - the long , quiet streets , - the deserted squares , - the silent houses , - the soft , waving // trees . He wondered to behold such tranquillity , - such peace , - after all his anguish . He walked beneath the soft branches with shame , - he shrank from the moonlight reflected against the houses , - the very pavement he seemed to tread on as an intruder , - as a felon ; and he looked around him like guilt , stolen in the night from its lurking-place , - ashamed , and fearful of being seen . " Ah , * thought Claude , as a moment of calm reflection came to him with the soft air and balmy night-breeze , little dreams he who , rude in nature , bad in heart , and feeble in understanding , - without principle , feeling , or religion , - with no restraints in this world , and no communings with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , of the dread act he perpetrates when he launches a blow against a fellow-being . ' " He bent his steps towards his favorite Park . His thoughts now rolled through his mind less confusedly . He was no longer mad , but they had a deep and solemn motion . He passed through the tall Brandenburg gate . The guard at his post looked at him ; he shrank from his eye , and the man seemed inclined to stop him , but did not . He sees , ' said Claude , humiliation in my very walk . ' " There is something in a night ramble which restores the agitated soul to itself . He felt the rapid motion , - the cool , sweet air abate , soothe , and calm the heat which till now had oppressed him . He penetrated into the beautiful recesses of the luxuriant wood . It was again a bright moonlight , and the scene touched him through all his agitation and awoke other feelings . " Receive me ! he said , pure shades ; receive the outcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamed , the fallen Shrink not from me , ye flowers , nor turn away your protecting arms , ye calm old trees , whd stand for ages through sun and storm , and never know what he who steals i ) eneath your path knows to-night . When I last walked here 1 was as pure and scatheless as yourselves ; now I am apart from other men , unless I dip my hands in blood ! Oh , that it were for ever night ! Oh , could I remain for ever here , alone with you , - where no blood flows at my feet , and no hisses sound in my ears . A blow ! a blow ! Poor , poor Rossi He went mad ; and it was this same hand that struck him too . God ! when he told me of it , I little knew what a blow was . Why did not the lightning arrest that rash hand ere it cast on me this fatal Taisery I should have killed him , but I was held , - for r.ood or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him What is killing ? what is life ? what is death ? Will not God pardon it ? Can I be punished for not bearing a burden beyond my strength ? and , after all , who says killing is not right ? // rrhe Holy Scriptures call out " blood for blood " ; and is not a blow blood ? Is it not worse ? We have killed each other since Abel 's time , - daily and hourly . It is our nature . It enters into the plan of Providence . All things kill . The soft dove snatches the golden insect ,  --  the hawk pierces the dove , - the lion tears his prey ,  --  the boar has his tusk , - the serpent his sting . This sweet forest , so fair to view , is but a scene of continual massacre . The microscope , that discovers ammalcules invisible to the naked eye , finds them killing each other . I have surely been led away by idle theories of human excellence . I have set myself apart as better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to be . God made us mortal . I will kill this man . I will meet him , - and one of us shall die . Perhaps , now , he will not , - then still I will kill him . To-morrow , - a week hence , - a year , - twenty years , - standing amid his friends , - asleep , - awake , - in bed , - in the fields , - in the dance , - at the very altar , on his knees in repentant prayer , - I will kill him ,  --  I will have his heart 's blood ! " He paused . The last words had been spoken aloud . They sounded like the imprecations of a demon escaped from hell , amid these soft glades and perfumed bowers . Alas ! what am I become ? What bloody and dark demon has entered my body ? Is this indeed honor ? Is this duty ? Our Redeemer suffered a blow ! * * * * But that sublime tradition which paints the wandering Jew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh God ! ' hecontinued , after pacing on yet further , I am lost . I acknowledge myself weak . I know not what I say or do . I am rushing blindly upon murder , - upon death . The very fiends in the shape of human reason seem goading and urging me on . Alas ! human reason is vain . I have listened to it too long . As yet my hands are pure from blood , - as yet I do not stand before the throne of Heaven , uncalled but by my own passion . There is a higher power , - I appeal to Him . I will not decide i*my rashness . What do I care for man 's opinion " He lifted his hands and eyes to heaven . It was near morning , and the sky was singularly transparent . He gazed breathless upon its quiet , eternal fields ,  --  the serene order of its glittering worlds ,  --  the hushed groups of stars , - the moon pure , high , bright , and calm as the virtue which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly thrown away . A dark cloud , of which the summit was piled up , mass above mass , like the silver Pyrenean cliffs above the blue Mediterranean , and whose base , black and definitely marked against the radiant air , lay stretched like a huge rock in a summer deep , gave to that upper world of light a new and awful aspect . As // he gazed , a sudden breeze came softly rushing over the treetops , - kissing the murmuring leaves , - reaching the face of the half-maddened being below , - cooling his brow , and cheek , and heart , - lifting the hair from his hot forehead , - and wafling to his senses and to his soul , in a cloud of perfume , a consciousness of love , - of hope , - of life , - of peace , - of Heaven . At the same moment large tears rose to his burning eyelids and rolled down his cheeks ; and , throwing himself upon the ground , - alone , in that silent wood , - unseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever walked the globe bent to earthly anguish , and he wept , convulsively , like a child . Oh , Elkington ! Could a wretch like thee bend that brow to the grassy ground , and shake , with almost fatal pangs , a heart which was to thee as the floating eagle to the howling cur ? Thou hast triumphed , - but beware The triumph of guilt is a wrong against Heaven . The good man is the child of God , and God is omnipresent , and he is around us , - in the very air , - when we know it not . " There is a blessing in tears . They are waters from Heaven , and they cleanse the soul to its pristine peace and purity . It is not right , ' muttered Claude , to take human life for human passion . Shall I not leave the task of punishing to the sublime Being who rules the universe ? Is he absent ? is he powerless " A peal of thunder burst over the starting earth ere the last word had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darted with a blinding intensity . The tremendous volume of sound paused after the first shock , - rolled on , - paused , - went on and on again , - crushingly , - as if annihilation itself had come upon mankind ; and repeating several times its appalling reverberations , - broad as the air , and apparently stirring the earth from its very orbit , - lost itself threateningly , but calmly , as if amid the vastness of other spheres . Claude had not yet moved when a torrent came rushing down , and he was drenched to the skin ; when he raised his head , the sky was wrapped in utter darkness . The wind swept over the wood , bending the tallest trees , and twisting their gnarled limbs till they groaned as if with fear and pain . The peal was followed by another , and so close and heavy that the instinct of self-preservation occupied his mind , to the exclusion of the subject which had so deeply agitated him . He hastened out of the Park into the broad road , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is something in a good drenching which deadens human passions , and shows how weak and idle are even some of those words which make us commit deeds // irreparable . The floods which drenched him were delicious , and cooled his fever . He breathed more freely , he trod more firmly ; and , if the truth must be added , at a considerably swifter pace than he generally adopted . His course was bent also towards the gate , and he reentered the town . " The rain , almost as suddenly as it had commenced , ceased , and a fissure appeared across the masses of black clouds which obscured the heavens . The dispersion of the vapors was so extremely rapid , that , even thrilled as he was by the incident which had just occurred , it fastencd his attention . Forming themselves into separate piles , the clouds broke apart in all quarters , leaving the blue void stainless , and the stars glittering with unwonted brightness . rrhen the whole air , earth , and heaven were suddenly illuminated by a soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the moon , and she broke out full orbed and almost light as day , while each torn fragment of silver cloud disappeared entirely , and the air became as still as the heaven . Oh God , ' said he , I worship thee in thy temple , I call upon thee for aid . May this be to me an emblem of my own soul . Its passions , however tremendous , belong to earth ; its calm hopes , to Heaven . I commit myself to thee . ' " And his soul now poured itself in prayer , which seemed to rise unimpeded to the Throne of Mercy . He had implored a sign , and Heaven had granted it . The serenity of nature taught him by its example to sit serene after the wildest storm , which the same hand that conjured up could waft away , and that no tempest could reach the fair arrangement of right and truth . Slowly he wandered to his home . No weakness disturbed his spirit or his intellect . He had made up his deterrnination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal body was subdued and over-mastered by the superior mind . At the word of reflection and of religion the hot blood flowed cool and placid through his frame . His obedient pulse played temperately , and all his soul was peace . " - Vol ii . pp. *25 - 35 . For the purpose of contrasting the two principles of action , - that of a sense of religious duty , and that of a sense of worldly honor ,  --  the author introduces a friend of Wyndham , a Mr. IDenham , who arrives at Berlin with a young and lovely wife , and who knows the infamous character of Lord Elkington . This gentleman is present when Wyadham receives the dishonoring blow , takes part in the quarrel , and , obedient to the duellist 's code , makes an arrangement to // meet Elkington . He is shot through the heart at the second fire , and a succession of tragical scenes follow , which the author has drawn with great effect . Through them all , Wyndham is true to his principles . But harder trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the astonishing fact , that Wyndham is the son of the Earl of Beverly by a former marriage ; that the Earl had been wrought upon by her own arts to believe he had been dishonored by his wife , and had cast her inexorably from him ; that she had left his home , and finally had sailed with her infant son to the West Indies ; that the vessel was wrecked , and she was reported among the lost ; but that the son had been accidentally preserved , and was in fact none other than Mr. Wyndham , who was thus the true heir to the Beverly title and estates . The person , therefore , who had secretly supplied the money for Wyndham 's support , was no other than the old Earl , whose approaching death , Elkington , pressed to the earth with dehts , is anxiously and impatiently awaiting . When the Earl 's last illness is announced , Elkington writes to his hankers to stop all further payments to Wyndham . This immediately reduces our hero to utter want , and exposes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being his friend , has become , by the arts of Elkington , and by his own vanity , his most unrelenting enemy . The Count calls for the payment of a debt , which Wyndham had accidentally contracted , and , upon his inability to meet the demand , forthwith sends him to prison , where our hero remains some time , apparently deserted by the world , and ruined for ever . He is at length set at liberty upon the security of his friend , Lavalle , and without a murmur applies himself to earn a subsistence hy teaching the English language . He is thus enabled to pay off his debts , which he does to the last farthing . But in the mean time the French Revolution has arrived at its height , and the aristocratic Carolan , whose daughter , by the way , has been rescued from the pistol of an assassin by Wyndham , at the most imminent risk of his own life , deems it his duty to offer his services to the royal family of France , whither he departs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater importance to our hero 's fortunes has silently been going on . Our old friend , Madame Wharton , has received a clew which she determines to follow out , and departs for England . There she succeeds in her // pursuit ; she proves the identity of Claude Wyndham , as the son of the Earl of Beverly , and makes to him immediately the astounding discovery that she is his own mother , being in fact the first wife of the Earl , who had been so long supposed to be lost . She convinces her husband , during an interval of restoration to his senses , of his injustice towards herself and the heir of his immense estates . All legal measures are immediately taken to place the claims of our hero beyond the reach of doubt or cavil , and the joyful intelligence is despatched at once to Berlin . Of course all this puts an entirely different face upon our hero 's affairs , and makes him at once as much the object of attention and admiration as he had lately been of neglect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The progress of the French Revolution has been so rapid and terrible , that all hopes of the Count 's escape from the perilous condition into which he had so self-confidently thrust himself , are lost . But Wyndharn determines to atten ) pt his rescue . He enters France , assumes the disguise of a Jacobin , and after innumerable hair-breadth scapes , and having performed prodigies of valor , finally saves the Count and his lovely daughter , and returns with them to England . The character of Count Carolan has been completely changed by his misfortunes and sufferings ; and , without knowing the present position of our hero 's affairs , he offers him his daughter . Wyndham keeps the secret , and all the parties are of course most agreeably surprised upon arriving in England , and being taken to the magnificent residence of the Earl of Beverly . Such is a brief oudine of this interesting story . There are episodes connected with the plot , of great moment , which we have entirely omitted . It is obvious , that the scheme of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; hut we think our readers will be satisfied , upon perusing the book , that he has used them with no little in* , enuity ; that his characters are in general well sustained ; and that his sketches of society are drawn from observation , and present us with a series of very lively pictures of the fashionable and diplomatic circles of a great continental cal ) ital . Interspersed with the stirring scenes of brilliant society , are many beautiful descriptive passages , breathing a poet 's love of nature , and showing an artist 's eye for her maulfold // enchantments . Tbe following , for example , seems to us very fine . " It was a pleasant night . The air was still and clear without being cold , and very refreshing and agreeable . The moon was in the wane , and had just risen , casting a singular radiance over the earth and heaven . Having supped heartily , and , with several new and interesting topics of reflection , being too fully awake to think of sleep , he determined to prolong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lonely . Here and there the night-watch went slowly by , with his long , shrill whistle , as if ingeniously contrived to disturb the sick , to awaken the sleeping , and to do seivice to none except thieves and robbers , who , thus warned , get to their hiding places till he is out of the way . Before the palaces of princes and military officers of high standing , and the public edifices , the guards paced slowly to and fro , in their simple gray cloaks and leathern caps , their muskets glittering in the moonbeams and once during his ramble he was crossed by a company of fifteen or twenty soldiers , on their rounds to relieve guard , their measured tramp echoing on the pavement , and reminding him that he was in the metropolis of one of the greatest military governments of Europe . " Claude went on , now indulging in his own reveries , now watching the broad , level streets , so beautiful in the moonlight , and the sculptured palaces , with their shadowy courts and half-unearthly company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it retreated and died away in the distance . At length he found himself before the Brandenburg gate , and paused to admire the tall columns , the stately outline , and the bronze group upon the top . The guard at the gate made no question as he passed out to extend a ramble so delightful into the wood . It was the hour for calm thought , and he had many subjects of reflection . The l ) rincipal one was the young girl with whom he had become acquainted in so curious a manner , and who seemed the imbodying of his fairest visions of woman . He had been struck with her character as described by Madame Wharton , - an authority the best that could exist on such a subject . That of a mother would have been partial ; that of a friend might have been drawn from imperfect sources . His own experience he could have placed but little confidence in , for he knew how different a thing woman often is in her real mind from what she appears when invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pleasure . It is probable that , without the previous eulogies of Madame Wharton , the grace and loveliness of Ida would // not have succeeded in impressing him so seriously . Every one xviii not sympathize with a young man who can not fall in love till assured by better authority than his own observations of the merit of the object . But this was Claude 's character imbued with thought , his feelings , or at least his actions , were subservient to his reason . His lonely life had rendered contemplation almost too habitual to him . He had dwelt too long and too much on the valuelessness of the earthly objects so ardently sought by his fellow-creatures . For , after all the everlasting homilies on the evanescence of existence , while they rarely arrest the thoughtless in their pursuit of pleasure or the xvicked in their career of guilt , often render the contemplative unnecessarily sad , and deprive the unhappy of sources of distraction from solemn realities which a benevolent Providence did not intend should appal or overshadow us . To Claude most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its joys illusions . He wanted the developement of his affections to balance and perfect his character , and to counteract the results of a too exclusive developement of his intellectual faculties . He had lived in a world of thought . He wanted to descend into the warmer one of feeling . His mind had occupied itself with subjects vast , high , and eternal . He had not studied society and common life with sufficient attention . Such a mind may be great if occasion presents , but can not be contented in the world where we are destined to live . Some author observes with a true philosophy , Bad as men may be , Providence intends that we shall love them . ' The uncompromising energy of Claude 's character , and the independence of an original thinker , made the path of youth one of danger , and caused him in many things to stand aloof from other men . " As he wandered on , Elkington , his singular insolence , - Lady Beverly , her unaccountable curiosity , which seemed to watch his actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The former he resolved to avoid if possible , and he determined never to deviate from the cold courtesy which should avert a quarrel . The anger with which he had received his rudeness passed away under the fields of heaven . He reflected that it was not in the power of such a man to insult him . " He paused at these thoughts and gazed upward . The air was strangely clear ; for nature , as if seeking higher praise than man 's , seems to put on more wonderful beauty when his eye no longer gazes on it . An indescribable peace and lustre reigned everywhere ; upon the piles of motionless and silver clouds , the steady-beaming planets , and the far off , ever-burning groups of stars . He gazed long and intently with a fervid // wonder . There flowed the Milky Way , rolling its snowy and noiseless waves through the track of blue . He gazed almost breathless into its eternal depths . There was Orion , mounting heavenward with his glittering belt ; and there , - at rest amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang all this infinite sphere of worlds , - half seen , and undistinguished by the common eye ,  --  the wanderer 's guide-the lover 's hope ,  --  the type , in its constancy , of how few hearts - lay the polar star . " - Vol. i. pp. 87-90 . The character of Countess Ida is a very lovely conception ; and the silent attachment between her and Wyndharn is described and illustrated with much beauty of sentiment , and delicacy of feeling . The following passage will show this , besides presenting another example of our author 's descriptive powers . " It was a warm spring day . The sun was bright on the pleasant Linden , and the gay population were abroad enjoying the fine weather . Nothing is so delightful as the approach of spring in these cold climates . Claude was peculiarly alive to such impressions ; and , as he passed out of the Brandenburg gate into the universal and favorite promenade of the Park , he perceived tokens of the spring visible everywhere around him . This season had stolen upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fashion with operas , balls , soides , and breakfasts ; with glittering crowds , the same ever-recurring faces , and all the pomp , glare , and circumstance of magnificent entertainments , that the soft and exquisite forms of half-forgotten nature struck his eye and touched his soul with a sense of happiness . As the various incidents of the now vanished winter rose to his memory ,  --  the constant succession of brilliant frtes , - the numerous nights which had found him wandering amid the half-fairy splendor of royal saloons , till the breaking day at length sent him to his bed ,  --  the new acquaintances he had made ,  --  the dark face , full of meaning , of Lady Beverly , - the rudeness of Elkington , - the bland courtesy of Carolan , - the dignified friendship of Madame Wharton , - arid last , not least , the enchantment which he had found in the society of Ida , and which had daily grown more delicious and more dangerous , - all seemed a fantastic dream amid the surrounding silence and solitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population had not yet begun to appear in its sylvan glades . Only the squirrel paused and listened in the path ; while the birds , whose clear notes echoed through the wood , scarcely flew at his approach . The grass // had burst out everywhere , and the buttons of the trees were fully opened , disclosing the tender leaves and blossoms . Flowers , some the spontaneous tribute of nature , and some set by the hand of the gardener , were peeping from the wayside or bending over the streams . The earth , long dead , had a warm and living look . Verdure was upon the ground , and perfume in the air . rrwo or three swans , stately as their mistress Juno , came floating down the stream , beneath the arch of a beautiful bridge which hung reflected in the flood ; and the air , entirely free from the chill which generally accompanies even the fairest promises of a spring day , as painful recollections of the past sometimes disturb the pleasure of the preseat , was altogether bland and balmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conduct of Ida had been a kind of mystery to him . Since their cold parting at the d*jeuner of Prince R. , her manner had been generally so formal as to relieve him from the necessity of being on his guard ; yet , at times , this reserve gave place to a gayety so familiar and a kindness so gentle as to startle him with the idea that , while he fancied himself only subjecting his own heart to danger , he was , in reality , also gaining the confidence of this artless and inexperienced girl . He had parted from her the day before , after an interview deeply interesting to him . The passion which had now taken entire possession of his soul had half betrayed itself in her presence , and the sweet instincts of a heart which had lost the power of directing itself , found in her manner so much tenderness even in its reserve , that he could not doubt that his love was returned . It was at this point that he walked forth to reflect upon his position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of an enviable kind . What had he done ? He had gained the affections of one affianced to another . He had weakly lingered by the side of one he could never marry , till perhaps their separation would be as much a source of unhappiness to her as to him . This was little more than the act of a scoundrel ; and , in reflecting upon it , he experienced the humiliating consciousness of having deviated from the path of honor . Alas so invisible are the lines which separate innocence from guilt , that the most honest sometimes find themselves over the limit before they are aware of it . No mortal step can assure itself against this danger ; but , while the weak and the depraved go on in their career of temptation , the noble-minded start from the flowery road the instant they see where it leads . Can I doubt it ? ' thought Claude , as he wandered into the thickest and most solitary part of the wood . She shares my infatuation . Let me , for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet hovers only in our dreams . She loves me . What power has aided my daring wishes ? Some demon , perhaps , to effect my ruin ! ' " In the ardor of his reveries , he had so far forgotten himself as to utter this rhapsody aloud . It was not without a guilty start that he heard a step at his side , and , lifting his eyes , beheld Madame Wharton. " - Vol. i. pp. 140- 143 . As a set-off to the graver and more solemn scenes , the amusing absurdities of the 1 ) igby family are very well introduced . The following is part of the occurrences at a Deyjooney dangsang . " At this moment the general clash of voices ceased suddenly , and was succeeded by a deep silence . An officer of the court entering with his baton , made a passage for the royal family . There was , however , little occasion for his exertions , for the crowd fell hack on either side , leaving a wide space for his majesty Frederic William II. , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch advanced in the midst of the rooms , and Claude was presented by Lavalle to Prince - the distinguished nobleman whose duty it was to name to royalty those who aspired to the honor of an interview . This ceremony was soon over , as well as those which etiquette rendered proper to the other illustrious personages . Having happily gone through these preliminaries , he was struck with the appearance of the Dighys . The good dame was magnificently arrayed in a brimstone-colored , richly-embroidered satin dress , hat and feathers ; a toilet somewhat conspicuous on any occasion , but unfortunately so on the present , since , the court being in mourning , it was the height of indecorum to appear in any other color than black or white . Oh Dieu , madame , ' said Madame de Godeau , in an under tone , with consternation depicted in her countenance you are not dressed in mourning , - when I tell you , - mon Dieu , - c'est *pouvantable . ' You told me , - meam ? said Madame Digby . You never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole court were in mourning . ' Ah , certainly , mem ; I recollect that , perfectly , but I had n't an idea you wanted me to go in mourning too . W hy , J do n't even know who s dead . I in sure I have never seen the poor man in all my life " It was , however , now too late for any remedy , and she determined to carry it through . She* therefore followed the grande maitresse , who had obligingly waited till the end of her colloquy with Madame de Godeau , and , with her elbows well // protruded from her ample body , made her way through the opposing multitude with little ceremony . Here and there Claude heard a nearly suppressed . I*h diable , quel dr6le de figure ! or , C Dieu ! qui est cette madame ld ! Mary was dressed in blue , but she looked so extremely pretty , that even they who laughed at were compelled to admire her . " Madame Digby , at length in good society , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the presence of the princess with the air of one who intended to show the world that she was not to be intimidated . The distinguished lady to whom she was about to be presented seemed scarcely able to repress a smile , and the circle around were still less successful , at the awkward air and ridiculous affectation of the honest dame as she made her opening salutation . But royal affability on these occasions has no limit , and all in their presence are greeted with the courtesy which forms one of the ornaments of a throne . Half afraid of being encountered by one of Lady Beverly 's haughty stares , Mrs. Digby was delighted to find the princess all smiles and blandness , and , recovering all her ambition with her ease , she cast a look around to assure herself that the whole assembly were witnesses of the honor she was enjoying . Have you been long in Berlin ? said her royal highness , in French . An address in an unknown language would have abashed any one not blessed with considerable nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the composition of Madame Digby . She only , therefore , approached a step or two nearer , - much too close for the distance which more experienced courtiers have a care to leave between royalty and those in its presence , - and , leaning her ear towards the face of the princess , she merely pronounced , in her own peculiar way , the word Mem ? " The princess repeated the question . I really beg your pardon , mem ; but , if you could speak English with the same trouble , I should be more able to communicate with your ladyship , mem , - that is , - with your royal highness . Madame de Godeau informed me that you 51 ) Oke English like a native , mem , - your royal highness. * I hope you find Berlin agreeable ! ' said her august companion , in English , and with a good-natured smile . Well , mem , I ca n't say but what I do . ' " The princess began here another question , but Mrs. Digby interrupted her to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodged ? inquired the princess . CC Why , mem , pretty fair , compared with where we were at Hamburg ; but the stoves give Mr. Digby the headache , your royal highness We know you English never find on the Continent the comforts which you enjoy in your own country , ' said the princess * ) olitely . " No , indeed , mem , - your royal highness , - that s what we do n't ; and as for- ' CC C Are you attached to any embassy ? inquired the princess . CC C No , mem , not yet , hut I believe we shall advertise for something of that sort ; my relative , Lord Clew , was- ' " She was cut short by a very affable courtesy on the part of the princess , and an exceedingly significant look from the grande maUresse on one side , and Madame de Godeau on the other , intimating that her interview was over . She accordingly made a salutation , such as , in her mind , fitted the rank of the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine lady , who had at length arrived at the very summit of the ho-tong ; and , ignorant of the conspicuous violation of etiquette of which she was guilty , she stepped away , turning her shoulder and back directly in the princess 's face . CC That lady not noticing , or not seeming to notice , the last maneuvre , turned towards Mary , who stood the next in the circle . The grande mailresse led the trembling gjrl forward . Her timidity was so obvious , and she turned so pale , that the benevolent heart of the princess was interested in her behalf ; and she addressed her so kindly , and led and sustained the conversation with so much consideration for her youthful and not ungraceful distress , that Mary found herself fully exempted from the necessity of making other remarks than her usual C yes ' and C no . ' CC The next object which attracted Claude 's attention was Digby , the perspiration standing on his forehead , his face always rather rubicund from the vivifying effect of good English beef and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrors which , poor fellow , he had undergone in his attempts to be presented . Unacquainted with the faces of the royal personages , even when by their side , he sometimes ran against a prince , and sometimes made an inquiry of a princess . Some one whom he had never seen before was every moment wheeling him violently round with , C Prenez garde ! - sa majests ! or , JVlonsieur , la princesse ! At length , tired , terrified , and internally swearing that no one , - not Mrs. Digby herself , // - should ever catch him again in a scene for which his habits of life had so little fitted him , his knees aching , and his feet in a state of torment from the effect of a pair of high-heeled and very small new boots , which his wife had persuaded him to purchase for the occasion , he reached a broad crimson sofa , glittering with gold , and occupied on the other end by a lady and gentleman . Throwing himself down in an exhausted state , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at last . Here sit I till dinner . ' " Taking out a yellow silk pocket-handkerchief , he deliberately wiped the moisture from his forehead and blew his nose and he had just finished taking a comfortable pinch of snuff , and was proceeding to offer the box to his neighbour , when he was struck with the intensity of astonishment with which a little military officer , with an enormous pair of mustaches , an exceedingly rich uniform , a multitude of orders , a high chapeau under his arm , and a long sword , fixed his eyes sternly upon him . In some surprise , not to say consternation , he hastily put up his handkerchief and snuff-box , and looked around to see what he had done , when he perceived that several others , - indeed , all the surrounding spectators , - were regarding him attentively , and with visible tokens of amazement . Among others , a person half behind him , and partly withdrawn within the embrasure of a window , began to make him significant signs and violent gesticulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The remark was lost , however , in a language which he did not understand . At length he came to the conclusion that he had torn his clothes , and , horrified at the idea , he proceeded to examine his elegant court suit , when his perplexity was terminated by Claude , who , perceiving his dilemma and the cause of it , approached him from behind and whis-pered , **cGet up . You are sitting with the prince and princess. * " If a bombshell had fallen at the poor fellow 's feet , he could not have been more alarmed . He started up , and was darting off to hide his humiliation in some distant corner , but Claude with a strong hand very quietly withheld him . Good God what now said Digby , afraid to move . You are running directly against the prince royal For Heaven 's sake , then , let me go this way And , with a spring , he would have run full tilt against another member of the royal family , had not Claude again checked his course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task of wiping his forehead . // Well , I say , - WTyndham ! he muttered , if this is Mrs. I ) igby 's ho-long- ! the circle dispersed and Claude released his prisoner . It was not long before he observed him planted in a corner , with his back held resolutely against the wall , standing as straight as a grenadier under review , occasionally making a wry face at the pressure of his new boots , and now and then applying his handkerchief to his temples .
