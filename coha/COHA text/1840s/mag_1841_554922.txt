txt IT has been our province already , many times , to call public attention to the difficulty existing between the Government of Great Britain and that of the United States , on the subject of the Northeastern Boundary ; we fear , that , to judge by the present l ) rospect , it may be our duty to do so many times hereafter . There is no appearance of any disposition in either party to concede a jot of its position , or to enter into any compromise whatever . Under these circumstances , it is difficult to foresee a termination to this dispute , unless it be one of a very unpleasant kind , which may at any moment be brought on with suddenness by the irritation felt , and the provocations mutually rendered , by those who live close to the boundary line . In the condition of things that actually exists along the whole of the eastern border of Maine , from Calais , which lies opposite to St. Andrews , up to Houlton , that adjoins to Woodstock , a great share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adjoining territories is intrusted . A slight indiscretion upon either side might occasion consequences which no subsequent prudence could entirely remedy . We are happy to believe that nothing of the kind is at present to be dreaded , and that , so far as their personal disposition is concerned , Governor Kent and Sir John Harvey are inclined to do every thing within their power to maintain those friendly relations between the two countries , which are vitally important to the happiness and prosperity of both . If we were to judge of the temper and disposition towards // the United States , of Her Majesty 's ministers at home , from those manifested in the Report which makes the substance of the correspondence named at the head of this article , we should not be slow to arrive at conclusions respecting the probable end of the controversy . To do so , however , would , in our belief , be very unfair to them . They have no motive conceivable to sanction what they must know to be wrong . They are too high-minded , however earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own country , to wish to arrive at them by a resort to dishonest artifices . We should be glad to say the same for some of the agents they have employed ; hut we can not . They have been doing their best to embroil the two countries still more than they have ever yet been embroiled , by this controversy . And , not satisfied with parading as much of disingenuous argument as they could devise , they have sought to infuse into it as invidious a character , and as sneering a spirit toward the United States , as it would readily admit . We deeply regret , for the sake of the two nations , that such agents were ever employed , and still more deeply , that , after they were employed , Her Majesty 's ministers did not exercise that supervisory function over the result of their labors , which might be calculated to prevent the unnecessary multiplication of obstacles to an amicable adjustment , over and above the number that already exist . It appears by the volume , whose title is first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , 1839 , Messrs . G. W. Featherstonhaugh , and Richard Z. Mudge , received the instructions of Lord Palmerston , Her Majesty 's Secretary for Foreign Affairs , requiring them to proceed to New Brunswick for the purpose of making investigations respecting the " nature and configuration of the territory in dispute between Her Majesty 's Government and the Government of the United States of America , and to report which of the three following lines presents the best defined continuity of highland range " First . The line claimed by the British Commissioners from the source of the Chaudi*re to Mars ' Hill . " Secondly . The line from the source of the Chaudh*re to the point at which a line , drawn from that source to the western extremity of the Bay of Chaleurs , intercepts the due north line . // " Thirdly . The line claimed by the Americans from the source of the Chaudiere to the point at which they make the due north line end . " It is evident , from an examination of these instructions , that the British Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object in view . It was that of ascertaining by positive examination the nature of the country in the disputed territory , and thus of gathering materials , upon which their own construction of the terms of the treaty might be most strongly supported . With this intention they ordered the survey of three distinct lines of boundary ; the first of these being the old line as it had always been laid down by the British , in the former argument upon the subject ; another , the old line as claimed by the Americans ; and in addition to these , a third , a different , a new and an intermediate line , which might by possibility obviate the objections that had been raised against the other two . Under such very simple instructions , it would seem as if nothing could have been plainer than to execute them . True , it would have required much time , and the Commissioners had none to spare , ii they were expected to report as they did report , in April of 1840 . But it does not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular . The shortest period , in . which they could have been expected to reach the ground of survey after their departure from England , must have brought them to the last of August . They had , therefore , owing to the severity of the climate in that high latitude , only the months of September and October to operate in . It appears by the result , that this was all the time they actually devoted to the duty assigned them . It can not , therefore , be wondered at , as the Commissioners did not feel themselves at liberty to apply for another opportunity to conduct their operations in the next season , that they left the greater part of that duty unperformed . They actually examined but one of the three lines pointed out to their attention in their instructions , and that one was the third or intermediate line , which had never before been suggested by either party . Having examined that , apparently with some care , and having cast a hasty glance at the others , not sufficient to report concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison , they returned , as directed , to spend the winter at home , and to make up a map suitable to accompany their Report . // The Commissioners probably discovered , in the course of their review of the materials which they had provided to make up that Report , that they would prove utterly unsatisfactory to their own government . They must have seen at once , that they had made no tolerably accurate survey of any line but the second of those mentioned in their instructions , and that if they were to furnish a return of that only , it would make little or no figure upon paper , and would render strikingly perceptible the absence of the desired information respecting the other two . In these circumstances , the expedient which they adopted was a singular one . They dismissed all notice of their actual survey , excepting as a secondary matter . They assumed the position of judges of the documentary and historical evidence touching the disputed question of boundary , upon which they do not appear to have been required to express any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the question of title , the absence of the investigation , to the full extent that they were bound to make it , into the nature of the country , the title of which was in dispute . Hence it follows , that but a quarter part of the body of the Report has any reference to the instructions which appear upon its first page , and the other part is a gratuitous examination of matters , with which the Commissioners , in our opinion , should have had nothing to do . We take it for granted , from the known character and reputation of the Commissioners , that Colonel Mudge was the author of that useful portion of the work , which furnishes all the information respecting the survey , and that Mr. Featherstonhaugh alone supplied the remainder ; and this we do , notwithstanding the fact , that both names appear signed at the bottom of the Report . In such circumstances , we suppose that both gentlemen must be held responsible for what it contains , a result which we regret much more for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' We , from the outset , regarded the selection of Mr. Featherstonhaugh to perform a part of ' the duty , as an eminently unfortunate one . He had resided many years in the United States , had been employed under its government , had figured rather too pompously for his own reputation under the self-assumed title of " United States ' Geologist , " and had not escaped pretty severe animadversion upon the means used by him in making up his Report in that capacity . It certainly was not very satis // factory to the citizens of this country , to perceive that an individual , who had been studying the surface of their territory at their expense , was suddenly attempting to hut what knowledge he might have acquired of men and things by years of observation among us , at the service of another , and so far as this question went , a hostile Government . It looked a little too much like the spirit of those knights of the middle ages , who passed from one side to another exactly according to the ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated in money . Hence it happened , that without having any fault to find with Mr. Featherstonhaugh personally , we regretted his appointment , and apprehended it would never conduce , in any shape , to the benefit of either party . Those apprehensions have now been fully realized . Mr. Featherstonhaugh has done his best to excite the evil passions of all Americans who will take the trouble to read what he has written . If he fails , it is not for the want of the will he puts into the work , hut from the fact that his long residence here has done much to destroy the authority that might otherwise have attached to his name . But , although Mr. Featherstonhaugh may have done what harm was in his power hy his labor , he ought to he thanked by all Americans for the good he has very unconsciously been the means of securing them . Had he not written such a Report , it may he doubted whether Mr. Gallatin would have exerted himself so much as he has done , in publishing the hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now far advanced in life , lie is one of the very few remaining among us , under whose hands the giant energies of the infant republic were moulded into form . And even at this day , he has , for certain peculiarities of mind which go to produce the character of a statesman , no equals among the generations that succeed his own . In him , there is very little of the merely brilliant ; and the ambition to acquire those official distinctions which are generally the objects of so much desire with us , appears to have long since passed away . But the talent of going to the hottom of all questions of public policy , of tracing them in all their minute ramifications with a single eye to the truth of the positions to he deduced , remains with him now , as fully as it ever was possessed , and he yet retains the disposition to exercise it for the benefit of the country . Even from his retirement in private life this gen // tieman has several times , within a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having authority ; and although no rabble is shouting at Iris heels , the wiser and more intelligent of the community still continue to look to him as one of the few oracles of the republic . We have already mentioned that quality in Mr. Gallatin , which leads him to overlook every consideration in style but the precise expression of the idea he means to convey . The consequence is , that not many of our diffusely thinking and loosely reasoning people have sufficient patience to begin and follow his train of propositions as he lays them down and joins them together . But the benefit to be gained in the process , will fully compensate for the effort necessary to understand him . His logic has the force of mathematical demonstration ; and in these days , when a fallacy lies at the root of many of the prevailing and fashionable doctrines that float about in the world , it is pleasant to recur to a source , where , if touched at all , they are likely to be exposed . There is not a question in religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been made a cover for more sophistical reasoning , than this one of the Northeastern Boundary has been made by the British . It would be a blessing to the public , if , in every other question , a similar reftitation of error could be applied , to that which Mr. Gallatin has drawn up in this . We would not have it understood , however , by what we have said , that the volume by Mr. Gallatin is devoted to the consideration of Mr. Featherstonhaugh 's Report alone . That would have been giving to it a most undue share of importance in the series of British papers upon the subject . His object appears to have been , to place before the public on both sides of the Atlantic , in a condensed form , the whole of the American side of the question , as it was prepared for the most part by himself , at the period of the arbitration by the King of Holland . This has never been done before in any shape at all satisfactory . The large volume , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon to sustain them , was printed solely for the tise of the Government , and has never been made accessible to the public at large . Neither is it likely , that , even if it had been , many persons would have taken the trouble to wade through the seven htindred pages it contains . We repeat , then , that Mr. Gallatin has done the public a great service , by concentrating , // as few men could have done so successfully , the substance of that volume , and by presenting at a single view , the merits of the question in dispute . But it is not with the general question we now propose to have much to do . If our former labors in this department have been of any use at all , they ought to excuse us from the necessity of repeating what we have already published . And if they have been of no use , we have no right to expect that we shall gain any thing by renewing them . It is , therefore , clearly incumbent upon us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted , that our readers are informed of its principal points . Should that not be the case , we will still go on , taking the liberty to refer them to the volumes of our Journal , * in which that information may be found . Our design now is only to consider those portions of the present Report by Mr. Peatherstonhaugh , and of the answer by Mr. Gallatin , which , either by their novelty , or their singular manner of treatment , appear to merit consideration . Most especially do we desire so to expose the method in which the British side of the argument has been , in this instance , conducted , as to draw down upon it that degree* of scorn from all honorable men , which it so fully deserves . In order the better to do this , we will now extract from the Report a passage at its commencement , explanatory of its general purpose . " Having found the physical geography of the disputed territory very much at variance with all the accounts of it to which we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , both in Great Britain and the United States of America , owed their origin to the previous surveys and negotiations respecting the Boundary Question , some of which surveys we found singularly at variance with our own careful observations made on the spot , as to the height of some leading points of the country , of vital importance to the question we came to the conclusion , that the most significant of those previous estimates , and which were connected with important inferences , were conjecturally made , without knowledge of the truth , and that thus very incorrect statements had been submitted to the judgment of the Sovereign arbiter , to whom , under the Convention of the 29th of September , 1827 , those previ * See . North American Review , Vol . VI . pp. 117 et seq. ; Vol . XXVI. , pp. // otis surveys were to be referred . We shall , in the course of this Report , point out to your Lordship these inaccuracies in a more specific manner . " Alive to the important bearing of this somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately upon our arrival in England , to enter upon a more careful study of the diplomatic history of the dispute ; in which was ? to be found those arguments , which had been raised upon the erroneous statements we have alluded to , and which had taken so strong a hold upon the public mind in the United States of America . " The assumption consequent hereupon , which is entertained in that country , that a particular range of highlands , north of the St. John 's river , and running parallel with , and at no great distance from the St. Lawrence , is the range of highlands intended by the treaty of 1783 , seemed to have suggested to the official agents , employed by the American Government under the fifth article of the Treaty of Ghent , the necessity of maintaining that the boundary proposed by the Treaty of 1783 , was identical with the ancient provincial boundary , between the province of Quebec and her Majesty 's province of Nova Scotia . This assertion , which appeared to derive plausibility from Mitchell 's map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commissioners of both Governments at the negotiations which . ended in the Treaty of 1783 , - induced the British official agents , under the Treaty of Ghent , to take the opposite line , and to insist that the assertion was altogether conjectural , and incapable of satisfactory proof " The voluminous conflicting documents , which this point gave rise to , show how much the British official agents were misled by the general ignorance which existed of the interior parts of the territory in dispute . they were right in denying that the ancient provincial boundary was identical with the range of highlands claimed on the part of the United States but they were wrong in denying that the line of demarcation , established by the ancient provincial boundary , was intimately connected with the boundary intended by the second article of the Treaty of 1783. " - p. 9 . This passage sounds as if the Commissioners had made certain very great discoveries . What these actually turn out to be , we shall have occasion to disclose hereafter . We will now confine ourselves to a notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily he tested , by reference to official documents . The first of them is that which relates to a pretended assumption , that the Americans claim a particular range of // highlands , as the range intended by the Treaty of 1783 . Now this assumption , which we perceive to have been made the basis of much reasonin* throughout the Report , so far as it is one , belongs to the authors of the Report , and to them only . The Americans claim no particular range of highlands as the range contemplated by the treaty , for the very good reason , that they claim no highlands other than as they are connected with the specific requisition of that treaty , that they separate from each other certain rivers . It is one of the unfounded assumptions throughout the work of Mr. Featherstonhaugh , that because there are two ranges of elevated land within this disputed territory , which take a parallel direction through it , it is the duty of either Government to take the one or the other as the line of the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the words of that treaty itself . These words are , " a line drawn due north from the source of St. Croix river to the highlands ; along the said highlands , which divide those rivers that empty themselves into the river *St . Lawrence , from those which fall into the . dtlantic ocean . " These highlands are to be sought at the sources of the rivers spoken of , and nowhere else . That highlands do extend in that line needs.no argument beyond the simplest principle in hydrostatics , nor do we understand the Commissioners to deny it . Surveyors might spend years in measuring the elevation of every mountain in Maine and New Brunswick , and , so long as those rivers kept on in their course respectively to the St. Lawrence and to the Atlantic , the American position would never be shaken . The other portion of this extract that merits notice , is , the singular candor of the admission , that preceding British agents were wrong when they denied that the line of the boundary described in the treaty was intimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between her Majesty 's province of Nova Scotia , and that of Quebec . This admission is apparently made with a view to carry that ancient boundary line far enough to the south to make it apply to the particular range of highlands claimed to have been discovered in the present survey . Yet , inasmuch as we shall presently see that this new discovered range does not in any respect satisfy the requisition of the treaty , and as it does not appear to have been known either in 1763 , when her Majesty 's abovementioned provinces had their boundaries defined by procla // mation , or in 1783 , when the second article of the treaty was definitively agreed to , we can not exactly perceive what necessary connexion it can have with the dispute in any shape . As to the denial of the identity of the ancient provincial boundary not " with the range of highlands claimed on the part of the United States , " - for they claim no range , - hut with the highlands dividing the sources of certain rivers descrihed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , to let every reader judge of the extent of the identity by a comparison of the descriptions themselves . For example ; the Proclamation of 1763 defines the boundary between Quebec , on one side , and Nova Scotia and Maine on the other , as follows From whence the said line , crossing the River St. Lawrence and the Lake Champlain in forty-five degrees of north latitude , passes along the highlands which divide the rivers that empty themselves into the said River St. Lawrence from those which fall into the sea , and also along the north coast of the Bay des Chaleurs , " &amp;c . The treaty only reverses the course , and defines the same boundary to be " Along the said highlands , which divide those rivers that empty themselves into the River St. Lawrence , from those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean to the northwesternmost head of Connecticut River . " Now all we need ask here is , whether it is possible that these two descriptions can refer to different lines ? Can there be two distinct heights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence from those which flow into the sea or the Atlantic Ocean ? We think the very fact , that the British Government has raised a nice distinction between those two expressions of sea and ocean proves very clearly , that it was the only point of difference to be found , and that the identity in other respects of the descriptions so far as they refer to the line , was exact . Yet , to judge from the tone of the last Commissioners , the surrender of an utterly untenahle position , taken by their predecessors , portends quite a new discovery of the truth . How far the highlands , defined as reaching towards the north coast of the Bay des Chaleurs can coincide with the grand discovery of the Commissioners , that stretches along // to the south coast of the same bay , we will submit to their consideration without further argument , and pass to other points . They appear not to have labored much upon that which has heretofore so severely exercised the British ingenuity , that is , whether a sea is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We presume they considered that little could he added to the argument already adduced . If so , we think them perfectly right . The British Commissioners heretofore employed , have covered themselves with glory in the field of philology . They have done much to establish the exact meaning of the words " bay , " and " sea , " and " ocean , " and if they have not been careful in the process to avoid stultifying the ministers of the United Kingdom , who first used these terms in their connexion with the present question either as meaning something at variance with what they are now construed to signify , or else as meaning nothing at all , they have at least saved all parties to future treaties with their country from under-estimating the necessity of proceeding with amazing caution , if they would guard themselves against the consequences of ambiguity . It has been maintained that the word " sea " in the passage quoted from the Proclamation of 1763 , was wide enough in its signification to include hays , and gulfs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bay des Chaleurs , and the St. John 's that flows into the Bay of Fundy , were clearly among the rivers referred to by that word in that instrument . But the change made in the Treaty by the substitution ofthe term " Atlantic Ocean " for " sea , " is affirmed to have been made for the sake of narrowing the signification so far as to exclude those rivers above named which flow into it only through the intervention of bays . Yet that her Majesty 's ministers understood it differendy in 1786 , can hardly be doubted , when we see that , in the commission given to Sir Guy Carleton as Governor of Quebec in that year , the southern boundary of his province is described as " a line from the Bay of Chaleurs along the highlands which divide the rivers that empty themselves into the river Saint Lawrence from those which fall into the atlantic Ocean . " Now if the Restigouche and the St. John 's are not rivers to be classed as falling into the Atlantic Ocean , then there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministers must knowingly have laid down a line of boundary which // could not be traced in the territory for the long distance that extends from the Bay des Chaleurs to the head waters of the Penobscot . Now is this credible by any person possessing common sense ? Is it to be believed for a moment , that some of the most distinguished official persons in Great Britain could sit down with a map before them to define a boundary line , and then do it in so bungling a manner as to omit to trace , in a description manifestly designed by its minuteness to be complete , any line at all for nearly one half of the southern side , and that including the whole of the division between their own provinces of Quebec and Nova Scotia ? - a division , too , which it was the particular object pf that Commission to define . But let us return to the great discoveries of the Report . It appears from the statement of the Commissioners that , " if it had been known that a range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , existed in a part of the territory which neither of the parties had examined , namely , south of the St. John , and lying in that oblique direction between the sources of the Chaudhre and the Bay of Chaleurs , in which ran the line of demarcation of the ancient provincial boundary , the Americans would never have made their assertion " that is , of the identity of the Treaty line and that ancient boundary . And further in conclusion they say ; We report that we have frunci a Line of Highlands , agreeing with the language of the  |p2nd  article of the Treaty of 1783 , extending from the northwesternmost head of the Connecticut river to the sources of the Chaudi*re , and passing from thence in a northeasterly direction , south of the Roostuc to the Bay of Chaleurs . " Now from this it would appear , as if here was a pure discovery of the Commissioners made for the first time after a survey of the ground . Yet if we turn back to the instructions furnished by Lord Palmerston for the gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chaudi*re to the point at which a line drawn from that source to the western extremity of the Bay of Chaleurs intercepts the due north line , " we shall perceive something more than an accidental coincidence between the directions and the line actually found . Unquestionably , if there has been any discovery , it was one which Lord Palmerston had already made when he sent out his Commissioners ; and these have done // nothing more than to build up an argument in support of a new position , the geographical facts for which they had been sent Out to establish . They have measured mountains almost exactly where Her Majesty 's ministry ordered them to he found and the consequence has been , the production of a map in which the nicely-shaded highlands occupy the precise situation that corresponds to the second branch of their instructions . We can not help thinking , moreover , that if the Commissioners of survey have been so lucky as to find a line of boundary agreeing with the language of the 2nd article of the Treaty , exa*t1y where the Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not less remarkably fortunate in omitting to find what it was not desirable that they should find . And , strange as it may seem , the same convenient vision which looked out upon the natural features of the country through the spectacles of the ministry at home , when it came to the examination of the ancient title , retained its singular faculty of seeing only what it wished to see , and overlooking every thing that was not to the purpose . We know not whether the method of conducting this operation is most remarkable for its ingenuity or its dishonesty . But Mr. Gallatin has furnished us with abundant opportunities of forming a tolerahly accurate estimate of each ; and , for the sake of enlightening our readers a little on this matter , we will proceed to cite a few of the instances in which they are displayed . The greatest discovery of the Report is about a comma . It is darkly alluded to in the 14th point of the recapitulation as follows XLV . " We have discovered by a critical examination of the Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the passage which describes the Western boundary of the territory included in that Grant , and which boundary was agreed at the time of the Treaty of 1783 , to be the Eastern boundary of Massachusetts , in conformity with the provision contained in the Charter of Massachusetts of 1691 , is susceptible of a new interpretation varying in important particulars from the received one ; and we show , by a literal translation of the Latin , that the boundary was intended to run from the most western waters of the St. Croix to the sources of the Chaudi*re ; a line , which it has been seen , coincides in a very striking manner with the boundary in the Sieur De Mont 's Grant of 1603. " - p. 54 . There was once a book published* containing an account // of great events that had flowed from very trifling causes . Probably , not an example could be found in it more remarkable than this one , if we are to trust Her Majesty 's Commissioners . The whole dispute between Great Britain and the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , turns out to have sprung from the misplacing of a comma , or rather from the uncertainty whether , in an old parchment where there are no commas , a certain sentence should be read as if it bad a comma before or after it . The printer of the Report has insisted upon putting it in after , notwithstanding that its whole argument was the other way . We ourselves are not disposed to pay much regard to the emendation in any shape , critical or political , and are perfectly willing to set off the accuracy of the proof reader fop Parliament , against the scholarship of Mr. Featherstonhaugh ; but , as the public may be a little curious to know something more of the matter than we have yet explained , we will extract for their information the observations upon the subject made by Mr. Gallatin . In the authentic Latin copy of the grant , communicated by the British Government , there are no commas . The copy art extract whereof will be given below is transcribed from the report as published by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inserted after the words versus Septentrionem ' , where first mentioned ; which makes the passage read as it has heretofore always been read . It must have been so placed by the compositor of the Parliamentary Press . The commissioners clearly intended that the comma should be placed before and not after versus Septentrionem ' , and it must be so understood by the reader . " Whether this emendation , which is the great discovery of the commissioners , be admissible , is left to the decision of crit. * ical scholars . My business is with the reasoning of the report ; and the reason assigned for the emendation is not sufficient . " - p. 140 . We will now stop a moment for the sake of furnishing the important sentence of the grant , about which there is so much question . It runs thus in most classical Latin " Oinnes et singulas terms Continentis , ac insulas situatas et jacentes in Ameri&amp;t intra caput seu prornontoriuin communiter Cap de Sable appelat . Jacen. prope latitudinem quadraginta trium graduum aut e* circd ab equinoctiali lined versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenden. ad occidentern ad stationem , &amp;c . " We now recur to Mr. Gallatin , who goes on to remark The word north , applied to the latitude of any country , known to be situated north of the equator , though superfluous , is perpetually used , and it is thus used several times in the Treaty ( to the firty fifth degree of north latitude ) . Everybody knows that the latitude , whether north or south , is always counted from the equator . The words ab equinoctiali linen , ' in the grant , are equally superfluous , and they correspond with the words in the Treaty , in latitude of thirty-one degrees north of the equator . ' " The object of the emendation can not have been to connect the words versus Septentrionem ' with the words ad cccidentem ' of the next sentence . For if the union of the two were necessary in order to express the northwest , it would follow , that ' versus Septentrionem ' alone was not sufficient for that purpose . But the true object of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where , being applied to latitude from the Equator , they must necessarily mean due north . And the commissioners call the tracing on maps of a due north line from the source of the St. Croix to the St. Lawrence , an erroneous construction of the expression towards the north . " But those words mean a line which inclines more to the north than to the east , or the west , and they necessarily embrace a due north line . Under the broadest legitimate construction , it can not vary more than from due northeast to due northwest . The American translation quoted in the preceding passage of the report , is undoubtedly incorrect in substituting the word north for towards the North , *c. " - p. 141 . Now this American translation , here alluded to , is not the one prepared under the authority of the Government of the United States , and included in one of the statements submitted to the King of Holland , but is one made for and added to a report of a committee of the Legislature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her Majesty 's Commissioners have seized upon the accidental circumstance of a republication of that report and the accompanying papers , by the order and for the information of the Congress of the United States , as an excuse for calling it an official translation . And this presents an opportunity for an insinuation , which , in view of the fact , that the truly official translation // must bave been lying before them at the time the Commissinners made it , deserves an epithet stronger than we choose to apply . The insinuation is , that the inaccuracies complained of , were committed with the deliherate design to prejudice the British claims . But what are the errors of this translation that they should deserve to be regarded as wilfully made ? There are two the first , that " versus Septentrionem " is rendered by " to the north " instead of " towards the north . " And with all due respect to Mr. Gallatin , we do not consider this any very great mistake , particularly as the same words that appear in the Appendix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of the report itself " northward " , which we take to be the precise meaning . At any rate , the variation in the two places will exonerate the makers of the Report from any deliberate intention to misrepresent . And so far the suspicions of the Commissioners are groundless . The other error is , that " proximam navium stationern " is called " the first bay " instead of " the nearest road , " and we greatly regret to perceive that Mr. Gallatin has at all countenanced this most preposterous objection ; particularly as he has noticed Mr. Featherstonbaugh 's own translation of the grant a few words above , where it is clear , that the very same term of " statio navium " is applied as in the original to the place " vulgo Sanetmaries Bay " , and hence that the terms are here used in the grant itself as equivalent . In point of fact , bay is , as applied to any part of the River St. Lawrence , a more proper word than road , if we take as authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the illustration which he adduces from Sandys ; " About the islands are many roads , but only one harbour . " As to the difference between the words " first " and " nearest , " if that is to be the basis for a charge of unfairness in translation , we must leave it to such wonderful critics as Her Majesty 's Commissioners , to point it out more clearly bereafter than they have yet done , before we trouble ourselves to make any defence . And after all , this translation which turns out not to be so bad as is pretended , was not the official translation , and Mr. Featherstonhaugh knew that it was not . Mr. Gallatin , as minister of the United States , bad incorporated in his second statement a translation which deserved that title , because it // made a part of the argument submitted to the King of the Netherlands on behalf of the United States . But unfortunately for the purposes of the gentleman , that translation corresponded too nearly with his own to enable him to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his way to find another . He quotes too freely from the pages of that statement to be able to deny that he has read it . By this time our readers may be apt to inquire , what is the purpose of all this quotation from the old defunct grant to Sir William Alexander . It is nothing more nor less than to justify Mr. Featherstonhaugh in marking out upon his map a line " versus Septentrionem " which goes two degrees of longitude " versus occidentem , " whilst it makes less than one degree of latitude " towards the north . " This is certainly a very free translation of the term , and comes with a very bad grace from one who ventures to insinuate against the Government of a foreign nation the perpetration of a wilful mistranslation with the design " greatly to prejudice the British claims . " If the navigators of Great Britain were to adopt the singular method of understanding the points of the compass thus laid down , we doubt whether their country would be great gainers by their skill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such forcible construction upon the Latin of this grant , as they have attempted . We deny their right to suggest any line like the one marked upon their map , as coming within the limits even of their own violent construction ; and lastly , we deny , that in any possible event , the simple words of the Treaty of 1783 can be made to depend for their meaning upon that grant . So much for the grand discovery of the Report . Subordinate to that are two or three others , which would be amusing , if they were not connected with a topic of so much importance to the peace of nations . One of them consists in a grave presentation of an old map of New France , or Canada , made by one Coronelli in the year 1689 , and of another republished at Paris , by de Lisle , in 1783 , from an old plate first published eighty years before* as evidence of the fact , that the same understanding was had of the limits of Nova Scotia , by the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was , to be sure , a most accurate understanding of the configuration of the country , as any // person may readily satisfy himself by a glance at the copies which accompany the Report , provided that even these are correctly given . In one of them , Nova Scotia , in the other New Hampshire figures , in the place where Maine is now usually put . And New England is set down as a very small affair , much smaller than New Hampshire in one map , and wholly distinct from it , whilst it is hounded in the other hy a river , called the Pentagonet , the old name for the Penobscot , which is put where the Kennehec is ordinarily found , and by Nova Scotia , which runs even west of that river on the north . Such are the marvellous discoveries of the Queen 's officers , which are entirely to overturn the American position . Such is the singular evidence of acquaintance with the boundaries of the United States , which is to overrule the authority of the negotiators of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that these negotiators did not prove themselves so very unskilful and ignorant in that business as to justify the supposition , that they would not have laughed to scorn the very idea of such guides as these in the description of their national boundaries . But there is another little discovery made by the Comnnssioner in this department of maps , which makes too good a story to be lost . We will give Mr. Gallatin 's account of it , as follows " It had heretofore been contended , on the part of Great Britain , that the boundary described in the treaty of 1783 , was identic with , and suggested by the height of land mentioned by Pownail , as that in which the Kennebec , the Penobscot , and the St. Croix had their sources . The same assertion is repeated in the Report , and the same reasons assigned for it . But the former agents of the British Government had denied the identity of the treaty boundary with that designated by the Proclamation of 1763 . That identity is now admitted in the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viz , that the description of the southern boundary of the Province of Quebec , in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 , was derived from the information in the map published by Evans , in 1755 , although the eastern portion of that map , as republished by Pownall in 1776 , belongs to him , and not to Evans ; and that the descriptions contained in the Proclamation of 1763 are a mere echo of the information produced by the explorations of Governor Pownall ; which information was for the first time published , together with his map , in the year 1776 , by Governor Pownail. // This anticipating echo is all that belongs exclusively to the report . " - p. 146 . But , fearing lest this might not be intelligible enough , Mr. Gallatin returns to the subject in another place . " The British Commissioners affirm that the height of land described by Evans and Pownall in 1755 , extended to the eastern branches of the Penobscot , ' and that the description of the southern boundary of the Province of Quebec , in the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Evans , the highlands there spoken of being identical with the height of land laid down in Evans 's map . " They clearly quote Evans 's map of 1755 , without having seen it ; though they might have found a reprint of it in Jeffery 's Atlas , No. 18 . It is entitled A map of the Middle British Colonies in America , viz. , Virginia , Maryland , Delaware , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , New York , Connecticut , and Rhode Island . ' It does not embrace a single foot of the height of land in question , and does not approach it . The Connecticut river is not delineated on it further north than a few miles north of the 43d degree of latitude , or about 140 miles south of the sources of that river . All north of that latitude , ( 430 10 , ) and east of the Hudson and of Lake Champlain , is a blank on that map ; and the name height of land ' is nowhere used init. " - p. 162 . Her Majesty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion , which they refer to , was added to the map of Evans twenty years after the publication of the latter . Unluckily for them , it sweeps away their position entirely , and not without betraying the general character of all their argument . The web is made of the same woof throughout , although it may be that only here and there a great and undeniable rent will show its texture . But what shall we say to the partial suppressions in some of the extracts quoted , and to the perverted arrangement of others , so as to deduce a meaning which they would not naturally bear ? What , to the quotation of an argument from the American statement of their claims as an admission against themselves , with recourse to the singular expedient of omitting the last sentence of it , which completely rebuts the point of the objection ? This is much the same thing with quoting from a book the statement of an antagonist position , and neglecting to take the least notice of the subsequent paragraph , which // overthrows it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which nations , strong in the confidence of justice in their cause , naturally proceed ? Is it like the far-famed and much boasted honor of Great Britain , to sanction a resort to such miserable petty shifts and evasions ? We think not . We trust , that they have not yet become so fixed in their determination to gain a communication between their provinces , as to resolve upon acquiring it by such dishonest pretences . But if they have , if the moral principles of Her Majesty 's ministers are not fixed enough to resist the temptation held out , we trust that the details of the negotiation hereafter to be carried on will establish in the clearest light , upon our side , the true nature of the position which they are driven to occupy in order to sustain it . We regret that our limits will not admit , at this time , of our going very fully into the evidence of the misrepresentations alluded to , consistently with some degree of attention to other very interesting branches of the subject . They are distinctly set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer our readers for further information , if they desire it . Our present purpose is to consider how far the arguments of Her Majesty 's Commissioners , drawn from supposed admissions against our claims made by American agents during the controversy , are entitled to any weight . One very strong objection to the whole British position , appears to us to be , the tendency constantly manifested by its supporters to go into matters which have only a secondary connexion with the real question at issue . Here is a plain provision of a treaty . There can not he a doubt about its real meaning . The British say it can not be executed according to that meaning . Very well . That is a point to be established by reference to facts in geography , susceptible of no misapprehension . It can not he established by the chance admission of this or that American , who had no more materials upon which to form an opinion than the British themselves . Let us now take an example of the nature of this sort of authority , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The object of Her Majesty 's Commissioners was to prove , that the State of Massachusetts had , in the year 1792 , 50 understood the terms of the treaty , as , in a grant made by her in that year , expressly to limit the extent of her territory within the country watered by the branches of the // Penobseot . Hence they pretend , that the State then admitted the highlands of the treaty to he very far south of the position , which is now assumed by the United States as the true one . But let us quote from the Report itself . " That this was admitted by the Government of the State of Massachusetts in 1792 , before the separation of Maine from that State , is proved by a contract entered into by that State , with Jackson and Flint , for the sale of a tract of land bounded to the east , by the St. Croix River , the tract being thus de-scribed " Westerly , by a line on the east side of the great eastern branch of Penobscot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the River Scoodiac , ( the St. Croix , ) and a line extending northerly from the source thereof to the highlands ; and Northerly , by the highlands , or by the line described , in the Treaty of Peace between the United States and His Britannic Majesty . ' " The western bounds of this grant are here covenanted to be formed by a line six miles distant from the eastern branch of Penobscot River , which line would run , by a just construction of the contract , to the source of that eastern branch , and no further . The northern limits were to be formed by the highlands of the Treaty of 1783 , and the eastern hounds by the River St. Croix , and a north line running to the highlands . This method of description is a mere paraphrase of the boundary description of the treaty ; and the inference is clear , that the parties conceived the eastern branch of the Penobscot to take its rise in those highlands . This is further proved in Greenleaf 's Map of Maine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the improved editions of which are the best authority in the United States up to the present day . On that map the boundary line itself of the grant to Jackson and Flint is laid down six miles from the eastern branch of the Penobscot , and the point of departure of that line is taken from that part of the eastern branch , which is opposite to the most western waters of the St. Croix . The line then continues to the source of the said eastern branch , where it stops , and where , unquestionably , the parties at that time conceived the highlands to be . Mr. Greenleaf , in his Statistical View of the District of Maine , ' published in 1816 , further confirms this to have been the general understanding at that day , by describing the highest points of land between the *. dtlan1ic and the St. Lawrence , as contained in a tract of country running northeasterly // between the sources of the Du Loup , a branch of the Chaudi*re , and the east branch of the Penobscot. " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake in his map . That is all the basis there is to the argument . Mr. Gallatin tells the rest of the story . " The plan of the survey may at any time hereafter be produced by the United States . It was executed in the years 1793 and 1794 , and contains 2,943,133 acres . Its eastern boundary extends from the Scoodiac Lakes , one hundred and fifty-two miles magnetic north , crossing the St. John above its junction with the Madawaska , and extending about fifteen miles beyond it . There the surveyors , having mistaken tributary streams of the Madawaska for rivers emptying into the St. Lawrence , turned to the west along highlands which , owing to that mistake , they supposed to be the highlands of the treaty . The western boundary of the tract is , from its northern extremity to the sources of the Penobscot , for 83 miles parallel to the eastern boundary , crossing the St. John , the . *tiguash , and the Restook , near its source . Further south that western boundary is parallel to the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - p. 147 . Now we happen , within a few weeks , to have seen the survey of this grant , which is upon record in the office of the land agent of Massachusetts . Upon that survey the north line runs along within twenty-five miles of the St. Lawrence . So that if those purchasers , Messrs . Jackson and Flint , had been able to fulfil their engagements to the State under their contract , Massachusetts would have been called in before this time as warrantor , to make good the title to a large portion of the territory , which the British now dispute . If , therefore , this is any authority at all as to the construction put in 1792 by the State of Massachusetts upon the words of the treaty , it goes directly against the position taken by the Commissioners . But we are not , on our part , disposed to rely upon this species of testimony . The treaty is as open to us as it ever has been to those who have preceded us . Its provisions are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries proceed in the only way that they can , in order to acquire the necessary information . Let them trace the sources of all the streams that flow into the St. Lawrence , and from thence proceed to find the upper sources of the Atlantic rivers . Upon that intermediate space described between // these limits is the boundary of the Treaty of 1783 , he it high or low . If it has not yet been found , it is only because it has not been sought for with the perseverance necessary to explore so wild a country , and not at all because it is not there . But the Commissioners , not satisfied with their fruitless attempt to involve the State of Massachusetts in an inconsistency , have undertaken to direct an argumentum ad hominem against Mr. Gallatin himself . It appears that that gentleman , very incautiously , as we think , in a confidential letter written while he was acting as one of the Ministers Plenipotentiary to negotiate the Treaty of Ghent , to the Secretary of State , did express an opinion that Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastward of the Penohscot . This was an opinion casually thrown out in a letter not intended for publication , and based upon information now admitted hy the author himself to have been insufficient and erroneous . The practice , peculiar to the United States , of making public all the papers connected with a negotiation , not long after it is over , is one calculated very much to embarrass those who act under instructions from the Government , as well as that Government itself . It furnishes foreign nations with opportunities to adapt their tone to the doctrines which they find laid down in these private papers , and thus to endeavour to hring on a contradiction , and , through that , a charge of inconsistency . It is like playing at cards with the opportunity of seeing the hand of an opponent , without disclosing your own . We know not that any remedy can be provided for the inconvenience . The only useful result will be , to inspire all Government officers with a proper degree of caution not to hazard opinions without full examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to apprize them , that the word " confidential* ' at the head of a paper can only signify , in a few years , what may be read by all the world . For the rest , we do not perceive that this opinion of Mr. Gallatin 's is entitled to any weight in a discussion like this . He has nobly redeemed it since , by presenting not an opinion , but an argument , based upon a full and complete examination of the evidence , the soundness of which , in our firm belief , it is not possible for human ingenuity to disturb . The British may make the most they can of the one , if they will only give America the full benefit of the other . // On the whole , when we consider the sort of education our public men have had to prepare them for the management of great controversies , it is wonderful that the negotiations which have been carried on with foreign nations , should have been so generally successful as they have been . In the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a statesman is absurd , because such is the precarious nature of popular favor , no man can beforehand entertain any reasonable certainty , that after he has prepared himself he will he supported by it . The independence of all necessity to earn a livelihood , without which such fitting can not be carried far , constitutes a serious drawback upon success , inasmuch as it dissolves the strongest bond by which the members of the community are held in sympathy . The self-made men , that is , individuals who have by their own meritorious exertions raised themselves from a condition of poverty and destitution to great consideration among their fellows , will always be the most likely persons to enjoy the honors which the country has to give . Yet , by the necessity of wasting their early years in the struggle for mere subsistence , they are all their lives exposed to feel the deficiency of cultivation , which those years well spent only can supply . It is therefore not at all surprising , that errors should sometimes he committed , or rather it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of our foreign policy , than have been thus far . Almost all those of which we have any knowledge , have been caused by insufficient information , and perhaps an unwillingness to assume the labor of investigation . If we were not afraid of subjecting ourselves to a charge of partisanship , we might adduce abundant evidence of the injurious effects of these errors during the first half of the administration of President Jackson . The time has not yet arrived to show all of them to the country in their naked simplicity . But one of them which was committed by a gentleman of distinguished character , the late Mr. Edward Livingston , has had too serious a connexion with the subject in hand to permit our passing that over in the same silence that will cover the rest . Mr. Gallatin alludes to it in this manner . " The fact , that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs did lay before the Parliament of Great Britain the report of the late Commissioners , affords strong evidence , that that dis // tinguished statesman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found time thoroughly to investigate the merits of the case , and to judge for himself . This is not at all surprising . I could quote the instance of an intelligent and enlightened Secretary of State of the United States , much less burdened with official duti.es than a British Minister , who , on this very question , did , subsequent to the award , propose to substitute for the due north line , another , which would have given to Great Britain the greater part , if not the whole of the disputed territory . Why the proposal was made , and why it was not at once accepted , can not be otherwise accounted for , so far at least as regards the offer , than by a complete ignorance of the whole subject . " - Preface , p. 9 . We are afraid that this cause is but too truly assigned for much of the erroneous management , which it has been the lot of the interests of Maine to endure , for some years past , at the hands of the General Government . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Livingston to add , that he was not the originator of the proposition of a northwest line , which would have exactly fallen in with the argument of Mr. Featherstonhaugh , in the Report now under consideration . The suggestion was President Jackson 's , and was declared to be based upon a local habit of surveying in the western country , which was not quite so safe a guide in the management of national questions , as a profound knowledge of the history of the countries connected with the dispute , and an investigation into the documentary evidence of title , might have been . We are not , however , aware of the existence of a single letter by Mr. Livingston , in the course of his correspondence with the British Minister upon this subject , which will do him credit with posterity , and which has not weakened the position of the United States in the negotiation . We have already in a former article* explained the character of his proceedings so fully , that they need not be further dwelt upon at this time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not open to the same kind of objection . If there has been no progress made by him to a settlement of the difficulty , at least there has been no appearance of surrender on our side , of the points in dispute . The issue , which bid fair at one moment to be entirely overlooked , has been again established // by him upon its ancient footing , from which it is now to be hoped that the government will never again recede , unless with the full concurrence of the State of Maine , and of the Union . It is perfectly well known to our readers that the survey made by order of Her Majesty 's ministry , which has been the means of ushering to the world the report of Mr. Featherstonhaugh , incited the Government of the United States to organize a commission of survey on our part . Circumstances not yet entirely explained , caused so great a delay in proceeding upon it last season , that little or no satisfactory information has thus far been gained . The Commissioner charged with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the source of the St. Croix , was unable to reach the ground until the middle of September , and he was early prevented from a prosecution of the work by the setting in of winter . Nor were the other two gentlemen who started earlier upon their portion of the duty , which was to trace the dividing highlands , much more successful in accomplishing it than Major Grahame . The partial report which has been submitted by them and furnished to both Houses of Congress , contains little more than an account of the privations they underwent . There is enough , however , to prove the difficulty of access to the region in dispute , by reason of its wild condition , and indirectly somewhat to shake the credit to he placed in the maps and statements of their immediate predecessors . We earnestly hope that the survey will be persevered in , until the doubt , that now hangs over the character of this territory , shall be entirely dispelled , and the United States enabled to specify with perfect geographical distinctness that boundary which divides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; - a boundary which does not the less exist , because it has thus far remained buried in the wilderness . It is idle to pretend , that the line found by Mr. Featherstonhaugh is that boundary . It is nothing but a range of highlands or mountains which runs through the territory in dispute . It divides the tributaries of one river ( the Penobscot ) that flows into the Atlantic , from those of another river ( the St. John ) , that flows into the same through the Bay of Fundy , neither of which rivers has the remotest connexion with the rivers that fall into the St. Lawrence ; and all of which , it is manifest by a single glance at any map , are restrained by a // barrier impassable to them from ever mingling their waters with those of that stream . How , under these circumstances , the commissioners can affirm , as they do at the close of their Report , that they " have found a Line of Highlands , agree . ing with the language of the 2nd article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Connecticut River to the sources of the Chaudi*re , and passing from thence , in a northeasterly direction , South of the Roostuc , to the Bay of Chaleurs , " must be matter of profound astonishment to every person who takes the trouble to compare them . Whatever may be the opinion entertained in England , of one thing we are sure , that no American ever should , nor do we believe one ever will concede , that the statement is true . It is to be hoped , that Her Majesty 's ministers will not seek to rest their position upon any portion of this Report ; but if they should , we trust that our Government will have spirit enough peremptorily to refuse to proceed upon any such basis . It is generally understood , that little or no progress has been made in the negotiation for several years past . The late President declined to avail himself of the opportunity presented by the action of Congress authorizing him to send a special minister with extraordinary powers , and persisted in conducting the affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him to take this course , we are uninformed . We are nevertheless bound to believe that he had strong ones . But the effect was unfavorable , in so far as it gave an impression abroad , that the Government and people of the United States were not sensible of inconvenience from delay . There was no such insensibility at that time , either in Maine or in Massachusetts ; and there is none such now . The feeling of insecurity in regard to our peaceful relations with Great Britain , is more widely entertained in those States than people are generally aware of . It will continue to prevail as long as this question remains open . It has some effect upon almost all the transactions in our eastern commercial cities . This is made strikingly perceptible , whenever intelligence of any movement within the limits of the disputed territory is received . We earnestly hope that a stop will soon be put to it ; and we trust that the coming in of a new administration of the General Government will be the signal for a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . // It is also understood that the tenacity , with which the British Government clings to the right of possessing this tract of land , is mainly owing to the fact , that a road to connect the British provinces of New Brunswick and Canada must run through it , and that , in a military point of view , such a communication is indispensable to the protection of them both . We shall not now inquire how far it is to he supposed we ought to go in conceding what , after all , is sought by the British as a security against ourselves ; nor yet , whether the mode in which the claim has been presented to our consideration has always been consistent or courteous . In the latter particular there have been faults on both sides . Nothing can well he in worse taste , and more really disadvantageous to our cause , than the vaporing declamation and bombastic braggadocio which has sometimes issued from our public men , when treating the subject . The government of Great Britain rests too strongly in the consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . Nothing avails with it so much as a determination , resolutely , decidedly , but moderately expressed ; - a determination which , as it seeks not to intimidate , will also never be relaxed by intimidation . This will furnish a better reliance , than all the small artillery which Governors ' messages , Legislative resolutions , and Congressional speeches can supply . The main use of these is to give indications of the unanimity of popular sentiment throughout the Union ; and even here their effect will he somewhat in the ratio of ' their abstinence from all unsuitable violence . The idea has been suggested of the possibility of settling this long standing difficulty by reference to a new arbitration . The great obstacle to it is to be found in the selection of a suitable arbiter . The influence of Great Britain in Europe is so great , that scarcely any sovereign can be said to be perfectly independent of it . Some might not incline to assume an umpirage ; others would be found scarcely acceptahle to us . The state of Europe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any addition to the causes for mutual jealousy and distrust which already prevail among them . Yet , notwithstanding all these difficulties , if a suitable arbiter can be found , who is willing to assume the labor of investigating the question , and the two governments , of Great Britain and of the United States , persist in their decision not to // move an inch forward to a compromise , we know of no peaceful alternative , other than to submit the question a second time . Should such a result take place , we beg leave to suggest the expediency of previously agreeing upon two points ; the first , that the arbiter be properly apprized beforehand , how far his decision may go , and yet continue binding upon the parties ; the second , that neither party shall have any excuse whatever for a refusal to enforce the decree . We think the failure of a second umpirage after the manner of the first , can be attended with nothing short of a state of hostility between the two countries ; and however strongly we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not yet prepared to say that it is in itself a justification for war . Nothing but the conviction , that Great Britain is wholly and utterly uncompromising , would bring us to that point . We do not yet entertain such a conviction . We hope better things , - we believe in better things ; and we trust that a revival of the negotiation at this moment of repose from our usual domestic strife , under new auspices , and with extraordinary energy , will have the effect of awakening Her Majesty 's ministers more thoroughly than they have ever yet been awakened , to the expediency of mastering the details of the question , and then coming to terms . rilbus would be removed a fruitful source of bitterness , and a great step would be made towards the establishment of a better understanding upon other subjects , which now threaten to disturb the harmony that ought to prevail between the kindred nations@@184058947.txt NOT contented with a life of eminent usefulness to his country , in the course of which Mr. Madison passed with honor through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to signalize the moment of his death by the communication of these papers to his countrymen . How much he valued them himself , was shown by the care which he took in preparing them for publication . How much he believed the people of the United States would value them , he proved by the testamentary provision which he made respecting them . He conceived that such would be the curiosity to read them , booksellers would vie with each other in the endeavour to secure the copy-right from his wido*w , and hence that it was a perfectly safe calculation in him to cl ) arge upon the sale of it legacies to the amount of twelve hundred dollars , whilst leaving the residuary net proceeds to Mrs. Madison . He was greatly mistaken in this expectation . In the grand lottery of book publication , it is not certain that a meritorious work will always turn out a prize . And publishers have , in America as well as elsewhere , so often realized this truth , that they are excusahly slow in venturing upon new and untried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this instance was , after it became certain that private enterprise would not undertake the publication of the work , that Mrs. Madison determined to offer it to Congress and to the Nation . By them it was subsequently purchased for the sum of thirty thousand dollars , and under their authority it has now been published . We are glad that this disposition has been made of it , as well because of the fitness that the original manuscripts should make a part of the National Archives , as because by it the services of a compe // tent and responsible Editor were secured to their publication in a proper form . Mr. Gilpin appears to have done every thing in his power to facilitate the understanding of the text by the public . But although we attach very great value to the Madison papers , we are by no means disposed to go the length of Mr. Robbins , the Senator from Rhode Island , who in his place described them as " the most valuable work that has appeared since the days when Bacon gave to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimen of the magniloquence for which this country is so remarkable , and which has its focus in the Congress of the United States . It is altogether too long a period of time to look hack upon , and too many profound men and brilliant geniuses have lived and written in the interval , for us to like to venture upon such a comparison . Besides , it appears to us to be doing great injustice to the work and its author , to take it up in this tone . It is neither a work of genius , nor does it treat very profoundly of any department of human knowledge . Its value , so far as we can understand it , is of a peculiar and somewhat unique character . It is the record of an extraordinary coincidence , in the same assembly , of men of practical skill , legislative talent , and disinterested purposes , such as the world had not often seen before , and such as it may never see again . The result was a written form of government which has already braved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time longer to be reckoned as a solitary exception to the rule in regard to similar instruments . The process by which this remarkable instrument was produced in a country where so many elements have always existed , and still exist , to defeat it , will always be deserving of profound study by all who interest themselves in political science . But we ought , at the same time , carefully to guard ourselves against the supposition , that the same measures which brought this assembly to a happy conclusion , could be repeated at pleasure with similar results upon any future occasion . It is very doubtful whether an equally good constitution with that which we are now considering , could now be made , notwithstanding all the knowledge we have acquired of its operation in the lapse of years . And it is still more doubtful , whether the very same men could or would have made the very same instrument at any other moment , before or since , than that in which they did make it , or // whether , if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other time have assented to it . So much of a lucky accident do we consider the formation ot ' our government , that we confess ourselves very incredulous as to the value which these papers can ever possess to any one hereafter , who shall seek in them for guides to action upon some future contingency that may occur of the same kind . Their great value appears to us to consist in the lesson they teach us , respecting the necessity of maintaining the government we have , and in the opportunity they furnish to later generations of understanding the principles which were intended to regulate its application to human events ; but in this they are of value to citizens of the United States , and to them only , of all the human race . One great merit of the Constitution is , that it was so well adapted to a pre*ixisting system of confederated States , each already possessed of an organized government of its own , as to combine them all , with as little of disturbance to established ideas and of friction in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to occur . But this is only a relative merit . It is not positive virtue , which should recommend the system to be introduced in other States that had never been subjected to the inconveniences of a confederation . If it became a question to any nation about to change its form of government , whether , for the sake of realizing the advantages that accrue from a constitution like that of the United States , it would be desirable to organize twenty or more distinct and independent States in the various sections of the country , for it to act upon , we think it would be easy to foresee that the decision would not be in the affirmative . The experiment has failed thus far wherever it has been tried . And the conclusion to be drawn is , not that the Constitution of the United States is , in the abstract , the most perfect system of government conceivable for all countries , but that it is admirably suited to the precise purpose in America for which it was created . If you did not presuppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then presuppose the exact organization into separate social communities called kStates , which exist here , the constitution would be of scarcely more worth than the thousand and one paper forms which have hardly outlived the date of their creation . If we are correct in our conjecture , then , it is the fitness of that instrument which is more to be considered than its abstract excellence . Hence the Madison Papers // will scarcely teach the inquirer after truth any new and marvellous axioms in the science of government , so much as the application of old and established ones to the peculiar condition of a people already organized into separate cornmunitie* , and seeking no more than for certain definite objects , expected to be gained thereby , to engraft upon their established system a few features of consolidation . Let no one , then , take up the Madison Papers with any hope to find general receipts for constitution-making in its pages , or materials with which to cultivate a captious and amendment-seeking temper towards our own . If he should , then will he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the body politic . No . Let him rather seek it as a searcher in history for examples of the difficulty which attends the establishment of all great political innovations ; and , having perceived the manner in which that difficulty was in this one instance overcome , let him be wary how he attempts to overturn , to alter , or even to modify the results , he for one is so fortunate as to enjoy . It is doubtless true , that there are many imperfections in the constitution , which it might be advisable to remedy if possible . One of the greatest merits of its framers was , that they did not pretend that it was a perfect instrument . They recommended it simply as the best that could be expected to be gained at the time ; and it doubtless was the best . What is not often the case , it has worked in practice far better than was anticipated ; so well , indeed , that we thinkit wholly unadvisable , in quest of fancied improvements , to run the smallest hazard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to conceive of the formation of a good plan of government , like that of the constitution of the United States , by a select number of wise and patriotic individuals , than that , when formed by them , the people of the several States of America should have deliberately assented to its adoption ; and even more than this , that after it had been adopted , this bit of paper should have continued a permanent rule of action to millions of beings for a period of time now exceeding half a century . If there were no other source of interest in the Madison Papers , these considerations would alone be sufficient to excite it in us . The problem of man 's capacity for self-government upon an extended scale , still depends for its satisfactory solution exclusively upon this exampIe. // It is then natural , that we should turn to the documents which relate to the commencement of the experiment with eager curiosity . The men who made the constitution are no longer here to explain the mode in which they arrived at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expositions they may have left behind them . Among these , the work now under discussion must always claim a high rank , as coming from one of the leading minds in the formation of it , and as embracing the opinions of all the others which were engaged in codperation . It may follow , that posterity will owe to Mr. Madison a larger debt of gratitude for his posthumous publication , than he created by his valuable services whilst in public life . The most brilliant productions of existing wisdom or genius not infrequently lose all their value with the departure of the spirit that set them into activity . The principles upon which the value of a form of government rests , must be transmitted with it , or it will soon change its character . The constitution of the United States will become a piece of parchment , whenever its living force in the breasts of the American people shall have passed away . But what is that force which many are so fond of lauding , without ever taking the pains to comprehend an atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that voluntary abnegation of power by masses of men for certain useful ends , which in all other forms of government is compulsive . In short , kSelf-restraint . The records of time furnish no instance of successful resistance to the passions which ordinarily exercise the most unbounded sway over the popular heart , like that which moved the people of these States to adopt the Constitution . There have been innumerable examples of resistance to oppression when exercised by others ; very few , of surrender of the means and the will to exercise it when they are actmially possessed . The revolutionary war which established our Independence was a commonplace struggle in comparison with that which erected our present form of government . The one was in accordance with that love of the largest liberty , natural to mankind . It appealed not to the reason , but to the feelings . It was the offspring of noble impulses , which might not have required much of regulating judgment . But the spontaneous sacrifice of power when once acquired , the cheerful assent to a vigorous plan of selfcontrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral , and a rule over resisting passions , far more difficult to execute , as it was , we think , more creditable to accomplish . It is doubtless true , that the knowledge of the principles of popular government had been long practically understood in America , under the forms which had been established by charters granted from the mother country to the colonies . But these were , after all , systems imposed , and not originated . And however directly they might lead to the maintenance of the social system , much as it bad been in the several States , they furnished no precedent for the union of those States under a form in many points of paramount obligation . The common cause of Independence for a moment joined them together in a common Declaration , but this was a very different thing from a permanent government . The necessity of combining to resist the common enemy in the most effective possible manner , made the want of it immediately perceptible . But no sooner did the representatives of the States in Congress turn their attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles to their success became on all sides fearfully manifest . The resolutions organizing committees for the purpose of preparing a Declaration of Independence , and of digesting a frame of government , were passed by the Congress on the same day , the 11th of June , 1776 . The first instrument was reported , considered , and adopted , by the 2d of the following July . But the second was not reported until the 12th of that month , was not adopted by Congress until the 7th of November , 1777 , sixteen months afterwards , and was not ratified by the Legislatures of all the States until March , 1781 . Three or four years were spent in discussing it , and the final ratification of Maryland took place long after the minds of runny had become made up , that , although it might be the best thing they could get at the time , it was not the less a perishing device . It is no doubt true , that this long delay was not wholly owing to the character of the proposed system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the period in question in the arduous duty of defending the country from the enemy , who at times pressed so bard upon them as to make all other considerations secondary to that of their own safety . But if this state of things had a tendency on the one hand to delay action upon the new frame of government , it presented on the other , the strongest pos // sible inducements to secure its acceptance at last . Yet such were the obstacles in the way of all agreement , and so great was the unwillingness of the several States to part with the power they possessed , that it may reasonably be doubted whether any thing short of the enemy thundering at the gate would have overcome them . There were jealousies of the large States on the part of the small ones , the opposition between slavery and free labor , the conflict of right to the unoccupied territories , the fear of consolidation , and , above all , the terror of a new and untried experiment , each operating with so much power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accepted at all , than that it was disputed so long . That instrument purported to be a compromise between all interests . It was nothing more than an attempt to retain a form of union without conceding the means to establish one . Yet , feeble and inefficient as it was , it made a necessary and very important step to the accomplishment of better things which would never have been brought about without it . It may be considered as filling up the transitionstate of the country between its infancy and its manhood . The history of the confederation is by far the most important , though we believe it to be the least studied , portion of our annals . We call it important , because it is the account of an attempt to reduce to practice a particular theory respecting government , which has always been , and for aught we know will always be , a favorite with young minds in the United States . The germ of our party divisions must be found here . It is so fascinating an idea , that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is avoidable by those who are able to govern themselves , that we are never surprised at perceiving the extremes to which the doctrine has been sometimes pushed . For this cause it is that the road to popular favor in the United States has always been by the abnegation of power ; and that to an extent sometimes much further than has proved advantageous to the country . But the great example of the practical operation of such a doctrine must be studied in the years of the Confederation . That system failed , because it was deficient in the indispensable vital energy which must necessarily reside in every form of government , to make it of any use to keep up one . It failed , because the jealousy of power that is liable to abuse had been carried so far as to cut off even that share of it // which might have been usefully exercised . The separate States , acting in reference to each other rather as independent sovereignties than as divisions of a homogeneous people , conceded to the common cause nothing which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concessions , which they were persuaded to make , proved nominal , for the reason that they granted n* means of coercion over themselves in cases when they refused to abide by them . The Congress in which the national power was vested was a deliberative body endowed with very feeble executive powers . There was no distinct national executive department , and no judiciary . The representatives of the States sat in conclave as fractional parts of the single vote each State was equally able to give , and performed their duty of recoinmending measures which it was never within their power to cause to he completed . They disputed with each other , they exhorted their constituency , sometimes they entreated and at others implored , but it was all of no avail . The state wheels would not move regularly when there was no force that could he brought to bear directly and simultaneously upon all , and the natural consequences of irregular motion ensued , disorder , discontent , and ultimate stoppage of the whole . The violence of war introduced anarchy enough in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of peace to prove how fast the road to social disorganization can he travelled , when the people who hold the power are not willing to part with it in quantities sufficient to do them any good . The Confederation may he considered as having fully illustrated hy a ten years ' operation the fatal error of its conception . To the most intelligent and best informed classes of the community , less than one half of that period had been fully sufficient to make it apparent . But popular prejudices are always strong , and that in proportion as they are established upon some general axiom . vf he war of the Revolution had been a war for independence . And independence was synonymous in the minds of many with the largest liberty . Not absolutely with that kind of liberty which runs into open licentiousness , for that has never at any time been a favorite in America , but with as much freedom of individual action as can be reconciled with a social state . The idea of concentrating a new power , coextensive in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not a very acceptable one . And it was nothing but the slowly extending consciousness of the deplorable state of things that was occurring by reason of the absence of it , which gave it any credit . The confederation had in its brief career been able to create a common debt ; the States had incurred debts during the war ; and the citizens in their private capacities had done the same , whilst engaged in the very necessary but unproductive duty of defending their rights . The industry of the country was in a state of stagnation . There was a necessity , that , in order to the liquidation of all these demands , it should be set in motion , and nothing could give it wholesome motion but that which was not then in existence , power in a national form of goveriunent . The people , not yet aware of the true nature of the disease that afflicted them , staggering under a burden too heavy for them to bear , inclined their ears as they always will in similar cases to the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times of suffering , with nostrums of quackery to relieve the symptoms , and yet give greater ultimate violence to the complaint . What an awful catastrophe seemed impending over the brilliant outset of the Revolution . The courts of justice , through which the recovery of debts is usually effected , were threatened throughout the land . Bands of men were assembled in the Eastern States , who were working themselves rapidly up to the defiance of all law . Murmurs against the very appearance of aristocratical forms in the higher branch of the legislature of the States , were but preludes to a gathering storm directed against all inequality in the possession of property whatsoever . The foundations of the social system were in danger , because the people knew themselves to be wretched , but they did not know and were not yet in a temper to learn , what it was that was requisite to a reversal of their unfortunate condition . It was a dismal hour for those patriots , who had led in the armies and in the councils of the country during the agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had upon the reason of the people was fast sinking to nothing , under the demonstrations that were making before their eyes of the popular madness ; dismal , because it seemed as if their very exertions in the common cause were about to be considered as a ground of reproach , and the claim to a pitiful compensation , to save them from starvation , was to be regarded as a // July , desire to impose an odious and unjustifiable public burden . It seemed as if the ignorant and the desperate , with no recommendation to credit but that of being brawling demagogues , were about to usurp the stations that had so far been filled by integrity and capacity . On every side was gloom . Great Britain was chuckling over the spectacle ; France was filled with mortification ; and all the other great powers of the world were looking with contempt upon a quarrelsome mob on the other side of the Atlantic , which , like a spoiled child , had whined and roared , and fought for the possession of at rinket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unwilling or unable to learn . In other countries a state of things like this would have ended in the establishment of an effective military monarchy . Iii America the eyes of the people were opened before the occurrence of any such necessity . The insurrection in the western part of Massachusetts carried with it a wholesome lesson to the minds of all thinking men throughout the Union . Hence it happened that all seemed lost , at the very moment when the causes were most rapidly maturing for a restoration . There were no military adventurers at once able and vicious enough to take advantage of the anarchical spirit , nor , even if there had been , is it probable they could have made much progress with the malecontents . These were poor and wretched , but they were not desperate . They were pushed to excesses by the pressure of the burdens that had fallen upon them , but they were not inclined to follow blindly the suggestions whatever they might be of any adventurous leader . Their rising was rather tumultuous than an organized plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little regard to fitness for the duties they were expected to perform . It was a natural consequence , that , upon the first appearance of an organized resistance by the civil authority of the Stare , the assemblage dispersed . It thus did little mischief , but on the contrary a great deal of incidental good . It proved the death of the Confederation . The experiment had been carried far enough for every useful purpose . To persevere in it further was clearly a suicidal attempt . Nothing remained but to make a new effort at social organization . And in this all the ability , and the honesty , and the good sense of the country were now ready to combine . The fact was apparent , that if the States // should fail in devising some method of self-government that deserved the name , the independence they had expended so much blood and treasure to acquire was about to prove a misfortune instead of a blessing , and that the tyrannical exercise of power by Great Britain , which had been thought dangerous enough to justify resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contrast with the license that seemed likely to succeed it . But this conviction , which was now generally established , had been wrought only by the experiment which had been made of Confederation . And it is in this point of view , that that plan must be considered as having served a highly useful purpose . Its failure satisfied the minds of a majority , that power must be actually vested in a central system , a belief which could make its way in America only by the strongest proof of necessity . But the fact that it did make its way in time for the common safety , constitutes a stronger argument in support of popular government on a large scale than all the abstract propositions that have ever been uttered . Yet it must not be imagined that this general belief which had ohtained , of the necessity of adopting a new form of government , extended to a proper idea of the degree of power which it was expedient to infuse into it . There were and still are many good citizens in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberty as to be always averse to a surrender of an effective portion of it . No one who knows the diversity of sentiment that prevails wherever there are numbers of human beings , will fail to understand the difficulty in the way of bringing a majority to agree in any definite remedy , or upon any single course of measures , to check the public distress . Neither was it until after long continued correspondence and repeated trials , that the same individuals who had gone through the heat of the revolutionary contest were enabled to persuade their countrymen to intrust them with the necessary discretion to devise one . It was a great step towards a brighter period when that confidence was finally given ; for it showed , that , whatever might be the temporary caprice of the many , they still retained a capacity to appreciate the characters of those who most deserved their esteem . The moment of public danger is generally the test of popul.ar opinions respecting men . In such a moment , the election of delegates to the Federal Convention that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the States . The consequence was the choice of the best men , and the formation of an assembly as remarkable as can be found in the history of deliberative bodies . We call it remarkable , but not so much for genius , or eloquence , or learning , though it was not without all these attributes in some of its members , as for the spirit which animated its deliberations ; a spirit filled with the difficulties of the task imposed , yet resolved to do all that could be done to overcome them ; a spirit conscious of the responsibility which rested upon the movement , and of the fatal consequences that might succeed its failure . The result was the Constitution of the United States . But this result was not the work of any single man of the assembly . There was doubtless great inequality in the shares in which the several members contributed to it , but the fact , we think , is established , that almost every one contributed something . Conflicting interests often hit upon intermediate propositions , the merit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them can yet be claimed by neither . Many of the most marked features of the instrument grew under the compound handling to which they were subjected , and all visibly improved as they passed along . How could such a process have been carried on , if the members had not been beforehand imbued with the spirit of self-sacrifice of opinion , and had not with great.singleness of mind devoted themselves to execute the solemn purpose for which they had been called together ? There were not many subjects for discussion , upon which a tolerable degree of unanimity could be naturally expected ; there were several , upon which the States were arrayed in diametrical opposition to one another . The fears of the small States were at war with the hopes of the large ones ; the pride , with the jealousy , of state sovereignty ; the navigating interests of the Northern , with the slave labor of the Southern States . And last though not least , the dread of an unbridled democracy had a sway not less marked , than that which saw in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was scarcely a shade of opinion existing in Amerjca upon government , which had not its representation in the Federal Convention , from the ultra democracy of a single representative body , combining in itself all the attributes of sovereign power , which was the favorite doctrine of Dr. Franklin , to // the monarchical tendencies of Alexander Hamilton ; from the state rights jealousy , which impelled Luther Martin and Judge Yates to retire from the assembly , to the extreme of consolidation and centralism in the person of Governeur Morris . Yet , strange as it may seem , these apparent causes of dissension proved in the end highly beneficial to a harmonious termination of the labors of the convention . For being nearly all of them guided by the right spirit , these differences of opinion were fused into the common result , in such a manner as to perfect the compound far beyond the point , to which it is likely that it would have been perfected , had a single ingredient mentioned been omitted . It was unquestionably very proper for the convention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon closing their doors and forbidding any divulging of their proceedings . And it was very well that no report should be given of these to the world , for some time after the Constitution had become the guide of national government . But we confess we see no reason why the same injunction of secrecy should for ever be maintained , or why Chief Justice Yates or Mr. Madison should incur any censure by retaining in their hands , for ultimate publication , the notes they had taken of the debates . We should not have noticed this point , if it were not that we had perceived , in a lately published volume of the Life of Hamilton , some attempt to blame Mr. Madison for his conduct in this particular . How far the judgment of the writer may have been biased to favor this opinion , by certain passages deemed unjust to and misrepresenting the sentiments of Mr. Hamilton , we will not undertake to say . There doubtless must be some allowance made in this case for the errors which reporters always commit , by misunderstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . And if the reports of Mr. Madison of the debate in the Federal Convention , so far as they affect the partners of his Iahot 's , were , like his reports of the Congressional debates under the Confederation , the only testimony extant respecting them , we should feel an inclination to enter a caveat against placing full dependence upon them . Fortunately , however , the unintentional and inevitable errors which he might have committed can be subjected to a tolerable test , by comparison with the notes of the other reporters , with the speeches made by members of the Federal Convention in the assem // blies afterwards held to approve or condemn their work , and with the numbers of " The Federalist . " Those who take delight in tracing discrepancies will find a few by following the mode here pointed out . Mr. Gilpin has done all that an editor should do to facilitate such investigations . Yet , after all , they establish nothing of importance against the general credibility of either reporter . So far from it , the coincidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is often discovered to exist in the pages of Madison and Yates , is hardly so convincing a proof to us of the genuineness of their reports , as the instances that can be found of casual disagreement between them . The well-known law of evidence on this point will dispense us from pursuing the subject , further than to exonerate Mr. Madison from all suspicion of design to misrepresent the sentiments of any of his colleagues . Let us now turn our attention to the great points of interest in these volumes . The first in time , as in importance , relates to the principle at the bottom of the change in government about to be carried into effect . Scarcely had the Convention become organized , before Mr. Edmund Randolph , one of the delegates from Virginia , brought forward the doctrines advocated by his State as a basis of the new system , embodied in a series of fifteen resolutions . Mr. Charles Pinckney , of South Carolina , followed him with a regular form of a constitution . We do not believe ( by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Journal was that form as he first presented it , for it bears too many marks of the maturing wisdom of an advanced stage in the sessions . However , that is not material to the present purpose . The great feature of reform of the vicious principle that dictated the articles of Confederation , was the same in both of the propositions , made on this day . There was no longer to be a federal compact between States , but a compact between the people of those States . The intervention of sovereigoties between the individual citizen and the national power , was to be done away with . This was a proposition very broadly laid down by various members coming from ol ) posite sections of the country , the acknowledgment of which was indispensable to progress in the new undertaking . That it might be most distinctly presented , Mr. Randolph , on the day after his first movement , concentrated the spirit of it into three resolutions . These were as follows ; // 66 1 . " That a union of the States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the articles of Confederation , namely , common defence , security of liberty , and general welfare . 2 . " That no treaty or treaties among the whole or part of the States as individual Sovereignties would be sufficient . 3 . " That a national government ought to be established , consisting of a supreme Legislative , Executive , and Judiciary . " These three propositions contain an explicit renunciation of all the false doctrine of the articles of Confederation , and contemplate the change from federation to union . Yet singular as it may seem , we do not perceive in the discussion of them that took place , a single sentiment in direct opposition . The only objection raised against them was made by Mr. Charles Pinckney , who had shown himself , on the previous day , very far from dissentient to tle l ) principle involved . Such had been the jealousy of power in several of the States when giving instructions to their delegates , that he appears to have apprehended some danger , lest the adoption of such decided resolutions might be construed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was acting . These powers , in a few Instances , extended only to the revisal of the old system , and not to its total subversion . Neither the Journal nor Mr. Madison explains the action had in the premises so clearly as Chief Justice Yates . According to him , Mr. Pinckney considered the adoption of the first resolution as tantamount to destroying the Convention . A fear lest it might be so construed by the States , led to the tacit postponement of the two first resolutions . The third , which provided a new disposition of the powers of government , was discussed more particularly upon the use of the words supreme and national ; words , it should be observed , that conveyed in an indirect form the sense of the preceding resolutions . Mr. Read , of Delaware , proposed a substitute omitting those very significant words . But so decided was the opinion of the Convention upon the point , that his change met with no favor at all , and the original resolution was adopted , six States voting for it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York being equally divided . Such was the first decision of the Convention ; a recognition , by most of its members , of the position , that the new system , though not intended to annihilate the state sovereignties , was // nevertheless in all cases of collision to be of superior obligation . From the unanimity with which it was voted we ought not however to infer , that there was no disposition in many members of the body to resist it . Most probably there was somewhat of legislative tactics used , in order to avoid fighting the real hattie upon unfavorable ground . The naked declaration , that a supreme national government of three branches ought to be established , could not present points half so advantageous for attack , as the question , that must necessarily grow out of its adoption ; the distribution of power among the departments thus to be organized , as well as the share of it which it was advisable to grant at all . Upon these it was that the true contest was decided . The articles of Confederation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each an equal share of weight in the national councils so that the small communities of Delaware and Rhode Island were exercising under them a control over the public affairs in all respects as great as Virginia , Pennsylvania , or Massachusetts . They had wrung this equal privilege from the necessities of the country during the war ; and it was from fear lest they should lose it by a change , that they manifested great aversion to any stronger measure than a mere revision of the old system . On the other hand , the large States were determined to do away with that unequal feature in the previous government first of all . An ardent struggle ensued . On the 1st of June , Mr. Patterson , of New Jersey , brought forward a string of propositions , understood by the Convention to be the ultimatum of Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Delaware , and Maryland , five out of the twelve States represented . These propositions contained a substantial enlargement of the national power , and a distribution of it into three branches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they went no further . The radical error of the system was sedulously preserved , by which the States were made the superior , and the federal government subordinate . The great question was thus brought fully before the Convention , and was discussed on botb sides with all the ability which distinguished it . Judge Patterson , Mr. Lansing , of New York , and Luther Martin exerted themselves to the utmost to sustain the parts of the old fabric which had not actually crumbled into dust , whilst Judge Wilson , Mr. Hamilton , and Mr. Madison , as strenuously contended for their demolition . // The vote however proved that seven States , among which Connecticut ranged herself , were resolved to adhere to the new system of Mr. Randolph and of Virginia , whilst only three continued their faith in the old one , as revised by Mr. Patterson on behalf of New Jersey . That this State and Delaware and Maryland should have clung with tenacity to a plan of government , by which they enjoyed a degree of power entirely disproportioned to their population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it denotes a singular want of foresight in the delegates from New York , that the earnest and eloquent remonstrances of Hamilton could not avail to prevent their casting their weight into the scale of the small States . It has been frequently the misfortune of that great State , to be embarrassed by the threads which even lilliputian politicians can wind about the stoutest frame . But although in a minority which neutralized his vote , Mr. Hamilton was nevertheless of very great service to her by labors in the Convention , for which New York owes him a debt she never has been magnanimous enough to acknowledge . Although the decisive vote upon the resolutions of Mr. Patterson ut an end to all hope of retaining the distinctive principle of the old system , a confederation of sovereign States , there was yet room to engraft upon the new one such features of it as the lovers of State sovereignty were most unwilling to see destroyed . Among these none was considered of more consequence , than the right of every State to an equal vote in the legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , gave rise to the most vehement contest that occurred during the session of the body . On the one hand , Wilson , Madison , and Rufus King , each representing a large State , advocated a representation proportioned to numbers , whilst , on the other , Judge Ellsworth , Mr. Lansing , and Luther Martin sustained the old practice of voting by States , each of them having but a single vote . The dispute upon this question threatened at one moment to break up the assembly . It was at the close of one day of the warmest discussion , the 28th of June , that Dr. Franklin was induced by the hopeless aspect of their affairs to make a motion that " prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven and its blessings on the deliberations be held every niorning . " The movernent , though doubtless sincere , had , considering the source // from which it emanated , rather too much of dramatic effect for the taste of a majority of the members . But the hour was a gloomy one , and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They decided otherwise ; and yet the conciliatory spirit , which religious feelings properly cherished might have furnished in abundance , came to them for once from considerations of temporary policy . A slow and painful process of reciprocal concession , at one moment broken otT only to be resumed with more earnestness on the next , ended in the formation of the legislative department as it now stands in the Constitution ; a comj ) licated piece of mechanism , by which numbers are allowed to prel ) onderale in the popular branch , but not without some material qualifications , whilst , in the other , each of the small States is secure in the possession of aa equal share of weight with each of the largest . Yet if we , at this time , compare the apprehensions which those small States professed to entertain of the consequences of conceding to the large ones the principle of representation proportioned to numbers , with the results of fifty years ' experience , we can place no very high estimate upon their sagacity . The idea does not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the cessation of the rule of voting by States , the delegations of the large States would be likely to vote , not according to the wishes of a whole State , but according to the predominating feeling of a small district in a *3tate . The effect of this would naturally be , and it has generally been found in practice to be , to divide the delegations of large States in opinion upon questions of public interest , to so great an extent as , in a great degree , to neutralize their force . The great State of New York , for example , which sends forty representatives to the Congress of the United States , does now show , and has shown , for several years , its numbers almost equally divided upon every test-vote on public affairs . So that , in point of mere nurnerical weight in the decision of questions , it hardly furnishes more than the little State of Rhode Island , which sends but two . Then , as it respects the oppression deemed likely to follow from combinations among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind has been actually felt . Public questions have always taken a wholly different shape , in which considerations of sectional or party policy have pre // vailed to unite States together , without discrimination as to size or relative numbers . The great States seldom act together . For many years , Massachusetts and Virginia were leading States in opposition to each other ; and of late , New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Virginia , have rarely been guided by any common or even by any settled policy whatever . There seems to be scarcely cohesiveness sufficient among the individual citizens of those SLates , to counteract the dividing tendency of national party organizations . un this particular , it may be seen that the Presidential election is exerting a greater tendency towards centralism and consolidation , than any other provision of the Constitution . But of this we propose to treat in its proper place . What we have said , thus far , of the little reason which experience has shown to justify the apprehensions entertained by the small States of the power granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , apply to the manner in which the elections under it have been thus far regulated . We are not at all sure , that a variation in the form of c7hoosing the representatives in the States would not be likely to realize all they feared and more . This variation is very simple , and the example of adopting it has in fact been already most imprudently given by several of the smaller States . We allude to the practice of electing all the representatives , to which one State is entitled , upon a single general ticket , instead of apportioning them among several districts , each containing no greater amount of population than the ratio of representation adopted by Congress may require . The temptation to parties to adopt a rule , which would throw power into their hands in large masses , will naturally be great . We are much surprised , that it has thus far excited very little attention among them . A brief calculation , only , would be necessary to show , that a combination between three or four large States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may in this manner , at some future time , control the whole policy of the Union . So serious do we consider this danger , that we should not regard as premature , any effort which should , as soon as possible , be made to provide against it by a prospective remedial law . So far as our observation has extended , we have been led to the belief , that farsightedness is the rarest quality found among statesmen . We think the speeches in these volumes // do not tend to shake the solidity of this judgment . And the entire course of debates in every one of the ratifying conventions , goes strikingly to confirm it . The reason probably was , in the present instance , that the framers of the constitution were standing in too great proxin ) ity to the details of the system , to be able to assign to each its proportionate importance relatively to the rest . They were , moreover , generally men of a practical rather than philosophical turn of mind , who brought to their work a tolerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in operation in the States which they represented , without possessing the generalizing faculty necessary to comprehend the full force of the modifications which they were now contriving upon a large scale . It has followed , from this , that , in some of the particulars where the Constitution was considered as most deficient , there has never arisen a shadow of difficulty , whilst in others , which were held to be the most skilfully matured , the action of the system has been wholly at variance with the intention . We shall endeavour to illustrate this more fully by and by . Another reflection which suggests itself upon reading these debates , is occasioned by the prevailing tone of the speakers , respecting the evils of a democracy . This , doubtless , grew out of the reaction in public opinion , caused by the experience then fresh upon them , of the latter days of the Confederation . Of one thing we are very confident , that no public man in the United States during the present century , could have ventured to express , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here reported . And these came , in many cases , from the lips even of persons who have since made a figure as leaders of that party , which has prevailed under the Constitution by unfurling the banner of democracy . We should like to know , what chance any of our young and aspiring politicians would stand of promotion at the present day , who should have the courage to express such opinions as we now cull , almost at random , from the volumes before us . Edmund Randolph , for example , expresses himself as follows ; He observed that the general object was to provide a cure for the evils under which the United States labored ; that in tracing these evils to their origin , every man had found it in the turbulence anci follies of democracy ; that some check was // to be sought for , against this tendency of our governments ; and that a good Senate seemed must likely to answer the purpose . " - p. 758 . Again , in another place , in organizing the Senate , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic licentiousness of the State Legislatures proved the necessity of a firm Senate . The object of this second branch is to control the democratic branch of the National Legislature . If it be not a firiji body , the other branch , being more numerous , and coming immediately from the people , will overwhelm it . The Senate of Maryland , constituted on like principles , had been scarcely able to stem the popular torrent . No mischief can be apprehended , as the concurrence of the other branch , and in some measure of the Executive , will , in all cases , he necessary . A firmness and independence may be the more necessary also in this branch , as it ought to guard the Constitution against encroachments of the Executive , who will be apt to form combinations with the demagogues of the popular branch . " - p. 852 . So Mr. Hamilton , upon the same subject " Gentlemen suppose seven years a sufficient period to give the Senate an adequate firmness , from not considering the amazing violence and turhulence of the democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which seizes the popular passions , they spread like wild-fire and become irresistible . He appealed to the gentlemen from the New England States , whether experience had not there verified the remark . " - p. 887 . One of these New England gentlemen , no other than Roger Sherman , went to the length of " opposing the election of the first branch of the National Legislature , insisting that it ought to be by the State Legislatures . The people , he said , immediately should have as little to do as may be about the government . They want information , and are constantly liable to be misled . " - p. 753 . But , lest these persons should be considered as expressing the sentiments of the aristocratic extrerrie in the Convention , let us turn , for comparison , to the doctrines then held by men who have since been constant favorites with the democracy . What said Mr. Madison himself ? Experience had proved a tendency in our government to throw all power into the Legislative vortex . The Executives of the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omnipotent . If no effectual check be devised for re // jiJuly , straining the instability and encroachments of ' the latter , a revolution of ' some kind or other would be inevitable . " - p. 1128 . And this in support of ' a motion to make an Executive during good behaviour . Again , he says in another place ; Why was America so justly apprehensive of ' parliamentary injustice ? Because Great Britain had a separate interest , real or supposed , and if her authority had been admitted , could have pursued that interest at our expense . We have seen the mere distinction of color n ) ade , in the most enlightened period oftime , a ground of the most oppressive dominion ever exercised by man over man . What has been the source of those unjust laws complained of ' among ourselves ? Has it not been the real or supposed interest of ' the major number ? Debtors have defrauded their creditors . The landed interest has borne hard on the mercantile interest . The holders of one species of property have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species . The lesson we are to draw from the whole is , that where a majority are united by a common sentiment and have an opportunity , the rights of the minor party become insecure . In a republican government , the majority , if united , have always an opportunity . " - p. 806 . Mr. Elbridge Gerry went much further . He says ; " The evils we experience flow from the excess of democracy . The people do not want virtue , but are the dupes of pretended patriots . In Massachusetts it had been fully confirmed by experience , that they are daily misled into the most baneful measures and opinions , by the false reports circulated by designing men , and which no one on the spot can refute He mentioned the popular clamor in Massachusetts for the reduction of salaries , and the attack made on that of the Governor , though secured by the spirit of the Constitution itself . He had , he said , been too republican heretofore ; he was still , however , republican ; but had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - p. 753 . And upon the plan of electing a Chief Magistrate by the people , he says ; " The popular mode of electing the Chief Magistrate would certainly be the worst of all . If he should be so elected , and should do his duty , he will be turned out for it , like Governor Bowdoin in Massachusetts , and President Sullivan in New Hampshire . " - p. 1149 . We have plenty of these quotations , if more are required . It must be borne in mind , that these two last-named speakers // were , in the year 1813 , elected by the popular party in the United States , to fill the two highest offices in their gift . Had it been even then generally known , that they had entertained and expressed such opinions as we have quoted , we incline to doubt whether they would have met with so high a reward for their services . The vibration of the pendulum was , however , at the moment of the Convention , at one extreme with the whole country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . " The members most tenacious of republicanism , " Mr. Hamilton observed , " were as loud as any in declaiming against the cries of democracy . " If we compare their doctrine , thea , with that now prevalent in both of the political parties of our day , and notice the eager contention going on between them as to which shall be most democratic , in name as well as in conduct , we can then form a tolerably accurate idea of the change that has come over public opinion in the interval . In truth the word democracy , as it was then understood , was never a favorite with any class of statesmen in the earliest period of our national government , not excepting even i*Ir . Jefferson himself . They had seen enough of unbridled popular strength , to be convinced that the voice of the majority was not always a safe immediate rule of action ; and it was hence the great object of the proposed form of government , so to divide power into many portions , and to combine opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weight of personal character , ample enough to guide the destinies of the country prosperously . This result , which they were aiming to bring about , they loved to denoniinate a republic , and not a democracy ; a republic , which whilst it should faithfully adhere to the general principle of reflecting the popular will , when conveyed through prescribed channels , was to be carefully guarded from experiencing the evil consequences attending the momentary fluctuations of popular feeling , and the unsteadiness and contradictory action which they occasion . It was to be the realization of that beau ide'al of government , a union of systematic energy with the largest practicable individual liberty . Thus far the operation of the system has fully realized all the expectations of its framers , but we must confess , that we do not regard as a very favorable symptom for the future , the prevailing disposition , on all sides , to change the name b.y which its founders preferred to call it . // We have already remarked the diversity of opinion that existed among the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This difference , which extended on one side from the admiration of a monarchy to that of the simplest form of representing a people , and on the other from the advocates of a perfect centralization of power to the furthest practicable distribution of it among confederated States , so far from producing its ordinary effect to paralyze action , had , in this instance , a tendency to improve and mature the object which all had equally a desire to secure . The reason was , that , however opposed the gentlemen might be in opinion , they were all under the influence of the right spirit . There were some , it is true , who seceded from the Convention , and others who declined to sign the form of constitution that was ultimately recommended , but in this conduct they appear to have been directed by scruples , honestly entertained , that they were exceeding their powers , and not by any factious or unworthy motives whatsoever . Several of those who refused their signature , were afterwards among the warmest defenders of the system , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demagogues were a class of persons unknown in that body . And it follows , that the speeches we read hear the simple , business-like character , that becomes statesmen and their occupation . The curse of our present mode of legislation , addresses to constituents to operate upon a popular election , was not then felt ; a misfortune which , if it must he regarded as having been avoided by keeping the doors closed , we feel slightly tempted to regret was ever entailed upon us by the adoption of an opposite practice . Much of the debating was conducted in that tone , just enough elevated to keep it above the familiarity of conversation , and yet not to prevent the rapid interchange of ideas , which is the most effective of despatch in deliberative bodies , but which the taste for elaborate harangues has now gone far to put out of fashion . It is probable , that the style of declamation has very much improved under the change , but we fear this advantage has been gained at the cost , not seldom , of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is but a single instance of a long , discursive speech , that of Luther Martin , which , for that reason , neither Mr. Madison nor Judge Yates inclined to report in full , but which , if we may judge of its substance by his report to the // Legislature of Maryland of the doings of the Convention , must have been a very different sort of diffuseness from that which now bears the name . Various as were the sentiments upon government of the different members , this did not prevent them from cordially acquiescing in a distinct and very reasonable practical proposition . Mr. Madison tells us , in a note , that " An independence of the three great departments of each other , as far as possible , and the responsibility of all to the will of the community , seemed to be generally admitted as the true basis of a well constructed government . " It would be difficult to name any thing that could have been better than this for the staring point of the Convention . When it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details by which the action of the proposed system was to be defIned . In this process , it is evident , from the result , that almost every shade of belief had some effect in modifying its provisions , and that thus , by a fusion of portions of these contrary doctrines into a common mass , the Constitution , like the shield forged for . ZEneas , came out much the better for the variety and the mixture of ingredients of which it was composed . The Legislative department of the government , which is provided for by the first article of the Constitution , appears to have been by far the most difficult portion of the work to bring into form , as it is the one by which , in point of fact , the powers of all three of the departments are measured and regulated . For inasmuch as this is the source of organization , it is the seat of the force which sets in motion the Executive and the Judiciary . In modelling that department , there was great danger of falling into errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been made too powerful for the safety of the respective States , or for the strength of the coordinate branches . We think experience has gone far to prove the skill by which these opposite kinds of risk were made to balance one another . It appears to us the best part of the instrument , as it is now understood in its amended form ; far better , indeed , than the organization of the Executive department . The mode in which the President should be elected , the powers which he should exercise when chosen , and the term of time during which any single individual should exercise // those powers , were topics thoroughly debated in the Convention . The result of their deliberations was the second Article of the Constitution . It is well worth the trouble to notice the degree of satisfaction which this part of their labors gave them . It was mentioned in " The Federalist " as little open to objection , and therefore needing no defence ; and it met with very gentle treatment in the ratifying Convention , when almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most violent attacks . Yet scarcely a feature of the whole system was earlier discovered to need remodelling ; not one has been constantly attended with so great difficulties in practice , or threatens so much even now to disturh , if not ultimately to overturn , the whole edifice of government to which it belongs . The original section which provided for the election of a President and Vice-President , would have been an excellent one , if it had only been predicated upon an accurate estimate of human nature . As it was not , it failed . It is very clear , both from the section itself and the temper of the debates , that there was no intention on the part of the framers of the Constitution to make the election of President an issue between individuals as candidates before the people . The intermediate agency of a body of Electors , themselves to be chosen by the people , was called into being to prevent it . That these Electors were designed to have and exercise a certain degree of discretion in the choice of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent concerted movements between the colleges , and in the provision by which no distinction was to be made in the votes for President and Vice-President , but also by the opinions frequently expressed in the volumes before us , that there would seldom be elections made by the Electors , by reason of the scattering of the votes , no single individual being likely very often to receive the suifrages of a majority of Electors . The practice under the Constitution has not corresponded to any such design . The Electors have , for the most part , performed an office merely mechanical , which might be dispensed with entirely without essential injury to the instrument , simply by counting the votes of the majority of each State in the United States , as equal to the number of its Senators and Representatives in Congress , and then adding together these several numbers . Could the original idea have been executed , we // should have much preferred it . But the effect of it would have been , vastly to increase the consequence of the Electoral Colleges , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated a sort of Saturnian reign , when men would cease to be more than moderately ambitious , when parties were not to contend with each other for the mere possession of power , and when the people would be more willing to give their confidence in advance to the agents selected by persons of their own choice , than they commonly prove to be . Such results were not destined to be among the materials of our experience , so far as we have yet learned it . The fourth election , held under the third article as it originally stood , convinced every one that it was not merely impracticable , but also dangerous . It was consequently amended into the shape in which it now stands . We now understand by the provision , that Electors are persons expected to have little or no discretion in performing their duty , but on the contrary , to do a prescribed act , with no greater advantage to the country than would follow , if the people were to do it themselves , unless it may be considered an advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater relative weight in deciding the election , than they would enjoy if the votes of free white male citizens throughout the Union were to be counted . So far as the framers of the Constitution may have intended to raise up a check over the tendency to popular heats and violence in the election of President , they must be considered as having utterly failed . It must , however , be admitted , that our experience of the effects of this important part of the Constitution , has been small in comparison with what it may be in future . It is far from improbable , that the difficulty of effecting any election by the Electors , may increase , with the spread of the country and the equality of local influence among many candidates , to so great an extent , as to make the House of Representatives in fact the Electoral College . Of the fatal effects of this upon the public morals , should it occur , who can doubt ? We will not , however , at this time , dwell upon a mere contingency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . We mean , that of the re*4igibility of the President . No topic was more fully discussed in the Convention than this . The argument on both sides was pressed with acuteness and ability , and yet the decision was favorable to // the practice . After fifty years of trial , the propriety of this decision is still disputed , and circumstances have of late given a very decided preponderance in the public mind , to an opposite doctrine . General Washington and Mr. Jefferson , by their example , dictated a practical limitation of the clause to a reelection for but a single term . There have been but three instances of failure in re*lecting a President once . But the injurious effects upon his whole system of policy during his first term , of allowing to a President the chance of reelection , have been so strongly felt , that the present disposition seems to be favorable to cutting it wholly off . We have yet to know , whether the inconveniences likely to follow the proposed change , will not be as great as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections , as stated in these volumes , are as follows . Mr. Governeur Morris said ; The ineligibility tended to destroy the great motive to good behaviour , the hope of being rewarded by a reappointment . It was saying to him , make hay while the sun shines . ' " - pp. 1124-5 . " In order to get rid of the dependence of the Executive on the Legislature , the expedient of making him ineligible a second time , had been devised . This was as much as to say , we should give him the benefit of experience , and then deprive ourselves of the use of him . " - p. 1195 . " Mr. Morris was against a rotation in every case . It formed a political school , in which we were always governed by the scholars and not by the masters . " - p. 1203 . Mr. Rufus King said , that he " did not like the ineligibility . He thought there was great force in the remarks of Mr. Sherman , that he who has proved himself most fit for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from holding it . " - p. 1146 . Mr. Hamilton " liked the new modification , on the whole , better than that in the printed report . In this , the President was a monster , elected for seven years , and ineligible afterwards ; having great powers in appointments to office ; and continually tempted , by this constitutional disqualification , to abuse them , in order to subvert the Government . " - p. 1507 . Without pretending to controvert such powerful arguments *s these , we can not , in view of the events of the last few // years , fully assent to the conclusions they arrive at . We much fear , it will ultimately appear , that the organization of the Executive department , whether the President is so for four years only , or is re*ligible , is the Pandora 's box , from whence all evils have escaped , to plague the world , and only hope is left at the bottom to console us . The principle of keeping the three great branches distinct and independent of each other , was fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are remarkable exceptions , which deserve notice in a general review of their labors . A check upon the Legislative power was placed in the hands of the President , which has proved , in some cases , a most formidable instrument for controlling its action . In like manner , the power of appointment to office , in itself strictly an Executive power , was subjected to a check from the higher branch of the Legislature . And both , Legislative and Executive departments , are subjected to the exercise of a power of revision , lodged in the hands of the Judiciary . These are the balances of the Constitution , and they have been distributed with a great deal of art . Great apprehensions were entertained in the Convention , that the Legislative branch would , notwithstanding their efforts to provide the contrary , acquire a decided preponderance over the coordinate departments . At times , there have been appearances to justify such fears ; but , on the whole , the tendency has not been very marked on any side . A very popular President is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to have his own encroached upon . With an unpopular one , the case is otherwise . Yet the appointing power is always in his hands , and that has no insignificant importance in regulating the action of both branches of Congress ; so that , after all , it may reasonably be doubted , wheth* er any attempt to alter or amend the delicate mechanism of the system , would not be productive of more unexpected injurious consequences , than are worth hazarding in exchange for the benefits that might be gained by it . Of all the departments , the most feebly constructed , as it seems to us , is the Judiciary . Without any popular strength to rest upon , with all the antagonist passions in the State organizations to resist , and obliged to rely , in a great degree , upon the codperation of both of the other branches , in order to maintain the authority of their decisions , the Judges have // no power to sustain them , excepting the weight of their character , the general rectitude of their principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them . If the President declines to enforce the execution of their decrees , or to punish the violation of them , or the Legislature refuses to abide by their construction of the Constitution , we are not able to perceive , in the system , any alternative but submission . The Court can not , indeed , be abolished by act of Congress , but it may be reorganized , and the power of reorganization is almost as dangerous as subversion . Then , by the course of duty assigned to it , it is perpetually liable to come in conflict with the laws of the States when they transcend the limits of the Federal Constitution , with no certainty that its judgments will be deemed binding , and without means to enforce them if they are not . The natural consequence of all this must , sooner or later , be a bias upon the minds of the Judges to evade the settlement of difficult points , and take refuge in collateral questions , rather than to come forward with the frankness and independence which ought ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , that thus far the apprehensions we express have been justified to a very trifling extent by experience , but we are as yet only at the beginning ; and we have no right to expect that a Marshall will often preside for thirty years together , to unite in his person the authority of moral and intellectual power with the dignity of official station . After an uninterrupted labor of four months , the work was at length matured , and the Constitution of the United States received , on the 17th of September , 1787 , the signatures of representatives from twelve out of the thirteen States . Of this number , nearly all had contributed something to the common object , but there were two or three who had taken so leading a share in the work , that it is impossible ever to allude to it without paying them the tribute of a particular notice . One of these was Alexander Hamilton . Among all the remarkable men of the Revolution , we know of no one , who , for the attributes which usually mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a singularly comprehensive mind , which enabled him to originate forms of government and systems of administration , whilst he united with it an intrepidity and an energy equal to the task of putting them in execution . He was a politician and a statesman , // without possessing those finer and more delicate feelings of lofty morality , which , while they do honor to a public man , sometimes go far to impair his means of usefulness . To Hamilton , men appeared always as instruments to be moved , and not as accountable beings , and theories of government or modes of policy were regarded simply with reference to the ends which might be attained by applying them . The consequence was , that however bold the features of his system were , and however decidedly beneficial in its application to the interests of the country , there was always a slight taint of earthly morality about it , which deprived him of the share in the public confidence , which he may now be regarded as having deserved . Peculiarly fitted for the difficult duty of calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , of understanding the bearings of the most comprehensive principles , and of entering into its minutest practical detail . Yet there is this remarkable peculiarity about the history of Mr. Hamilton , that , whilst he acted a most important and honorable part in a critical period of our national affairs , there was not , probably , an instant of his life in which he enjoyed the perfect sympathy of the mass of the people of the United States . A native of a different soil , he appears to have come to America to serve an important end in engrafting upon our institutions certain features of energy and stability , which they did not naturally possess , and then to vanish from the scene , leaving no popular regrets behind . He was never a man of concealments , nor , possessing as he did , that consciousness of superiority , the inevitable attendant of genius , did he always take enough pains to disguise his modes of exerting it over others . He was no demagogue , and entertained , perhaps , a too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , that the people would never kindle at his name , and that his most masterly movements always experienced a vehemence of resistance , which might have been softened , if not turned aside , by a more conciliatory deportment . This compelled him to rely , for the execution of his projects , upon the authority of great popular reputations , or assemblies . The countenance of Washington was indispensable to him before the people . The moment that he lost it , his position ceased to be commanding . In his opinions upon government , it should never be denied , that he leaned strongly towards the monarchical system , as it is seen to // exist in England ; but he was a man of too good sense not to understand , that the spirit of America could not be reconciled to adopt it . However decided his own convictions might have been , he never sought to press them further than to incorporate , in the American project , some portions of its vigor . Yet , even for doing this , he has been subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his customary asperity against political opponents , and Mr. Madison , with his more guarded but equally decided hostility , have not spared efforts to throw , because of it , much public odium upon his character . We think this course as ungenerous as it is undeserved . Surely , if our country deserves the title it boasts of , that of being the freest on earth , abstract opinions should always be allowed full latitude in the utterance . And no doctrine concerning government , that proceeds from honest convictions , should be made a subject of reproach to any one , so long as no action is meditated to be based upon it . IMr . Hamilton doubted the efficacy of a purely republican form , to secure the permanent happiness of a people . Very well . So did General Washington . So did John Marshall . So have many of the best statesmen and patriots that have lived among us . The same doubts have , at all times , existed , arid still do exist , in the bosom of American society . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are mere opinions . And not a man can be found , who is not ready to stand by that system as long as it will work , let his apprehensions be what they may . We , therefore , see no more justice in attacking Mr. Hamilton , or anybody else , for entertaining them , than in attackino* a Mr. Jefferson , as he also has been attacked , for his partiality to an opposite extreme . There is one feature of Mr. Hamilton 's character which , perhaps , deserves to be one moment longer dwelt upon , because it was in him , as it is in most persons who possess it , the parent of much questionable political morality . We fear it is , at this time , as common here as in any part of the world , and that it is rather spreading among us instead of diminishing . Let us illustrate what we mean , by quoting&gt;a sentence from the present volume . Mr. Hamilton upon one occasion said ; We must take man as we find him ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest his passions in doing so . A reliance on pure patriotism had been the source of many of our // errors . He thought the remark of ' Mr. Gorham a just one . It was impossible to say what would be the effect in Great Britain of such a reform as had been urged . It was known that one of ' the ablest politicians ( Mr. Hume ) had pronounced all that influence on the side of the crown , which went under the name of corruption , an essential part of the weight which maintained the equilibrium of the Constitution . " - p. 938 . ChiefJustice Yates reports the same observations somewhat differently ; - In all general questions which become the subjects of discussion , there are always some truths mixed with falsehoods . I confess there is danger where men are capable of holding two offices . Take mankind in general , they are vicious ; their passions may be operated upon . We have been taught to reprobate the danger of influence in the British government , without duly reflecting how far it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up many ideas upon trust , and , at last , pleased with our own opinions , establish them as undoubted truths . Hume 's opinion of the British constitution confirms the remark , that there is always a body of firm patriots who often shake a corrupt administration . Take mankind as they are , and what are they governed by ? Their passions . There may be in every government a few choice spirits , who may act from more worthy motives . One great error is , that we suppose mankind more honest than they are . Our prevailing passions are ambition and interest ; and it will ever be the duty of a wise government to avail itself of those passions in order to make them subservient to the public good , for these ever induce us to action . " The man who could give utterance to such a strain of remark may have been a great politician , but he was not a good moralist . To such a man Sir Robert Walpole might easily appear the paragon of statesmen ; Sir Robert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his price , and yet who used his ill-gotten influence for the best interests of the king and country he was serving . There may be , and doubtless is , great truth in every unfavorable estimate of human nature ; though it is equally likely that there will also he much of falsehood . But the good part of man 's nature is not likely to have a fair chance of developement , when the hypothesis is once assumed as true , that it does not exist , or that it must be made subordinate to the bad one . Political men are too apt in all countries to rest satisfied with the narrow view , and hence // their own minds very soon share something of the taint which they are always on the watch to perceive in those of other men . For our own part , we would rather that a higher standard of public virtue be professed , even where there is not always perfect success in attaining to it . We would rather that a statesman should not avail himself too much of the passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strive a little more to arouse their principles . We would rather that he should himself set the world an example of noble aspirings , that his fellows might respect and admire even when they felt unable to follow it . Such was , however , the texture of Mr. Hamilton 's mind as we see it in the extract already quoted ; and the consequence will be that for ever after posterity may adjudge him to stand in the very front rank as a practical politician , but they will refuse to put him on a level with the best of our patriots . There was in him a mixture of correct moral conception and laxity of practical application , which must qualify our respect for his memory . Although a great man , he has gained no solid hold upon the American heart , and his lamentable end only serves to confirm the conviction which grows out of the observation of his life , that he knew too distinctly what was positively right , to admit of our palliating or excusing his fault in conduct absolutely wrong . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He belonged to a different order of human beings . Possessing a mind far more of a meditative cast than that of Hamilton , he inclined to study measures in their abstract principles , and the movement of life through the primal impulses which occasion it . He was a student of facts rather than of men , therefore much better calculated for the exposition of a rule of action than for the direction of it when it was to be executed . His temperament was calm , deliberative , perhaps slightly deficient in energy . He possessed a good judgment , with enough of expediency to suffer it to be biased by the impetuous force of such a bold speculator as Mr. Jefferson , whilst it exerted a more than compensating influence in restraining that boldness from making itself felt in unfortunate action . Better calculated for counsel than for the direction of events , he will appear to posterity a greater man as a framer of the Constitution in the Federal Convention , and as a legislator in the first Congress convened after it was adopted , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as President of the United States . When called upon to act a part in a great system of political measures devised for the purpose of securing the ascendency of his party , he approved himself a faithful lieutenant to a hold captain ; hut when himself afterwards promoted to the chief station , he was destined to prove , in the course of the trial to which he was put , the truth , that it is far easier to counsel than to perform . The most marked defect which he exhibited as President was in the knowledge of men . His most characteristic merit was his sound sense . He was fated to ascertain hy his experience in the executive station , that doctrines which sometimes best aid a party to mount to power , are not the most serviceable in the use of it . He had none of the false pride which put him above profiting by his lesson . The consequence was , the surrender of the system of national policy introduced by Mr. Jefferson , and the decided , though tacit , return in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Washington school . On the whole , there are few men who deserve to he regarded as more fortunate in their lives than was Mr. Madison , if indeed that may he called good fortune which was rather the result of capacity and prudence acting upon favorable circumstances . Many persons have had more than he without succeeding in using it as well . He fell into the exact position best calculated for the developement of his powers , and he filled it skilfully . The task of assisting to found a system of government for a people , in itself one of the most exalted that the world can afford , was one which all the habits of his previous life , as well as the natural turn of his mind , fitted him to perform . Without having the vigor or originality of Hamilton , he possessed other qualities which in his situation were quite as valuable . He could by his moderation act as a mediator of differences , a softener of extremes in opinion , through which virtue he not only gained a useful power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired the respect and esteem , if he did not always soothe the violence , of those who were opposed to him . He was called to administer the government he had taken so large a part in establishing , at a moment when its strength was more severely tested than it has been at any other time before or since . Foreign war and domestic discord came together upon him in a manner that would have tried the nerves of the strongest man . And although , upon // looking back , we find it impossible not to censure him as wanting in the vigorous preparation which we should expect in such an exigency ; yet the fact that all difficulties were ultimately overcome , that the internal disaffection accomplished no harm , that his hold upon the people carried us through the danger , and , lastly , that an honorable peace and great prosperity subsequent to it crowned his labors , will go very far to place his name high in our annals upon the list of our capable , honest , and successful statesmen . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , that these volumes present two distinct matters of historical interest , the one subsidiary perhaps , but scarcely inferior in interest , to the other . We very much fear that the period of the confederation will never receive from the young students of this country the share of attention which its importance would seem to require . We have already so far transgressed the usual limits of an article , that it is impossible for us at present to go into any explanation of our views . But one remark we must be allowed to make ; - Jf there are any persons who desire to understand the origin , and trace the movement , of the parties that have agitated this Union during the past half century , they must begin here . The first part of the Madison papers will furnish a partial insight into the system of policy which has always marked the southern section of the country ; a system which has , for a considerable portion of the period mentioned , preponderated in the national government . Although not in itself to be relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so rich in materials of comparison with documents from other quarters , that it is to be hoped , when placed in the hands of some future philosophical historian , our posterity may obtain the means of understanding the truth . The Constitution of the United States has , thus far , by the admission of all parties , established a far better practical form of government than was anticipated by any one when it was made . But it would be a curious and not unprofitable task to compare the operation of the system , as it is now understood and practised upon , with what it was during the early administration of it , and with the declared intentions of its framers . We think that some deviation could be shown , that does not promise well for the future . But in this opinion we would not venture to be positive . For , after all , there are great obstacles in the way of correct judgment by persons who witness and // take interest in a train of present events . The tendency always is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a durable effect to what may only prove a temporary disturbing cause . An energetic and highly popular chief magistrate can give to his station a moment 's preponderance in the government , which will vanish with the accession of a person of different character . The blustering of a fe*v state politicians may sometimes create uneasiness respecting the strength of the general government , which the course of events in a short time will prove wholly superfluous . Events like these only go to show how very nicely the balances of the system were adjusted , and what a self-correcting vitality actually resides in it , which proves the wisdom of its framers . But there are other indications which are not quite so promising . Across the disputed land of strict construction and consolidation , of state rights and centralism , of slavery and of free labor , we think we perceive the elements of a storm which will shake to its centre , if it make not a wreck of the fair fabric of our present institutions . The single element which has steadily gained ground of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of almost every balance in the Constitution , is the democratic element , the very one which , as we have seen , it was the great object of its founders to put in check . And , strange as it may seem , the path which it has chosen for itself is the one which appears to have been the least anticipated ; - we mean that through the election to the Presidency . To that every other part of the system is now made in a great measure subordinate . And , instead of being regarded as the mere Executive head , charged with the duty of carrying into effect the laws , the President is looked to , by the great body of the people , as a person whose abstract sentiments upon every subject of public interest ought to be declared and made the subject of rigid examination . Should the practice of cross-questioning every candidate for the office become settled , the time will not be far distant when they will take the field in person , and solicit the people 's votes . This can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , for it will have the effect of drawing the Executive and the people into a close union at the expense of the other departments of the government , as well as of consolidating the power of the national chief magistrate at the expense of that of the States . And the end may very naturally be a pure democracy , in which the // President represents the people , and becomes solely accountable to them for his conduct , and the legislature and the judiciary play very secondary and insignificant parts . It can not be denied that Congress has been of late years doing something to hasten this state of things , by the turbulence , disorder , and uselessness of its proceedings . The Senate has more than once become a nursery of faction , and the House of Representatives a scene for the lowest and most disgraceful brawling . Such things can not long happen in any country with impunity , much less in ours , where the cui bono is constantly upon every tongue . Already has the constitution of the Senate been well nigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And nothing further remains but to settle the practice of universal resigning whenever public servants follow the dictates of their own judgment in opposition to the popular voice , and the Constitution , from being the complicated republican form which its framers designed to make it , will be a simple machine of more unmixed democracy than was even the government of Athens . There is , however , a recuperative energy in the breasts of the American people , which may save them from long suffering under any evil which they themselves create . However gloomy the prospect may sometimes be to the true patriots of the land , they should never lose sight of the fact that there was one moment in our history , when it looked a great deal worse than we now see it , and yet all was not lost . The hour of ( larkness was but the foreshadowing of a bright and glorious dawn , when , under the superintending guidance of wisdom and integrity , the people enjoyed the full harvest of their industry , and the banner of the Union became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet quite parted from those brilliant days ; but it can not and ought not to be concealed that our progress of late years has been somewhat downward , and that a new system of political morals is in the course of adoption throughout the extent of the United States , which threatens to drown all the landmarks of our ancient faith in the one great ocean of expediency . We trust there are young minds which are in secret working themselves free from the dross of this corruption , arid young hearts practised to beat not merely with the casual impulse of an honest patriotism , but also with the regular vibrations of an unconquerable principle ; a principle not more to be shaken by the " civium ardor prava jubenti urn , " than if it // was called to resist the " vultus instantis tyranni . " To such , if such there are , we bid God speed , for we fear that it is no ordinary trial which awaits them.                @ @ @ @ @
