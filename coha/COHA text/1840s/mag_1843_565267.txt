txt Two opinions are prevalent with respect to the duties of representatives in legislative assemblies . One is , that they are bound to carry out the will of their constituents , so far at least as not to break any oath which they may take on entering upon office . The other is , that they are bound to do that , which after due deliberation seems to them likely to promote the general welfare , whether they follow the will of their constituents in so doing or not . These opinions , it is plain , relate to something which is to bind the conscience of the representative , and to be the law of his conduct while acting for those in whose place he stands . As laws of action , then , the two opinions are opposite , and must drive one another from the throne of the soul . If the representative is bound to do the will of his constituents , and if this obligation must guide his vote ; he ought not to ask himself when he gives his vote whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in this way he brings up before his mind foreign considerations , which may tempt him aside from the path of duty . Nay , in his deliberations before voting , he has nothing to do with the question of the general welfare ; unless we suppose that he deliberates to move the will of his constituents , and through them to move himself . And on the other hand , if his aim in discussing and voting be to promote the common good ; h eought not to heed the wishes of his constituents except so far as they are conformed to right reason . Or at least , if it be morally certain that what he regards as the best measure will not be carried or will soon be given up ; his part is to gain all that for the public good , which can be gained from men 's obstinacy or ignorance . Again , as in all other cases we are bound to decide questions of duty according to the best evidence within our reach , and though that evidence may be slight , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; so the representative must be guided by the light before him , though that light be feeble . It is of no use to say that he is instructed in one case and not in another . The only effect of instructions is to make it plainer to him how his constituents wish him to act . If these wishes should be the rule of his conduct as a representative , he has in such cases no doubt what he must do , and is relieved from every uncomfortable apprehension that he is going wrong . But is he allowed , because no express orders have been sent him , to follow his own judgment , or to make the public good the rule of his vote ? No , certainly , if his supreme law must be his constituents ' good pleasure . The only difference between one case and another lies in the degree of assurance which he possesses , that he has found what that good pleasure is . When , indeed , after due inquiries , he is in a state of suspense concerning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best measures will be approved by his fellow citizens at home . But he ought , if this theory be true , to anticipate such cases , and sound their minds as far as possible . We have still further to observe , that these rules of duty must be applicable to all representatives employed in legislation who deliberate and vote ; whatever the body be which they represent . Men sometimes talk as if the United States Senate was peculiar in this respect . But no reason can be given why one legislative body should be bound to obey one of the rules of duty proposed // above , and another the other . Can such a reason he found in any peculiarity in the mode of election ? Suppose the choice is made by an intervening body , as for instance the state legislature . That surely does not destroy or even modify the relation between the senator and the state . He is still the representative of the state , employed to debate and decree in its stead ; and his relation to the state is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a governor 's when he happens to be elected by the legislative houses . Nor can the reason for a difference be found in the greater power and importance of one representative body than of another . If the will of the constituents must be the law , it is impossible to draw a line between different bodies or between measures of unlike importance brought before the same body . All cases must be subject to the same sweeping rule . The senator of New York , and the representative " of some town in the western climes , " only " to those who dwell therein well known "  --  the extremes in regard to legislative dignity and importance-are here on one level . Nor will the nature of the government change the duties of the representative . It is often asserted to be peculiarly a democratic thing that the representative should feel himself to be the servant of the people , and should execute their will in all respects . But there seems to be no reason why it should not be thought to be just as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a country where political power is confided to a small part of the people . In the one case , the will of the grown up males , say of from a quarter to a seventh of the community , is obeyed ; and in the other , the will of some smaller fraction . Nay , if this be the end of legislation , such obedience may be said to be more fitting in the aristocratic than in the democratic body . For in a government of the former kind , the present and the ultimate will of the constituents will more regularly coincide , and will better agree also with their interests-we do not say with the interests of the entire population , but with that of the aristocratic voters-than in a democracy , where the ignorant as well as the intelligent are called to cast their votes . it is therefore , to say the least , easier in the former case for the representative to ascertain the wishes of those whom he must on the supposition obey ; and he may be more sure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat of government those wishes continue steady in one direction . Nor is the question of duty affected by the degree of light and intelligence on the part of the constituents . If it is , it must be so because their greater insight into public affairs enables them to know better what will promote their true interests . All the light that they can ever obtain will not increase the certainty to themselves or to others of what their will is : a child may know and make known to others what it wants as well as a philosopher . If I am bound to obey the enlightened will of others and not the unenlightened , I am so bound , clearly , not because it is their will , but because their will decides in favor of that which is for the best . And if so , their will is of worth only so far as it is an index of the best course ; an evidence of the judgment of enlightened minds concerning what ought to be done : and accordingly it is to be placed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same question , being , as it may happen , the most important or the least important evidence within my reach . They , then , who would establish any such distinction between one sort of constituents and another , must abandon the doctrine of instruction . // Once more ; the question of duty is not affected by an express or tacit permission , given to the representative , to follow in certain cases or always his own independent convictions as to the utility of measures proposed in the legislature . For if he may do so because he has received such permission , the reason why he may , lies in the permission , that is , in the will of those who granted it ; so that the ground of duty remains the same in every instance . Moreover , an intelligent man will be apt to suspect that the duty of the representative must be the result of his relations , which are invariable . If this be so , as we shall hereafter see that it is , the constituents can not alter his duties without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legislative representative , or one only in a new and qualified sense . What has been said thus far goes to show that the last and highest rule for the representative is in all cases the same ; unchanged byexpress instructions , by the importance of his office or of the measures before him ; unaffected by the form of government ; and not capable of being altered by his constituents . So long as his relations continue uniform , and he remains a representative in a legislative body , with power to deliberate and to establish something by his vote ; so long must he in all cases alike-where a constitutional oath at least is not in his way-either be guided solely in the last instance by the will of his electors , or solely by his own persuasions in regard to the public good . Which then of these unlike , and it may be divergent , paths must he take ? An answer to this question is often found in the mischiefs to which servile obedience on the part of the representative is thought to lead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep enough ; nor will it of itself , until after long experience , convince those , who have been led , by something which they call principle , to the other opinion . Another answer must be drawn from the invariable nature of legislative representation . And this will be best seen by determining what would be the duties of the constituents , if they could meet together for the purposes of legislation , and how far the representative steps into their place . With respect to the first of these points , there can be but little difference of opinion . If the citizens of any state or country were assembled together for public purposes , as in ancient Athens , the aim of each ought to be , not to secure his own private good simply , but the good of the whole body . The means employed would be deliberation , by which the best course is found out ; and voting , by which a choice between measures is expressed . In each mind judgment , conscience , and the power of choice , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed ; conscience in keeping unworthy considerations from affecting its decisions ; and the power of choice in giving the vote as judgment and conscience had decided . And in thus exhibiting the offices of the citizen , we are far from intending to exhaust the subject of his duties as a legislator , or to make precise divisions of the faculties of the mind . All we seek is to furnish a statement , at once so true and simple , as to meet with general acceptance . Now , then , does the representative take the place of his fellow citizens in such a sense , that his judgment , conscience , and power of choice , take the place of theirs ; or is he merely their creature to carry out their will ? The answer must be gathered from his functions and his powers . If , on the one hand , they are such that he can not exercise his judgment , then it is certain that he is not entirely in the place of his constituents . And the // same thing is equally certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best measures , but had no power to give them a legal form . If for instance men were sent to the legislature to talk merely ; no one would suppose that they took the place in legislation which the citizens might have occupied before , or would now occupy , but for this expedient to save them the trouble . Or if men were sent to vote merely without deliberation ; it would be evident that they were delegated to give the finishing stroke to measures already settled , without having any voice or will of their own . And if we may so argue from the absence of these functions , we may with equal certainty from their presence . If a man is a member of an assembly where discussion of public matters goes on from day to day , and where at the end of the discussion a vote is cast ; it needs no arguing to show , that by the very nature of the body , the discussion is intended to affect the vote ; or , in other words , the vote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members . So far then as his functions are concerned , he is precisely in the place which his constituents would take if they met together . If they would be members of a deliberative body , so is he ; if they would discuss public measures or hear them discussed , he does the same ; if they would vote , so can he with the same unrestricted power . Hence , then , it seems to be certain , that if they would be bound in conscience to prefer those propositions which should seem to them most conducive to the public good , he also must choose those which seem so to him . In other words , he is not sent-we argue it from the essential nature of legislative bodies , as they have hitherto existed  --  to execute the will of the community , but to perform those duties which they can not perform , by reason of their inability to assemble for deliberation in one place . Let it be remembered also , that the representative system is not a new wheel added to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , under their ground-law or constitution , have withdrawn from the habit of deliberation in common , if they ever had it , and from the right to pass laws in any other way than through their representatives ; reserving , it may be , to themselves , or to part of themselves only , the right to give advice or to petition for redress of grievances . If any number of citizens , even reaching to the whole body , should meet and ordain something ; this would be mere advice , unless a change of constitution had preceded ; and could not have the force of law upon the conscience of a judge , a magistrate , or any private man . The people have then restricted themselves in the discharge of a duty which they or others must perform-law making ; and they leave these others to do that which is necessary to the performance of this duty  --  to deliberate and decide upon the usefulness of measures . The conclusion then is certain , that this duty , which by its nature is one demanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others or not done at all . It would be difficult for those who take the opposite view , to find a subject of discussion , or a reason for it , in a house of representatives . If the last duty of such a body is to obey the will of their constituents , and if , as we have seen , this is alike a duty when certainly known through instructions , and when less surely inferred from some other source ; then , with the exception of constitutional questions , the matter properly in debate for the purpose of moving the minds of fellow members , is simply whether this or that measure is approved by those whose creatures they are . This is the only consideration which ought to affect their // judgment and their vote . A very singular spectacle in truth , such a legislature would present . The only point at issue , between a member from Connecticut and one from Tennessee , is regarding the wishes of each other 's constituents . Each knows the views and desires of his own state or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must stoutly contend that on this point , where politicians have almost an unerring instinct , the other is under a mistake ; and that he himself , though living a thousand miles off , is better informed with regard to the wishes of a community , than the other , who by the supposition has his office only that he may convey those wishes to Congress . Truly a silent vote is the only fit one for a body such as this . A " gag law " ought to be carried out physically upon their persons ; and the " one hour " of speaking by rule should be shortened sixty minutes . And it may be fairly doubted , whether even on constitutional questions , there can be an opening for debate in such an assembly . For although its members may be bound by oath " to support the constitution , " still they may reasonably ask themselves whether these words intend the constitution as they , or as their constituents understand it . If their main duty is the one supposed , and if the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presumed that the private judgment of the representatives was not thought of , and that they were considered as mere instruments , like ministers of a sovereign , appointed to express the constitutional interpretations , as well as to carry out the measures of their masters . The oath can have two meanings , and that meaning is to be preferred which takes away the burden of deciding constitutional points from the representative , because on the supposition , he is freed under the constitution from fc*llowing his own judgment in all other cases where he acts officially . Our course of argument , if true , overthrows the doctrine of instruction in all its forms . The extreme of this doctrine alone wears the look of principle , and will be adopted by right-minded men who are led astray by wrong theories . Its more common shape is that of a mongrel between the two theories which we have been considering . A man must obey explicit instructions , it is said ; but when they are not given , may presume that he is allowed to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this view that we observed , that the mode by which the popular will is discovered makes no difference , provided it is the ground of duty . We now add the more general and fundamental remark , that if a man takes the place of his constituents , he is bound in all cases to do what they would be bound to do ,  --  to act according to his best judgment as to the public good *A1nd that thus the doctrine of instruction in all its aspects must be thrown to the winds . In this way we can hope to have good legislators , men who will see the right and pursue it ; but the oth ' er theory looks like a device to throw conscience overboard , and to free bad lawgivers and corrupt constituencies from all sense ' of guilt . It is a scheme to transfer responsibility from those who are qualified to feel it , who have had all sides of a measure held up before them during a debate , to those who can not and should not feel responsible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the two thieves in the fable . The representative knows what is for the best , but is not bound to vote for it ; the constituents have not the same means of judging , and yet bear all the weight of obligation . A great deal of human guilt would be prevented by a like ingeniousprocess applied in other cases .. // If our principles are sound , a representative may not pledge himself ' beforehand to a particular course , nor promise to obey instructions , nor actually obey them when given , unless they are intrinsically right . We do not say ,  --  and we beg those who may read what we write-in a captious spirit to notice this ,  --  that instructions may not be given and ought not to be respected . If they are regarded only in the light of advice and of an expression of opinion , they may be useful . If they are looked on as mere wishes , they are not to be thrown away ; for it is one part of legislation , though a minor one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they interfere with no greater good . But assuredly an honest man ought never to promise to vote in one way , when the result of deliberation may be to convince him that the very opposite is the right one . Still less ought he to bind himself in a general way to obey his constituents , for he thus multiplies the probabilities that he will give a wrong vote , and admits a most hurtful principle . It becomes all good men to resist the spread of the doctrine of instruction , which was formerly confined to our southern states , but which has of late begun to travel northward during these times of shifting majorities and of party bitterness , owing to the facility with which it enables each newly victorious party to obliterate the traces of its fallen rival . We admired the course of a distinguished lawyer of New York , when held up for the state senate a year and a half ago . He was called upon to pledge himself to vote , if elected , in favor of the system pursued by the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He replied that his present opinion accorded with the proposed pledge , but that as he would be , if chosen , a member of a deliberative body , where he might hear reasons that would alter his persuasion , he could take no pledge whatever . He was we believe dropped for this answer ; being too good now to serve a party that heard him nominated with applause . Gentlemen who hold to the duty of obeying instructions , often resign rather than perform it . But upon their principles such conduct is very strange and inconsistent . Why should they resign ? Ought they to avoid doing what they own to be right , because it is unpleasant ? Can there be any thing dishonorable in doing one 's duty , in acting on principles which one has received long since , and perhaps used much to the annoyance of an antagonist ? Such a representative too , should bethink himself of the wide range of the services he may render to his constituents : he has a larger sphere to act in , than a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in his vote . He can represent all parties and all combinations of opinion as they happen to be uppermost . He can be the " jack on both sides , " and stay with the strongest until its game is out ; and all this in obedience to a principle that binds his conscience . Happy man , in whom the love of office and duty thus harmoniously unite , and permit him , in the course of " one revolving moon " perhaps , to say aye and no upon any proposition whatsoever . But we fear that those who resign rather than obey , have an obscure feeling that they thus avoid a degrading situation , or entertain a suspicion that they can not obey without losing the respect of upright men . They now begin to be sensible that a man of far-reaching views and long experience is not wanted where any one who can vote would do just as well ; and that a man of great talent is meanly employed in doing that to which a man of no talent is equal . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we receive with thankfulness the light their conduct throws on the subject before us ; but // we also maintain that they are most inconsistent and most unjustifiable in declining to do an admitted duty . The tendency of the doctrine of instruction must now appear to be , even in its most qualified forms , that of degrading a legislative assembly . It is not easy to see why men of ability should wish to sit in a body upon which eloquence and argument are wasted ; where they can not expect to persuade and ought not themselves to be persuaded . Upright men , again , will not be returned , if they hold the principle for which we have been contending . There remain then only the second rate politicians , with a part of the weaker sort of honest men , to compose a house , the proceedings of which may affect the civil interests of millions and the relations of a country to the world beside . And is this the place from which intelligence or uprightness ought to be driven ? Such a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good or evil . There is an inconsistency between its capacity and the constitutional powers left to it , which would make itself felt . Or penalties might reasonably come in to prevent disobedience to instructions ; for surely the judge is no more justly impeached and punished for a breach of his main duty , to decide according to law , than the representative would be for violating his chief obligation to express by his vote the popular will for the present time . And , with this , clear specific instructions must be written out to guide the whole course of the representative . He certainly would have a right to demand them , lest he might be punished for mistakes as if they were misdemeanors . Freighted with documents which revealed to him his duty , his great aim would be to make himself master of their contents and if doubts or new cases arose , the constituents must again be consulted and relieve him from his embarrassment . If he venture to sug gest views which they oppose , or argue with them in his communications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps remove him to put a more pliant man in his place . Thus the few honest men that might remain in such an assembly would leave it , and be succeeded by those who would not dare to rebuke or give advice , who would sit quiet spectators of the mistakes of their employers , anxious only to avoid their wrath . It would be idle to speculate upon the ultimate effect on political institutions , when this principle had had its perfect work : the probability is that a new wheel would be added to the machine , rendering it only more complex ; that a body constituting itself the people 's representatives , would meet in caucus to decide what measures the people should approve and what condemn ; and that thus , in the place of one body gathered in the center with the ability to compare and adjust the interests of the whole nation , would arise in every quarter knots of local politicians , who , if honest , could not have looked beyond the bounds of their own horizons . And how widely do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reference to a whole country . To the man who feels bound to pursue the public good , it is no matter who elects him ; he feels that his duties have a permanent form . It is the same to him , whether he is chosen by a district or by a general ticket , or whether the whole union should choose all its representatives in a body . In all cases , he regards himself as the representative of the whole nation ; appointed indeed to take care of the interests of a certain section , but still bound-as the section itself is bound  --  to make those interests yield to more important ones , when they are inconsistent . He perceives that in his person and that of his fellow representatives , the country virtually meets together ; // that there is no other place where the interests of all can be compared and adjusted ; and that to make so sacred a body , created to promote the common good , powerless it may be in that respect , and only powerful to carry out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation at its source . This being his temper , his ear is not closed to any suggestions that may come from any quarter , east , west , or south ; and as his pledge is not given to oppose the best measures , he can view every proposition with candor and accept of it freely . The people too , feeling that this is the aim of legislation , will select men who can best secure the public weal , men who have looked abroad over the whole of the country , who understand every interest , and most clearly those of their constituents . They will be confident that such men will not deceive them , nor basely sacrifice their substantial welfare . And they will soon find out that the good of all the parts is so linked together , that their representative , who seeks that good and secures it , will secure their own . But upon the other theory , unless the interests of all the districts shall be seen obviously to coincide , there can be no broad or generous legislation . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of balances , shall turn into the good of the whole ; until then will a country under such lawgivers , fail of prosperity and true progress . A kind of feudal principle will prevail over the principles of free republics , to keep the parts in a state of isolation , and split that into fragments whose excellence consists in being undivided . The nearest approach to an enlarged system possible under such a theory , is that of log-rolling , as it is significantly called ; which has tended to burden some of the United States with useless public works , ruinous expenses , and disgrace ; or the still worse system of parties as at present carried out in practice ; under which the majority who choose the representative , are his only constituents ; the party arrange the measures for the state or country ; the members of the party in the district are dragged into those measures by force ; and the representative himself is like the men in some armies , who are chained together to fight for their masters . Nor is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instruction you obtain representatives who will not be faithless to the interests of their constituents . For whether they are pledged or not , the fact still continues the same , that they can vote on which side they please , and under the influence of any kind of motives . The impulse to follow the wishes of one 's constituents , is surely stronger in ordinary cases than any other ; and many a man , who has discarded the doctrines of obedience to them , has obeyed them in practice even against the convictions of his own judgment . The possibility now remains on the one hand , that men professing to have the highest interests of the whole country in view , will act from base motives , when they disregard the interests of their constituents ; and on the other , that men who promise to mind their constituents in all things , will desert their cause for the sake of filthy lucre or of office . If what we have said above is true respecting the kind of representatives which the two theories in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much doubt on which side the greater evil would lie . The principle which we have been advocating , but not the opposite one , can be reconciled with the provisions of the Constitution . This instrument does not indeed , in express words , set forth the relation which it regards the representative as holding . Our argument from it can only // reach the point of showing , that the practice of obedience to constituents tends to results certainly not looked for by the constitution , and is opposed to its spirit , so far as can be argued from the analogies of other provisions . We will give the considerations which have occurred to us , without much regard to order . It is expressly provided , that the members of neither house shall be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate . ( Art . I , sect. 6 . ) But if so plain a thing as obedience to the express will of constituents is a duty , resulting from the only true theory of government , the opposite is a crime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , as now , simply by the loss of public favor . Such a course tends too , to change the term of office allowed under the constitution . And this it does the more effectually , because the same reason which requires obedience from the representative during his office , will more imperatively call on him to lay down his office if the people of his district should so wish . And hence , every oscillation of the majority , every change of a few voices , which in these days , like the clouds , are banked up and scattered by alternate blasts of wind , must require a resignation and a new election . The constitution again allows the two houses to place themselves in a situation where they can neither consult or guess at the will of the people , by permitting secret sessions and the suppression of such parts of their journals , as in their judgments may require secrecy . ( Art . I , sect. 5 . ) Why should it increase or even make insurmountable , the difficulty of finding out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives Congress also the power to " provide for the general welfare of the United States , " ( Art . I , 8 , ) within certain limits , which it attempts distinctly to mark out . May it not be fairly argued , that they who receive such a power become obligated to use it ; that , as it requires the highest judgment and oftentimes a disregard of local interests , they are bound to act accordingly ? And which is most consistent with the spirit of an instrument which was framed for union and for the general welfare , to keep that welfare in view as the most important thing in every vote , or to keep it in view only when the selfish wishes of the parts do not oppose ? Our position again receives some support , from the discretionary and advisory power of the President . This officer being chosen by a majority of the people , is bound according to the principles of the doctrine of instruction , so far as his relations to legislation are concerned , * equally with the representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure . But when he is required " to recommend to the consideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient , " it is no doubt presumed , that he will afterwards also judge concerning the necessity and expediency of measures , when they are presented to him for his sanction ; that is , that he will accept or reject them , as he shall think the public good demands . ( Art . I , sect. 7 . ) And so much weight is given to his objections , that he has the questionable power of impeding legislation hy his veto ; nay , in most cases , of preventing it altogether . We believe that this principle is distinctly recognized in the constitutions of some of the states , but we have no leisure to enquire whether this is really the case . It is rather amusing , that when one party in one of the houses of the legislature * Though the President has no legislative power according to the constitution , ( Art . I , sect. 1 , ) there can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judging , reflecting person , ( Art . 1 , sect. 7 , ) not as a formality . // of Georgia was lately endeavoring to instruct one of the state senators in Congress out of his seat , and the minority seceded so as to prevent a quorum , the seceding members were charged with a breach of their oath , which required them on all questions and measures , so to give their vote and conduct themselves , as should in their judgment appear most conducive to the interest and prosperity of the state . A very proper oath , and one which originated in a clear perception of the principles which ought to govern the representative . But if the oath was founded in reason and was taken merely to confirm a previous duty , was not their senator also in a very similar relation , and had he not like duties ? Nay , does not every consideration subordinate to the main one of the principle , which is the same in both cases , press with far greater weight on the senator in Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet-such is the effect of politicians giving in to false principles-these very men , who call a representative at home perjured for not voting as his judgment dictates , call the representative in the senate of the United States all but a knave , for doing just the contrary . We will add but one thought more , and that is , that the doctrine of instruction tends to prevent one of the chief good results of the representative system . The main uses of this system which now occur to us , are the following : 1 . It tends to equalize the parts of a country , and to enlarge the borders of freedom . When the assembly was composed of all the citizens , those on the outskirts could not attend to their civil duties with the same regularity as the inhabitants of the center . Hence , a central power would arise , into whose hands the management of the state would fall , while the borderers would suffer a loss of their civil rights . But the system of representation renders perfect equality possible , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost essential to free institutions , when they are brought into contact with despotism . For as long as free states could not grow beyond the limits of vicinity to some capital , while despotism could enclose any bounds whatsoever , the contest between the two principles was unequal . 2 . It tends to check the occasional excesses of freedom , and to promote that control of reason in government , without which government becomes an evil . A volume of illustrations of this remark , might be drawn from the history of unrepresented democracies . But it is presumed that they will not be needed by those who know by what means great crowds are often swayed , and with what speed feeling passes from man to man , increasing as it goes , until it may rise to phrenzy . Of this , Athens , the freest among the ancient states , was well aware ; the citizens of that fierce democratie , ' in order to check themselves , prevented the passage of laws , properly so called , in the ordinary assemblies of the people ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the debates of the senate . Now it is this last object of a representative government , which the doctrine of instruction defeats . It creeps into the legislature , carrying there every prejudice which should have died in its native soil , every partial view which the reason of the whole community , if it could have been collected together , would have discarded . The fortress which reason  --  the reason of a peoplebuilt for itself , is seized upon by discordant passions . Every agitation of the mass is perpetuated , and they who were withdrawn from home that they might deliberate in quiet , are put into a great whispering gallery , where the multitude of // noises deafen the ear and drive reason from its seat . And as if this were not enough , this doctrine gives birth to a class of politicians , who , incompetent to represent the reason of a country , strive to gain favor by feeding every wish of a people or a party , without regard to the highest good . This , if the scene were transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the gratification of desire unregulated by reason carried the day , we should call criminal and ruinous . What is there to alter its character , when it takes place throughout a country . The habit once begun , grows fast , and is not soon laid aside . Arbitrary will becomes every thing ; it absorbs all the juices , so to speak , of the political body , until reason and conscience are obliterated and disappear . A nation under such politicians resembles the geese of Strasburg , which are kept before a fire until their livers acquire an enormous size for the sake of the epicures of Paris . And to whose benefit does this turn ? To that of the politicians . For , as they are well aware , a master-calling himself a servant , perhaps-will become necessary to men who are guided by passion and ignorance , to men who think that the rule and end of government should he to have their wishes fulfilled , and not the true interests of the whole body promoted.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
