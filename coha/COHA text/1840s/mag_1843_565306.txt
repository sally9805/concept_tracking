txt DR . FRANKLIN once expressed the wish , that his earthly life might be divided into two periods , one of which should occur something like two hundred years after the other . This singular wish was prompted , if we remember right , by his strong desire to witness the future condition of his country . lie , in common with those great men who , with him , established , first its independence , and then its form of government , had his fears as well as his hopes touching the issue of their doings . In order to rouse their countrymen to resist the tyranny of England , they had excited feelings and appealed to principles which in some minds produced hostility to all government . In fostering a hatred in the nation against foreign rulers , they had unintentionally created to some extent a jealousy amounting to dislike of all rulers . They had raised a spirit which they could not lay  --  a demon which they could not exorcise , as they found to their sorrow , when they came to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said he , in 1778 , when the present constitution was before the people for adoption , " a nation of politicians .

He was not only a dili5 , ent student of history , but a close observer of persons and events in his own times .

And now , though he sleeps in his grave with the blessings of his countrymen resting upon him , he still , being dead , yet speaketh , to instruct us in the lessons of wisdom hallowed by the sepulcher . The letter above mentioned , published first in 1837 , and recently in his COLLECTION or PAPERS , is an analytical examination of certain political principles , avowed by many of our countrymen in their writings , their speeches , or their conduct , as a sound basis of theory or of action . Though in their opinion these principles may be as evident as the mathematical axiom , the whole is greater than a part ; or as profitable as the " scoundrel maxim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author , with philological accuracy , either proves them to be false , or shows in what sense only they can be true . Having lived through more than one quarter of the period mentioned above , during which his friend Dr. Franklin was willing to slumber in unconsciousness , waiting the developments of time , he was able , from seeing the practical operation of these principles , as well as their elementary relations , to judge of their correctness . " To the Honorable Daniel Webster : Sin-In your public addresses or speeches , and in those of other gentlemen of high political distinction , I have often seen an opinion expressed like this-That intelligence and virtue are the basis of a republican government , or that intelligence and virtue in the people are necessary to the preservation and support of a republican government . These words , intelligence a ndvirtue , are very comprehensive in their uses or application , and perhaps too indefinite to furnish the premises for the inference deduced from them . Men may be very intelligent in some departments of literature , arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other departments . By intelligence , as applicable to political affairs , it may be presumed that those who use the term , intend it to imply a correct knowledge of the constitution and laws of the country , and of the several rights and duties of the citizens . " But , sir , the opinion that intelligence in the people of a country will preserve a republican government , must depend , for its accuracy , on the fact of an intimate or necessary connection between knowledge and principle . It must suppose that men who know what is right , will do what is right : for if this is not the general fact , then intelligence will not preserve a just administration , nor maintain the constitution and laws . But from what evidence can we infer that men who know what is right will do what is right ? In what history of mankind , political or ecclesiastical , are the facts recorded , which authorize the presumption , much less the belief , that correct action will proceed from correct knowledge ? Such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts of men ; a supposition which not only revelation , but all history forbids us to admit . " Let me ask , sir , whether the Greeks , and particularly the Athe // mans , were not an intelligent peo. pie ? Were they not intelligent when they banished the ablest statesmen an generals , and the purest patriots of their state ? Was their intelligence sufficient to insure , at all times , a just administration of the laws ? In short , if intelli*ence could preserve a republic , why were not the Grecian republics preserved ? " Then let us turn our attention to the Roman state . Were not Sylla and Marius intelligent men , when they rent the commonwealth with faction , and deluged Rome with blood ? Were not Ccsar and Anthony and Lepidus , and Crassus and Brutus and Octavianus , intelligent men ? Did not the Roman commonwealth fall into ruins in the most enlightened period of its existence ? And were not the immediate instruments of its overthrow some of the most intelligent men that the pagan world has produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there was no settled government to control reason . Were not the leading men of the parties intelligent men ? - men who cut off the heads of their opponents , with as little ceremony as they would tread a worm under their feet , and for the sake of liberty . When one party was crushed , the others cried out , the republic or liberty is safe . When another party fell under the guillotin , then the triumphant party shouted , liberty is safe . But after all , the republic was not saved ; and all parties at last were glad to find peace and security under a throne . " Intelligence alone then has not yet saved any republic . But intelligence , it is said , must be accompanied with virtue , and these united are to give duration to a republic . " Now , sir , what is this virtue ? what does it mean in the sentiment or opinion above cited ? What did Montesquieu intend by virtue , when he wro* about its influence in preserving a republic ? - ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Roman citizen consisted in personal bravery , and in devotion to the defense and extent of the commonwealth . In particular men there existed a strong sense of right or political duty , which may take rank as a moral virtue . But such instances were rare , and most rare in the decline of the commonwealth , when the citizens were most intelligent . But in general , the virtue of the Romans was a passionate attachment to the commonwealth , for the grandeur of which they fought and conquered , till they had brought the civilized world to the feet of the republic . This virtue extended the dominion , but did not secure the existence of the republic . " If by virtue is intended the observance of the common social duties , this may proceed from a respect for custom , and a regard to reputation ; and either , with or without better principles , is a useful practice . " But such virtue as this will not save a republic , unless based on better principles than a regard to custom or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , not to say generally , yield to selfishness ; that is , to the ambition of obtaining power and wealth . When strongly tempted by private interest , men often find the means of enlisting reason in its service ; and invent excuses for disregarding the public good , which ought to be , and for the preservation of republican government must be , the ruling motive of citizens . " The virtue which is necessary to preserve a just administration and render a government stable , is Christian virtue , which consists in the uniform practice of moral and religious duties , in conformity with the laws both of God and man . This virtue must be based on a reverence for the authority of God , which shall counteract and control ambition and selfish views , and subject them to the precepts of divine authority . The effect of such a virtue would be , to // bring the citizens of a state to vote and act for the good of the state , whether that should coincide with their private interest or not . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens , or even by a majority of the citizens of a state ? History does not authorize us to believe that such virtue has ever existed in the body of citizens in any community ; or to presume that such a community will ever cxist. " - pp. 269 , 270 . In the course of this letter he analyzes the expression , " all men are born free and equal , " compares the tyranny of kings and nobles , against which our fathers took care to guard themselves and their posterity , with the tyranny of the people acting by a majority , against which it is not so easy to guard . He speaks of the operation of universal suffrage ; of the rights of person and of property ; of the difficulty there is , from the extent of our territory , of the great body of the electors becoming acquainted with the comparative merits of the different candidates for office . He adverts to the extensive patronage of the President , which enables him , if disposed , to bribe his supporters ; of the jealousies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to excite prejudices against learning and literary institutions ; of the opinion , that the legislator is bound to follow the wishes of his particular constituents ; of removals from office ; of the doctrine , that there are no vested rights ; of the opinion , that a state may at the end of nineteen years from the date of the contract , repudiate its debts ; of the doctrine , that if a small number of persons are guilty of violating law , they may be indicted , but if a great number outrage law and rights , they are not to be indicted or punished ; of the opinion , that offices are created for the benefit of individuals , rather than for the state . On these topics he presents his thoughts to us in his dwn excellent style of writing , perspicuous , terse , and vigorous , characterized , like his other productions , by his intimate acquaintance with our mother tongue ; reminding us of the best writings of Hamilton , Madison , and Jay ; breathing forth the same spirit of patriotism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit that per . vades this letter , we would say to every one who intends to perform the duties of an American citizen . it is not enough for you to become acquainted with the general features of American society , and of American institutions . What you want to know so far as you can , is the exact " form and pressure " of the present times . You want te know the very shapes of the circumstances in which you will be called personally to act . Our country , commencing its existence under the happiest auspices , is furnished with abundant materials of present good ; while the omens of future good lead us to expect a glorious destiny . There are sc many physical causes in climate , soil , water power , and facilities of intercourse ; so many political causes in the freedom of our institutions ; so many moral causes in education , religion , and the power of the press , that we very easily , in our self-admiration , adopt the opinion , that our country , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen of the world and the child of the skies , " will go on in improvement , from glory to glory , until she will become the joy of the whole earth . But while one prophet from his elevated position is thus ready to say , " How goodly are thy tents , 0 Jacob , and thy tabernacles , 0 Israel ! blessed is he that blesseth thee , and cursed is he that curseth thee ; " another prophet , gifted widi as clear a vision , is ready to say , " How is // the gold changed , and the fine gold become dim ! ah , sinful nation , a seed of evil-doers , how art thou become a hissing and a by-word among all nations ! " When some political seer , some foreigner , puts forth such a prediction , instead of giving him any credit for " mystical lore , " which may enable him to see " coming events in their shad we upbraid him with the insinuation , that his " wish is the father of his thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitate the prudent mariner , who , with a wary eye , looks out for storms even in fair weather ? Is there no evil at work in our system , which with * . terrible efficiency tends to this uredicted result , which we rejoice ; o believe it will never reach ? In the physical world there is what is called a principle of cornuensation . Where there is a peculiar advantage or convenience , ft is balanced by a corresponding deficiency or inconvenience . J'hus , under the sunny skies of beautiful Italy , the malaria reigns . The same principle appears in the moral world . In this mixed state of being , we find that when nations or individuals enjoy peculiar blessings , they are subject to corresponding evils . What then are some of the ad. vantages which we as a nation enjoy , on the one hand ; and what are some of the correspondent evils ? First , then , the age in which we live is characterized by great freedom of opinion , in opposition to mere authority . The ages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines in politics , education , and religion , merely upon the authority of great names . They ask for evidence ; and they feel competent of themselves and by themselves , to judge of the evidence . In the early periods of human society , the great mass of the people were willing to enroll among the gods , as worthy of divine honors , the man who made discoveries in science , or inventions in the arts . In later periods , if they did not deify such , they still were willing to honor them as princes in the empire of knowledge , to whom others should do homage . Thus was it when Aristotle reigned with imperial sway , over the minds of men , who were contented with this intellectual vassalage . Thus was it during the night of the dark ages , when he of the triple crown proclaimed his infallibility to believing millions . Thus was it during the dawn and after the risen day of the Reformation , when Luther and Calvin , even when in their graves , ruled as lords paramount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as Papal countries , had its lord spiritual and its lord temporal , who exacted the homage of the many as their right ; even though the one lord was a New England justice of the peace , and the other a parish minister . But we in this age , delivered from this intellectual vassalage , enjoy to the full the right of private judgment , and liberty both of speech and of the press . But while we rejoice in the good , let us look at the evils which in the way of compensation are put into the other scale . One evil growing out of this state of the public mind is , that in their opposition to authority , men will not believe even on the authority of God , any truth that is mysterious . There is danger that men in the pride of intellect , will reject some of the fundamental doctrines of the gospel . There is danger , that , while they avoid repairing to the great light of the world for illumination , they will in the pride of reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sparks which their own hands have kindled . Are there not even now those who lean away so far from the authority of God to their // own understanding , that they measure themselves by themselves rather than by the Bible , which they consider to a large extent as obsolete . Are there not those who reigning as kings , without their teaching , set themselves up to be teachers of ' what they do not understand , the originators of new and crude doctrines in politics , new and wonder . ful nostrums in medicine , and new revelations in religion ? But do you say , give truth an open field for encounter with error , and we need not fear for the issue ? Yes , but you should remember that error is multiform , while truth is but one . Error has a natural affinity for the universal depravity of man , while truth can not be omnipresent with appropriate evidence , to meet it . Another evil connected with the good mentioned above , is , that while men enjoy the advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the press , they are exposed to become the vassals of the many , in their subjection to what is called public sentiment . In our popular form of government , as the majority must rule , there is supposed to be a positive excellence in numbers , independent of the virtue and intelligence which they may include . As men are at liberty to form any opinion , they are under a constant temptation to adopt the opinion of the majority as the most profitable . Watch the workings of their minds . " That cause will prevail , therefore I go for that cause . Those opinions will generally be adopted , therefore I adopt them now . " If they are in doubt which side will prevail , they are , in the language of the day , unwilling to commit themselves , lest they should be found on the wrong , that is , on the unpopular side . Now to talk of such men being free , when they are the slaves of the many ! why , they will follow the multitude to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , es pecially if by so doing , there is a chance to lead the multitude . They can not bear the loss of popular favor . They cower and hang their heads beneath the frown of popular indignation . They tremble and quail beneath the tyranny of public opinion . The sense of their individual responsibility is lost in the mass of minds with which they are associated . Moreover , the age in which we live is characterized by the love of practical , to the comparative neglect of speculative truth . In former times , there were sages and philosophers who retired from the haunts of business , to seek for truth in the calm meditations of contemplative life . In their seclusion , they held communion with God , with nature , with the spirits of the migbty dead , with their own great minds , that they might become acquainted with the living form of truth , with the first good and the first fair . Admiring the forms of intellectual beauty , they sought for them in the fields of original investigation . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means . In thus extending the bounds of knowledge , they were the benefactors of our race ; but to a large extent they were so unintentionally . They did not apply their knowledge to any useful purpose . And besides , they not unfrequently employed their minds on subjects that lie beyond the scope of the human intellect , or that in their nature are frivolous and unprofitable . But in our times there is not this waste of intellect . The grand inquiry now is for useful truths , namely , for those that have a practical bearing in promoting the arts of life , the well being of society , and the salvation of the soul . Look for a moment at the application of physical truths to the construction of machinery , that can by one directing mind do the work of a thousand hands ; or at the application // of political truth to a system of internal improvement , which is diffusing through the land , wealth , convenience , and comfort ; or at the application of moral truth to the temperance reformation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you look carefully at things like these , you can hardly fail of being convinced , that there is scarcely an important truth known in physical science , in politics , in morals , in education , or in religion , which has not been applied to some purpose , if not to some useful purpose . One evil to which we are exposed in consequence of this attention to the application of truth , is , that men will think lightly of those truths which they can not perceive to be immediately useful . They are so much accustomed to consider truth as valuable on account of its application , that they overlook its intrinsic excellence . Thus the noble science of astronomy may be valued only as it is applied to the art of navigation ; the wonderful science of chemistry , only because it can be applied to the prevention and cure of disease ; mechanical philosophy , because it can be applied to steam engines ; political truth , only as it will help to sustain a party ; and religious truth , only so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way it is , that Truth , who dwelt of old in the bosom of God , as his own daughter , comes down to man , not as the child of the skies , but as a mere menial , useful , but degraded . The tendency of this , is , to give a superficial character to all the important professions . If the farmer studies the art of agriculture only so far as is necessary in order to make money ; if the mechanic learns his trade in the shortest possible time , so far as it is necessary in order to undersell his competitors ; if the physician studies the science of healing only so far as is necessary to get a multitude of patients ; if the clergyman studies theology only so much as is necessary to draw after him a multitude of admirers ; can they he otherwise than superficial ? Said one of the most successful politicians of the present time , men do not love truth now-a-days . They want only so much truth in a given case , as will gild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret of success in politics is to employ a little truth , and a great deal of management . If political agitators find that they can arouse and sway large masses of men by party machinery , will they not be tempted to reject the doubtful aid of truth ? They want only thosn truths which are immediately available , and not the whole truth . They want a candidate that is available , and not the best man . What they want is loyalty to their party , just as in a roonarchy there is loyalty to the king . The party can do no wrong , just as the king can do no wrong . And is there not danger moreover , that religion will in this respect follow in the steps of J ) olitics ; that those who plead her cause will rely more upon machinery , than upon the great truths of the Bible . If the politician forsakes the grand principles of the constitution , in the use of truths that are available to the present success of his party , is there not reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , in the use of those fragments of truth that are found to be most available ? If the politician labors not so much to instruct , as to produce immediate results at an election , is there not reason to fear that leaders in religion will aim chiefly at immediate results , rather than at thorough instruction ? If the politician dares not trust the people to form their own views of public measures , but must make as many as they can , commit themselves at some public meeting , is // there not danger that leaders in religion , will in some way make as many as they can , commit themselves to certain movements , so that pride of character will do for them what conscience would not . If the politician is in the habit of showing forth his patriotism hy talking , rather than by doing the duties of a good citizen , is there not danger that the religionist will endeavor to show forth his piety by talking , rather than by doing the duties of a good Christian . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the religion of our country will assume the character , and the defects , of our political institutions ? Again , the present age is characterized by improvements in physical comforts and the arts of life . This is the natural consequence of the application of knowledge . A large amount of labor that used to be employed in making the necessaries of life , can new , by the use of machinery , be employed in improvements . Every man knows , that there is fair chance for bettering his condition . Reverses there have indeed been during the last six years . But compare the country now with what it was twenty five years since , and you will have no doubt that great progress has been made in these improvements . One evil growing out of this good , is that of discontent . The chance of bettering their condition , will not let men rest satisfied with their condition , though theirs is a good one . They can not let well alone , while they know there is a better . They must engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or they envy those who have been more successful than themselves . And then too , as money answereth all things in gaining these physical comforts , they have learned to sacrifice the virtues and charities of social and domestic life at the shrine of avarice . The cry is , with all thy getting , get money . Another evil kindred to this , is , that inasmuch as men have changed their condition in many respects for the better , they have come to feel that change is the same as improvement ; that what is old , is had ; that what is new , is good . On this ground , they are ready to exchange their old political opinions , their old modes of education , their old forms of worship , their old religion , for new political principles , new modes of education , new forms of worship , and a new religion ; just as they would exchange an old garment for a new one . They plume themselves upon being up with the times ; but they forget , perhaps they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbish of centuries , and embraced with rapture under new names . If you join a political party , they will change their principles and " shoot you as a deserter , " if you do not change with them , even though you joined them on account of the principles which they have deserted . Moreover , the age in which we live is characterized by a spirit of active benevolence . A vast number of Christians acting on the principle , that they are not their own , being bought with a price by Him who went about doing good , regard the spirit of benevolence as at once the test and the fruit of discipleship ; as at once the pledge and the earnest of heaven . While we rejoice over the good , let us as before , look at the corresponding evils . One evil is , that we are exposed to have a bustling and ostentatious religion . There is a certain kind of honor connected with patronizing the various objects of benevolence , whether by money or influence . For the sake of gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest and retired modes of duty , to a violation of the injunction : " Take heed that ye // do not your tdms before men to be seen of them . " This spirit of be . nevolence , so excellent in its nature , has created a vast number of offices to which ambition can aspire , by means of the various organizations which it has originated . These offices may not offer as large an ernolument , to tempt avarice ; but they confer as much respectability and influence , as some of the higher offices of prelacy , and they may be coveted as much . Another evil is , that by yielding the mind habitually to reasons addressed to benevolent feelings , the moral character of an action comes to be measured by the good which it produces . " Such an action produced a great amount of good ; it must therefore be right . " Just as if a man may perpetrate any enormities , and call them virtuous , provided they appear to produce good . Just as if the end being good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be violated , and promises broken , and justice outraged , if good appears to be produced by so do-ing ! Another evil to which we are exposed is , that in the subdivision of the objects of benevolence , certain associations , through the activity of their agents , will teach the community to attach a disproportionate importance to the objects which they were organized to promote . Some of these objects , more exciting in themselves than other objects equally important , when presented by some eloquent agent who has his speech perfectly committed , make a strong impression on the public mind while the other objects are overlooked . These men , in their zeal to form public sentiment , deal in high-wrought descriptions and startling statements in favor of their cause . They place in the foreground of the picture their own object , in bright colors and in strong relief ; while other objects , if noticed at all , are placed far in the background , in dim perspective , as of much less importance . But besides thus presenting a distorted view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the danger of losing the symmetry of a perfect man in Christ for a monstrous development , there is another evil . By the presentation of thrilling description , high-wrought statement , impassioned appeals to the public mind , it is taught to lose its relish for simple truth , just as the drunkard loses his relish ibr pure water . Something more exciting is needed . The simple truths of nature and revelation must be distilled in the alembic of a heated imagination , to furnish a moral alcohol for the public taste . Besides , by multiplying organizations of this kind , there is danger that large classes of the most active and efficient Christians , in their attachment to some particular associations , will decline from the higher and more spiritual doctrines and duties , into narrow viex* and intolerant feelings ; that , in this way , some of these associations will become arrayed against each other , like two hostile armies ; that there will be challenge and defiance , crimination and recrimination , bitter words and bitter feelings , until , in the rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel will be lost sight of on both sides . And what aggravates the evil of this war is , that it is carried into the very heart of the church . Formerly there were standing controversies between the religious denominations . These controversies appear in some degree to have subsided , so that now , in the opinion of some , there is more of a tendency than formerly to union . But , unfortunately , while there has been a gain , so far as the external relations of some of these denominations are concerned , there has been a loss , in some degree , of internal peace . As the last general topic , we shall // notice the great susceptibility of the public mind . The fact that such a susceptibility exists , is too well known to require any proof . The time has gone by , when subjects deemed important were treated with indifference . Hardly a subject connected with politics , morals , education , or religion , can now be presented , without its awakening emotions either of dislike or approbation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public mind , we will bestow a glance on the comparative evils . There is danger that the public generally will acquire an habitual love of excitement . This is perfectly evident from the nature of the human constitution . Excitement , through the passions of the mind , can become habitual , as well as through the appetites of the body ; the excitement of anger as well as the excitement of alcohol . There is an intoxication from the passions , as well as the intoxication from ardent spirits ; and what is remarkable , they agree in their immediate and their remote effects . The one is equalLy s*eductive as the other . Now it has been found that by using the appropriate means , it is perfectly easy , on any important subject , to get up an excitement in the community . By means of the press and the eloquent tongue , especially if there is a combination of effort , it has been found that public opinion can be manufactured in any quantity , and public feeling excited to any degree . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up an alarm in respect to some important interest . Then agitate the public mind with terror for a time . Next , prepare and recommend certain agencies and measures as certain remedies , for the treatment of the case . Then declare that we shall all be ruined if we reject these proposed agencies and measures . Lastly , denounce , as the enemies of God and man , those who refuse to employ these proposed agcncies and measures . This recipe never fails . Having been under this treatment , they will burn down a convent at one place , and a hall at another ; hang up men without judge or jury ; move in mobs , especially at elections ; assault private houses and the mansion of the president of the nation ; while in a thousand minor ways they will outrage the proprieties of life . They will violate the majesty of the law and the shrine of justice , and even the sacred rights of our common nature ; and all for what ? They have been told that some great interest is thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects , they are hurried on by their excited feelings , first to decide important questions without evidence , and then to act regardless of consequences . How their understanding is warped by their passions ! " Allis fair in politics , " is a practical rule with them . Why ? Because success in their eyes is more valuable than the truth and honor sacrificed for its sake . " Any measures that will accomplish the conversion of a sinner , " is a maxim sometimes adopted ; just as if his happiness is of more value than the rectitude of his spiritual guide . But such excitements in some cases embitter as well as corrupt the public mind . They injure the temper of the subject of them , as evidently as the excitement of alcohol . He shows it in his unsocial and morose conduct towards those who differ from him , in his censorious words , and even in the tones of voice and in the harsh expression of his countenance . Thus it is that they plant many a root of bitterness in the community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public mind has been in a chafed and excited state ; and just in proportion to the degree of excitement , whether on politics , morals or religion , has there been a repulsion between the // elementary parts that compose it , just as bodies charged with electricity repel each other . A fierce and fiery spirit has beea awakened in large masses of the people , which ever and anon blazes out with destructive energy , in different parts of the country , threatening to lay waste our fair heritage . In the above remarks it has not been our intention to sustain the positions we have taken by an induction of facts ; since the memory of the intelligent reader can furnish them . Nor was it our intention to illustrate them by moral painting , though this can so easily he done . Our aim has been simply to present a connected view of certain advantages which our country enjoys at the present time , with their attendant evils , in order that we may not only be grateful to the Giver of all good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these evils , we may successfully guard ourselves against the dangers to which they expose us.
