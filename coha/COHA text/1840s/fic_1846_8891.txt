EDITORIAL INTRODUCTION . This favorite comedy was first brought before the public the 11th of February , 1800 , at Covent Garden Theatre . It had a most successful run , being received for a number of nights by large audiences with roars of laughter . Munden , Lewis , Fawcett and Mrs. Mattocks are said to have been irresistible in their several characters ; and if we may credit Mrs. Inchbald , the humble but excellent part of Humphrey Dobbins , in the hands of Waddy , was made the most finished character in the piece . Corporal Foss is hardly equal to his prototype , Sterne 's Corporal Trim ; but he serves to fill up the picture agreeably . The presuming , self-complacent Ollapod , with his jumble of martial and medical allusions , and his propensity to seize upon expressions that may be twisted into a pun or some other sample of small wit , is an amusing fellow , although one can not help thinking all the while that he deserves a good kicking . This part was one of those in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unfrequently played by Mr. Burton , who gives to it a remarkable degree of finish , and never fails to make it one of the most laughter-provoking characters of the stage . Mr. H. Placide has also a well-merited reputation in the part . We learn from Peake 's " Memoirs of the Colman Family , " that the author received for the " Poor Gentleman " the sum of 550 , then the customary price for a five-act comedy ; that is to say , 300l. on the first nine nights ,  --  100l. on the twentieth night ,  --  and 150l. for the copyright  --  or , to come still farther down to details , 33l. 6s. 8d. per night for the first nine nights  --  100l. on the twentieth night  --  and 100l. on the fortieth night . This was the plan settled by Cumberland with Sheridan at Drury Lane , and Harris at Covent Garden , for remunerating authors , instead of their ( generally losing ) benefits . The copyright was usually understood to be a distinct bargain  --  the proprietor of the theatre was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered by a bookseller . Mr. Harris was accustomed to pay an author one or two hundred pounds above the 550l. when the drama was very successful , which was the case with most of Colman 's plays . The following remarks by Mr. Peake upon the subject of dramatic writing will not be inappropriate in this place ; " Alas ! times are sadly changed for authors ; but in those days there were no ruinous salaries , nor was the star system in vogue ( the stepping-stone to the downfall of the drama in England . ) Live and let live , was then the actor 's motto . At that period , an author could write for a company , but now it must be for an individual : and the individual is paid such a monstrous sum for his nightly performance that the manager is incapacitated from giving a proper remuneration to the author , whose brains have created that which the over-paid actor has to deliver . The evil does not rest here : to administer to these single enormous salaries , the humbler members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly possible to exist . No person of respectable education would now think of venturing on the stage for a livelihood , whatever might be his talents , for he would be certain to have to exert himself , merely to throw the proceeds of his labour into the already well-filled pockets of three or four actors . Under these circumstances is it astonishing that the drama has declined ? If the writers of the present day had Lewis , Johnstone , Quick , John Palmer , Fawcett , Munden , Bannister , Emery , Mrs. Jordan , Miss Farren , Mrs. Mattocks , Miss Pope , cum mullis aliis to ACT for them , there would be no outcry against authorship . Footnote : 1Kb We should again see comedy on the boards ; but the star system has driven away authors from the theatres , and extirpated the race of good second-rate actors , without whose assistance no play can be properly represented . There is no rule without an exception ; yet the truth of the foregoing remarks will be pretty generally acknowledged ; and when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recur to the invention of the authors ; but , alas ! it will be too late , for the profession of the actor is nearly extinct . The regiment is broken up , and there is no depot for recruits . " Nearly half a century has elapsed since the " Poor Gentleman " was produced : and it stills holds firm possession of the stage . With the exception of the " School for Scandal , " we know of no modern comedy , which seems to retain its place in the public favor more securely . This is true , we believe , as well in regard to England as to the United States ; but the play is so thoroughly English in all its characters and allusions , that it is not a little extraordinary its popularity should be such in a country where the local wit can not be so keenly relished and appreciated . It must have merits of a durable nature to stand the test of transplantation so well . CAST OF CHARACTERS . Table : 3Kb COSTUMES .

" was given , meaning to pull out my pistol , in a deuce of a hurry , I presented , neck foremost , the d  --  d diet-drink of Lady Kitty Carbuncle ; and the medicine being unfortunately fermented by the jolting of my horse , it forced out the cork , with a prodigious pop , full in the face of my gallant commander .

Sir Robert Bramble Why , no ; but when a man 's of the same opinion with me , he puts an end to the argument , and that puts an end to conversation ; so I hate him for that . But where 's my nephew , Frederick ? Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Been out these two hours . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble An undutiful cub ! only arrived from Russia last night ; and though I told him to stay at home till I rose , he 's scampering over the fields like a Calmuc Tartar . Dob . Humphrey Dobbins He 's a fine fellow . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Do n't you think he 's a little like me , Humphrey ? Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Bless you , not a bit : you are as ugly an old man as ever I clapped my eyes on . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Now , that 's d  --  d impudent ! But there 's no flattery in it , and it keeps up the independence of argument . His father , my brother Job , is of as tame a spirit  --  Humphrey , you remember my brother Job ? Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Yes ; you drove him to Russia , five and twenty years ago . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Angrily . I drove him ! Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Yes , you did : you would never let him be at peace in the way of argument . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble At peace !  --  Zounds ! he would never go to war . Dob . Humphrey Dobbins He had the merit to be calm . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble So has a duck-pond . He was a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tame rabbit , boiled to rags , without sauce or salt . He received men 's arguments with his mouth open , like a poor's-box gaping for half-pence ; and , good or bad , he swallowed them all , without any resistance . We could n't disagree , and so we parted . Dob . Humphrey Dobbins And the poor , meek gentleman went to Russia for a quiet life . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble A quiet life !  --  Why , he married the moment he got there ; tacked himself to the shrew relict of a Russian merchant ; and continued a speculation with her in furs , flax , pot-ashes , tallow , linen , and leather . And what 's the consequence ? Thirteen months ago , he broke . Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Poor soul ! his wife should have followed the business for him . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble I fancy she did follow it , for she died just as it went to the devil . And now this mad-cap , Frederick , is sent over to me for protection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must n't neglect his son . Frederick is heard singing without , L. Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Here comes his son  --  that 's Mr. Frederick . Enter Frederick , L. Fre . Frederick Bramble Ah ! my dear uncle , good morning ! Your park is nothing but beauty . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Who bid you caper over my beauty ? I told you to stay in doors till I got up . Fre . Frederick Bramble Eh ?  --  Egad ! so you did . I had as entirely forgotten it as  --  Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble And , pray , what made you forget it ? Fre . Frederick Bramble The sun . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble The sun ?  --  He 's mad ! You mean the moon , I believe . Fre . Frederick Bramble Oh , my dear sir ! you do n't know the effect of a fine spring morning upon a young fellow just arrived from Russia . The day looked bright  --  trees budding  --  birds singing  --  the park was gay  --  so , egad ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your old balcony ; made your deer fly before me like the wind ; and chased them all round the park to get an appetite , while you were snoring in bed , uncle ! Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Ah ! so the effect of an English sun upon a young Russian , is to make him jump out of a balcony , and worry my dear ? Fre . Frederick Bramble I confess it had that influence upon me . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble You had better be influenced by a rich old uncle , unless you think the sun likely to leave you a fat legacy . Fre . Frederick Bramble Sir , I hate fat legacies . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Sir , that 's mighty singular . They are pretty solid tokens of kindness , at least . Fre . Frederick Bramble Very melancholy tokens , uncle ; they are the posthumous despatches Affection sends to Gratitude , to inform us we have lost a generous friend . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Aside . How charmingly the dog argues ! Fre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me this morning . I will obey you better in future ! for they tell me you are a very worthy , good sort of old gentleman . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Now who had the familiar impudence to tell you that ? Fre . Frederick Bramble ( L. ) Old Rusty , there . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble ( C. ) Why , Humphrey , you did n't ? Dob . Humphrey Dobbins ( R. ) Yes , but I did , though . Fre . Frederick Bramble Yes , he did ; and , on that score , I shall be anxious to show you obedience ;  --  for ' t is as meritorious to attempt sharing in a good man 's heart , as it is paltry to have designs upon a rich man 's money . A noble nature aims its attentions full breast high , uncle ; a mean mind levels its dirty assiduities at the pocket . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Embracing him . Jump out of every window I have in my house ! hunt my deer into high fevers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n it ! this is spunk and plain speaking ! Give me a man who is always plumping his dissent to my doctrine smack in my teeth ! Fre . Frederick Bramble I disagree with you there , uncle . Dob . Humphrey Dobbins So do I. Fre . Frederick Bramble You , you forward puppy !  --  If you were not so old , I 'd knock you down . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble I 'll knock you down if you do ! I wo n't have my servants thumped into dumb flattery ; I wo n't let you teach ' em to make silence a toad-eater . Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Come , you 're ruffled . Let 's go to the business of the morning . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble D  --  n the business of the morning ! Do n't you see we 're engaged in discussion ? I hate the business of the morning ! Dob . Humphrey Dobbins No , you do n't . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble And why not ? Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Because ' t is charity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we mus n't neglect business . If there be any distresses in the parish , read the morning list , Humphrey . Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Taking out a paper , and looking over it . Jonathan Huggins , of Muck Mead , is put into prison . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Why , ' t was but last week , Gripe , the attorney , recovered two cottages for him by law , worth sixty pounds . Dob . Humphrey Dobbins And charged a hundred and ten for his trouble . So seized the cottages for part of his bill , and threw Jonathan in gaol for the remainder . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble A harpy !  --  I must relieve the poor fellow 's distress . Fre . Frederick Bramble And I must kick his attorney . Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Looking at the list . The curate 's horse is dead . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Psha ! there 's no distress in that . Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Yes , there is , to a man who must go twenty miles every Sunday to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Why wo n't Punmock , the vicar , give him another nag ? Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Because ' t is cheaper to get another curate ready mounted . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble What 's the name of the black pad I purchased last Tuesday at Tunbridge ? Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Beelzebub . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Send Beelzebub to the curate , and tell him to work him as long as he lives . Fre . Frederick Bramble And if you have a tumble-down tit , send him to the vicar , to give him a chance of breaking his neck . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble What else ? Dob . Humphrey Dobbins Somewhat out of the common . There 's one Lieutenant Worthington , a disabled officer and a widower , come to lodge at Farmer Harrowby 's , in the village . He 's plaguy poor indeed , it seems , but more proud than poor , and more honest than proud . Fre . Frederick Bramble That sounds like a noble character . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Humphrey Dobbins He 'd see you hanged first ! Harrowby says , he 'd sooner die than ask any man for a shilling . There 's his daughter , and his dead wife 's aunt , and an old corporal that has served in the wars with him ; he keeps them all upon his half-pay . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Starves them all , I am afraid , Humphrey . Fre . Frederick Bramble Crossing to R. Uncle , good morning . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Where the devil are you running now ? Fre . Frederick Bramble To talk to Lieutenant Worthington . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble And what may you be going to say to him ? Fre . Frederick Bramble I ca n't tell till I encounter him ; and then , uncle , when I have an old gentleman by the hand , who is disabled in his country 's service , and struggling to support his motherless child , a poor relation , and a faithful servant , in honourable indigence , impulse will supply me with words to express my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop , you rogue !  --  I must be before you in this business . Fre . Frederick Bramble That depends upon who can run fastest . So start fair , uncle ; and here goes ! Exit hastily , R. Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Stop ! why , Frederick !  --  A jackanapes ! to take my department out of my hands ! I 'll disinherit the dog for his assurance ! Dob . Humphrey Dobbins No , you wo n't . Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Wo n't I ? D  --  me , if I  --  But we 'll argue that point as we go . Come along , Humphrey ! Exeunt , R. Scene II .  --  The Exterior of Farmer Harrowby 's House . Enter Corporal Foss , L. , and crossing to R. , followed by Stephen Harrowby . Ste. Stephen Harrowby Calling after him . Hollo ! I say , Mr. Corporal ! Foss . Corporal Foss Ah , Master Stephen ! is it you ? Ste. Stephen Harrowby What do you think I ha ' been about ! Foss . Corporal Foss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose . Ste. Stephen Harrowby Now feyther 's head man be gone to dextricate the cattle . But you was telling I t' other day , you do know , about a springing up of a mine , which be done by a man they do call a pie on an ear . Foss . Corporal Foss A pioneer is our name for it , my honest lad .  --  Ay , I have seen some of that work in my day , Master Stephen . If we could but get a little spot of ground , now , with a bit of good-for-nothing building upon it  --  Ste. Stephen Harrowby I ha ' found out just such a pleace , Mr. Corporal . Foss . Corporal Foss Then I 'll show you the whole process . Ste. Stephen Harrowby I ha ' done the whole progress myself . Foss . Corporal Foss Have you ? Ste. Stephen Harrowby You do know feyther 's pig-sty ? Foss . Corporal Foss Yes : it stands on the edge of the dry ditch , at the back of the house . Ste. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure enow ; but I ha ' blowed it up with gunpowder . Foss . Corporal Foss The devil you have !  --  And how ? Ste. Stephen Harrowby All according to rule , mun  --  just as you laid it down . I bored a hole under the ditch wi ' the peel of our oven , and then I laid in my bumbustibles . Foss . Corporal Foss Well ? Ste. Stephen Harrowby Why , I clapped the kitchen poker to un , red hot ; and it all went up wi ' a desperate complosion , just as you destroyed that outlandish buttery . Foss . Corporal Foss Bless us , Master Stephen ! then you have ruined the town in cold blood , and killed all the inhabitants ! Ste. Stephen Harrowby No ; the inhabitants am lying in the ditch , as pert as daisies ; only the little pigs am singed quite bald , and the old white sow be as black as the devil . Enter Mary , L. Mary . Mary Brother Stephen ! come here , brother Stephen . Feyther do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o ' this fashion , what will the neighbors call ye , Stephen ? Ste. Stephen Harrowby Call me !  --  Why , a perspiring young hero , of five foot six inches , willing to mortalize himself in the field of March ! Enter Lieutenant Worthington , L. ,  --  he crosses and exits into house , R. U. E. Foss . Corporal Foss There  --  his honour is come home ; I must go in for orders . Mary . Mary Oh , Mr. Corporal , Joe Shambles , the butcher 's boy , ha ' brought this from our town for your master . Gives a letter . Foss . Corporal Foss One letter ! Is this all he left for us , my pretty maid ? Mary . Mary No ; he left a leg of mutton . Foss . Corporal Foss Oh ! Exit into the house . R. U. E. Ste.

Enter Lieutenant Worthington and Corporal Foss , R. Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Where are the ladies , corporal ? Foss . Corporal Foss They are gone to take a walk , an ' please your honour . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Seating himself . Oh ! mine has somewhat fatigued me . Foss . Corporal Foss Under favour , I think your honour takes too much exercise ; it always brings on the torment in your wound again . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington You bustle about for me more than I could wish , corporal . You got your wound in an ugly place , you know . Foss . Corporal Foss I got it at Gibraltar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursed shell struck us both together . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Sighing . I remember it did , corporal . Foss . Corporal Foss And when I lay on the ground , and your honour 's left arm was so terribly wounded , you stretched out your right to help me . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington I do n't remember that , corporal . Foss . Corporal Foss Do n't you ?  --  But I do ; Warmly. and I wish I may be damned if ever I forget it ! Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Well , well ! do not let us swear about it , corporal . Foss . Corporal Foss I hate swearing , your honour , as much as our chaplain loved brandy ; but when a man 's heart 's too full , I fancy , somehow , there 's an oath at the top o n't , and when that pops out , he 's easy . Ah ! we had warm work that day , your honour . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington We had indeed , corporal . Foss . Corporal Foss There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us at land . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Moreno , with his fleet , before us at sea . Foss . Corporal Foss At ten in the morning , the Spanish admiral began his cannonade . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Our battery from the king 's bastion opened directly . Foss . Corporal Foss Red-hot shot poured from the garrison ! Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Cannons roar ! Foss . Corporal Foss Mortars and howitzers ! Wor . Lieutenant Worthington The enemy 's shipping in flames ! Foss . Corporal Foss Fire again ! Wor . Lieutenant Worthington They burn ! Foss . Corporal Foss They blow up ! Wor . Lieutenant Worthington They sink ! Foss . Corporal Foss Victory !  --  " Old England forever , your honour ! " Huzza ! " " Wor . " Lieutenant Worthington Ay , corporal , against the world in arms , Old " England forever ! " Both . Both Huzza ! Foss . Corporal Foss Gravely , after a pause . We have no limbs to help our country now ;  --  we shall never fight for her again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corporal ; ' t is impossible ! Foss . Corporal Foss But our hearts are for our country still ! though your honour has only half-pay , and I am but an out-pensioner of Chelsea . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington We have no right to complain , corporal . National bounty , beyond its limits , would be national waste ; and ' t is impossible to provide sumptuously for all . Foss . Corporal Foss That 's true , your honour ; every hero that loses his life in the field , must not expect a marble monument . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington ' T is of little import , corporal : a gallant soldier 's memory will flourish , though humble turf be osier-bound upon his grave . The tears of his country will moisten it , and vigorous laurel sprout among the cypress that shadows his remains . But ' t is a bitter thought , when we must depart , to leave unprotected the few who are joined with us in the ties of affection , and the bonds of nature ! Foss . Corporal Foss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mr. Burford for five hundred pounds . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Smiling . I did not mean that , corporal . There , however , I am easy : my friend has strict honour ; and , should he die , the regular insurance of his life secures me from injury in lending him my name . But ' t is strange I have not heard from him . Foss . Corporal Foss I had forgot ; here is a letter just brought for your honour . Shall I break the seal ? Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Let me see . Opening it and reading . " Tunbridge . " ' T is written in the neigbouring town . Who should know me there ? Reading . " Sir , I am instructed by Mr. Ferret , solicitor , of London , to inform you , that Mr. Burford died , on the 26th ultimo , on his way to the insurance office ; whereby the policy , which had expired the day before , is become roid , and the bond and warrant of attorney for five hundred pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be not paid forthwith , I shall enter up judgment , instantly , for the recovery of the same . " My child ! my child ! Sinks into a chair . Foss . Corporal Foss Your honour ! Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Ruined past hope ! Foss . Corporal Foss Approaching him . Do n't say that , your honour ; for while your half-pay continues  --  Wor . Lieutenant Worthington My creditor will grasp all ! my person seized , and my poor child destitute ! Foss . Corporal Foss Destitute !  --  What , my young mistress ?  --  And you ? and  --  Do n't give way to grief , your honour ! I am lame to be sure , but I am fit for labour still . There 's my little pension , too , from Chelsea . Things may come about ; and , till they do , you and my young mistress shall never know want , while the old corporal has a limb left to work , or a penny in his pocket . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Corporal , I  --  Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , this is he ! Zounds ! I am quite out of breath ! To Worthington . Sir , I am come to  --  Whew ! I beg pardon : but , as you perceive , I am devilish blown ! Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Leave us , corporal . Exit Foss , R. At your leisure sir , I shall be glad to know whom I have the honour of addressing . Fre . Frederick Bramble I am Frederick Bramble , sir ; my uncle , Sir Robert Bramble , lives at the foot of this infernal hill . He fixed his house there , I fancy , for the sake of argument , because most men , maintain it is bad to build in a bottom . He is as charitable as a Christian , sir , and as rich as a Jew . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington I give you joy of a relation , sir , who has so much virtue , with so much wealth . When fortune enriches the benevolent , the goddess removes the bandage from her brow , that she may bestow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a stranger here , and a recluse , I have no right to enter further into your uncle 's character . Fre . Frederick Bramble Yet he has just now , sir , taken a right to enter into yours . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington May be not rather have taken a liberty , sir ? Fre . Frederick Bramble ' T is his duty to be the most inquisitive fellow in the neighborhood . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington ' T is a strange duty for a gentleman . Fre . Frederick Bramble I hope not , in this country , sir . If a gentleman be in the commission of the peace , and living on his own estate , he should be anxious , I think , to inquire into the conduct of those around him , that he may distribute justice as a magistrate , and kindness as a man . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington But how can your uncle 's principle apply to me , sir  --  a secluded sojourner , with a quiet family , lodging with one of his tenants ? Fre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hem !  --  that is , I mean  --  the  --  peculiarity of your situation . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Haughtily . Sir ! Fre . Frederick Bramble Aside . I shall make a bungling business of this , after all ! Aloud . I say , sir , that my uncle , as I told you , is a warm old heart , who busies himself in learning the circumstances of everybody about him , and  --  Wor . Lieutenant Worthington The circumstances ! Fre . Frederick Bramble Yes ;  --  and so Humphrey Dobbins , a stupid old servant , among other intelligence this morning , happened to  --  to mention you , and  --  Damn it , sir ! the truth 's the truth ! I am here to prevent my uncle offering his assistance too bluntly , and I fear I have done it too bluntly myself . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington It would be absurd , sir , to affect blindness to the motives of your visit ; I see them clearly , and thank you cordially . You have touched the heart of a veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will wound the dignity of a gentleman . Fre . Frederick Bramble I came here to heal wounds  --  by my soul , I did ! ' T is not in my nature to inflict them . I am new in England , ignorant in the manners of the country ; for I arrived here last night from Russia , where I was born ;  --  but , surely , surely it can not be offensive , in any part of the globe , to tell the afflicted we feel for them . Pray give me your hand ! Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Take it , sir  --  take it ! Receive the grasp of gratitude , and be gone ! Fre . Frederick Bramble Not till you first permit me to  --  Wor . Lieutenant Worthington I can accept no favours of the nature you offer , where I have no claim ; and what claim , young man , can I have upon your attentions ? Fre . Frederick Bramble The claim each man has in common upon his fellow . We are all passengers on life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mire on the road , the next that comes by is a brute , who does n't stretch out a hand to extricate him . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington That may hold in the courtesies of life ; but I do not admit it as an argument in essentials . Fre . Frederick Bramble Then I wish my uncle were here , with all my heart , sir ; he 'd argue this point with you , or any other , to all eternity . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington I want no arguments upon points of honour ; honour , the offspring of honesty , dictates for itself . Fre . Frederick Bramble Sir , I respect it , for its parent 's sake , though the child is a little maddish : for honour is sometimes cutting throats , where honesty would be shaking hands . But let let me entreat you to relax  --  to be persuaded . Come , my dear sir ; true honour , I trust , can never have reason to blush , because honesty is assisted . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington After a pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trying moment . I have a family  --  a beloved child , from whom I may be shortly torn , without the means of  --  No matter ! Even the griefs that inwardly wring me , would not force me to unbend , were there not a native ingenuousness in your manner which wins me . To you , then  --  to a youthful stranger , whose sympathy comes o'er a rugged soldier 's nature , as pictured Love bestrides the lion ,  --  to you I will owe a temporary obligation . Fre . Frederick Bramble Will you ? Then you have made me the happiest dog that  --  Searching his pockets . Eh !  --  No ! zounds ! I mean , sir , you have made me look the silliest dog in the world ! Wor . Lieutenant Worthington What do you mean ? Fre . Frederick Bramble In my haste to do service , I never once recollected I wanted the means : my heart was so full , that I quite forgot my pockets were empty . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington I can not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fre . Frederick Bramble Insult !  --  Oh , my dear sir ! you do not know me  --  you may soon . I have left a father in embarrassments in Russia ;  --  I have landed here , dependent on an uncle 's bounty ; and paid my last shilling to the coachman , who set me down at his gate ;  --  but my relation is as generous as a prince ; he will , I am sure , give me a supply , and then  --  Wor . Lieutenant Worthington And then I would not , for worlds , draw upon your little store . You have a superior call , it seems , upon you  --  a parent in distress . Fre . Frederick Bramble My father 's involvements , no doubt , will be his brother 's care : and if  --  Wor . Lieutenant Worthington No more  --  no more ! I see the workings of your heart . Farewell ! Crossing , R. Repine not that your will to do good actions outruns your power . Had the widow been without her mite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moist shrine of compassion , it would have secured to her a page in Heaven 's register ! Exit , R. Fre . Frederick Bramble Now this is all very pretty rhodomontade ; and I 'll go directly and argue that it is so , with my uncle , for the good of the bluff veteran . A widow 's weeping for distress may water the road pleasantly enough for herself to paradise , but if she could shed peck loaves instead of tears , it would be twenty times better for the poor's-box .

I have been reasoning all my life , and find that all argument will vanish before one touch of nature . Fre . Frederick Bramble I fancy you will often find it so , my dear uncle .

Corporal Foss No enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wor . Lieutenant Worthington I am strongly inclined to go to Sir Robert 's today . Foss .

Corporal Foss I had almost made sure of your honour 's going . I have laid out the red roquelaire ; and , in case of a dark night , Stephen 's now in the stable , dusting out the lantern , for me to march home before your honour . Wor .

But the gentleman who protected me has been so good , so very good , that  --  Wor . Lieutenant Worthington That what , Emily ? Emily . Emily Worthington I should like  --  to thank him  --  that 's all . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Have we not both thanked him already ? Emily .

Open your heart to me  --  to your father  --  your friend , Emily ! Emily . Emily Worthington Indeed , I never wish to hide my thoughts from you : they often meet your ear , so wild and so unformed , that they resemble dreams . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Alas ! my child , the thoughts of young minds too frequently resemble dreams . Should you love this young man , Emily , it is a dream , from which no reproof of mine shall startle you , but the gentleness of a father shall awaken you . Emily . Emily Worthington Love him !  --  Oh , no  --  But he preserved me from danger , and , on that account , I dread he may incur it himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart is , Emily . Emily . Emily Worthington Yes , indeed I do . I should be grieved if I did not know it dearly loved you . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington And you have no such sentiments towards this young man , Emily ? Emily .

Lieutenant Worthington Take , then , my fondest counsel while I live  --  my best legacy , alas ! should I be hurried from you . Act not too suddenly on ideas . Doubt that passion may mislead you , till reflection justifies your impulse . Wed not for wealth , Emily , without love  --  ' t is gaudy slavery ; nor for love , without competence  --  ' t is twofold misery . Glide gently down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor too slight a freightage ; and may your voyage , my child , be happier  --  much happier than your father 's ! Re-enter Corporal Foss , R. Foss . Corporal Foss Madam Mac Tab wants to know if you all dine at Sir Robert 's , your honour . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington Why does she inquire , corporal ? Foss . Corporal Foss It 's about putting on some of her trinkums and furbelows , I fancy , your honour . She came in , awhile ago , as muddy as our little pigeon-toed drummer after a long march . Wor . Lieutenant Worthington I have thought o n't . Tell her we shall go . Foss . Corporal Foss No  --  will you ? Huzza ! I ha' n't been better pleased since they made me a corporal ! Exit , R. Emily .

Lieutenant Worthington We shall not live here for a twelvemonth , madam . Luc . Miss Lucretia Mac Tab I am glad of it , for this place is worse than a cowhouse . One is up to one 's ears in mud , and nothing but brutes are its constant inhabitants . Wor .

Ollapod Troubled with a palpitation of heart , and ca n't come . Sir C. Sir Charles Cropland He does n't seem of that sort . What are the odds , now , that he does n't wing me ! These greenhorns generally hit everything but the man they aim at . Olla . Ollapod Do they ?  --  Zounds ! then the odds are , that he 'll wing me . I 'll be principal , if you please ; for , to say the truth , I never served my time to the trade of a second . Sir C.

Sir Robert Bramble I begin to perceive it . I 'm a strange old fellow , fond of argument , they say ; but I have so little time left now in this world , that some of my arguments are a little shorter than they used to be .

Sir R. Sir Robert Bramble Why so ? I happen to be sheriff of the county ; and as all writs are returnable to me , a scrubbyish fellow asked me to sign one against you . I thought it might be as well not to lock up a worthy man in a scurvy room , just as I had asked him , from no common motives , to sit down to my table ;  --  so I drew upon my bankers , instead of John Doe and Richard Roe ; and you may re-imburse me at your leisure .
