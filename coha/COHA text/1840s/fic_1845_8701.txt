Main text Part 1 Pastoral Chorus Chorus  --  of Men and Women upon the Mountains . The morn is glowing in the east , Resplendent up the cloudless sky ; The golden sunbeams brightly dart , And linger on the mountains high , The breath of God is on the fields , The yellow corn , the fragrant flower , Alike bow as his spirit moves , And trembling own his wond'rous power . Trio . Father of life and light ! we bend to thee Thy love smiles in the pouting fields ; Thy glory in the golden sky .

The virgin train hath come to greet thee , The valleys echo with their song ; Thine eager child the first to meet thee , And the glad melody prolong . The victory 's won , the Lord hath triumph 'd , We bring thee wreaths to crown thy brow ; And offerings for the holy altar , Where low thy warrior chieftains bow . Sweet smiling Peace now glads the valley , The shepherd 's pipe again is heard ; The flocks are grazing on the mountain , And blithely sings the merry bird . The trumpet 's notes no longer fright us , The clang of arms has died away ; For Victory 's hand hath waved our banner , And Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jephtha My beauteous child ! sweet mountain flower ! Bright sunbeam in a darksome hour ; Why first come forth to greet thy sire With tuneful song and youthful choir ?

Despair  --  despair hath seiz 'd my heart ; I can not kiss thy dimpled cheek , I can not smooth thy locks apart , Without a pang too sharp to speak . All  --  all  --  thou art my life to me , And I must live to weep alone ; Sleeping to dream , my child , of thee , Waking to think of the and moan .

Jephtha 's Daughter My father ! if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the Lord , do to me according to that which hath proceeded from thy mouth ; for as much as the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies , even of the children of Ammon . Let this thing be done for me ; Let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and bewail my fate  --  I and my fellows . Air . Cease , troubled bosom , cease , Sad heart , be lull 'd in peace ; Life 's but a gleam of light , And death a calm and tranquil night , Lo ! how the flower fadeth When eve its beauty shadeth .

Sad day for Judah 's conquering host ; home hath no winning charm . Lo , where the father mutely stands , fondly gazing on his child . Hush 'd be the brazen trumpet 's sound , hush 'd be the cymbal 's clang , for Judah 's daughters seek the hills , to bathe the flowers with their tears . But the Lord 's our protector , he 's good and he 's mighty ; Let us praise him and worship him , the king over all . Holy Lord , God of hosts ! Basses . Let our voices speak to heaven  --  let the hills the shout re-echo  --  Let the wailing trumpet sound and swell the anthem of the host .

The morning 's saffron sky , When sparkle dewy tears , And light clouds hang on high . Bright pictured on the deep The hues of heaven rest , There all its beauties sleep Upon the sea 's clam breast The clouds that float aloft , With blushes on each fold , As if a finger soft Had edged them round with gold . And then the deep blue sky , That peers in depths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pleasant green . There 's music in the breeze That slowly creeps along , The brake and lofty trees Are eloquent with song .

My child , it is the will of God , Thy sunny hours are few , The altar 's thirsting for thy blood , Then bid the world adieu . I 've watch 'd thee with a father 's care , And from thy natal hour ; Beheld thee blooming mild and fair , A bright , yet tender flower . Hush 'd be the cymbal 's warlike clang , Hush 'd be the trumpet 's tongue ; Low let our conquering banner hang , Be the song of wailing sung . Solo  --  High Priest .

Bass  --  Recitativo The fire of heaven hath fallen upon the altar , and the flame swells for its victim .

Oh , tempt me not with that look so full of love ; I can not lose thee , and yet my God commands . A moment more , and thou art lost to me .
