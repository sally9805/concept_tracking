txt /q/ these topics are considered , I have endeavoured to show the true relation which exists between endosmosis and capillary attraction , and how the latter itself springs from electric excitement . I have shown how , in strict conformity with this principle , the flow of the sap and the circulation of the blood may be explained ; the systemic circulation , for example , arising as a necessary consequence of the deoxydation of arterial blood . The theory of these circulatory movements taking place in organized structures I have not heretofore published , though they have been taught in my lectures in this University . It will be seen that the peculiarity is in tracing the action to chemical changes ; that the systemic circulation arises , as has just been said , from the deoxydation of arterial blood ; the pulmonary circulation from the oxydation of venous blood ; and the flow of sap in flowering plants from the carbonization of water by the sunlight in their leaves . It might be supposed that Chapter XVIII. , AP. , is intended as a reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been published by M. EDMOND BECCIUEREL , in the Annales de Chimie . When that chapter was written , I had not , however , had the opportunity of seeing his valuable memoir . The experiments there given were not made with the iodide , but the bromide of silver , a circumstance which relieves me from much of the weight of the criticisms of that chemist . It is not only from my own experiments , but also from those of Sir J. HERSCHEL , that I am led to differ from M. BECCIUEREL , in regarding the iodide and bromide of silver as exhibiting very different changes in the spectrum . M. BECQUEREL 'S idea that there is but little difference between them , does not seem to be consonant to experiment . Of the Appendix , several chapters have already been translated into different European languages , and a variety of criticisms upon them have been published . It is this circumstance which has caused me to hasten the printing of the whole of these papers in this collected form now offered to the public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will necessarily happen , that on many points mistakes will be made as to the meaning and views of an author . This has happened in the present instance , both in Germany and France : for example , in Chapter XV. , which has been republished in Paris in the Annales de Chimie , errors of the kind occur . Those who are familiar with these matters will find , when they look over these papers in the form PREFACE . vii now given , that views have been thus accidentally imputed to the author which he does not entertain . It did not enter into my plan to reprint any of the valuable memoirs which have been published by other chemists on these topics , more especially on those relating to the chemical agencies of light . I may , however , direct the attention of the readers to a description by Sir J. HERSCHEL , of the spectrum alluded to in the Appendix ( 645 ) . It is inserted in the Philosophical Magazine for February , 1843 . In this paper will be found what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of light on Daguerreotype plates , and the reader of this volume will be the more interested in it , inasmuch as it contains criticisms on several of the leading doctrines here set forth . The different chapters of the Appendix are , for the most part , reprinted from sources mentioned under the title of each . In a few instances slight changes have been made in them ; changes which have been rendered necessary by the mode in which they were originally published . Thus some of these papers were printed in various American , and others in European journals , and it sometimes happens that experiments are in consequence described twice over . This repetition I have avoided by removing the paragraphs involved . In this manner I have entirely omitted to republish in this work a paper on the constitution of the atmosphere , given in the Philosophical Magazine for October , 1838 , because nearly all its experimental matter had been previously published in the American Journal of Medical Sciences , and is given in Chapter VI . The time has now arrived when both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Chemistry and Natural Philosophy , the only basis which can elevate them from their present deplorable position to that of true sciences . It is with this impression that the explanations which I have given in this book of the mode by which light acts in determining organization , and of the mechanical causes by which such organized matter is transmitted from point to point of living systems ( for these are the leading facts which this work is designed to illustrate ) , arc offered to the attention of chemical philosophers . /z/ University of New- York , October 1 , 1844 . N.B. The references to the Appendix are made by the number of the paragraph , thus ( Ar. , 100 , 101 ) . When the place referred to is in the body of the work , the letters AP . are omitted , thus /z/ THE first edition of this work being exhausted , I have taken the opportunity of inserting in this an abstract of the recent experiments and discoveries on the movements of plants under the influence of light . It is chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy , published in June last . I have also corrected several errors which were overlooked in the former edition , and made some improvements in the general arrangement and appearance of the work . The favourable reception which this book has met with from the philosophical world and the public , assures me that I was not mistaken in the estimate I placed upon the importance of the subject on which it treats . The agency of the imponderables in determining the production of chemical results , and more especially those connected with the growth of plants , is beginning to obtain the attention of philosophers , and doubtless before long will constitute a separate science . If any of the various problems discussed in this book should facilitate the researches of others in this interesting and beautiful department of knowledge , it will be to me a full reward for the labour and time I have expended . /z/ April 28th , 1845. /z/ Object of the Work stated .

THE rapid progress of organic chemistry has recently drawn the attention of scientific men to many remarkable relations which exist between animated beings and the inorganic world . For a long period , physiological doctrines , the spirit of which , for many ages , has undergone but little change , offered an insurmountable barrier to the application of methods of physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On these , in our times , a successful inroad has been made , chiefly through the aid of improved methods of chemical analysis . In a philosophical point of view , it was the office of the seventeenth century to unfold the doctrine of universal gravitation , to assign proper causes for the motions of the celestial bodies , and to develop the great doctrines of astronomy . It was the office of the eighteenth to lay the foundations of physics and chemistry , or of that group of sciences which embraces the relations and reactions of atoms . It is the office of the nineteenth to discover the laws which obtain in the complicated structure of animated beings , those laws which give rise to the mysterious phenomena which we call life . 2 . This book , in which will be found some facts which it has happened to its author to discover , is offered as an humble contribution among those more brilliant gifts with which Germany , and France , and England have lately enriched vegetable and animal physiology . It treats of a subject which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sciences . The great idea which it is designed to illustrate is /z/ that which connects the production and phenomena of organized beings with the imponderable principles . 3 . In this work the existence of the Vital Force of physiologists as a homogeneous and separate force is uniformly denied . The progress of science shows plainly that living structures , far from being the product of one such homogeneous power , are rather the resultants of the action of a multitude of natural forces . Gravity , cohesion , elasticity , the agency of the imponderables , and all other powers which operate both on masses and atoms , are called into action , and hence it is that the very evolution of a living form depends on the condition that all these various agents conspire . There is no mystery in animated beings which time will not at last reveal . It is astonishing that , in our days , the ancient system , which excludes all connexion with natural philosophy and chemistry , and depends on the fictitious aid of a visionary force , should continue to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been broken down by the most common considerations , such as those connected with the mechanical principles involved in the bony skeleton , the optical principles in the construction of the eye , or the hydraulic action of the valves of the heart . 4 . In their origin , all those important ideas which now constitute modern science have been obscurely and imperfectly set forth . It is not given to the human mind , when it emerges from the darkness of ignorance , any more than to the human eye , when it emerges from physical darkness into the sunshine , to see all objects which are before it in their proper aspect and position . A period of time must elapse , during which we become accustomed to the light . Future discovery , in its progress , may show that , of the facts brought forward in this volume , many are misplaced , and many misapplied ; these are incidents to which all philosophical works are liable . But if it should happen that anything contained herein shall aid in fastening the attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impart , the author will have received his reward , and the labours of ten years will not have been entirely thrown away . 5 . Organized beings and organized bodies spring forth in those positions only to which the rays of the sun have access . They are , therefore , limited to the atmosphere , the sea , and the surface of the earth . Periodical vicissitudes , which are observed both in vegetables and in animals , serve to show that this is not a mere fortuitous coincidence , but rather an intimate connexion between the phenomena of life and the presence of the imponderables . When the sun is set , the leaves of plants no longer decompose the carbonic acid of the air , but a pause takes place in the activity of their functions , and they sink into a passive condition . The gaseous bodies brought from the ground by the action of the spongioles percolate through the delicate tissues of the leaf , and escape away into the atmosphere . At night , also , in many flowers , the petals fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active processes cease . It is , therefore , through an instinctive impulse , that comes over them during this period , that all animals , except such as take their prey by night , seek places of rest . Darkness , and silence , and repose are all connected together . 6 . It is one of the greatest discoveries of the present age , that the races of animals which have inhabited our globe were of successive creation ; that they constitute a /z/ series , the extreme terms of which bear no resemblance to each other ; that , commencing with those of the earliest date , we are able to trace a constant progress both in intellectual and structural development . In all , there are found evidences of the operation of the same formative power , acting by and resorting to the aid of the same physical principles . The trilobite , of the primary fossiliferous rocks , and man , of the most recent , have , at the first glance , little in common , but a more attentive observation soon shows that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have both undoubtedly sprung from the operations of the same Intelligent Mind . 7 . Do , then , these successive races of sentient beings form altogether a strictly continuous series 1 As in the series of mathematicians , where each term bears a definite relation to those which precede it , and contains within itself the elemental law of those which are to come after it , do each one of these organized beings observe a position of relationship with those that are of earlier , and those also which are of later date ? Do the animals and the plants of the Carboniferous Period connect those of the Silurian with those of the Newer Pleiocene I Were the organized mechanisms of the Old Red Sandstone essential to the appearance and existence of those which live with us ? Are we , in short , to regard the Author of these wonderful forms as operating in each one of these instances by the same law , and , from small beginnings , evolving and transforming the most elaborate by a successive passage through those which are inferior ? or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epochs , the broad hand of an overruling Providence is to be- discovered , fashioning and framing each class of created forms , irrespective of external physical forces or agents , and giving birth spontaneously to unconnected tribes of animals and plants , which bear no sort of relationship to one another , and are not parts of one common plan in which there is a unity of design ? 8 . The interior movements of the solar system , and the collapsing of nebular masses , are committed to secondary agents or to immutable laws ; and these are events which , for their completion , often require great periods of time . No invisible or extraneous agency ever intervenes . In her predestined course , the moon revolves and exhibits her phases , and , like the beating pendulum , though ten thousand years may have elapsed since its last beat , the comet the pendulum of the universe swings punctually past the sun . That universe is not an unchangeable mass , but is made up of moving and revolving orbs , which are all obedient to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out , that , in the midst of all these transitory affairs , immutable principles are involved , and a common law is incessantly in operation ? 9 . In the history of the human race , it may be observed that epochs have occurred , which , following each other with a kind of periodicity , have stood in relationship with , or even brought about , the conditions of modern civilization . As in the course of the life of an individual there is no incident which is not in connexion with circumstances which have preceded it , and none that does not give a bent to those that follow , we naturally view the vicissitudes of our existence as bearing the relation of cause and effect . We trace the circumstances of to-day from the circumstances of yesterday . In the movements of the celestial bodies we continually see fixed events resulting from the operation of apparently variable causes ; the waxing and waning of the moon , the /z/ eclipses of the sun , the transitory visits of comets . On our own earth we also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and summer , and autumn and winter , following each other unceasingly . From year to year we witness the alternate increase and shortening of the day , the tempests of the equinoxes , and the sultry weather of midsummer . In the world of organization which is around us , we observe similar mutations : there are plants which come up in spring , and die away in autumn ; and even those hardier races which witness the changing of empires , give tokens that they are included within this law of variation . The oak unfolds its buds into leaves , which periodically fall to the ground . Among sensitive beings , from time to time , different races of animals have held dominion of the earth : at one period it has been almost the exclusive abode of reptiles , at another of four-footed mammalians , and at last is under the control of two-handed man . 10 . In whatever direction , therefore , we look , we perceive the transitory nature of all things : even with those which , from their magnitude , their remoteness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as not participating in these unceasing changes , the law holds good . Throughout the universe there is no monument that retains its primordial condition . 11 . Each one of these various changes , no matter whether it concerns organic or inorganic nature , has been the result of the action of some determining cause . The countless systems of phenomena which have arisen are all connected together as systems of effects . In a web , as it passes from the loom , the different threads interlace with one another , and though we soon cease to identify each as it pursues its sinuous way , we know that the last is connected with the first ; and in the web of nature each event has been brought into relation with others that have gone before it , and others that have succeeded it , and all are intertwined together as a series of causes and effects . 12 . Understanding thus that no effect takes place except by the operation of some prior cause , we occupy ourselves in discovering its dependances on things that have preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest philosophers in their speculations on natural phenomena , and ordinary men in the daily affairs of life . The disasters of to-day we attribute to the errors of yesterday , and the possession of glory , and wealth , and position in society , to plans that have been conducted well . No man is in heart a fatalist , for each one clearly perceives that his destinies are in his own charge ; and no small portion of human happiness or misery springs from a knowledge of these things . In other tribes of life , where intellectual processes are replaced by processes of instinct , it is very different : the wild animal which lives in the prairies meets seasons of famine and distress without a moan . Careless for to-morrow , he bears up with his present lot , and is utterly unconscious that he may have been the author of his own wo . There is with him no recording memory of whence he came , no distracting care of whither he may go . He acts , in respect of the passing time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their whole life ; they are ignorant of what happened in their early days of infancy , and never trouble themselves about what may come in old age . 13 . The vegetable world , from possessing no nervous system , is inherently incapable /z/ of appreciating its own existence , and much more , therefore , of feeling emotions of pleasure and pain . To animals nature has given a present contentment , which is purchased by ignorance ; but to men , who are endowed with reasoning powers , whose nervous system has been so formed as to enable their mental operations , by processes of memory , to reach over long periods of time , to combine together events which are afar off , to decompose into their constituent parts phenomena that are complex , and to trace each one of those parts up to its proper cause , knowledge has been given , and the price of that knowledge is pain . 14 . So far as their intellectual powers are concerned , the life of animals , even of those of the highest orders , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toils of the day , the weary labourer sinks into repose , and there come before him pageants and scenery connected , to a certain extent , with the external world ; but of that world he is wholly unconscious . Instead of the accustomed forms that he meets in his daily affairs , there spring up light aerial shapes and phantasms . From recesses in the brain , where they have been long stored , and perhaps forgotten , the recollection of landscapes that he has seen of old come forth ; he views the well-known forms unfold themselves before him : there stands the aged oak , at the foot of which he has so often watched the setting of the sun , and there is the pale-blue sky with its gilded clouds , and in the distance the almost invisible mountains . That fairy panorama has its shadowy tenants , which live , and move , and breathe : the dead are also there . From those silent sepulchres which are within the brain , they rise again as living things , and people the scenes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 . As thus , during the night , these phantoms come up spontaneously before us , and spontaneously disappear , and time , of which men gain a knowledge only by comparing events , passes unnoticed away , we see to what a small extent the will controls these phenomena . The spectres come unbidden , and they as suddenly depart , and very often , during one slumber , they change and rechange again , and memory , the archconjuror , evokes scene after scene . 16 . With the brute creation the same thing holds . In their daily relations with external nature , almost all their functions are carried on by the promptings of instinct , or in a mechanical way . So far as we can see , the current of thought seems to be little under their control , and they have no power of effecting the collocation of ideas . They can not tell the passing of time , which flows away in its silent lapse , and leaves them , as it found them , contented . Unaided by the instincts which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning from causes to effects , or from effects to causes . Even in the most obvious cases , where actions are performed before them which , if performed by themselves , might tend greatly to their enjoyment , they exhibit but a low imitative power . Though he has often seen it done by man , the monkey has never yet learned to make a fire . 17 . All objects which surround us , whether animate or inanimate , are marked by a transitory nature . They come into existence , for a while they continue , and then they pass away . It is thus that , in the course of ages , the configuration of continents and ( j TIME IS AN ELEMENT OF LIFE . seas undergoes change changes , however , which require long periods of time , and which , in the course of human existence , are , for the most part , imperceptible . Commencing with the inorganic world , which we see is included in this law of unceasing variation , we discover that each of its component structures passes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated . For the same reason it is that bodies which are organized and organization in itself implies complicated structure are of all forms most liable to these mutations . The dead carcass of an animal speedily disappears under the forms of water , ammonia , and carbonic acid , its elemental atoms breaking up into simpler and more enduring groups . It is a vulgar error that a living being possesses a principle of resistance to external agents , while a dead one submits itself to them ; both equally change , or , of the two , the living one putrefies and changes the more rapidly ; but , then , for each of the several systems of dead and dissevered atoms , appointed routes of passage are prepared . The carbonic acid escapes by the lungs , the nitrogenized compounds through the kidneys , and water through both those organs and the skin . The putrefaction of an organized being is a constant event ; it commences before birth , and continues after death ; but , though constant , it is regulated in life , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanism appointed for removing the decaying atoms broken down . 18 . Time , therefore , enters as an element in animal life . Individuals , after the progress of a few years , pass away , and , during each moment of their existence , their various parts are undergoing incessant change . There is a constant removal of all the carbon compounds from every part of the system ; a removal which necessarily arises in conducting locomotion , and various other functions . If an electric current is to be passed along the wire of a voltaic battery , and is required to evolve a certain amount of light or heat , or to produce a certain amount of electro-magnetic motion , a fixed amount of zinc must be consumed . If a steam engine has a given quantity of work to perform , a given quantity of coal must be burned . So also in animal systems , the production of motion can only be effected by the consumption of the parts of the animal machine . In the higher races , in which an elaborate development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmutation go on with the greatest rapidity . Among insects , which are constantly upon the wing , the combustion of the organic atoms is at a maximum , as is also , consequently , the production of heat ; but at night , or when they rest , the rate of respiration diminishes , the heat declines , and the transmutation is checked . In the existence of an animal , as also in the existence of its constituent atoms , time , therefore , enters as an element . 19 . There is a constant washing away of mountains into the sea , and rivers continually tend to fill up their beds . In one region the detritus of the land , brought down by streams , encroaches on the ocean , and makes new countries ; in another , the ocean invades the shores , and makes changes in the shape of continents . In the vegetable world , the leaves are organized in spring , and decay in autumn ; and among animals , each has its own period of duration . Among all these organized structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work , physical phenomena have to be originated , and physical ends to be gained . The death , therefore , of an or- /z/ ganic atom in an animal , has for its object the production of a given result , and is itself the result of the action of ordinary physical powers . 20 . If , thus , the various movements I am executing in writing these pages arise directly from the respiration of oxygen gas , and its transmission , by arterial blood , through the system , and each letter that I have penned is the result of the death of parts of this animal frame , which , in their removal , have ended in the production of motion and heat , it is plain that there is no essential difference between the death of an organic atom and the extinction of an animal race . Of the thousands of animal forms which have ceased to live , and of which , indeed , we should have no knowledge but for their remains , which have been entombed in the earth , what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How is it that , at a given epoch , these animated forms have on a sudden stood forth , and after continuing for a time , as suddenly disappeared 1 Why is it that this disappearance does not take effect in a gradual way , but is so abrupt an affair as to serve , in the hands of geologists , the purpose of marking off one epoch from another ? Do not these total disappearances point to external forces of the most extensive operation as the agents that have been at work , and the end and object of those extinctions the production of physical results I 21 . As the cause of extinction of those innumerable tribes of life which have inhabited the earth is directly traceable to physical events , for individuals , also , the same law holds good . On the American Continent the mastodon is no longer seen , though but a short time has elapsed since all the rich valleys were thronged with those enormous elephants , and still , in the salt-licks , their bones are disentombed along with those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone to obscure and unintelligent orders of life that this law of extinction applies . Within the periods of history , have not the same things happened 1 The founders of the greatest empires and republics have ceased to exist . Among us , what has become of that ancient people who built the extensive structures in the Western States ? Their name and every recollection of them have passed away . Even before our eyes , is not the same thing happening ? From the Atlantic States , have not the Indian races nearly disappeared I They are borne by the tide of civilization across the great Valley of the Mississippi . Among them one tribe after another is swept away . The blood of the Mandans has ceased to flow in the veins of a single human being . Worn down by famine , by war , and by pestilence , these children of the forest recede before that civilization , the benefits of which they obstinately refuse to receive , and , clinging with an uncontrollable instinct to a wandering and savage life , accompany the wild animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessities , from time to time return among us , and beg in the City of Washington for a blanket and a little bread . 22 . Yet among them there are men capable of the highest emotions and the most noble deeds . The hand of Providence presses upon the Indian . The race , like each individual of it , submits in silence to an irreversible doom . From the day when organization first commenced on the surface of the earth , the law which it has followed has been a law of progress and of evolvemeut . A myriad types of life have been created , and myriads of living forms produced , and the last is the highest . Even with us the /z/ same thing is going on : advances in knowledge are advances in power . The civilized man of these days is a wholly different being from the man who lived a thousand years ago , and the conditions which determine his position have totally changed . With us the position both of empires and of individuals is fixed by the possession of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been given , there is a requirement to join in the advancing march . The Indian stands still , and the penalty is death . 23 . These severe results are brought about by universal laws laws which were not intended for individual cases . In the system of the universe an individual is not known , but action takes place on masses . Nor are the laws of Nature ever bent to give benefits to or bring punishment on any individual . They go into effect with an inexorable decision . The earth in her course pursues an irresistible march , and tides rise and fall in the sea with a fixed fatality . In the affairs of men the same unwavering destiny is observed , and whether it be in the case of an empire or a man , resistance to the course of events ends in an inevitable doom . He who resists the progress of civilization , meets the same fate as he who resists the cataract of Niagara . There is no waywardness in Providence , no partialities , and no hates . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good and the evil , and sendeth his rains on the just and on the unjust . " 24 . From these considerations , therefore , we may gather that the laws of Nature contain provisions for the extinction and removal of successive races ; operations which are carried on by the action of physical powers . As the death of an individual arises from the action of external agents , so , in the same manner , does the disappearance of a tribe : and hence we see that , as existence is under this control , it can not take place except when physical circumstances conspire ; as they change , so , also , must the various forms of life undergo corresponding mutations. 25 . In the constitution of all organized beings , water enters as the leading ingredient of their fluid parts ; it is therefore obvious that there is a very limited range of temperature in which the processes of life can be carried on . These thermometric limits are between 32 and 212 Fah . Life , therefore , is comprised within a range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might proceed to show how the existence of individuals and races is completely determined by external conditions . How , for the same reason that an individual dies , so too does a tribe become extinct . Pursuing these considerations , we might show how closely the development of the intellect itself is connected with them ; we might compare the effect of climates in the torrid , the temperate , and the frigid zone , and show how history bears out the truth of these views . We might appeal to individual experience for the enervating effects of hot climates , or to the common understanding of men as to the great control which atmospheric changes exercise , not only on our intellectual powers , but even on our bodily well-being . It is within a narrow range of climate that great men have been born . In the earth 's southern hemisphere , as yet , not one has appeared , and in the northern they come only within certain parallels of latitude . I am not speaking of that class of men who , in all ages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have sunk again into their na- /z/ live insignificance , so soon as the causes which have forced them from obscurity cease , but of that other class , of whom God makes but one in a century , and gives him a power of enchantment over his fellows , so that by a word , or even by a look , he can " electrify , and guide , and govern mankind . " 27 . It was a beautiful idea of some of the English chemists of the seventeenth century , that our earth is nothing more than an incrusted star a star , the light of which has gone out . They gathered this from the well-known phenomena of hot springs , and the increasing temperature of deep cavities . In their opinion , there was a sun in the earth beneath , as well as a sun in the firmament above . These views are essentially the same as those which are now received by geologists , who almost universally admit the doctrine of a central heat , the surface having cooled down nearly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of M. POISSON , that the sun , in his movements through space , successively carries his attendant planets through regions of variable temperatures temperatures which are variable by reason of the different amount of stellar radiation which crosses them , and that , for many ages past , he has been coming from a warmer to a colder space . Admitting this to be a true representation of the fact , the phenomena which we witness are such as should take place . If a great mass of rock was brought from the equator suddenly into the polar regions , it would , from being exposed there to a low temperature , commence to radiate its heat , and in a very short time , if examined , would be found coldest on the surface , with a temperature increasing towards its centre , that increase being at first rapid , but the heat subsequently becoming uniform . Such a rock POISSON regards as being a miniature representation of the earth . 28 . Which ever of these hypotheses is true , of one thing we are certain , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with these changes , not only has the distribution of plants and animals varied , but general disturbances have taken place in the types of existing species . Those creations and extinctions to which allusion has been made were all , undoubtedly , connected with these thermal disturbances . There can be little doubt that the mastodontoid family was destroyed by a general reduction of temperature . With modifications of the distribution of this allpervading agent , changes in the distribution of organized beings must of necessity ensue . Even with us , were the mean temperature to rise by a few degrees , the great mammalia of the torrid zone would push their excursions to the north and south . The Bengal tiger would leave his jungle , and press himself into higher latitudes . It would require but a slight meteorological change to bring the orange-tree into the Middle States , or to tempt the turkey-buzzard far to . the north of New- York . And , on the other hand , should a reverse action take place , and the mean temperature descend by a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States must pass to a lower latitude , or become extinct . The distribution of organized forms is , therefore , directly , and their very existence indirectly , determined by the distribution of heat . Who , then , can doubt that all living beings depend on physical force ? 29 . If these things are true with respect to the organized forms which are known to have existed in former times and we examine the relations obtaining between the /z/ present climates of the earth 's surface and the animals that reside on it how abundant is the proof that all are still under the control of physical agents ! Things being so , and each species having its assigned spot , from which it does not wander , for many ages the same inhabitants are found in the same places . They change as individuals only : the old decline and die away , the young spring up in their stead . I do not know whether , in taking these general reviews of the earth , we ought to have any regard for individuals ; whether we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit the strength and vigour of youth , and the decrepitude and languor of old age . Life and death are familiar to us , because as individuals we have a deep personal interest in them ; but the cares of Nature are beyond a day . In the Drama of the Universe , each actor performs his part , whether leading or obscure , and , though he may retire from the scenes , the play goes forward to its catastrophe . Whether it be an individual or a race , each , by the actions of its life , has given some turn to the general course of events . In the undulations that circle on a quiet lake , each particle alternately rises up and sinks into repose ; but that particle , minute as it was , that motion , small as it might be , was absolutely necessary to keep up the onward motion of the waves . Under this point of view , the destiny of each individual is connected with the destiny of the world . 30 . With each breath that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed a change on the earth 's atmosphere . One year with another I have removed therefrom eight hundred pounds of oxygen gas , and have cast into it a much greater weight of carbonic acid , made up of the detritus of atoms which have been dismissed from the system as unfit for the continuance of life . It is the express function of the act of respiration to produce this result . That carbon , thus given forth , was received in the form of food , it sated the cravings of hunger , or gratified those animal pleasures which depend on the sense of taste . Taken by appropriate apparatus from the stomach , it passed into the circulation , and , grouped with other materials , it changed into blood ; and now , by capillary attraction , aided by the action of the heart , it was carried to every part of the body , and became a constituent of a living being a temporary constituent only . As we have said , it is a vulgar error that the distinction between a living and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain itself without change , while the latter undergoes putrefactive decomposition . Both equally putrefy , or , if there be a difference , the change goes on most quickly in a living system . The true distinction rests in this , that a living body is accommodated with machinery to remove the decomposing atoms , and hence the process is conducted in a regulated way . A chemist looks upon life as made up of unceasing deaths . And those atoms of carbon are removed because their life is over , and they pass , by the action of the lungs , into the atmosphere as carbonic acid gas . 31 . But their function is not ended . There , it is true , they commingle with the elements of the air , and are no longer fit to support the respiration of man . The ways of Nature are marvellous . This gas , cast away by animal forms , serves now as food for plants and trees . Under the influence of the solar beams , the leaves that have been unfolded in spring , spreading their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETWEEN ANIMATED FORMS AND THE ATMOSPHERE . jj sition of these effete atoms ; they undo what the animal system has done ; they release the oxygen once more , and restore it to the air for the use of animals , and appropriate the carbon to their own structures . From it they fashion their flowers , from it they build up their stems or perfect their fruit , and prepare once more food for man . 32 . Thus do these carbonaceous atoms run through a cycle of change , passing from animals to vegetables , and back again from vegetable to animal systems ; and the SUN , to whom Nature has given the charge of these wonderful operations , from age to age furnishes his unfading beams ( Ap. , 824 ) . He sinks below the horizon at night , and retires to the south in the winter , and performs his work by regulated and measured steps . Even at the polar regions , where there is no morning , no noon , no evening , no midnight , where there is no rising nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon , " and under the influence of his midnight beams , trees and plants run through the same series of changes in a few weeks , which they accomplish in months under the purple skies of beautiful Italy . " BERZELIUS. 33 . As , thus , we see the sun performing the office of a great life-giver , and know that all his movements are accomplished by the operation of mechanical laws , as we understand that all these multiplied motions are executed by the action of one attractive force , it would seem as though Nature , on the great scale , called on us to recognise the agency of mechanical laws in regulating the processes of life . 34 . The carbonaceous matter which has flowed through the heart of man as blood , is transferred , by respiration , to the air , and aids in the formation of forest trees or painted flowers . The Asiatics , with whom have originated all the varieties of pagan creeds that have spread to any extent in the world , believed in a transmigration of souls ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in a transmigration of bodies . The coal that we burn is the remains of forests which , in former ages , were thronged with living things forests that sprang , as do the trees with us , from gases that were formed from the respiration of animals but of animals that are all extinct . 35 . Atmospheric air is , then , the grand receptacle from which all living things spring , and to which they all return . It is the cradle of vegetable , and the coffin of animal life . Made up , as it is , of atoms that have once lived , that have run through innumerable cycles of change , the aspect of purity it presents conceals too well its history . In its ethereal expanse are crowds of atomic forms that have once blossomed as flowers , or participated in the pleasures and pains of animal life . Their former function discharged , these atoms that are dead await their turn of reorganization once more . They occupy themselves in transmitting the many-coloured beams of light , or moving in vibration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits well their former state and future destiny . The remains of wild beasts , or of more ferocious men , disappear in this general tomb of dying atoms , and after a time are reorganized by the solar beams once more , perhaps in those pensive wild flowers that blossom unseen in the gloomy wastes of an American forest . 36 . We know that the daily rotation of our earth on her axis determines periodic observances in the functions of organized beings , and fixes their times of activity and sleep ; a similar result attends upon her yearly motion in her orbit . How is it that , in our latitudes , trees and plants awake at the coming of spring , and put forth their leaves /z/ and flowers , and then sink again into their annual slumber 1 How is it , also , that wild birds and beasts conform in their habits to the progress of the seasons , and at one time prepare to bring forth their young , and at another anticipate , with a provident foresight , the coining winter 1 Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which are even connected with the well-being and wealth of nations , are determined by the occurrence of certain epochs . It is no explanation of these curious facts to say that they depend on other facts like themselves that an animal sleeps by night , because his prey is also asleep ; that a fish migrates at those periods when his instincts tell him that the food on which he lives is abundant . If , in any of these cases , we pass from fact to fact , we uniformly come , at last , to the same conclusion , that all these incidents are directed by astronomical events ; that THE SUN not only determines periods of awakening and sleep , of growth and decay , but that there is also committed to him a control and regulation over all the movements of animated beings on the face of the globe . It is the luminous rays of that distant star which , falling perpendicularly , produce the luxuriant vegetation of tropical regions , and his rays of heat which debilitate and enervate the human race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliquity of those beams which suffers the ground to be always covered with snow , and makes those inhospitable countries almost without inhabitants . The trade winds , also , which blow uninterruptedly for ages , carry away towards the poles immense quantities of oxygen gas , which the green parts of plants throw into the atmosphere of the torrid zone . That oxygen is evolved by light , and is then disseminated by heat . In the sea the same influence which thus presides in the air is also at work . The Gulf Stream , which issues from the Mexican waters , with its temperature elevated by solar action , determines the distribution of the Atlantic fishes ; the northern whale avoids its offensive warmth , and on its sides shoals congregate which delight in a more genial heat . As it approaches the coasts of Europe , and spreads out into a fan-like form , the vapours that rise from it give forth their latent heat to the air , and moderate the climates of England and France . The coldness and sterility of corresponding latitudes in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the arts of life , science and literature , have ihere reached their greatest perfection . This physical agent , thus eternally but invisibly continuing its operation , produces a thousand events in which its agency is only remotely traced ; nor are those influences limited to mere physical results ; they stand in connexion with the progress of society and the evolution of mind . A full development of the reasoning faculty can only take place where physical circumstances conspire . It is to the climate of England and France that the human race is indebted for the intellect of Newton and Laplace . 37 . In these remote events , which thus originate among the ordinary phenomena of the natural world , and strike us forcibly when we trace them , step by step , from their origin to their result , we are prone , at a casual glance , to give too much weight to intervening influences , and forget the final cause . Would it be too much to assert that , with returning seasons , periods of vegetation , and the distribution of animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily movements which are taking place in every part of the world 1 There is no harvest which is gathered , no famine which desolates , that has not sprung from an immediate connexion with /z/ them . In judging from a narrow circle of observation , or from an imperfect experience , men are led to regard these as fortuitous affairs . Are they not rather brought about by unfailing and unchangeable causes From century to century , the sun pours forth his undiminished stores of light and h'eat ; the former , out of inorganic material , constructs molecules that are organized , and from them builds up the myriads of vegetable forms which are destined for supporting animal life ; the latter , controlling the movements of inorganic matter , divides into climates the earth 's surface , volatilizes water from the sea , sets the wind in motion , and directs the form , duration , and movement of the clouds . The primitive force which is at work , producing these vital and meteorological phenomena , undergoes no change in intensity from year to year ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . It is through this that the droughts of one country are contemporaneous with the abundant showers of another the famine which threatens one place is compensated by harvests in another . As natural laws were never meant for operation on individuals , but for action on systems and masses , incidental vicissitudes , such as those of which we are speaking , should never guide us in our judgment of final results . Operating with an unerring certainty , and with an unchangeable force , the sun carries on his plastic works , as the earth , in her daily rotations , submits herself to his beams . From this it comes to pass , that though there may be variations in the lot of particular nations or particular individuals , the common interests of all are protected , the common rights of all are upheld . From the very beginning of things , every class of variation has been determined where particular climates shall fall , where particular temperatures shall be observed , what shall be the speed of vegetable growth , what tribes of animals shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the most striking results of organic chemistry is the relationship which it discovers between animals and plants ; the former constituting an apparatus for oxydation , the latter an apparatus for deoxydation . Compared together , a relation of antagonism exists between them . Plants , from inorganic matter , construct their various tissues and parts ; these are consumed by animals , and forced back into the inorganic state . It is therefore plain that the sun is the great formative agent , and animals are the destroyers . If we consider the successive races of organized beings , beginning from the lowest and passing to the higher tribes , it would seem as if the general idea under which Nature has been acting is , that as the more complex structures were evolved to emancipate them from the direct control of external physical forces . The vegetable kingdom , unendued with locomotive powers , deriving its existence directly from external agents , is completely under their control . If the summer is too brilliant , or rains do not fall , a plant withers and dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals have their existence determined by the action of physical causes ; if these be favourable , they flourish ; if unfavourable , they must submit to an inevitable lot . To tribes that are higher , to a certain extent , the rigour of these laws is remitted , and a certain amount of independence secured ; the African lion can retire to a shade in the middle of the day ; yet still he is held in a state of subjection , and instinctively submits to the operation of an overruling power , and is kept to the sands of his desert from cool and temperate climates . The sunbeam is his chain . In man alone the emanci- /z/ pation is complete ; for into his hand Nature has committed a control of the imponderable principles . It matters not whether it be in the torrid zone or in the frigid , he tempers the seasons by his intellectual - power ; he resorts to every artifice of clothing , or to the warmth of fire ; he dissipates the natural darkness by artificial light . Developed by civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if the harvests of his own country have failed him , his hands have created commerce , which brings him an abundance from distant places . Unlike even those races which are next below him , and which instinctively aim at the result he so perfectly accomplishes , he does not wait upon the gifts of Nature , but compels her to minister to him . When they are oppressed by hunger , whole tribes of fishes migrate in the sea , and innumerable flocks of birds direct their flight to distant countries ; but civilized man , without calling into action his own locomotive powers , puts his arm across the globe , and satisfies his wants . 39 . What , then , are the final impressions left upon our minds by these general considerations ? They teach us that life never occurs except in regions to which the imponderable agents can have access , an observation which is equally true of vegetable and of animal forms ; that elementary organization directly or indirectly arises from the plastic agency of those all-pervading forces . Whether we consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in incessant changes changes which result from the fixed operation of invariable laws ; that , of the successive tribes of beings which have peopled our earth , each series may be regarded as expressing the general relation of all physical agents at the time of its existence , the brilliancy of the sun , the pressure of the air , and other such conditions ; for we see that , between those conditions and the organization of the structures considered , there are fixed relations ; that in the more highly complicated forms of beings , mutations more readily take place , and in all , time enters as an element ; that in the same way that whole races have disappeared from the face of the earth , and have become extinct , so , also , do individuals die and atoms change ; that , whatever motion is accomplished , or whatever change is brought about , there is a consumption of material or an expenditure of force ; that , as the surface of the earth is continually remodelled by physical agents , so are the vicissitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bring about physical ends . The passage of a comet , never more to return , in a hyperbolic orbit past the sun , is a result of the same general law that keeps a planet revolving in repeated circles the extinctions of races which have heretofore taken place , or which are going on before us , are not brought about by a direct intervention of supernumerary forces , but are the constant result of those which are always in action . If , moreover , our thoughts are directed to the relations which exist between climates and the character of races , the distribution of vegetables and animals ; if we observe the antagonization of these great classes in the result of their vital processes , their position as respects the atmosphere , the control which astronomical events possess over everything , the action which currents in the air or currents in the sea exercise over the distribution of animated forms , and even over the well-being of man , we surely shall have but little difficulty in understanding that , as in the inorganic world , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which natural philosophers and chemists recognise are constantly employed . /z/ CONTENTS : The Growth of Conferva in Water .

IF we expose some spring water to the sunshine , though it may have been clear and transparent at first , it presently begins to assume a greenish tint , and , after a while , flocks of green matter collect on the sides of the vessel in which it is contained . On these flocks , whenever the sun is shining , bubbles of gas may be seen , which , if collected , prove to be a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen , the proportion of the two being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new parts , as they are developed , being all day long covered with air-bells , which disappear as soon as the sun is set . If these observations be made on a stream of water , the current of which runs slowly , it will be discovered that the green matter serves as food for thousands of aquatic insects , which make their habitations in it . These insects are endued with powers of rapid locomotion , and possess a highly-organized structure ; in their turn , they fall a prey to the fishes which frequent such streams . Organic chemistry teaches that it is the office of vegetable life to form from inorganic matter organized molecules , and furnish them as food for the support of animals , which simply assimilate , but do not fabricate ; we must , therefore , infer that the fibrine , the albumen , the gelatine , the fat , and whatever else of those compound organic molecules is required for the support of fishes and insects , are originally formed by the action of light on that green matter . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coincident actions . The sunlight is the agent which directs its growth , but it does not so plainly appear what is the body from which it originally springs , and on which the light exerts its influence ; whether it comes from microscopic germs which , floating about in the air , find their way into every water , or /z/ from organic cells furnished from obscure sources . The process once begun , goes on with uniformity and rapidity so long as external circumstances are favourable . Some of the chemists of the last century asserted that no organic nucleus was required , and that , on putting such bodies as spun glass or amianthus into a vessel of water , on exposure to light , those fibres would become covered with bubbles , and the water would begin to turn green . But I have found that these are experiments which do not succeed except under circumstances where there is every reason to suspect the incidental introduction of organic matter . COUNT RUMFORD has stated that yellow silk , in an unspun state , as it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oxygen under the influence of light . It is probable , however , that here , as in the former cases , some specific organic matter has been introduced , for the result very often can not be obtained . 41 . Similar green flocks to those of which we here speak are also found on the surfaces of rocks exposed to the sea , damp walls , and other places where there is a constant moisture . They belong to the algae or sea-weed tribe of botanists . The confervse are thus described by Professor LINDLEY : " They consist of filaments , generally simple , and are formed of two tubes , of which one , which is exterior and transparent , offers no trace of organization to the most powerful eye , so that it might be called a tube of glass , contains an inner articulated filament , filled with colouring water often almost imperceptible , but at other times a very intense green , purple , or yellow colour . " 42 . Admitting the existence of some objective germ , or sporule , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to give a pretty clear account of the process of evolution of the green matter . When pure water is freely exposed to atmospheric air , in consequence of the quality exhibited by all substances ( Ap. , 75 ) of diffusing into the interstices of each other , there begin to pass into it the different gaseous bodies which have access to it . These do not all pass with the same facility , nor are they taken up to the same amount . The relative quantity of each follows the order of its solubility . Of the three gases to which our attention must be directed in the phenomenon we are now considering , oxygen , nitrogen , and carbonic acid , carbonic acid passes into the water with the greatest speed , oxygen next , and nitrogen much more slowly ( Ap. , 54-63 ) . When a state of equilibrium , therefore , has been attained , it will be discovered that the pure water has become contaminated by the presence of these different gases , and that they exist in it to an amount represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river water , therefore , naturally contain these different gaseous substances , which are intimately connected with the production of green matter . Indeed , from the very mode in which rivers and springs are fed , the solution of gaseous matter in them is completely secured . By the action of solar heat , vapours are raised from the sea , and ascending to the more elevated and cooler regions , give out their latent heat , and condense into vesicles or microscopic drops , the aggregate of which forms a mist or cloud . In this state of excessive subdivision , the drops are brought into a perfect contact with the air , and an absorption of its constituents takes place . To give still greater security , the drops of rain , which are nothing more than those vesicles coalesced , as they come down from the sky pass through the subjacent aerial strata , and AMOUNT OF WATER-GAS DETERMINED BY HEAT . j 7 withdraw as much gas as they can hold . From rains which thus take place and fall on elevated regions , springs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been obtained from the atmosphere . 44 . This water-gas , as it might be termed , may be expelled entirely from water by boiling , and by resorting to that process a knowledge of its constitution has been obtained ( Ap. , 93 ) . The power by which liquids hold gaseous substances in solution is diminished by heat , and as soon as a liquid boils all extraneous gas is carried away , because , under those circumstances , the vapour which is generated by the heat , passing in bubbles through the mass of the liquid , exposes itself to the contained extraneous gas , which diffuses rapidly into it , and escapes away when the bubbles burst on the top . The law of equilibrium of diffusing gases teaches us that this process can only end in the total removal of the contained air ( Ap. , 47 , 48 ) . Temperature thus controlling the quantity of gas dissolved in water , we can easily see that in different countries the relative amount of water-gas will differ , and that its mean quantity will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those seasons during which vegetable action is advancing most rapidly , that is , in spring and summer , its amount will be determined by the mean temperature of the spring and summer months . In tropical climates there should be less of this gas than in temperate , but in the use which is to be made of it for physiological purposes a compensating agency appears ; the poorer water of equatorial countries is acted on by a more brilliant ray . The light and heat of the sun here stand in the attitude of antagonizing forces . The calorific beams , by reason of their obliquity in the more polar countries , allow an increased quantity of gas to be dissolved in water ; the luminous beams which come with the same obliquity have therefore more to operate on . 45 . If saline matter be present , it acts as a disturbing agent ; for a liquid which is impregnated with salt has its solvent powers greatly diminished . Bulk for bulk , therefore , sea water must contain a less volume of gas than fresh water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water discharges many important functions . It is connected with the physiological operations both of the animal and vegetable world . Being twice as rich in oxygen as atmospheric air ( Ap. , 93 ) , it is destined to carry on the respiratory processes of those classes of animals whose form requires that their breathing apparatus should be of the most compendious figure , and which have to live in the water . Thus , in those fishes which breathe by branchiae , the processes of combustion which are to go on in their systems depend on a supply of the concentrated oxygen of water-gas . The fish swallows a mouthful of water , and then , by muscular contraction , drives it out past the gills , among the threadlike fibrillae in which venous blood is passing . Inter-transfusion in an instant takes place , oxygen from the water-gas flashes into the venous blood and arterializes it , carbonic acid simultaneously comes out , and , as the fish moves forward , is carried away in the current of water . 47 . A mass of water thus containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germ , or sporule , or objective point , on which the light can act , is exposed to the sun . As has been said , a bubble of gas soon makes its appearance , and growth , with a devel- /z/ opment of the green colour , takes place . If we examine the changes which are now occurring in the water , we find that the carbonic acid is disappearing , and oxygen and nitrogen are evolving . The growing mass increases in volume and weight . After a time , if proper measures are taken to cut off any farther supply of carbonic acid , the process conies to an end . But as conducted naturally , there is a free exposure to the atmosphere , from which the acid diffuses , and hence , as fast as its removal by decomposition takes place , new quantities are restored again . 48 . The direct action which is accomplished under the influence of the light is the total decomposition of the carbonic acid gas . Its oxygen is evolved , and its carbon goes to form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generality of chemical writers seems to be probable , that the carbon thus evolved , while it is yet in a nascent state , unites directly with the elements of water , and produces one of the starch family of bodies . But the constitution of the green matter is far from being so simple . Chemical examination , and considerations connected with the nutrition of the insects which feed on it , serve to show that it contains more hydrogen than is necessary to convert its oxygen into water . There is also nitrogen in it . 49 . In the air-bubbles which form and finally escape , we find not pure oxygen , as is generally supposed , but a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen gases . The source of the former is unquestionably to be referred to the decomposed carbonic acid . From the circumstance that in the growing mass there is an excess of hydrogen , and in the escaping air a large quantity of azote , it would seem that a compound having the same elements as ammonia has been acted upon . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or river water is far too small to furnish the supply which would be necessary . It seems , therefore , not improbable that the nitrogen naturally dissolved along with the carbonic acid and oxygen in the water is indirectly connected with the decomposition . 50 . The presence of carbon , and an excess of hydrogen in the green matter , proves that the sunshine has effected two different decompositions , the decomposition of carbonic acid and that of water . 51 . At this stage of the description , let us pause and review the facts which have presented themselves to us . We have arrived at the conclusion that all the solid material under consideration is produced from gaseous matter contained in water in a state of solution . This gaseous matter comes directly from the , atmosphere ; it contains the same constituents as the atmosphere , but differs from it in having them in a different proportion . We see , therefore , that there are , as it were , two atmospheres enveloping the earth 's surface ; one of these is the air which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , and in those streams and waters that are found on the surface of the ground . Between these a remarkable relation exists : in the common atmosphere the proportion of oxygen to nitrogen is nearly as one to four , in the water-atmosphere it is nearly as one to two . 52 . Between these two atmospheres , a constant connexion is established , through the chemical relations of water , which receives its gaseous contents from several different sources . Part of its carbonic acid it obtains by direct absorption from the superincumbent air , and part is given to it by the respiration of fishes and other aquatic ani- MODE OF DIFFUSION OF GASES INTO WATER . jg mals ; for animal life , though carried on beneath the surface of this liquid medium , has the same chemical object in view as when carried forward on the surface of the earth ; it ends in the conversion of carbon into carbonic acid , of hydrogen into water , and an evolution of heat . Its oxygen , in the same manner , has two sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the former instance , and a still more concentrated store in those little air-bells that cover the green vegetable matter as long as the sun is shining ; in these the volume of oxygen is , on an average , double that of the nitrogen . Upon them the water exerts its solvent powers , removes as much as it can carry away , and the bubble then floats to the top of the water , and escapes out into the air . From the same two sources nitrogen is also procured . With these abundant supplies , therefore , furnished partly from the vital changes which are taking place in its mass , and partly from the external air , the constitution of the water-atmosphere is kept up unimpaired. 53 . All the carbon which we thus find in the green matter comes from dissolved carbonic acid , all the hydrogen from water or ammonia ; the latter also furnishes a certain quantity of nitrogen , other portions of which are obtained , without any decomposition , from that which has been dissolved out of the atmosphere . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modelled on the same idea as in the case of life carried on in the air . In both cases , vegetables act as the great formative agents , and animals as the destructive power ; and in both , the source and origin of action is to be found in the beams of the sun . For nearly two centuries , physical science has fully admitted the agency of that central star as the great seat of mechanical force , which retains the different planets in their orbits . It is only of late years that we are beginning to recognise his agency as the author of organization and life , who lays up , with an almost provident foresight , in vegetable productions , stores of light and heat for the use of the animal world . The coal-fields which furnish us with fuel are the remains of primeval forests , among the branches of which birds nestled at night ; and the warmth that we receive from them , and the light that they give us , have been safely stored up for us for thousands of centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons cause the sea to shine with a phosphorescent light , derive their glow remotely from the vegetable kingdom ; and the fireflies , which , in such countless multitudes , on a summer evening in Virginia , make the grass and trees glitter with their intermitting beams , are only pouring forth again rays which once came from the sun . 54 . I have thus far considered the process of evolving green matter from a primitive cell or seed placed under water . It is now proper to generalize on these views , and to show that , so far from this being an insignificant case , it represents fully all that goes on in the vegetable tribes , whether they live under the water or in the air . Let us , therefore , proceed at once to investigate what takes place in the case of plants which are of a more complex character , and higher in the scale of creation . If a few garden seeds of any kind are sown in a flower-pot , and caused to germinate in a dark room , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain space in the absence of light ; their young leaves , if any should be put forth , are of a yellow or gray- white colour , and they soon fade away and die . But if these plants be brought out into the light , they /z/ presently begin to turn green , they unfold their leaves , and evolve their different parts in a natural way . From day to day their weight increases , and chemical analysis shows that they are fixing carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , and azote . If they be made to grow in confined glass vessels , under such circumstances that an examination can be instituted on the changes they are impressing on the atmosphere , it is discovered that they are constantly abstracting carbonic acid from it , and as long as the sun shines on them , or as long as they are exposed to bright daylight , they continue appropriating carbon and exhaling a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen . The continuance of their growth depends on a continued supply of the acid gas in due quantities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last century by PRIESTLEY , who found that when leaves of any kind are placed in water , which holds carbonic acid gas in solution , they evolve oxygen when in the sunshine . It is not pure oxygen , but a mixture of that gas with azote ( Ap. , 794 ) . It has been objected that no conclusion can be drawn from experiments conducted in this way in regard to vegetable functions , for a plant which is fitted to carry on its living processes in the atmosphere is placed in an unnatural condition when immersed in a vessel of water . But there is much less force in this objection than might at first sight appear . A leaf , exposed to the air , does not absorb and act upon carbonic acid gas as a gas ; its tissues and parts are saturated with water , which has been thrown up by the capillary force of the spongioles , or , on some occasions , obtained directly from the atmosphere by the beautiful process of nightly radiation to the sky , and corresponding precipitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the succulent structure , is the medium through which carbonic acid is absorbed and decomposed . In point of fact , therefore , though plants may live in air , their mode of discharging this function is the same as though they were living in water , for the absorptive force of that liquid is called into play , and carbonic acid is presented in a dissolved state , and the case , in reality , becomes nothing more than a repetition of what goes on when water-plants are digesting . In very many instances Nature takes extraordinary pains to secure a rapid supply of the acid . In water-plants , which are often fixed , reliance is had on currents which are established by variations of specific gravity , so as fast as one portion of water has approached to the place of decomposition and surrendered its gas , it is pressed away by those around , which are about to discharge the same duty . But in aerial plants , the digestive organ unfolds a broad surface to the atmosphere , and the calorific beams of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour are readily absorbed ; a warm current , which is easily established in a mobile fluid like air , rises rapidly ; and , as if this were not enough in multitudes of instances , the trembling leaves are set upon slender footstalks , which give way to every passing wind , and are thus continually brought into an extensive and ever-changing gaseous contact . It is scarcely possible to conceive a more simple and effective contrivance , or one which reaches more perfectly its destined end . To animals powers of locomotion are given , with a view of securing a possession of food ; at proper seasons the wild pigeon comes up from the southern countries , and instinctively flies thousands of miles ; and in the case of many beasts , to procure their prey seems to be a principal cause of movement . An animal , an oxydating machine , is driven by Nature to expend his powers of loco- /z/ motion , and go in search of his food ; a plant , a reducing apparatus , has a more delicate duty to perform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supply for all its wants . 55 . Under these circumstances , therefore , when leaves of aerial plants are placed in carbonated water in sunshine , we can , so long as their structure remains unimpaired , observe with a certain degree of correctness the phenomena which they would exhibit under more natural conditions . By botanists and the earlier writers on chemistry , the function discharged by the green parts of plants is often spoken of as a species of respiration , analogous , to a certain extent , to animal respiration . This mistake originated in those obscure physiological views of which the old doctrine of vitality was the prolific parent . Respiration is essentially an oxydizing process , a process of combustion , but the part which is played by a vegetable leaf is to obtain carbonaceous matter from air , and store it up in a solid form in its various strictures . This solid matter thus obtained is the very same which at an after period , entering the digestive organs of animals , is by them subjected to assimilatory processes , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is performed by those green parts is not , then , a respiratory action , but one of digestion . 56 . We have already said that leaves placed in spring water in sunshine evolve bubbles of gas . A direct sunshine is not , however , absolutely required ; the same experiment , if conducted with proper precautions , can be made to succeed with the diffused skylight . The bubbles , as they form , rise to the top of the water , and if collected and analyzed , yield , as in the case of water-plants , two substances , oxygen and nitrogen ; a little carbonic acid is always present , but that arises from the peculiar conditions under which the experiment is made ( Ap. , 794 ) . 57 . Thus , by the influence of the sunlight , organic matter is added to vegetable systems , the action being accompanied by a variety of chemical decompositions and interstitial diffusions . The substances arising are such as are necessary for the uses of the plant , and in order to distribute them to the requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the more highly organized plants , goes under the designation of the flow of the sap . The descending sap , like the arterial blood of animals , contains all the different compounds which are required by the organized structure .

IN the lower classes of plants , such as those of which we have been speaking , which carry forward absorbent processes on every part of their surface , the mechanism for nutrition and respiration is of the simplest character , and , as we shall hereafter see , is nothing more than a surface action ; imbibition , nutrition , and aeration all taking place upon the same point . But in any organized structure , as soon as types of centralization are adopted , and specific processes carried on in distant parts , the nutritious juice must necessarily pass from place to place , and undergo in its route proper chemical changes . In its movements it must flow along predetermined channels , and take in succession given directions . To accomplish this a circulatory apparatus is required , adapted in each instance , as to form and character , to each peculiar organism . In the higher classes of animal life , this process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood ; in plants , under the designation of the flow of the sap . 59 . There is that unity of plan in all the works of Nature which causes us at once to understand that in these various mechanisms the same physical principles are resorted to ; that the flow of the sap and the circulation of the blood are due to the same powers . A theory of such movements , therefore , can only be true when the principles which it involves give at once a clear account of every case , of the flow in plants and in animals , and even in every individual instance in each of these great classes of organized beings . Such a theory should be applicable to the movements in flowering plants , and to all its various modifications in the less complicated orders of vegetable life ; for each particular instance it should show why specific apparatus is required , and /z/ why , in cryptogamous plants , none whatever is necessary ; it should show , among the varieties of animal races , why this or that mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why in fishes the aorta resembles in mechanism the portal vein of the mammalia . In those more elevated tribes whose functions require that several circulations should be simultaneously carried on , it should give a clear account of the mechanism for them , whether they be systemic , pulmonary , or portal . The character of a true theory is its extensive and clear application - to all individual cases . 60 . In this and the following chapter , I propose to explain what appear to be the true mechanical principles of the general circulation of organized beings . For some years past I have taught these doctrines to the medical classes of this University , though until now they have not appeared in print . Founded as they are on principles strictly physical , they form an important portion of the views set forth in this work . If among plants light is the great agent of organization , electricity is the great motive force , which , under a specific modification , determines the movements of nutritious juices . The imponderable agents are the vital principle of organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines here given apply to all cases ; they are also in harmony with physiological knowledge . They embrace not only the vegetable and animal world , but the specific instances in each . In individual cases , they give an account of the mechanism of the various circulations , whether they be systemic , pulmonary , or portal . They also will be found to apply to those abnormal cases which arise in disease , and offer an exact prediction of what should take place in inflammation and asphyxia. 62 . First , therefore , let us take up the consideration of the circulation of the sap in flowering plants , and show the physical conditions on which it depends . In the following chapter we shall apply the same principles to the circulation of the blood . 63 . Early in the spring , in the'Southern States , the farmers plant their corn the Zea mays . In the course of some days , if the weather is warm and favourable , the seed begins to germinate , and presently the young plant appears above the soil . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , the radicles begin to extend themselves , and growth rapidly sets in . In a few weeks the plant has risen to an altitude of several feet , and exposes its large green leaves to the sun . By the end of July , or the middle of August , its maximum height is attained , and , under favourable circumstances of culture and season , so great is that height , that a man on horseback can not touch the tassel which adorns the top of the plant with a walking-stick . All this enormous evolution of organized structure has , in the course of a few days or weeks , originated from a seed buried in the ground a seed which weighed but a few grains . 64 . From the roots to the top of the plant , large quantities of fluid are constantly passing , and large quantities are thrown off from the leaves by evaporation . All this water is obtained entirely from the soil , and all the carbonaceous matter which constitutes the solid part is derived from the atmosphere ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air in showers of rain or drops of dew , we are justified in saying that this immense mass of organized matter is nothing more than a portion of the atmosphere , which has been condensed and fashioned in a few weeks by the agency of the imponderable principles . /z/ 65 . In those hot climates , the quantity of sap which flows in a short space of time through the vessels of such a plant is incredibly great . In the month of April , 1834 , 1 cut a vine , which was growing wild on the edge of a forest in Virginia , asunder with one blow of an axe ; the cut surface , which was about 1 inch in diameter , exhibited its open vessels , from which there poured out an uninterrupted stream of ascending sap . In the course of eight hours there was collected of this fluid seventy ounces , and this was probably a far less quantity than would have been raised under ordinary circumstances , where the leaves aided the spongioles by their exhausting and pushing action , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , in these warm climates processes of vegetation go on with extraordinary rapidity , and in summer , from the intense brilliancy of the sun and the high temperature , the midday assumes peculiarities which in colder climates are never witnessed . In the forests of those countries , at that hour , there reigns an unbroken silence , a period of complete repose . The wild dove , which all morning long has poured forth her plaintive note from the top of some withered pine , seeks for a shady covert , and plumes her feathers in the heat of the day ; the wanton squirrel forsakes his gambols , and retires to his nest ; the turtle dozes on the surface of the stagnant pools . There is not a cloud upon the sky , there is not a breath in the air . The sunbeams tremble upon the leaves , or sparkle upon the sand , or steal in long gleams of light across the water . A profound silence reigns among myriads of living things , inhabitants of those solitudes ; a silence only broken at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves , or the distant tap of the lazy red-headed woodpecker upon some hollow trunk . 66 . As we have said , if at the proper season of the year the stem of a plant be divided , ascending sap will copiously flow from the extremity of the stump . If , moreover , the part which has been cut off , and which bears the leaves , has its cut extremity immersed in a vessel of water , imbibition of that water will rapidly take place , and life be maintained for a time . From these facts , and others of a similar kind , botanists have had no difficulty in recognising two distinct sources of action concerned in the flow of the sap . They have shown that the spongioles or extremity of the roots , which apparently consist of a lax cellular or spongy tissue , have the quality of impelling the sap upward , and hence it flows from the extremity of a stem from which the upper part has been cut off . From the fact that a branch on which the leaves still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which its extremity is immersed , they have regarded those organs as possessing a kind of suction power , due to the evaporation which takes place under the influence of heat from their superficies . The spongioles , therefore , drive the sap upward , and the leaves , by their exhaustive effort , draw it . 67 . But this doctrine is essentially defective . It furnishes no reason for the downward flow of the sap ; none for the well-known fact that the exhausting action of the leaves is under the control of light . To a certain extent , it is true , an evaporation taking place from the leaves will conspire in its result with the movement of the ascending sap , but it must not be forgotten that it will also antagonize with the movement of that which is descending . That there are two seats of action in the phenomenon , the spongiole and the leaf , is quite true ; but its causes a : e very different from those gener- /z/ ally supposed . The action in the leaf and the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely an example of what takes place in the passage of arterial blood to the veins in the systemic circulation of the mammalia. 68 . It is not worth while to expend any space here in refuting the old explanations of these different circulatory movements , nor in detailing how , in the opinion of some physiologists , even in the most rigid vegetable stems , the juices are propelled by alternate dilatations and contractions of the woody tubes , much in the same manner as motions are executed by the dorsal vessels of certain animals . Nor need we describe how the vital principle that chimera of the Dark Ages , which has kept physiology in the rear of all other sciences can be brought to give one of its usual , and expeditious , and unsatisfactory accounts of the phenomenon . 69 . Without wasting time , therefore , on those futile explanations , let us pass at once to the philosophical principles which are involved , and show how the doctrines of common CAPILLARY ATTRACTION are capable of giving not only a comprehensive , but also a beautifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are found in flowering or in flowerless plants , in sponges , or in the mammalia. // takes its name from the circumstance , that if a glass tube of small diameter , or even as fine as a hair ( capillus ) , be immersed at one end in water , the water immediately rises above its true hydrostatic level to an altitude which is greater in proportion as the tube is smaller ; in tubes of very narrow diameter , such as those here referred to , an elevation of many inches is without any kind of difficulty obtained . Thus , iujig. 108 , if some water be placed in a cup or other vessel to the height A B , and there be plunged into this water glass tubes such as D , E , the water at once spontaneously rises in those tubes to a height which is greater in proportion as the tube is narrower . In E , therefore , it rises higher than in D. 71 . But this elevation from the true hydrostatic level only take place with certain liquids in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D and E , if quicksilver is used instead of water , so far from there being an elevation , there is an analogous depression . The liquid metal is forced down , as it were , beneath its proper level to a greater depth in proportion as the tube is narrower . And that this depends on the chemical relation which subsists between the liquid employed and the substance of which the tube consists , is clearly shown by smearing the interior of a glass tube with tallow or oil , and then immersing its end in water . The water , under these circumstances , so far from rising , is , like quicksilver , depressed . 72 . The physical law under which these elevations and depressions takes place is very simple , and important to be remembered . If a liquid can wet the surface of a solid , it will rise in a tube formed of that substance ; but if a liquid can not wet a solid , it will be depressed below its true level in a tube formed of that substance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube immersed in water , a tube of such diameter that it could cause the water to rise to the altitude of twelve inches , and the tube be broken off so that it is only six inches long . The theory of capillary attraction , and also direct experiment , show that under these circumstances the water will rise to the /z/ top of the tube , but will not jlow over , as one might perhaps have expected . In an ordinary capillary tube , therefore , nothing like a constant flow can take place , but the liquid having attained its highest possible elevation , remains there . 74 . That a continuous flow should take place , all that is necessary is , by any proper means , either by evaporation , chemical action , or other processes , to remove away the superficial portions of the elevated liquid when they stand at the extremity of the tube . An illustration will show how this is accomplished . The wick of a lamp is nothing more than an extensive system of capillary tubes , tubes which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common experience satisfies us , such a wick may be immersed in a reservoir of oil for months , or even years , without any sensible portion of that liquid being removed ; but if the lamp is lighted , the process of combustion dissipating the oil as fast as it reaches the upper portion of the wick , fresh quantities are furnished from beneath , and a continual flow takes place until all the oil is gone . So also in a spirit lamp , as long as the extinguisher is over the wick , and no evaporation of the alcohol can take place , there is no flow ; but the moment the extinguisher is removed , so that evaporation into the atmosphere can be accomplished , there is a constant upward flow until the alcohol is dissipated . These are results which have been long recognised . 75 . From these elementary considerations , therefore , it is clear , that although , in the ordinary use of a capillary tube , continuous movement along it is not witnessed , that movement readily sets in as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have used as illustrations , combustion in the one , and evaporation in the other , gave rise to a continuous motion . 76 . In the same way a variety of other ordinary causes may produce these movements . Suppose , . 109 , we had a vessel A , containing water , and another vessel B , containing alcohol , and between them a narrow capillary tube , C , passing . Let us farther suppose this tube C to be previously filled with water . At its extremity which opens into the vessel B , containing alcohol , it is clear that the water will be brought in contact with the alcohol , but in this liquid water is soluble ; and , therefore , as fast as that water can be presented , the alcohol will dissolve it , take it up , and remove it away . It is plain , therefore , that there will be a constant flow of water from the vessel A to the vessel B , a flow which arises from the circumstance that the water is dissolved from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the affinity of the alcohol for it . This/therefore , is nothing more than a repetition , under another form , of the cases already used above ( 74 ) as illustrations . 76 . But an attentive consideration of the facts will convince us that the affinity thus existing between the two liquids , and which thus gives rise to a flow from A to B , ought , after a short time , to cause portions of the alcohol to find their way through the water in the tube C , and present themselves in a certain quantity at its entrance into the vessel A ; there , in their turn , they are exposed at once to the pure water , which takes up and dissolves alcohol just in the same way that alcohol takes up and dissolves it . There must , therefore , be a constant flow of alcohol , from B to A , along the tube , for the very same reason that there is a simultaneously constant flow of water from A to B , in the contrary direction . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if two different liquids , which can dissolve one another , communicate through a tube which both can wet , both of them will flow through that tube contemporaneously , the one passing in one , and the other in the opposite direction ; and it is plain that all this is nothing more than a simple case of common capillary attraction . 78 . What happens through one will , under similar circumstances , happen through one hundred or any number of tubes . If , therefore , instead of a single tube C , a great number of tubes were made to communicate between A and B , they would all act alike , and through them the two liquids would simultaneously pass in opposite directions . 79 . It is also obvious that the shorter we make the tube C , or the supposed collection of tubes , the more readily will the flow take place , because the vessels A and B are then made to communicate through a shorter obstacle . If , therefore , we take a box , A , fig. 110 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as a piece of paper , or bladder , or porous earthenware , &c.,; which substances may be regarded as consisting of a congeries of very short tubes , their pores answering to such short tubes , and in the compartment A place water , and in B alcohol , through the intervening barrier interchange will take place ; and if there be no leakage , and one liquid passes more rapidly in its course than the other , not only will the interchange we have been describing take place , but there will be also an accumulation of liquid on one side of the barrier C , and a diminution of it on the other . 80 . All this is irrespective of the shape or form of the vessels , which may be cubical , or round , or of any other figure . The essential conditions for action are to have two liquids , which have an affinity for one another , placed on opposite sides of a pervious obstacle or porous barrier , which both of them can wet . Movement will then take place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly than the other , there will be an accumulation on that side of the barrier to which it goes , and a deficiency on the other . 81 . M. DUTROCHET took a bladder , and , filling it with alcohol , tied the mouth of it tightly , so that none of the liquid could escape . He then placed it in a vessel of water , and found that the alcohol came out of the bladder into the water , and the water passed through the bladder into the alcohol , and , inasmuch as the water flowed more rapidly than the alcohol , there was a constant accumulation within the bladder , distending it ; an accumulation taking place with sufficient force to burst it open , provided the experiment was continued long enough . 82 . To these phenomena M. DUTROCHET gave the name of Endosmose and Exosmose , the former in allusion to the current flowing inward , the latter to that flowing outward . Physiologists were pleased with these sonorous designations , which ever since have been used in the books . Some supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the remains of vitality still existing in it , arising from its organization . It is , however , as we have seen , one of the ordinary cases of common capillary attraction , with which the vital force has no more connexion than its kindred principle Phlogiston. 83 . The rise or depression of a liquid in a capillary tube is determined by its quali- /z/ ty of wetting or not wetting the surface of that tube . Of two liquids in a given tube , that will rise highest which will wet the tube most perfectly . And , therefore , we can see in these movements , that if two liquids be placed on opposite sides of a porous system , or at the opposite ends of a capillary tube , which is wetted by one more perfectly than by the other , that one which exerts the most energetic action will flow fastest . If a piece of bladder be soaked in water and in alcohol , it will be readily seen that the former acts more powerfully on it , giving it greater flexibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For these reasons , if a mixture of water and alcohol be tied up in a bladder , as is well known , the water will soak out and evaporate away , but the alcohol will be retained . And for the very same reason , when these two liquids are placed on opposite sides of such a porous body , the water moves fastest through it , as in the experiment of DUTROCHET ( 81 ) . 84 . From these simple principles we deduce the following important law important , because it gives us at once a clear explanation of the rise of sap in trees , and a beautiful exposition of the true cause of the circulation of the blood : When two different liquids are brought in contact in a porous solid , which is wetted by both , but by them , unequally , that one which has the greatest affinity for the solid , or which tcets it most perfectly , will pass most rapidly through it , and may even drive the other entirely before it . 85 . This passage is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ap. , 145 ) water will thus pass into alcohol through a pervious membrane with a force equal to the pressure of nearly two atmospheres . Nor is it alone between liquids that the phenomenon takes place ; it is exhibited also by gases . Here , again , the force with which the movement has been accomplished is surprisingly great . Sulphurous acid will pass ( Ap. , 158 ) into atmospheric air against a pressure of one hundred and ten pounds on the square inch , and sulphuretted hydrogen will move through a membrane with a force that is superior to a pressure of twenty-four atmospheres ( Ap. , 162 ) . As a mechanical agent , capillary attraction , therefore , is fully able to overcome any of the resistances which it has to encounter in elevating sap to the tops of the loftiest trees , or driving blood from the remotest parts of the largest animals . 86 . In the Appendix I have given ( CHAP . V. ) an account of the physical principles on which capillary attraction itself depends . It is needful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the evidence there brought forward , that it is nothing more than a manifestation of electricity , and that all capillary phenomena are cases of electrical attraction . If we take a piece of flat glass , and place it on the surface of some mercury , the glass is held to the metal with a considerable degree of force , so that it requires some exertion to separate them . When this is done , and the electric condition of the mercury and glass respectively examined , the one is found to be positively and the other negatively electrified . They must therefore attract each other ( Ap. , 116 ) ; and it is owing to this electric excitement , which always takes place upon the contact of bodies , that all the phenomena of capillary attraction are due . Thus , if two pieces of plate glass are brought in contact , they are found to cohere , because the one is positive and the other negative , /z/ as may be proved by examining them with an electrometer . Even in those cases in which attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles apply- Two leaden bullets , which have been brought ( Ap. , 12G ) into contact with one another , cohere strongly , but we are not able to show the development of the separate electricities on each , because of their high conducting power . So , too , when a piece of glass is laid on the surface of some water , and , on being lifted off , is carried to the electroscope , no development can be detected , and the reason is obvious , for there has been only an apparent , and not a true separation of the liquid and the glass from each other ; the particles of the liquid have been simply torn apart , and have not been separated from the glass . 87 . Referring , therefore , to that chapter for the proof that capillary attraction originates in electric disturbance , it is sufficient for our present purpose to remark , that it is therefore due to the very same cause as chemical affinity itself . The quality which liquids possess of wetting or not wetting the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication of the affinity which is between them . Quicksilver will not wet glass , because they have little affinity , but it will wet a surface of gold or of tin with facility , because its affinity for those bodies is energetic . These observations , which appear so simple , have very important applications ; the intensity of affinity between a given liquid and a solid with which it is brought in contact determines their capillary relations , and thereby determines , also , the phenomena of movement . No farther proof of this importance is , perhaps , required than the result to which we shall be presently led , that even in MAN the circulation of the Wood is caused by the oxydating action of that liquid on the solid structures with which it is brought in contact . 88 . Let us , therefore , finally remember that the explanation of the circulation of nutritious juices , both in the vegetable and the animal kingdom , rests upon this simple physical principle , that if two liquids communicate with one another in a capillary tube , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that tube or structure different chemical affinities , movement will ensue ; that liquid which has the most energetic affinity will move with the greatest velocity , and may even drive the other Jluid entirely before it ; that this is due to common capillary attraction , ichich , in its turn , is due to electric excitement . 89 . These things being understood , let us proceed now to apply our principle ( 84 ) to the cases in hand , and commence with giving the theory of the flow of sap in plants . 90 . The liquid of which the ascending sap is constituted is derived from the ground by the action of the spongioles , and consists of water holding in solution the different saline bodies which are necessary to the plant , along with carbonic acid , &c.; This compound fluid passes upward by the woody fibre and ducts of the alburnum , making its way to the leaf , on the upper surface of which , in common cases , a change in its chemical constitution occurs through the influence of the sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being a thin watery solution , becomes much concentrated , and gains the under face of the leaf . This elaborated sap , or latex , as it is frequently called , returns now to the bark , and descends through its cellular tissue and inter-cellular spaces , finding its way by the route of the medullary rays to all parts of /z/ the plant . During its descent the different vegetable principles necessary for the economy of the plant are removed from it , and a certain quantity goes down to the roots , partly to aid in their growth , and partly to throw new qualities of ascending sap into the tree . In this descent , the elaborated sap moves through a system of vessels which anastomose with one another , in the same manner as the capillary vessels of animals . These tubes go under the technical name of laticiferous tubes . 91 . We see , therefore , from this description , that there are two points of this circulation which require attentive consideration the spongiole and the leaf . The spongioles are nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been recently formed from portions of the descending sap , but that sap is itself a species of mucilaginous solution . Precisely , therefore , as water will pass through the tissue of a bladder , the interior of which is filled with gum-water , so will moisture from the ground flow through the spongiole . There is no difficulty in accounting for the rise of the ascending sap on the principles of capillary attraction , and , indeed , this is the explanation now generally received by vegetable physiologists. 92 . While , therefore , those philosophers have freely admitted the applicability of this principle , under the name of endosmosis , to the explanation of the ascent of the sap , they have attributed to it , as an aid , a force which conies into operation only in an incidental way . This is the exhausting action of the leaf . But it is probable that this force takes little or no part in the movement of the sap , for any tendency to a vacuum occurring in the leaves of a tree would cause those structures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rising fluid . It is true , that if we take ( 67 ) a branch covered with its foliage , and dip its cut extremity into water , imbibition of that water will rapidly take place ; but the phenomenon is certainly not due , as is ordinarily supposed by botanists , to the exhausting action of the leaf , but to a very different cause . The exhaustion is only an incidental affair . 93 . Guided now by the principle we have laid down ( 88 ) , let us predict what must be the necessary action of the leaf . The ascending sap , which we will suppose , for simplicity 's sake , to be water , rises to the upper face of the leaf . It there obtains carbonic acid gas from the air , of which the sunlight effects the decomposition , the resulting action being a change from water to a mucilaginous solution . In the tissue of the leaf we have , therefore , two fluids engaged , water and a mucilaginous solution ; and what must of necessity be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ( 84-88 ) , and force it back , along its proper vessels , into the stem . The imbibition , therefore , that we perceived when a branch is dipped in a vessel of water , docs not arise , as the botanists say , from evaporation taking place on the leaf , but it conies from the capillary reaction which is going on in the leaf between the water , which is then presented as ascending sap , and the mucilaginous solution which has been formed by the light of the sun . Evaporation , it is true , takes place , and comes into operation , as I have said , in an incidental way , but the proper force which gives origin to the whole phenomenon is the capillary action which is going on in the way just described . 94 . It is the imperfection of the principle on which they were relying- the exhausting action of the leaf that has caused botanists to look upon the descent of the sap /z/ as such a mysterious affair , for which they could offer no explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have explained the descent of the elaborated sap on visionary hypotheses , that it was alive , or had obtained some vital qualities . It had long been perceived that gravitation could have little or nothing to do with the motion , for the descending sap flows upward in a dependent branch . 95 . What , tEen , is the reason that the light of the sun controls the rapidity of imbibition the speed with which the ascending current comes ? Because it controls the amount of carbonic acid gas which is reduced , and , therefore , the amount of elaborated sap that is formed . Why is it that the flow from the roots diminishes when changes are befalling the leaves , and why does it stop in the winter 1 Because the mucilaginous solution which is made by the light diminishes in quantity , or ceases to be formed altogether . How is it that , when parts are rapidly developing , the latex moves fastest , and the ascending sap comes with most force ? Because the consumption and the consequent formation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see , therefore , that the two sources of force in a flowering plant , the spongiole and the leaf , derive their power from ordinary physical principles . And these considerations also furnish us with another instance of that unity of plan so often met with in the works of Nature ; the same law which determines the action of the spongiole determines also the action of the leaf . The same idea is concerned in throwing the sap upward into the stem , and forcing it down again from the leaf . And the rays of the sun , which , by forming that mucilaginous body , gives rise to these concurrent and harmonious actions , equally set in operation the tissues of the leaf which is freely exposed to their influence , and the absorbing mechanism of the spongiole , which is buried , perhaps , many feet deep in the ground . 97 . Whatever has been here said respecting the movements of the nutritious juice in exogenous plants , applies also to the case of endogens , the essential mechanism being the same in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the researches of comparative anatomists , that the presence of a circulating machinery is determined by the centralization of the nutritive and respiratory apparatus . In exogenous and endogenous plants , from the circumstance that the liquid and solid material are introduced at distant points , the one through the root , the other through the leaf , channels of communication from one to the other , and , indeed , to every part , are required , and hence the introduction of a circulatory apparatus . In lower tribes of vegetable life , where this separation of function does not exist , the circulatory mechanism is correspondingly absent ; the sea-weeds absorb on their whole surface , and nutrition is directly carried forward at the points of reception . In lichens there is the first appearance of a transfusory mechanism , arising from the circumstance that on those parts which are shaded from the light absorption most rapidly takes place ; here , probably , however , the channels of movement are the interspaces between the cells , and the cause , simple capillary attraction . In mushrooms there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed in the higher plants , for in them the rootlets absorb nutrient matter from the soil , from which it passes , by capillary action , to every part of the system . /z/ 99 . Thus , in the vegetable world , if we commence our examination with the lowest orders of cellular plants , and pass successively through the mosses and ferns to the flowering plants , we see the same physical cause in constant operation . They all obtain their liquid and their solid food through the agency of capillary attraction the former from the soil , and the latter , in higher tribes , from the air . It is , moreover , in virtue of its action as a capillary mass , that the ground becomes uniformly moist ; and hence , through the operation of the same power , fluid matter is first brought to the plant , and then distributed through it . It is in virtue of its capillary diffusion through atmospheric air that carbonic acid gas is brought in contact with the leaves ; and when there reduced , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growing parts . Of the energy of this force there is abundant evidence , not only that it can cause the gradual percolation of juices through small structures , such as the minutest moss , but also lift the sap to the tops of the highest forest trees , and , indeed , far higher were it necessary , and drive it back again to the roots , irrespective of the agency of gravity . Even gaseous substances , as is shown experimentally in the Appendix ( Cn . XL ) , pass into one another with a force greater than the pressure of a column of water seven hundred feet high ; so that , to elevate the sap in a tree , or to drive the blood in an animal , is an insignificant demand on the energy which this force could put forth . 100 . In conclusion , we here again remark the influence which the imponderable principles exert in directing all kinds of movements on the surface of our globe . The sap rises in a tree because the sun shines ; it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in plants . Indirectly , it is true , chemical affinities or electrical agencies are brought into operation , but the prime mover of the machine is the light , which produces a mucilaginous body , which is different in composition in different plants , and which constitutes their proper juices . 101 . The cause of the movement of the sap in Jlowerin g plants both of the rise of the crude sap upward , and of the descent of the elaborated sap downward is the light of the sun , which effects the decomposition of carbonic acid gcs. /z/ ON IKE TtiCHANICAL CAUSE OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD .

LET us now proceed to inquire how the physical principles which have guided us , in the preceding chapter , in determining the cause of the flow of sap , apply to the more interesting case of the circulation of the blood in the higher animals . 103 . The popular explanation which is given of the circulation of the blood in man , refers to the heart as the prime mover of the mechanism . This central organ of impulse is devoted to a double purpose . It has to throw the blood through the channel of the arteries to every part of the system , and , receiving it back again by the veins , has to throw it to the lungs , in which it must be submitted to the vivifying influence of the air before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the general purposes of the economy . In order to enable it to discharge this task , it is furnished with an appropriate valvular and tubular arrangement , and , at specific periods , contracts and dilates , for the purpose of ejecting or sucking up the circulating liquid . In the opinion of the older physiologists , these periodic motions take place either directly , for the reason that the heart is alive , or , as some of them have supposed , through the mysterious agency of the cerebro-spinal axis . 104 . The blood , thus alternately driven from and drawn to this centre of action , is , in this view , a living fluid , possessed of a great many extraordinary properties . A portion of it extracted from the system by any of the ordinary processes of phlebotomy , soon coagulates and , dies . In what this change consists , this distinction between the living and dead blood , does not so plainly appear . Moreover , the ancient physiologists imputed a variety of other equally important offices to the heart ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as love , and held it accountable for the various deeds in which its possessor was concerned , a moral accountability for good and evil . These philosophical doctrines have , to a certain extent , become interwoven in common speech , and we now often use them without attaching any strict signification to them . Anatomical and me- /z/ chanical considerations might , perhaps , lead us to infer that these ancient views are not altogether correct . There does not seem much consonance between mitral , tricuspid , and semilunar valves , and affections or passions , or the responsibilities for good and evil . A pump may be a very curious and ingenious piece of mechanism , but surely we can not regard it as a morally accountable agent . 105 . For such reasons , therefore , modern physiologists are disposed to cast aside altogether these ancient views , and look upon the heart as an ordinary but beautiful specimen of hydraulic contrivance , in the same way as they look upon the eye as an optical apparatus . 106 . In man there are three prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Portal . It is necessary that we should understand the nature of each . 1st . THE SYSTEMIC . Arterial blood , which has been brought from the lungs by the pulmonary veins into the left auricle , is forced by its contraction into the left ventricle , the contraction of which drives it into the aorta . By this it is distributed to all parts of the system , the arrangement of arterial tubes becoming smaller and smaller in diameter until they degenerate into mere capillaries , from which it finds its way into the ascending and descending vena cava , the terminal tubelets of which collect it , and k is returned to the heart by the right auricle during its dilatation . In the systemic circulation , therefore , the blood leaves the left ventricle as arterial blood , is finally distributed by the capillary arteries , undergoes , on its passage into the capillary veins , a chemical change , gives off oxygen , from being bright red it turns dark , and , becoming venous blood , is then brought back to the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The venous blood , thus brought to the right auricle , is forced into the right ventricle when the auricle contracts . A similar contraction of the right ventricle now forces it into the pulmonary arteries , by which it is distributed upon the air-cells of the lungs ; here a chemical change takes place ; from being dark venous blood , it becomes bright red arterial , and , being collected by the pulmonary veins , returns , finally , to the left auricle of the heart . In the pulmonary circulation , therefore , the blood leaves the right ventricle for the lungs , undergoes in them a change , giving off carbonic acid , and then returns to the left auricle. 3d . THE PORTAL . The portal vein collecting blood from the chylopoietic viscera , distributes it to the liver . This blood there mingles with that which has been derived from the hepatic artery , and which has already been deoxydized in that organ . From this portal blood , bile is secreted and passed into the biliary tubes . The changed blood is now collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is transmitted to the ascending vena cava . The portal circulation is , therefore , apparently not connected with any central organ of impulse . It commences in a capillary system , and terminates in a capillary system . There is no hydraulic mechanism for the purpose of determining a current . 107 . Of these different varieties of circulation , let us now select one , and show that the principles we have employed in describing the flow of sap both upward and downward , apply here also . Let us , therefore , confine for the present our considerations to /z/ the systemic circulation , and then proceed to show how the same principles bear on the other varieties also . For , as has already been remarked , it is essential for a true theory of these movements , not only to explain them in an isolated case , but also in every instance ; to explain not only the systemic , but also the pulmonary and the portal ; to explain not only the varieties of circulatory movement in one given individual , but also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in the scale of creation , or whether they belong to the animal or vegetable world . 108 . Let us , therefore , take as our guide the great principle laid down in the preceding chapter ( 84-88 ) , That if . two liquids communicate with one another in a capillary tube , or in a porous or parenchymatous structure , and have for that tube or structure different chemical affinities , movement will ensue ; that liquid which has the most energetic affinity will move with the greatest velocity , and may even drive the other liquid entirely before it . 109 . The arterial blood which moves along the various aortic branches , and is distributed to every part of the system , contains oxygen , which it has derived during its passage through the lungs . Its colour is crimson . As soon as it has reached its destination in the minute capillary vessels , it begins to carry on its proper process of oxydation , attacking in a measured way the various tissues through which it is flowing , burning out their effete carbonaceous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The direct result of this operation is an evolution of heat . But while this chemical change in the tissues is going forward , the arterial blood itself is also suffering a change in giving up its oxygen , which may be looked upon as its active principle , and gaining in exchange the results of the combustion . From being crimson , it turns dark ; from being arterial , it changes into venous blood . 110 . Let us farther confine our thoughts to what must take place in a single capillary tube , or in one small portion of a porous structure ; for whatever reasoning holds in this case , will also hold for any number of capillary tubes , or any mass of parenchymatous structure . On the arterial side of such a tube we have the crimson arterial blood ; on the venous side we have the dark venous blood two different fluids ; but what is the relation which obtains between each of these liquids , and the walls of the tube or the substance of the parenchyma in which they are placed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its oxygen , ready to burn out any carbon or hydrogen in its way , substances of which the tube or structure is composed , possesses an intense affinity for those structures , an affinity which is at last exhibited by its actual destruction of them ? The arterial blood , therefore , has an intense affinity for any of the tissues with which it is brought in contact . 111 . In the next place , how is it with the venous blood , which occupies the other extremity of the tube ? The affinities of the oxygenized the arterial blood have been satisfied ; it has effected the combustion of the tissues through which it has gone , it has changed into inert venous blood . From being red , it has turned dark . The very change which has come upon it , or which , rather , it has undergone , is sufficient to assure us that , so far as its chemical affinities for the surrounding structures are concerned , those affinities are at an end . The venous blood , therefore , has little affinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contact . /z/ 112 . To the mind of a chemist , the relation which exists between arterial and venous blood and the soft solids of the animal body may be very forcibly impressed by these considerations . Regarding the blood itself as a mere vehicle for the introduction of oxygen , and the carrying away of carbonic acid and water , and remembering that the substances of the tissues acted upon are chiefly carbon and hydrogen , our final estimate of the relation of arterial and venous blood respectively to those tissues comes to this the affinity of arterial blood is expressed by the affinity of oxygen for carbon and hydrogen ; the affinity of venous blood by that of carbonic acid for carbon , and of water for hydrogen . Compared together , therefore , the former is the representative of a highly energetic force , which in the latter is diminished down to zero . 113 . Now what is the phenomena which our general principle ( 108 ) predicts , as arising under these circumstances ? Simply this , that the arterial will drive the venous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . 114 . The oxygenizing action of the arterial blood is , therefore , the true cause of the systemic circulation . 115 . In the systemic circulation , upon these principles , the flow must be from the artery to the vein . 116 . The pulmonary circulation next presents itself . In this , as we have described ( 106 ) , there is a certain chemical change going on , the consideration of which gives us the cause of the movement . We have seen that the motive force of the systemic circulation arises from the deoxydation of arterial blood ( 114 ) . How is it with the pulmonary ? We have here venous blood presenting itself on the air-cells , no longer presenting itself to carbonaceous or hydrogenous atoms , such as constitute the soft solids , but presenting itself to atmospheric air , or , more truly , to oxygen gas itself , which , being the more absorbable of the constituents of the air , is taken up and held in solution by the moist walls of the air-cells . Under these circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is precisely the converse of the former ; in that the arterial blood had an intense affinity for the carbonaceous substances with which it was brought in contact , and the venous none . In this , the venous blood has a corresponding intense affinity for the oxygen which is dissolved in the tissues with which it is in contact , and the arterial blood has none . Movement again must ensue , but as the conditions of the affinity are reversed , so also is the direction of the motion , for now the venous blood drives the arterial before it , and drives it with an inexpressible force to the heart . 117 . The pulmonary circulation is , therefore , due to the oxydation of the venous blood . 118 . The direction of the pulmonary circulation ought to be from the venous to the arterial side . 119 . Had we , therefore , known nothing of the circulation in the higher order of animals , but been instructed in the chemical relations of the blood to the soft tissues and atmospheric air , we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that circulation , and shown what its direction in different organs must be . 120 . It may strike those who are not familiar with physiological facts , that in these /z/ descriptions a most important omission is made the omission of the action of the heart , an organ plainly connected by position and mechanism with the phenomena we have under consideration . 121 . Physiologists have long seen , in opposition to the popular opinion , that the heart can only exert a very subsidiary action . Plants are wholly destitute of such an organ , yet their juices circulate , and there are multitudes of animals which are in the same predicament . In insects , for example , for reasons for which we can give on these principles a clear explanation , no such central organ of impulse appears . In fishes , the systemic circulation is carried on without a heart , and in cold-blooded animals movement in the capillaries takes place after the heart has been cut out . Even in man , after death , the arterial tubes are found for the most part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened through any possible agency of the heart itself , but meets with a very ready explanation upon the principles we have been giving . In the case of acardiac monsters , also , which are not uncommon , the absence of a heart seems to have exerted little agency on development and growth . Moreover , when we inquire into the condition of the circulation in the earliest periods of existence , we find that , far from the heart being the first to appear as a central point , and its various vessels to branch forth from it , the vessels themselves are the first to appear , and the heart , then , is subsequently developed . 122 . What , then , is the true office of the heart ? How is it that it comes to form so essential a portion of this mechanism I Had the CREATOR predetermined that in the construction of the circulatory apparatus of man no organ of the kind should be employed , let us consider the final difficulties which must have arisen . The systemic circulation originates in the deoxydation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can conceive that advantage might have been taken of the excess of mechanical force arising at the points where these chemical changes were going on , for that model was successfully followed in the systemic circulation of fishes ; but in the case of animals which do not live in the sea , but breathe atmospheric air , there are serious difficulties in the way . It is very apparent that there is no necessary connexion between the chemical changes taking place in the lungs and those taking place in the system . The rate of oxydation in the lungs depends on a variety of causes , and the rate of deoxydation is also determined by its own proper causes . There is no necessary connexion between them ; and if , on either of these points of change , an excess of action took place , the result of it must have been a disturbance of the equilibrium of the whole circulation . At some central point , therefore , the current going to the respiratory machine and that going to the system must be intercepted and intercepted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the movements of the one to the movements of the other . In animal structures , motions of this kind are universally accomplished by the help of muscular contractions , and hence arose the idea of a heart , which , by periodic muscular contractions , should serve to adjust the flowing currents to one another , and prevent engorgements or deficiencies in any part of the route taking place . 123 . From this arrangement , also , another important advantage arose . The arterial and venous tubes in the neighbourhood of the heart attain a considerable diameter . /z/ From this circumstance , they require some arrangement by which they can be filled or emptied . The auricles of the heart relieve all their corresponding veins , to a very great extent , from pressure ; the ventricles serve , in their turn , to fill thoroughly the aorta and the pulmonary artery . 124 . In the last place , let us turn to the portal circulation , and show how , in it , the same physical principles apply . The blood which flows towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that vein from the chylopoietic viscera ; it has , therefore , the same relation to the blood furnished from the different and corresponding aortic branches as has the general systemic venous blood . The arterial blood , therefore , drives it before it , in the same way that the general systemic circulation takes place , and , passing along the portal vein , it is now distributed to the liver . In this organ it also receives the blood which has been brought by the hepatic artery , and which has served for the purposes of the liver . t 125 . The process of biliary secretion now takes place , and compounds of carbon and hydrogen along with soda are separated as bile , and pass along the biliary tubes . In its final effect , therefore , the chemical action of the liver closely resembles the chemical action of the lungs . Compared with the resulting blood which passes along the branches of the hepatic veins , and finds its way into the ascending vena cava , the portal blood differs by containing the elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive the portal blood out of the liver into the ascending cava . Let us consider them in succession . 1st . The blood which is coming along the capillary portal veins , and that which is receding by the hepatic veins , compared together , as to their affinities for the structure of the liver , obviously have this relation ; the portal blood is acted upon bv the liver , and there is separated from it the constituents of the bile ; the affinities which have been at work in producing this result have all been satisfied , and the residual blood , over which the liver can exert no action , constitutes that which passes into the hepatic veins . Between the portal blood and the structure of the liver there is an energetic affinity , betrayed by the circumstance that a chemical decomposition takes place , and bile is separated ; and that change completed , the residue , which is no longer acted on , forms the venous blood of the hepatic veins . In the same manner , therefore , that in the systemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , becomes deoxydized in consequence of an affinity between its elements and those of the structures with which it is brought in contact , and drives the inert venous blood before it , so , too , in the portal circulation , in consequence of the chemical affinities and reactions which obtain between the portal blood and the substance of the liver affinities and reactions which are expressed by the separation of the bile that blood drives before it the inert blood which is found in the hepatic veins. 2d . But in the liver there is a second agency at work , which , conspiring in its resultant with the former , produces motion in the same direction . As we have said , the blood of the hepatic artery , after serving for the economic purposes of the liver , is thrown into the portal plexus . Hence arises a second force . The pressure of the arterial blood in the hepatic capillaries upon this , is sufficient not only to impel it into /z/ the capillaries of the portal veins , but also to give it a pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure which arises between the arterial blood of the hepatic and its corresponding venous blood , must give rise to motion towards the hepatic veins ; no regurgitation can take place backward through the portal vein upon the blood arriving from the chylopoietic viscera , because along that channel there is a pressure propagated in the opposite direction , arising from the arterial blood of the aortic branches . The pressure , therefore , arising from the relations of the hepatic arterial blood , conspires with that arising from the pressure of the portal blood , and both together join in giving rise to motion towards the ascending cava. 127 . So great are the forces which arise under these circumstances , that there is no doubt that the blood of the hepatic artery alone could , of itself , control the circulation of the liver without any re-enforcing aid from the portal blood . So when , from accident or otherwise , the portal vein is shut , or when from malformation it opens directly into the ascending cava , the hepatic artery takes charge of the functions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These views , therefore , lead us to understand that there are three sources of force engaged , under normal circumstances , in directing the portal circulation . One of these is found in the aortic capillaries , when they are spread on the chylopoietic viscera , the mode of action being precisely analogous to that which obtains in the general systemic circulation . The other two are found in the liver itself ; the first is a pressure exerted by the portal blood on that of the hepatic veinlets ; the second by the blood of the hepatic artery , which , conspiring with the former , urges the resulting mixture along the hepatic veins into the ascending cava. 129 . I might now proceed to show with what clearness these doctrines explain the circulation of the blood in other tribes of life ; for example , in the case of the model which is adopted in fishes , the aorta of which has long ago been recognised as bearing a strong resemblance to the portal vein of the mammalia ; but , as throughout this chapter these latter have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to be offered farther by using their type of construction for illustration . To any one who reflects on the principles which have been laid down , there will arise no difficulty in explaining the mechanical causes of the circulation in any particular case , more especially if this plain precept is kept constantly in mind , that , for the , physical reasons which have been assigned ( 88 ) , a pressure will always be exerted in every one.of these , instances by the fluid which is ready to undergo a change upon that which has already undergone it ; a pressure which , as there is no force to resist it , will always give rise to motion in a direction from the changing to the changed fluid . 130 . As we have said , it is the character of a true theory to be applicable to all cases , and to render a clear account of every circumstance that may arise . A true theory is like a window of crystal glass , through which we can see all objects in their proper positions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are such as are near , or those that are at a distance ; no matter whether they are directly before us , or enter only obliquely into the field of view . A fictitious theory is like a Venitian blind , which has to be set in a certain position with respect to the observer , and only shows /z/ him objects for which it has been adjusted , and those in an unsatisfactory manner ; but if he moves to one side or to the other , or endeavours to see objects which are not directly in his way , his view is intercepted , or , perhaps , unless he makes a new adjustment , the light is shut out altogether . 131 . Let us , therefore , see how these chemical principles will apply when the system under consideration is no longer under normal conditions , but has passed into a state of disturbance or of disease . It is well known to physicians , from the phenomena of asphyxia , that whenever the admission of oxygen into the air-cells of the lungs is prevented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be renewed again on the readmission of that gas , provided it is within a short space of time , and recovery may and often does take place under these circumstances . What , now , is the cause of that asphyxiated condition ? why does the blood cease to flow ? The chemical theory of the circulation of the blood through the lungs , which I have just given , points to the oxydation of that blood as the very cause of its movement ( 116 ) . It is the pressure of the deoxydized upon the oxydized blood that drives the latter along the pulmonary veins to the heart . But should anything intervene to prevent that oxydation taking place , no pressure can arise , and , therefore , no movement can ensue ; the conditions for asphyxia are all present ; conditions which , however , are removed so soon as oxydation can be reaccomplished ; then movement once more takes place , and a natural state is restored . If any evidence were required to show how little influence the heart possesses in controlling the pulmonary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood , it may be derived from the phenomena of asphyxia. 132 . As another illustration , we may here bring forward and explain the fact , well known to physiologists , that if the trachea be obstructed so that oxygen is restrained from passing into the lungs , and asphyxia is being induced , blood taken from any of the systemic arteries exhibits a venous aspect . What , now , does the chemical theory say should take place in the general circulation ? We are to remember ( 114 ) that the very cause of that circulation arises from the pressure of the oxydized arterial blood upon the deoxydized venous blood . Under the conditions supposed , we have interfered with the constitution of the arterial blood , and given it a venous character ; the conditions for pressure are , therefore , not accomplished , and no pressure takes place , and no flow from the arterial to the venous capillaries . Under these circumstances , the impulsive action of the left ventricle must be spent in an increased pressure on the walls of all its communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the walls of all the veins . As , in a steam-engine , any steady variation of motion is finally impressed upon the governor , which adjusts itself consentaneously ; so , in this case , the heart , which acts as a governor , accommodates itself to the changes going on . The left ventricle presently ceases in its violent effort to force the blood , and the pressure on the arterial walls abates . But , if the trachea is now relieved , oxydation of the blood goes on , pressure again takes place in the systemic capillaries , and the proper action is restored . 133 . These different facts , which might have been predicted from the theory that the deoxydation of arterial lilobd is the cause of the systemic circulation , have every /z/ one been experimentally determined by direct experiment by Dr. RF.ID ( Carpenter 's Human Phys. , p. 417 ) . 134 . We might now proceed to inquire what , on these chemical principles , ought to take place when a reverse action ensues , as when between the arterial blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up which lead to its more rapid deoxydation , and the concomitant evolution of heat ; conditions which are found in the various local inflammations . In these , by reason of an increased affinity between the soft tissues and the arterial blood , deoxydation and corresponding combustion more rapidly take place , with an abnormal elevation of temperature , and the flow of blood to the point of disturbance is increased . The old medical aphorism , " ubi irritatio ibi affluxus , " translated into the precise language of modern chemistry , simply means , to the point where its deoxydation is taking place , the arterial blood willjlaw. 135 . By the aid of the principles here laid down , all the various physiological or pathological conditions which are met with in inflammation , asphyxia , gangrene , &c.,; are presented as so many interesting chemical problems for solution . Such cases , also , as the non-asphyxiation of reptiles , the variable respiration and heat of insects , according as they are in motion or at rest , the results of death from lightning , afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the time has now arrived when the exact sciences are to come to the aid of physiology , no one can doubt . For many centuries past , a profitless system has been followed , the same system that formerly obtained in natural philosophy , and the uncertainties and doubts of medical science are the best proofs of its value . It is the ruling principle of this system to satisfy the inquirer for facts by the use of empty words , words which mean nothing and prove nothing . Life and vitality , with other sonorous epithets , figure away in these visionary speculations as though they were realities , and change their forms without reason or rule , as do the images that we see in dreams . /z/ CONTENTS : Modes of isolating the Coloured Rays .

Chemical Action on other Bodies . 136 . FROM the foregoing observations ( Ch . I. ) , we see that the primary formation of organized from inorganic matter is brought about by the agency of the sunbeam , either directly falling on the point of change , or received in an indirect way , as the diffused light of the sky or clouds ( 56 ) . /z/ 137 . In the sunbeam different principles exist , some of which are visible to the eye and others invisible . The conjoint action of the former communicates to us an impression of what we denominate white light . But in this white light there are rays endowed with the quality of exciting the sensations of colour , such as red , yellow , green , blue . We are required to determine which of these principles is concerned in the physiological change we are considering . It is necessary , therefore , to describe the SOLAR SPECTRUM . 138 . A beam of light coming into a room through an ordinary window is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles which are always floating in the air scatter the rays in all directions by reflexion , and enable them to operate on the eye . This light constitutes what is designated by optical writers as white light . To the ordinary acceptation of the term white , it does not . correspond ; it is the unchanged , unaffected light of the sun . 139 . A beam of light coming through the painted window of a cathedral falls on the ground , or on objects in its way , and communicates to them the various tints with which the glass has been stained . The brilliant colours which are thus developed by the action of the glass exist originally in the white light , and are made apparent by the absorptive action of the medium through which they have come , in a way which will be presently explained . 140 . There are also other modes by which , from white light , brilliant colours can be produced . Thus , transparent media , such as gems , cut into certain shapes and polished , when exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is these brilliant hues which give to the diamond its value as an article of female ornament . It is also in the same way that the angular pieces of glass which are strung upon chandeliers and around gas flames , emit in a brilliantly-lighted room so many fitful changes of colour . And in the same way also Nature exhibits to us that most beautiful of all meteorological phenomena , the rainbow , by refracting , reflecting , and dispersing the white light of the sun , and producing a regular display of colours . These colours , arranged as in the rainbow , may also be seen wherever a shower of drops of water is falling in a proper position as respects the spectator and the sun ; they are often , therefore , visible when fountains are playing ; often in the sea-spray , when it is cast ashore by a brisk wind ; often accompanying the bows of a steamboat which is moving rapidly through the water . 141 . There is a third mode by which , from white light , brilliant colours are produced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same manner that two sounds may be so situated with respect to each other as to destroy one another 's effect , and produce silence ; or , as two waves upon water , when the concavity of the one corresponds with the convexity of the other , destroy one another 's effect ; so may two rays or waves of light be placed , in respect of each other , that , instead of re-enforcing each other 's effect , they may produce darkness . This phenomenon , which in these different cases passes under the general designation of interference , under ordinary circumstances , in the case of light , is expressed by the production of brilliant colours . Such are the beautiful and almost metallic tints that are seen on the wing-cases of certain coleopterous insects , more especially certain beetles in the Southern States , which expose a /z/ glow of colours greens , yellows , blues , and reds as they change their position . So , too , the beautiful display which is seen on the breast of the wild dove , and still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of these colours , and of the colours of light generally , was first discovered by Sir ISAAC NEWTON , who , in his investigations , followed the second of the methods here mentioned , the production of colour by refraction . Of late years , the attention of philosophers has been much turned to the third method , that of interference ; this , as will be presently seen , possesses , in particular cases , very great advantages over that by refraction ( 140 ) , or the first one , by absorption ( 139 ) . // be briefly described , as follows : Let a beam of light coming from the sun ( s , Jig . Ill ) pass through a circular hole ( a Z ) in the shutter of a dark room , and fall upon a piece of glass cut into the form of a triangular prism , c d e , placed as in the figure . On the farther side of the prism let there be a sheet of white card-board , M N , or some other such screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its entrance into the room through the hole in the shutter , is white , and were the prism not interposed , it would advance forward on a straight line , and , falling on the screen at z , would there give a circular white image of the sun . The interposition of the prism disturbs this white light from its rectilinear course , and , refracting it , bends it into a new path . The disturbance produced by the prism is of two kinds : first , the ray is moved out of the rectilinear position in which it would have gone ; and , second , it no longer gives rise to a white circular image , but to an elongated and highly-coloured image , which goes under the name of the solar spectrum . Of the intensity and beauty of these colours it is impossible to give any description by words . An imperfect representation of their position is given in the frontispiece . In the coloured figure thus received on the card-board , NEWTON detected seven different tints , red , orange , yellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colours , the red is uniformly nearest to the point ( z ) to which the ray would have gone had the prism not intervened ; the violet is most distant . And as the production of the colours depends upon the refracting action of the prism , NEWTON designated the red as the least refrangible , because it was least removed from its natural course ; and the violet as the most refrangible , because it was the most removed . 144 . Now if these seven coloured rays be collected together again by any appropriate arrangement , so as all to fall on one common point , that point will be of a brilliant white , as was the point z . If two of them , as the yellow and blue , in like manner be directed together , they will give rise to a green ; or the red and blue to a purple ; or the yellow and red to an orange ; showing , therefore , that while different coloured rays thus give rise to compound tints , all the rays in the spectrum converged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally came through the aperture a b , in the shutter . // That the white light of the sun consists of seven differently-coloured rays , some of which are more , and some less , refrangible by glass . That , consequently , when a beam falls on a triangular prism of glass , its constituent rays are not all equally re- /z/ fracted . That of them the red is least , and the violet most refracted , and , therefore , the white image ( z ) which the original beam would have given , became elongated so as to form the solar spectrum in which the constituent colours are seen . 146 . Leaving now the optical arrangement by which this phenomenon is produced , let us confine our considerations to the spectrum itself . It is to be remarked that the purity of the constituent coloured spaces becomes greater , as the separation of the rays is more perfect ; and , as is shown in jig . Ill , these rays are diverging from one another , it is obvious that the farther the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater will be the apparent dispersion of the rays . If the screen is brought close to the prism , the colours are but little developed , because , not being yet separated from one another , their mixture produces white light ; but at a distance of twelve or twenty feet , they have diverged sufficiently , and each one appears for itself . 147 . Inspection proves that , in this spectrum , not only do the various parts differ in respect of the colours they show , but they also differ in their intrinsic brilliancy . A piece of fine-printed paper , held in succession in the different colours , is legible at very different distances . Held in the yellow , it may easily be read at a considerable distance ; but held in the violet , it must be seen close at hand , or the letters can not be distinguished . The other coloured spaces possess intermediate powers , and , by direct experiments made by FRAUNHOFER , it appears that the different portions of the Newtonian spectrum have their order of illumination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be perceived that the brilliancy of the yellow rays is taken as unity , and the other rays compared therewith . The letters refer to the figure in the frontispiece. /z/ Intensity of Light . InB C /z/ In E F /z/ 148 . It is not only in illuminating power that these different regions vary ; they vary also in their heating power , as is shown by their action on a thermometer . When a prism made of flint glass is used , and the bulbs of a set of small and delicate thermometers are plunged in the coloured spaces , it is perceived that , commencing with the violet , each thermometer rises higher as it approaches the red region ; and even beyond the red region , where the eye can detect no trace of light , the maximum of heat occurs , thus showing that the heat which exists in the sunbeam is an intrinsically different agent from the light , because , by the action of a prism , it can be refracted , and is found in a space in which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time that the white chloride of silver , and , indeed , all the white salts of silver , when exposed to the sun , turn black ( Ap. , 443 ) . A piece of paper washed over with any of these white bodies , as the chloride , and held in the spectrum , soon undergoes a change . In the more refrangible region , the rays begin to effect a decomposition , which spreads far beyond the violet extremity ; and when the bromide of silver is used , this darkening action is simultaneously begun from end to end of the spectrum , and chemical action extends beyond both of its extremities . In the /z/ same manner , therefore , that from the experiment of Sir W. HERSCHEL , in which a point of maximum heat was observed beneath the red end , the physical independence of light and heat was shown , so from analogous experiments on the chemical changes exhibited by the salts of silver , the existence of a distinct class of rays , invisible to the eye , designated " chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results lead us , therefore , to suppose that there exist in the solar beam a variety of distinct principles , and when that beam is acted upon by a prism of glass , those principles are parted out from each other . Among them some are visible , affecting the eye with the sensation of the various colours of light , red , yellow , blue , &c.,; and others are invisible , affecting the thermometer , or producing chemical decompositions . The general idea which we gather from these remarks is , that there are three separate principles coexisting in the solar ray , light , heat , and a principle of chemical action ; and when this ray is dispersed by a prism , three several spectra arise , of which two are invisible , and one can be seen . Their relative position is such as is given ino-. 112 , where A B is the luminous , and therefore visible spectrum ; C D the invisible , chemical spectrum ; E F the invisible spectrum of heat . 151 . These are the apparent phenomena which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in that spectrum the several coloured spaces are far from being pure , and many interesting phenomena are therefore imperceptible . NEWTON , who has never been surpassed by any experimenter in minute investigation , studied with great attention the peculiar circumstances which conspire in the production of the ordinary spectrum , with a view of isolating each one of the coloured spaces in a state of purity . 152 . First , he shows that , when an image of the sun is formed in a dark chamber upon a screen , as at z fig . Ill ) , that image does not terminate in a sharp circular edge , as is the case with the object himself , but is surrounded by a penumbra , the light gradually fading away ( Jig . 113 ) . This can be wholly removed by placing a convex lens so as to receive the ray , and give an image in its focus . And just as the solar image is surrounded by the penumbral ring , so also does the same defect accompany the rays when dispersed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penumbra is equally decomposed and dispersed with the bright light of the central image . Such an effect is seen in Jig . 114. 153 . Suppose , now , that by the use of a lens the penumbra is removed , and the direct solar image ( z ) received on the screen is seen to be terminated by a sharp and well-defined edge the image , of course , will be perfectly circular . If , now , a prism is placed behind the lens , in such a position as to intercept the converging beam of light , as at C ( fig. 115 ) , where A is the aperture in the shutter , B the convex lens converging the rays that come in through the aperture to a focus , F , where they form a circular image of the sun , the rays are bent on one side by the prism C , and a neat spectrum is formed on the screen at D E , with sharp edges , and devoid of any penumbral continuation . 154 . But the image of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the separation and successive superposition of coloured circular images , that separation being /z/ due to the different refrangibility of those different coloured rays . Let , therefore , in fig. 116 , r o y g bi v be a series of such circular images , all conjointly composing the spectrum E D , arranged in their proper order , r being the red image , and v the violet ; if we take any one of these images , such as y , and consider its constitution , we shall find that , by reason of the overlapping of the adjacent images , there are rays in it which belong to the images on either side , and instead of the circle y consisting of yellow light only , it includes orange light derived from the circle o , and green light derived from the circle g , as is obvious from the overlapping of those circles o and g , upon the circle under consideration , y. 155 . Farther , an ordinary spectrum without a penumbra differs in constitution in its various parts . If a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the overlapping of the successive circles along that line takes place to the greatest extent ; but if another line , m n , be drawn along its edge , on that line the successive circles do not overlap , and , therefore , while along the axis of the spectrum , E D , the intermixture of the rays and of the colours is at a maximum , along the edges of the spectrum there is no overlapping , no intermixture , and each one of the coloured ' rays is in a state of purity . The light of such a spectrum , therefore , becomes more and more homogeneous as we pass from the axis and go to the outer edge . 156 . But suppose the total length of the spectrum remaining the same , those circular images are diminished in diameter , as in Jig . 117 . Here , through that diminution of diameter , overlapping is prevented , and each one of the rays is separated out for itself , there is no superposition , and the colours are equally homogeneous in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This diminution in the magnitude of the circular images may be produced in practice in several different ways . The one which NEWTON recommends , and which is generally adopted , is to use the aperture in the shutter as the radiant source , instead of the sun himself . The diameter of the sun subtends an angle of about half a degree . But over the diameter of the aperture in the shutter we have , of course , a complete control ; we can make it half an inch , or the hundredth of an inch , as experiments require . Instead , therefore , of adjusting the screen , E D , fig. 115 , at such a distance as to receive the image of the sun himself , we remove it farther off , until we have depicted upon it an image of the aperture in the shutter well denned , and with sharp edges On interposing the prism , we find upon the screen , when adjusted to the proper focal point , a spectrum of the aperture , in which the separation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter . 158 . When this diminution is carried too far , the quantity of light admitted becomes very small , and under these circumstances NEWTON shows that great advantages arise , by employing , instead of a circular hole , a longitudinal slit or oblong aperture ; then the separation of colour is equally perfect , and more light being admitted , the different experiments may be made in a satisfactory way . 159 . Under certain circumstances , it is desirable to possess a spectrum in which the intermingling of the colours by overlapping takes place in a regular manner . The plan adopted by NEWTON was to employ a triangular hole . The image of this , when form- /z/ ed by a lens and dispersed by the action of a prism , is as is given in Jig . 118 ; where the triangles overlap at the bases , A B , and the intermixture of the different coloured rays is at a maximum , but at the other side of the spectrum the vertex of each triangle being separate from those on either side , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity . 160 . These are the chief improvements which were introduced by NEWTON in the formation of the solar spectrum , and it was in one purified in the manner here described that his most delicate experiments were made . It is extraordinary , that after he had advanced so far as to the use of a lens , and a narrow longitudinal aperture , that the discovery of the fixed lines escaped him . Even if his glass prism was imperfect , these lines are easily seen with prisms made from pieces of looking-glass cemented together and filled with a solution of sugar of lead , and such prisms NEWTON says that he employed . 161 . The dark lines in the solar spectrum were first perceived by Dr. WOLLASTON , and described by FRAUNHOFER . They may be seen by forming on a screen of white card-board , jig . 2 , Frontispiece , the spectrum of a narrow fissure or chink . The lens may be a common convex lens , or an achromatic ; the prism should be without veins or other flaws ; under these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the focal position , so that the spectrum is produced with sharp edges , a number of dark lines will be seen crossing it in certain positions . Of these , a sketch is given in Jig . 103 , and in the frontispiece . These different lines have been designated by FRAUNHOFER by the letters of the alphabet , as follows : A is in the red region , B in the red near its outer end , C is beyond the middle of the red , D is in the orange , and is a double line , E is in the green , F in the blue , G in the indigo , and H in the violet . 162 . Of the fixed lines , it is only the larger which can be seen by projection upon a screen . Viewed through a telescope , a vast number of minute ones become visible . FRAUNHOFER estimated them at GOO , and these are now known to constitute a part only of those which actually exist . In the solar spectrum , they maintain their position among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light which comes by reflection from any of the planetary bodies . In artificial lights they are not seen ; and in the rays which come from the various fixed stars , although they are present , they are found in different positions and in different groups . 163 . It has already been stated that when any salt of silver is exposed to the spectrum ( 149 ) , a decomposing effect takes place , and the salt becomes black . If the spectrum used be one of a narrow fissure , so that the fixed lines are visible , it will be found that the resulting impression contains them ; that where there is a fixed line there is a corresponding want of action upon the decomposed surface ; and , farther , that beyond the extreme violet end , and in a region where the eye can perceive no light , the chemical impression reveals remarkable groups of these inactive spaces , M N O P , Jig . 103 . These extra-spectral lines were discovered about the same time by M. BECQUEREL in France , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of them was , however , published first . Their use has become essential in all chemical investigations connected with light . , 164 . Without anticipating here what will have presently to be rtated in regard to /z/ the chemical agencies of the solar beam , our attention is first to be directed to its calorific properties . The following facts , which are gathered from the writings of M. MELLONI , who has cultivated this department of physical science with such remarkable success , will serve to give an idea of the opinions which have been advocated by that eminent philosopher . 165 . The different illuminating power of the different regions of the spectrum is , of course , plainly evident to the eye . NEWTON supposed that the calorific effect of the different spectrum regions followed the same order , and , therefore , that the yellow space was the hottest . In this view he was followed by LANDRIANI , SENNEBIER , ROCHON , and others . But at a later period , Sir W. HERSCHEL having observed that when different coloured pieces of glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heat which traversed them was not in proportion to the amount of light , he made trials on the solar spectrum by putting thermometers in its different colours and marking their elevations . In the course of these experiments he substantiated two remarkable facts : 1st . That below the red region , and in a space where no light could be seen , the thermometer rose . 2d . That the point of maximum temperature was not , as NEWTON supposed , in the yellow , but totally out of the coloured spaces , and among these dark rays which are less refrangible than the red rays of light . 166 . These experiments were repeated by various chemists , and with very contradictory results , some affirming the results of Sir W. HERSCHEL , and others dissenting from them . SEEBECK , however , eventually proved that this arose from the nature of the prism used . That when flint glass was employed , the maximum point was in the dark rays ; that when crown glass was used , it was at the extremity of the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orange ; for water , it was in the yellow . 167 . M. MELLONI repeated these experiments with the aid of an improved thermometer , and established their correctness . He took a prism of crown glass , which gave the maximum of temperature at the extremity of the red , and determined the distribution of heat in the coloured spaces , and also in the dark region outside of the red . Then he interposed a layer of water , so that the rays emerging from the prism were transmitted through it , and again measured the temperatures in the obscure and the luminous spaces . They were found altered ; some were totally destroyed , others partially , and others had escaped without sensible change . The greatest absorption had taken place among the least refrangible , the action having been less and less as the red ray was approached ; it diminished through the red , the orange , and a part of the yellow , and then to the end of the violet it disappeared . 168 . The direct effect of this partial absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bring it successively through the red , the orange , and the yellow region . These experiments also show that the heat distributed through the solar spectrum is not a homogeneous agent , for the same medium acts differently on its differently refrangible parts . In the same manner , M. MELLONI showed that the calorific rays arising from artificial sources That while most transparent substances had the quality of absorbing some of these rays , and allowing others to pass , there is one body , /z/ rock-salt , which is equally permeable to them all It therefore constitutes the true glass of radiant heat , and glass and water and other diaphanous bodies act towards heat as coloured media do to light ; they possess for it an invisible coloration. 169 . When , therefore , we attempt to investigate the distribution of heat in the solar spectrum by the aid of a colourless flint glass prism , we are doing the same thing as if we were attempting to study its coloured spaces by employing a prism of blue or green glass . Such an instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spectrum , absorbing some rays and letting others pass ; and as it acts towards light so does flint glass act towards heat , because it possesses an invisible coloration for that principle . But rock-salt , which is transparent equally to all these rays , will not produce such an effect , and hence , in all investigations connected with radiant heat , prisms of that mineral ought to be employed . When this is done , it is found that the maximum of temperature in this normal spectrum exists in the dark space , not in contact with the red extremity , as Sir W. HERSCHEL supposed , but wholly detached from the colours , at a mean distance equal to that which exists in the contrary direction between the red and the yellow . If the rays which form this normal spectrum are made to pass through a plate of flint glass of sufficient thickness , the maximum approaches towards the red region ; if one of ordinary glass , it passes into the red ; if water or alcohol be used , it enters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limpidity of these different media , the colours undergo no sensible alteration , and the maximum remains always invariably fixed at the beginning of the yellow . 170 . Thus , the inferior bands of the spectrum may preserve the same ratio of luminous intensities , and lose the relations which exist in their temperatures . The calorific elements do not follow the lot of their corresponding luminous elements . Therefore , light and heat are two different agents , or two modifications essentially distinct of one common agent . ( MELLONI , Comptes Rendus , Jan. , 1844 , p. 39 , &c.); 171 . To these beautiful results of MELLONI , Sir J. HERSCHEL ( Phil . Trans. , 1840 , p. 52 ) has added other very remarkable ones , obtained by a different process . If we take a slip of thin writing paper , and , having blackened one side of it by exposure to the smoke of a candle , adjust it so as to receive the solar spectrum , and with a flat brush equal in breadth to the paper dipped in rectified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper is completely saturated , and looks of a uniform black colour , " a whitish spot begins to appear below the extreme red end of the luminous spectrum , which increases rapidly in breadth until it equals the breadth of the luminous spectrum , and even somewhat surpasses it , and in length till it forms a long appendage exterior to the spectrum , and extends , moreover , within it , till it reaches up to , and beyond the centre of the yellow ray . In this state , and just as the general drying of the paper begins by whitening the whole surface to confuse the appearances , a second sudden and copious wash of alcohol from above downward must be applied , without disturbing the spectrum , or in any way shaking the apparatus . The superfluous alcohol will have hardly run off " , when the phenomena of the thermic spectrum begin to appear in all their characters ; at first faintly , and , as it were , sketched in by a dimness and dulness of tie otherwise shining and reflective surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a perfect whiteness , marking by a clear and sharp outline the lateral extent of the calorific rays , and by due gradations of intensity in a longitudinal direction their law or scale of distribution , both within and without the luminous spectrum . " 172 . " The most singular and striking phenomenon exhibited in the thermic spectrum thus visibly impressed is its want of continuity . " It consists of several distinct patches , or round solar spots , as is seen njig. 119. 173 . These are the leading facts in relation to the distribution of heat in the Newtonian spectrum . Let Us , in the next place , proceed to examine the laws of the distribution and action of the chemical rays , commencing first with the decomposition of one of the salts of silver , as , for example , the iodide of silver , which forms the basis of the Daguerreotype. 174 . The action of the Newtonian spectrum on the Daguerreotype plate is very remarkable . Imperfect attempts were made , soon after the preparation was published , to determine the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part , these , however , were made without any kind of precaution as respects the purity of the dispersed colours precautions which NEWTON , a century ago , so clearly pointed out . Instead , therefore , of spectra of great purity , in which the length is many times greater than the breadth , drawings were given in which the breadth of the solar image is equal to its length . Whoever remembers that , in the experiments conducted by NEWTON with a view of determining the phenomena of homogeneous light , and in which the lengths of his spectra were sometimes seventy times greater than their . breadth , will easily understand how small must be the value of such imperfect proofs , which , indeed , can scarcely be called impressions of the solar spectrum . 175 . The impressions obtained in July , 1842 , in Virginia ( Ap. , 645647 ) , and which may be taken as almost perfect specimens of the action of this variety of spectrum , were made by strictly following the precautions of NEWTON ( 152 , 153 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under various changes in the dimensions and figure of the aperture admitting the light ; as , for example , when it was a circle , a triangle , a fissure . Of the former of these , a very elaborate account has been given in the Philosophical Magazine , by Sir J. HERSCHEL ( Phil . Mag. , Feb. , 1843 ) , who has deduced from it what is probably the true theory of the action of light on the Daguerreotype plate . In these perfect spectra there are certain peculiarities which can not at all times be produced ; they require an exceedingly brilliant sun , and a clear sky . In tropical latitudes there is no difficulty , during the heat of summer , in obtaining them ; but in New- York , during a great many trials which I have made in the course of two years , I have but once been able to reproduce them . 176 . The solar spectrum obtained upon iodide of silver may be roughly divided into two great and almost equal regions : the upper region , corresponding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extreme violet , exhibits , by a deep dark colour , or series of colours , that a decomposition of the iodide has taken place ; probably in those portions in which this decomposition has been complete , the iodide has lost one half of its iodine ; the lower region , which is by far the most interesting portion of the two , and by far the most difficult to study , corresponds to the lesser re- /z/ frangible rays , which are included between the extreme red and the blue . There is no difficulty , at any time , in securing the representation of the upper , but it is in this lower part that the diversity of result is so great , and about which there is so much difference of opinion among different authors . 177 . I regard these two classes of rays the more and the less refrangible as exhibiting , upon the iodide of silver , antagonizing and contrary actions , the former exerting a decomposing agency , the latter a protecting agency . The circumstances under which the lower region makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of brightness that the sensitive surface is slightly stained by it ; the spectrum rays then exert their protecting agency on the places on which they fall , and maintain the iodide in an undecomposed state . That this is the true statement seems clear to me , from the circumstance that the phenomenon is independent of time . It is immaterial whether we expose the sensitive surface for five minutes or for an hour , no change whatever takes place in this lower region ; the iodide remains equally undecomposed . Now this must arise from the circumstance that the decomposing effect of the skylight is exactly balanced by the protecting agency of the lower rays so exactly balanced that it is immaterial whether the exposure be for one minute or for an hour , the resulting action is the same . 178 . This view of the relation between the more and less refrangible rays , in the action on iodide of silver , is strengthened by what is known to take place when phosphorescent surfaces are exposed to the sun . In that case , as all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert a protecting agency , but even extinguish the phosphorescent glow occasioned by those which are more refrangible. 179 . Exposed to the prismatic spectrum , different compound substances give rise to very different results . In some cases the change is limited to one , in others to other regions of the spectrum . Thus the iodide of silver seems to be decomposed by the more refrangible rays , the chloride exhibits a greater range of the same species of action , the bromide is blackened by every ray from end to end of the spectrum . Of these different results a very extensive series has been made known . They have occupied much of the attention of Sir J. HERSCHEL , who has published the results of his investigations in the Transactions of the Royal Society . 180 . Fig. 120 shows such impressions on different substances , a being the effect on the iodide , and b on the bromide of silver . In these it is to be remarked , that not only does the length of the figure vary very greatly , but also the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prismatic Spectrum . Mode of forming the Interference Spectrum . Its Peculiarities . The Distribution of the Colours , and Law of their Intensities . Reflected Interference Spectrum . Its Fixed Lines .

Mode of Defining Chemical Effects by Wave-lengths or by Times of Vibration . Impression on Bromide of Silver . On Chloride of Silver . Total Change in the Distribution of Heat in the Interference Spectrum . 181 . THE prismatic spectrum is obtained in a state of the greatest purity when the decomposed beam of light comes through a narrow fissure , and the instrumental arrangement given in ( 153 ) is employed . All the fixed lines are then thrown upon the screen , and the separation of the different homogeneous rays is accomplished , perhaps , as perfectly as is possible . 182 . But in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solar beam , very serious difficulties may be traced . If we inspect a photographic impression , or if we consider the intensity of the luminous rays in its different parts , we perceive that , as the violet end is approached , the different changes take place in a less abrupt manner ; the light fades gradually and imperceptibly away , the photograph does not end sharply , but , spreading itself out to a great distance , disappears so gradually that we can scarcely say where its termination is , and the fixed lines increase in number and breadth compared with what we perceive at the red extremity . 183 . These different results obviously arise from an inherent defect in the prismatic spectrum ; a defect which originates in the very cause which gives rise to the spectrum itself unequal refrangibility . Of two sets of rays compared together , one set taken in the red , and the other in the violet region , it is obvious that , in the same spectrum , from the very circumstance of their greater refrangibility , those in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in the red . That is to say , if we have two rays , a and b , in the red , whose indices of refraction are almost identical , and which , projected in the spectrum , would stand close to each other , side by side , and another pair , c and d , in the violet , whose indices of refraction bear precisely the same relation to one another , these last , by the act of refraction , will be more separated , because they are relatively more refrangible than the former . The result of this increased separation in the more refrangible regions is to give an apparent dilution to them , while /z/ the lesser refrangible regions are concentrated . The relative position of the colours must also vary ; the fixed lines must be placed at distances greater than the true distance , as the violet end is approached . 184 . In all investigations on the chemical action of the spectrum , the greatest importance is to be attached to these considerations , for our estimates of chemical results depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . When , therefore , we obtain a prismatic impression on any sensitive surface , it is very far from representing the true character of the phenomena . The action which ought to be concentrated in a lesser space at the more refrangible region is spread over a greater , and with that augmentation an apparent diminution of the amount of action is perceived . This , of course , should make the maximum point vary , spread out unduly the violet end , and dilute the true effect . The different regions of the prismatic spectrum can not be fairly compared with one another . 185 . My attention having been directed to these peculiarities , I obtained from the mint at Philadelphia , in May , 1843 , a piece of ruled glass , with a view of examining the different questions for which solutions had been apparently obtained by the defective use of the prismatic spectrum , substituting for it the interference spectrum of FRAUNHOFER . I am particular in mentioning this date , because I perceive that , at the very time that I was making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectrum , Professor MASOTTI was doing the same thing for the luminous rays in Italy , as is stated by M. MELLONI , in the Comptes Rendus , Jan. , 1844 , p. 44 ; and it is possible that , before the time that this volume reaches the Continent of Europe , other skilful experimenters may have followed in the course of Professor MASOTTI , and , perceiving the great advantages which arise , may have applied it for the chemical rays . 186 . As the interference spectrum is less known than the prismatic , I will here give a brief account of the mode by which it is to be formed for experimental purposes , and of its peculiarities. 187 . The principal apparatus is a grating composed of a number of intervals , alternately transparent and opaque . A piece of glass , with lines ruled on it with the point of a diamond , forms the best grating. ; these lines should be parallel to one another , equidistant , and so close that several hundreds , or even thousands of them , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perfection did FRAUNHOFER carry this kind of work , that he obtained gratings containing 30,000 lines in the inch . A beam of light , directed horizontally into a dark room by means of a heliostat , is to be transmitted through a fissure , as in the arrangement for showing the fixed lines in the prismatic spectrum . At a distance of several feet , the ray is received on the ruled glass , behind which , a few inches intervening , a piece of ground glass is placed . The lines which are upon the glass are to be adjusted so that they are parallel to the sides of the fissure through which the light enters . In FRAUNHOFER 'S arrangement , instead of a ground glass , a small achromatic telescope was placed , having a mechanism for measuring angular deviations , and rotating on an axis coincident with the centre of the grating ; the following facts , which may less exactly be verified with a ground glass , were then determined . Upon the axis of the ray coming in through the fissure , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides were perfectly sharp , and of the same appearance as though the grating had not intervened ; on the right and on the left of this image , two equal spaces , completely dark , and , beyond each of these spaces , a series of solar spectra , each having its violet extremity pointing inward towards the central image , and its red extremity outward . Of these spectra , the first on each side is perfectly insulated , but the violet of the third projects upon the red of the second , and in the same way each successive spectrum is overlapped by those coming after it . These spectra are situated symmetrically on each side of the central image , and with a telescope , or when other proper means are used , the fixed lines are plainly visible in them . 188 . In fig. 121 these phenomena are represented : A is the central white image ; BCD .... the successive spectra on the right hand ; E F G , the symmetrical ones on the left . 189 . If , now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example H , from the middle of the central image in the successive spectra on one side , we shall find that the distances which separate that centre from this ray in the consecutive spectra on one side H ' in the first , H " in the second , H ' " in the third spectrum are in an arithmetical progression ; A H " is double , AH ' " is triple of A H ' . The angular separation , measured by the instrument , between a given ray and the middle of the central image , is termed the deviation . 190 . " FRAUNHOFER has measured thus the deviations of the principal lines , making use of different gratings ; that is to say , of gratings the lines of which were more or less close , and in which the opaque groove was more or less large compared with the transparent interval . He has proved , in this manner , that the deviation of the same line , or of the same colour , does not depend on the ratio of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interval , but on the sum of those two magnitudes ; that the absolute value of the deviation is in the inverse ratio of this sum ; that is to say , that in multiplying the measured deviation by the known sum of the width of a groove and a transparent interval , we obtain a number which is constant for the same ray , whatever may be the grating which we use . FRAUNHOFER has calculated upon exact and numerous experiments the values of this constant for the seven principal lines of the solar spectrum , and finds that these values are precisely equal to the lengths of undulations of colours corresponding to those rays , such as FRESNEL had obtained by other processes . " /z/ 191 . Of these phenomena the undulatory theory gives a rigorous account . It farther shows , that the deviation of one of the colours in the first spectrum , multiplied by the sum of the breadth of one of the grooves of the grating , and of its corresponding transparent part , is equal to the length of an undulation of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all gratings , and gives an easy means of determining the length of an undulation. 192 . In the same spectrum , also , the deviations of any two colours are to one another as the lengths of their respective undulations . For this reason , therefore , the violet ray is situated nearest to , and the red farthest from the optical axis . 193 . From a note attached to M. MELLONI 'S memoir ( Comptes Rendus , Jan. , 1844 , /z/ p. 43 ) , it appears that Professor MASOTTI has determined that in these beautiful spectra the most luminous point is in the centre of the yellow ray , which is itself placed at an equal distance from each extremity of the spectrum . From this central point the luminous intensity declines regularly and equally to each end , so that the red limit and the violet limit have both the same luminous intensity , and are the least luminous parts of the spectrum . M. MASOTTI has also shown that the colours of these two limits are formed by ethereal waves , the lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of 2 : 1 . On the frontispiece the interference and prismatic spectra are compared side by side . 194 . Before directing farther attention to the peculiarities of the interference spectrum , I shall proceed to explain the method of obtaining it which I have found most suitable for chemical purposes . Through a narrow fissure , A. , Jig . 4 , frontispiece , I direct a beam of light horizontally by a heliostat , and at a distance of twelve feet I receive it upon the surface of a piece of ruled glass , the lines of which are parallel to each other , and rigorously parallel to the heliostat fissure , A. More than a year ago I found that there are practically great advantages in using a reflecting grating over one in which the light is directly transmitted . The glass , B C , is therefore to be silvered with a piece of tin foil , so as to act like a mirror , and it will be found that the tin amalgam upon it copies perfectly all the ruled lines . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in placing B C so that the ray coming from A falls perpendicularly on it , for all that is required to ensure the proper adjustment is to move B C until it is in such a position that the ray , after reflexion by it , returns back to the heliostat fissure , A. At a distance from B C of six inches , I place an achromatic object glass , D , in such a position that it shall receive perpendicularly the reflected rays of the spectrum of the first order ; in my arrangement this happens to be the left-hand spectrum , as the observer looks towards the heliostat fissure , A. The achromatic lens is thus brought as near to the grating as possible , without its edge intercepting the ray coming from A. In the focus of this lens , at E F , a ground glass is placed ; it is adjusted in a box , E G , and so arranged that the ground glass may be removed , and any photogenic surface put in its place . This portion of my apparatus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common Daguerreotype camera , which contains the necessary ground glass and cases for photogenic preparations . 195 . The apparatus being properly adjusted , so that the ground glass receives the rays perpendicularly , the spectrum will be seen depicted upon it in beautiful perfection , exhibiting all its striking peculiarities and its fixed lines quite visible . Every precaution should be used to shut out all extraneous light . 196 . The descriptions given of the interference spectrum by optical writers refer to the transmitted spectrum ; but these which are obtained by reflexion are , as FRAUNHOFER showed , like those in all respects . For several reasons , it would be preferable to use parallel lines ruled on a piece of polished steel or speculum metal . Silvered glass , however , has the advantage of not changing readily under the influence of the various corrosive vapours used in these researches . The grating which I employ is five eighths of an inch long , and one third of an inch broad . /z/ 197 . The interference spectrum is given iujlg. 133 and in the frontispiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen on the ground glass . By the side of it is placed the prismatic spectrum , the spectrum of NEWTON . Compared together , we see that in the latter the yellow region is among the less refrangible rays , in the former it occupies the central position of the spectrum . The distribution of the fixed lines is also different , though their position , as respects the coloured spaces , is the same for both spectra . Of course the light is distributed differently in respect to its intensity in the two spectra , as has been said : for the one it is a maximum in the centre , and fades away equally to each extremity ; but for the other , the illuminating power is as given in the table ( 147 ) derived from FRAUNHOFER. 198 . The following table , derived from Sir J. HERSCHEL 'S Treatise on Light , gives the lengths of the waves of light corresponding to each one of the principal lines of the spectrum . The Paris inch is supposed to be divided into one hundred millions of equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . Length of wave corresponding to the ray B , 2541 /z/ 199 . In the preceding chapter , we have given a brief account of the experiments of M. MELLONI on the distribution of heat in the spectrum , and shown ( 170 ) bow he deduced from those results the doctrine of the physical independence of the two imponderable principles . More recently , however , M. MELLONI has repeated the same experiments ( Comptes Rendus , Jan. , 1844 ) , and draws from them a result diametrically opposed to the former . 200 . That a philosopher should , with the progress of knowledge , change his opinions on fundamental points of science , is very far from being a fault . For more than ten years M. MELLONI has studied , with unexampled success , the laws and phenomena of radiant heat . The leading doctrine which he has deduced from those researches is that to which we have just referred , the entire physical independence of light and heat . From recent repetitions of his former experiments , he has now arrived at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of calorific indications sensible to the organ of sight , or , vice versa , that the radiations of dark heat are true invisible radiations of light . " The arguments which have been employed ( 169 ) in discussing the experiments of SEEBECK and others , on the shifting of the maximum point when different diaphanous media are used from the red into the orange , or even into the yellow , all hang upon the admission that the spectrum under consideration is sufficiently pure , and that there is no superposition or overlapping of its parts . For , were this the case , even where colourless and diaphanous media are used , such as crown-glass , water , sulphuric acid , and alcohol , though these , by reason of their transparency , do not exert any absorbent action on the rays of light , they might , by reason of their invisible col- /z/ oration , absorb certain of those rays which are beyond the extreme red ; and if these obscure rays , by superposition or overlapping , extended from their proper places into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media would then be exercised , and apparent movements of the point of maximum take place , such as have been actually observed the point shifting successively from the obscure spaces into the red , from the red to the orange , from the orange into the yellow . 201 . Now , in those spectra which were formerly employed , both by Sir W. HERSCHEL and M. MELLONI , this very difficulty must have taken place , and the results obtained were therefore not simple , but compound . It is obvious , if we would avoid these interferences , that we must employ a spectrum capable of showing the fixed lines , the parts of which are properly separated from one another . 202 . On making use of such a spectrum , M. MELLONI found the maximum temperature uniformly at the extremity of the red ray , it being immaterial what diaphanous substance had been used as a prism or as an absorbent medium . When glasses of a brownish colour were interposed , a colour which results from their exerting an absorbent action on all the colours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " these colours allied to their temperatures , that during the transmission they lost as much heat as light , so that the ratio of these two agents remained always unalterable . " From these things it is deduced , " That the luminous radiations , disengaged from every other heterogeneous radiation , have a heat of their own , which follows exactly the same vicissitudes , so that the different phases of a given ray of simple light may be measured indifferently by its luminous or calorific relations . " 203 . Of all the departments of physical science , there is none about which so many experimental difficulties gather as that which is connected with investigations on the solar spectrum , which is the point of reunion of the most energetic and powerful imponderable agents , visible and invisible ; and probably we shall not obtain true views of its constitution and properties until our doctrines have changed over and over again , and years have elapsed . In the views just cited , M. MELLONI returns to the opinions held at the beginning of this century ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photometer. 204 . That some splendid generalization will hereafter unite all these imponderable principles , we have repeatedly said ; but there are very many facts now known which none of the views hitherto brought forward can embrace . Under these circumstances , it would seem that the proper course to pursue is to regard each one of these agents as physically distinct . " Notwithstanding the clearness with which M. MELLONI has put forth his recent doctrines , those who have read with attention the beautiful memoirs which he has formerly written , will pause before they assent unconditionally . It is not by a difficult and delicate experiment , such as that now under consideration , nor even by a series of them , that that assent will be readily obtained . There are former experiments to be explained away , former measures to be accounted for , before this desirable simplicity can be effected . It is very true that , admitting the doctrine of the identity of light and heat , or their common dependance on one higher agent , the experiment we have just described meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties /z/ when we attempt similar explanations for other facts . Thus , a thin plate of transparent alum and a thick mass of smoky rock crystal , the former completely diaphanous , the latter so opaque that even when placed in the fullest light it was not possible to read large printed characters , being compared together , the latter was found to be more transparent to heat than the former in the proportion of 19 to 6 ; and , indeed , if these agents be identical , and the rays of light have a proper heat of their own , so that their amount may be measured by a thermometer , what becomes of such experiments as the following , brought forward , on the other side of the question , by M. MELLONI , formerly , who passed a ray of light through a stratum of water , and then through a glass tinged green by the oxide of copper ? " The pure light emerging from this system contains much yellow , and possesses , at the same time , a tinge of bluish green . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the most delicate thermoscopes , even when it is so concentrated by lenses as to rival the direct rays of the sun in brilliancy . " Taylor 's Scientific Memoirs , vol. i. , p. 392. 205 . Until , therefore , an explanation can be given of this experiment , or its authenticity disproved , the recognised rules of chemistry require that we should speak of light and heat as distinct agents . Nor are these the only imponderable principles which are involved ; there are others known to exist , the position of which is determined by these discussions : the chemical rays , for example , which M. BECQUEREL regards as nothing more than invisible light , adopting for them the same theory which M. MELLONI has adopted for the rays of heat . There are also rays which can excite the glow from phosphorescent bodies . From the time of FRANKLIN and CANTON it has been known , that if calcined oyster shells were exposed to the rays of an electric spark , as , for example , to the discharge of a Leyden vial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may easily be proved , it has more recently been found , that if the rays thus exciting the phosphorescent quality be transmitted through a piece of colourless flint glass , they can no longer produce the result . It might be said that this arises from the fact that colourless glass has an invisible coloration , and that it absorbs the rays which are far beyond the violet , but direct experiment proves that flint glass possesses no such quality . 206 . Inasmuch , therefore , as a piece of flint glass can cut off those dark rays which excite phosphorescence in the sulphuret of lime , and combinations such as that which has been referred to ( 204 ) are known , which can separate light from heat , we are justified in regarding these as distinct imponderable principles . They may , it is true , be remotely identical , but they are not identical in the way here set forth . They may all consist of similar movements or undulations of one primordial ether , but there are points in which the mechanism of those undulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the phenomena of sound , we may have instruments which give rise to undulations of the same length and the same intensity instruments which are executing the same strain of music at the same time yet we know well enough that each one impresses its own proper modifications , which the ear in an instant detects . At a distance , we recognise the flute , the violin , the piano , the bugle , from one another . 207 . The imperfections of the prismatic spectrum , which have been just described /z/ as exciting so powerful an influence in the distribution of light and heat , are equally perceptible in the case of chemical effects , a result which becomes apparent at once when we operate with the interference spectrum . When , on any sensitive silver surface , this spectrum is received , instead of a stain exceeding in length the coloured spaces , the change is limited to a narrow region , occupied by the more refrangible rays . 208. nfig. 133 , the visible interference spectrum is given with its fixed lines , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The figure in the frontispiece is drawn from the measures of FRAUNHOFER . If the two be compared together , it will be seen that there are differences in the relative distances of the lines . These differences arise from the mode of conducting the experiment in the two cases . FRAUNHOFER 'S spectrum was carefully determined , the angular deviations being measured on a graduated arc . Fig. 133 is depicted from the appearance on the flat ground glass of the camera , 209 . Before giving a description of the chemical effects of this spectrum , it is neces sary to explain the method of subdividing the spectrum which is here resorted to . In the earlier discussions on the chemical effects of light , the different regions of the spec truin were marked out by the designations of the different coloured rays , and effects were described as taking place in the red , or yellow , or violet ray . An improved plan was proposed by Sir J. HERSCHEL , and followed by him in his various writings : it consists essentially in dividing the space which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cobalt blue glass , into 13-30 parts , taking the centre of the yellow ray as the zero point , and continuing the divisions equally into the more and less refrangible regions . 210 . Over these different methods the use of the fixed lines possesses very great advantages , inasmuch as we do not make reference to ideal , but to actually visible points existing in the spectrum . Since the discovery of these lines , therefore , both M. BECQUEREL and myself have used them to . mark out spectrum regions . The only difficulty which is in the way is , that they do not give subdivisions minute enough for many purposes . But this difficulty can be wholly removed , and other very great advantages gained , by using them in the manner which I shall now proced to explain . 211 . It has been stated that the deviations ( 189 ) of the different fixed lines , B , C , D , in the interference spectrum , are proportional to the lengths of the undulations which they respectively represent . By designating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdivision may be carried to any degree of minuteness ; the measures of one author will compare with those of another , and the different phenomena of chemical changes occurring through the agency of light become allied at once with a multitude of other optical results ; as , for example , when we are told that the decomposition of bromide of silver occurs at a maximum under the influence of a ray which is 0-00001538 of a Paris inch in length , we recognise in an instant that his ray falls between the fixed lines G and H , the length of G being 0-00001587 , and of H 0-000014G4 ; we see , moreover , that the point spoken of is nearer to G than to H , and , if it were necessary , by a very simple arithmetical process , we could determine the number of vibrations executed by that ray in thus bringing about the maximum decomposition in billiontbs of a second , using the rate of the propagation of light at 192,000 miles . /z/ 212 . The . fixed lines , used in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum into any number of parts , and to indicate effects either in space or in time . For chemical purposes , in which mathematical accuracy is scarcely attainable , all that we have to do , in order to determine the lengths of waves producing given effects , or the times of vibration , is to determine , upon the interference spectrum , the point at which the change in question has taken place , and , using the numbers which FRAUNHOFER measured for the different fixed lines , find what is its relation to them . Thus , for example , suppose it has been found , by experiment , that a certain substance , exposed to the interference spectrum , exhibited a maximum point of decomposition exactly midway between the fixed lines F and G , which are both impressed on it , it is required to know what is the length of the wave which brought about that decomposition in parts of a Paris inch . The numbers given by FRAUNHOFER are , For G . -. - . v . . 0-00001587 , /z/ and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has for its wave-length /z/ 213 . In the frontispiece , I have annexed FRAUNHOFER 'S numbers to each ray , omitting , for the sake of brevity , the ciphers. 214 . In Jig . 134 is represented the effect of the interference spectrum upon a silver plate , rendered sensitive by exposure to iodine vapour , and then to bromine . The time of its exposure in the camera was half an hour . The point of maximum falls , as may be determined upon the foregoing principles , nearly at the point 0-00001538 . The dotted lines , x and y , indicate the beginning and end of the stain . The maximum point does not fall equally between the two , but is nearer to the more refrangible extremity . When this spectrum is compared with the corresponding prismatic one , in Jig . 103 , we see how great is the difference ; the effect , which is there carried far beyond the extra-violet regions , is here compressed down into a narrow space . 215 . Fig. 135 represents a very beautiful result , obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iodine , and then for a short time to the vapour of chloride of iodine . In this case the point of maximum falls nearer the line G. The time of exposure was ten minutes . The fixed lines , which were discovered by M. BECQUEREL and myself beyond the visible spectrum , are here crowded down into so small a space that the individual groups are all found together , so that they would scarcely be recognised . 216 . Fig. 136 gives a very perfect result which I obtained on a plate exposed first to the vapour of iodine , then to bromine , and then to chloride of iodine ; the point of maximum falls at 0-00001538 , as in 7%. 134 ; the time of exposure was one Hour . The decomposition extended on one side beyond E , in the green space , to the point 0-00002007 ; and beyond the violet space to the point 0-00001257 .

M. BECQUEREL , as appears from the Scientific Memoirs , vol. iii. , pi . ix. , Jtg. 2 , has been more fortunate . Although , in the course of a great many experiments , I have often obtained very beautiful results , in which the lines in the indigo and violet spaces were given in great numbers , and many of them of that degree of minuteness as to require a lens to show them distinctly , it has never yet happened to me to see the fixed lines D and E reproduced on a sensitive surface of any kind . 2 8 .

From Chapter II . we see that the process of digestion of plants , so far as we have yet examined it , may be separated into three different chemical actions . 1st . The absorption of carbonic acid and water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrogen . 3d . The retention by the plant of carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , and nitrogen . 220 . There has , therefore , been a decomposition of carbonic acid , of water , and probably of some nitrogenized compound . 221 . But these extraordinary decompositions have been produced by the agency of the sun . The most energetic reducing agents which we know are required in the hands of chemists to produce some of these effects . When made red hot , the vapour of phosphorus and also potassium will accomplish the deoxydation of carbonic acid . Plants can do the same at 50 Fah. very readily . 222 . If water be exposed to the light in glass vessels , common observation assures us that it never undergoes decomposition . In the same manner carbonic acid in a jar remains without exhibiting any change . We shall soon discover why , under these circumstances , the powerful reducing agency of light is not called into action . /z/ 223 . We have seen that the appearance of green matter in water , and the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest trees all the solid matter found in their branches , stems , bark , and various other parts , was originally fabricated in the leaves , for it was in them that carbonic acid was decomposed and its solid material fixed . Once thus introduced into the interior of the vegetable system , it passes through a multitude of changes ; from the descending sap the different compounds are removed , and lodged in their proper places . It is in this way that the starch , sugar , gum , woody fibre , fibrine , albumen , caseine , essential oils , resins , &c.,; are all produced . First one and then another change is impressed on the descending juice , and first one and then another special compound is removed from it ; but the point from which all this cycle of changes begins may be traced back into the leaf , to the decomposition of carbonic acid and production of chlorophyl , under the influence of light . 224 . A ray of light , as is well known ( 137 ) , contains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A principle which impresses the organ of vision with a specific sensation , and which is therefore spoken of explicitly as LIGHT ; of this there are several modifications : one which produces in our eyes the sensation of a red colour ; another , a yellow ; a third , a blue ; and these , conjoined in proper proportions , give rise to a white . 2d . A principle of radiant heat , the well-known characters of which are the power of producing expansion in bodies , of communicating a feeling of warmth ; in this the phenomena of coloration have been traced as in the former case . 3d . A principle of chemical force , which seems to be intimately associated with light , but differs from that principle in wanting the power of affecting our organs of vision . From this intimate association with light , I have suggested for this principle the name of TiTHONIC RAYS , in allusion to the fable of Tithonus and Aurora . In this , as in the former , the quality of coloration has already been traced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctive character of causing certain substances , when submitted to its influence , to shine for a short time after with a transient light ; this principle also is invisible to the eye , but differs from the tithonic rays in the fact that , under certain circumstances , transparent glass is opaque to it . 225 . Of these constituents , visible and invisible , in the solar beam , which is it that has charge of that digestive function of plants which we are now considering ? Is it the light or heat , the tithonic or the phosphorescent ray 1 226 . Several years ago , experiments were made by SENNEBIER for the purpose ef determining this question ; his results seemed to show that the violet rays contained the active force . More recently , in France , M. MORREN commenced an inquiry of a similar kind , and came to the conclusion that the luminous rays , and more especially the yellow , were the cause of the phenomenon . In 1836 , Dr. DAUBENY published , in the Transactions of the Royal Society , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to show that the leaves of plants decomposed carbonic acid , and turned green most rapidly in the yellow ray , the other colours , orange , green , red , blue , indigo , and violet , producing the same effect , more and more slowly in proportion as their illuminating power was less . The plan which was followed by these different chemists /z/ was to cause the plants to grow or to carry forward their decomposing action under the influence of light which has passed through glass stained with the different colours Thus , if young plants are made to grow beneath a shade of lemon-yellow glass , in a few days it is seen that such light does not exert a destructive agency , but they grow vigorously ; and if , simultaneously , comparative trials are made with other shades of different colours , such as red , blue , green , &c.,; an estimate may be obtained of the comparative effects of rays of these different colours . 227 . But it is well known that lights thus produced are not monochromatic , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ray which passes through them is examined by a prism , it is always dispersed into a variety of different colours . Thus , the light which passes through the ordinary variety of blue glass , analyzed in this way , is found to contain red , yellow , and an abundance of indigo and violet , although it looks of a pure blue tint . The blue light which passes it is therefore not a simple , but a composite blue , made up of many other colours , the blue predominating . And as this observation applies to almost all sorts of coloured media , their colours being compound and not simple , it is obvious that when we make experiments with them we shall be liable to be led into error , unless we determine what rays they actually transmit . Accordingly , Dr. DAUBENY determined this point in the case of each glass and coloured medium that he used . 228 . About the same time that these experiments were made in England , I commenced some of the same kind in the south of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , where , during the summer season , the light is extremely brilliant . These served to show that under a yellow solution , such as the bichromate of potash affords when dissolved in water , the leaves of plants turned green , and the decomposition of carbonic acid gas was effected . 229 . Soon after this the British Association for the Advancement of Science , in consequence of some results which had been obtained in England , which seemed to countenance the opinion of SENNEBIER , that the violet rays direct the function of digestion , appointed a committee to examine this matter at their expense . A number of experiments were consequently made , very much in the same manner as those which had been previously conducted by Dr. DAUBENY ; these seemed , however , to be at variance with his conclusions , and showed , that while the violet tithonic ray is the active agent which controls the process , the yellow ray of light is exceedingly injurious . 230 . But it is now known that these results , like those of SENNEBIER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by MORREN in France , and by DAUBENY in England , it is yellow LIGHT which directs the digestion of plants ; that leaves can be greened , and oxygen given off , and carbon fixed by light that has passed through a solution of bichromate of potash , or through yellow glass ( Ap. , 784-792 ) . 231 . The proper mode of conducting these experiments is to employ the solar spectrum itself , a process which , it will be seen ( Ap. , CH . XV. ) , was first resorted to iri New-York . By some appropriate optical mechanism , a ray of the sun is transmitted into a dark room through a circular hole in one of the shutters , and kept motionless for several hours , although the sun may have apparently moved . a considerable distance /z/ over the sky . This ray ( a b , Jig . 122 ) is to be intercepted by a glass prism , c , which disperses it into its different coloured beams . And now , having provided a set of glass tubes filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid gas in solution , and in each placed the same number of leaves of grass or of some other plant , so that each tube may be as nearly like all the others as may be , these tubes , inserted in a small pneumatic trough , c d , are to be set in the spectrum of light , in its different coloured spaces , one in the red , one in the orange , one in the yellow , &c.; Care also should be taken to exclude all extraneous light , so that that which causes any action among the leaves may be derived from the ray which comes in through the shutter only . Very soon , if the sky is clear and the sun brilliant , the phenomenon begins . In the tube which is in the most luminous part of the yellow ray small bubbles are evolved , and these rising to the top of that tube , there collect , so that after the lapse of a few hours a sufficient quantity may be gathered for measurement and analysis . The tubes that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the sky possesses an intense brilliancy , they will even approach in the rapidity of their action to the maximum yellow . A few bubbles also make their appearance in the blue , but after an exposure of many hours , if scrupulous care is taken to shut out all extraneous light , no action whatever is perceptible in the extreme violet , where SENNEBIER supposed the decomposing force to be situated . From these things we therefore gather , that it is in the yellow light that the power controlling the function of digestion of plants is to be found , the other coloured beams , orange , green , red , blue , &c.,; following in the order of their illuminating power . 232 . This prismatic experiment is one of the most beautiful objects which organic chemistry can offer , carried on in a chamber which would be totally dark were it not for the intensely coloured curves which are cast upon the walls by reflexion from the tubes , curves which often are many yards in length , indicating by their gaudy tints and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes and the vegetable leaves glow with the colours in which they are immersed . Meantime , the most interesting phenomenon which can be witnessed is silently going forward ; dead and inanimate matter is , under the influence of the plastic beam , putting on the form of organization and life . Oxygen and nitrogen gases are exhaling , chlorophyl , and gum , and sugar , fibrine , and albumen are coming into existence . These are compounds which , under ordinary circumstances , are destined to be used as the food , and form part of the bodies of animals . For it is from atmospheric air , as organic chemistry shows , that plants spring , condensed out of it , as it were , by the agency of the solar beam ; to the same source also it is that gradually during life , and totally after death , the parts of animals hasten to return . 233 . A little reflection shows the great advantages which this mode of experimenting possesses . In the white light of the solar beam there is a fixed proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beam is dispersed by prismatic action , and is simultaneously received upon vegetable leaves , we , in effect , measure out to them similar quantities of the different coloured rays , and observe the resulting action . When pieces of glass are used , as in the former experiment ( 226 ) , a great deal depends on their OBJECTIONS TO THE USE OF COLOURED GLASSES . ( jg thickness . It is easy to conceive , that although in the solar spectrum the yellow ray is vastly more luminous than the blue , if glasses or coloured media were used in experiments of any kind , results of precisely an opposite nature might be obtained . We can imagine a piece of yellow glass so thick as actually to transmit less light than a thinner piece of the blue . With glasses and absorbent media , therefore , not only must the nature of transmitted light be discovered , but thickness must also be taken into account . 234 . Suppose , as an illustration , plants were made to grow , or to decompose carbonic acid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that of which finger-glasses are made , and the result compared with what was occurring with another set of plants in action under a thick or deep yellow glass . It might turn out that the former would vegetate more vigorously , and fix more carbon , and produce more chlorophyl than the latter , because more light actually fell upon them , though the medium through which it came was blue . We must not forget that the mode of action in producing chemical decomposition , and the mode of action in producing vision through such an optical contrivance as an eye , proceed upon different principles . In the action of the eye time does not enter as an element ( Ap. , 536 ) . In the decompositions produced by radiant matter , or by light , it does . A faintly luminous object does not become brighter and brighter as we continue to look steadfastly at it ; it has assumed its maximum of brilliancy at the first glance . But a faintly luminous beam , falling upon leaves of plants , or upon any changeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes on . In our experiment , more and more carbonic acid is decomposed , and more and more oxygen set free as the time is prolonged . And so when absorbent media , as stained glass , are used , the final effect is dependant on the total amount of light that has been furnished ; and hence the turbidity , or thickness , or partial opacity of those media must be ta-ken into account , as much as their colour-giving relations In the prismatic experiment this source of disturbance does not occur . /z/ CONTENTS : Different Agents existing in the Spectrum .

FROM the preceding chapter , we have arrived at the conclusion that the imponderable principle which directs the digestion of plants is found at a maximum in the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23G , But it has been stated ( 224 ) that there are no less than three other principles /z/ coexisting in solar light , tithonic , calorific , and prosphorescent rays ; for the two former the phenomenon of coloration has been distinctly traced , as will appear in a subsequent chapter ; for the latter , analogy would lead us to suppose that the same thing holds . 237 . In yellow light , such as can effect the decomposition of carbonic acid , a variety of other principles exist yellow tithonic rays , yellow calorific rays , and perhaps yellow phosphorescent rays . Prismatic experiments ( Ap. , 790 ) can only indicate the refrangibility of the ray which produces a given effect . Experiments by absorbent media are finally required to point out its exact nature . 238 . In order that the reader may possess clear views of the evidence which is to be brought forward , showing that it is yellow LIGHT , and not tithonic , calorific , or phosphorescent yellow rays which superintend the formation of organic molecules out of inorganic matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the distinctive characteristics which appertain to each of these principles . 239 . Of the calorific rays , or rays of heat , nothing , however , need here be said . Their physical independence of light , and separate existence , were completely established by MELLONI ( 170 ) , who also discovered in them modifications analogous to coloration. ' 240 . The existence of the tithonic rays was first ascertained during the last century . They passed in the books under the name of chemical rays a name still continued by many chemists . As a multitude of phenomena with which they are connected became known , it has been found absolutely essential to give to them a specific name , such as can be moulded conveniently for the purposes of science , and combine readily to form those different words which are necessary to give names to instruments in which they are involved , or to phenomena with which they are connected a name which , however , involves no hypothetical idea of their nature or action . 241 . The most striking fact in connexion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two principles are separable from each other by artificial processes , yet , under natural circumstances , they always occur together . In sunlight , in gas-flames , from candles , and even in the moonbeams , in which no heat is found , the chemical and luminous rays exist together . They undergo reflexion , refraction , polarization , and interference , apparently under the very same laws . But while light can affect the eye , and bring us into relation with all the phenomena of the material world , these rays fail to affect our organs of vision they are invisible . 242 . In view of this constant association of light and the chemical rays , and to express the idea of their near alliance to each other , and as the wants of science imperatively called for a specific designation , the name of tithonic rays has been suggested for them . It is drawn from the fable of Aurora and Tithonus . This name forms compound words with facility . It does not involve us in any speculative considerations , but merely points out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost always associated with light . As has been just stated , all the mechanical laws which regulate the reflexion , transmission , polarization , and interference of light , obtain also for this . 243 . The mathematical theory of light is based upon the postulate of undulations taking place in an ethereal medium . This theory , like the theory of universal gravi- /z/ tation , possesses an abundant internal evidence of truth . In our times extensive and important applications have been made of it , so that it now includes an explanation of all the phenomena of reflexion , refraction , polarization , double refraction , interference . As yet , it has furnished no clear account of the phenomena of absorption , the very phenomena which are at the basis of all physiological and chemical facts in their relations to luminous agency . As we shall presently prove , the decomposition of carbonic acid and the function of digestion in plants depend on the absorption of light . Nor is there yet included in it any representation of the various phenomena of heat . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , and one great generalization embrace all the phenomena of the imponderable agents . But the purposes of science require , until that event takes place , that we should continue to speak of the various imponderable principles as though they were different agents , and treat them as though they were separate existences. 244 . The first decisive evidence brought forward to establish the physical independence of the heat and light of the sunbeam , as has been stated ( 165 ) , was derived from the experiments of Sir W. HERSCHEL , the illustrious astronomer . He found that , when a beam of light is dispersed by a prism , and the resulting spectrum examined , by placing thermometers in its different coloured spaces , the most luminous rays are not the hottest , the maximum temperature occurring , not in the yellow , but in the red ray ; and even out of the red ray , and where the eye could detect no light whatever , he.at was present , for the thermometer there rose rapidly . Starting from these experiments , MELLONI added farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparency for heat ; that there are certain media more or less opaque to one of these imponderables , and more or less transparent to the other , and that , by appropriate combinations , media can be obtained which will allow light to pass them with very little diminution of its intensity , but which stop the heat almost entirely . 245 . In the dark rays which come from a vessel of hot water , we have radiant heat without light ; in the moonbeams we have , on the contrary , light without heat . 246 . By a series of experiments of a similar kind , the physical independence of the tithonic rays has also been established . During the last century , it was observed by SCIIEELE , that these rays occur abundantly beyond the violet extremity of the spectrum , where the eye can discern no trace of light , an observation essentially of the same kind as that made by Sir W. HERSCHEL for radiant heat . In consequence of this discovery , the occurrence of invisible rays was at once assumed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence became an admitted fact in science . 247 . It does not appear , however , that any clear views were entertained as to the precise character of these dark rays . Writers on optics spoke of them indifferently under the name of violet rays , chemical rays , deoxydizing rays , and invisible rays . Of all the benefits which can be conferred on an infant science , those arising from establishing clear , bold , prominent , decisive views of its fundamental agencies and their actions are by far the most valuable , for they fasten the attention forcibly . In all progressive sciences , each epoch of evolution , for sciences advance forward by starts , is traceable to the announcement of some clear and vivid idea . g3 DETITHONIZING ACTION OF YELLOW SOLUTIONS . 248 . As we have said , the existence of these dark rajs beyond the violet end of the spectrum was established during the last century . For , when a solar spectrum is made to fall on a piece of paper covered over with white chloride of silver , that compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and violet rays fall ; the change also extending over those spaces which are outside of the violet ray , and where there is no light . In 1836 , by using bromide of silver instead of chloride , I found that these deoxydizing rays extended out of the blue light down towards the yellow ( Ap. , 445 ) ; these experiments were published in 1837. 249 . From a variety of evidence , obtained about the same time , it appeared that when absorptive media were used , the rays of light could be deprived of much of their chemical power . Thus , on passing a ray through a solution of bichromate of potash ( Ap. , 410 ) , it became almost inactive , refusing to produce any change on sensitive paper ; a similar result following on passing it through DALTON 'S solution of the quadrosulphuret of lime , and a variety of other media ( Ap. , 410-509 ) . At that early period in photographical investigations , when as yet no other chemist was engaged in these pursuits , two important facts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the spectrum of light and the tithonic rays ( Ap. , 386 ) . 2d . That the tithonic rays exhibit undoubted tokens of modifications answering to colours in light ( Ap. , 384 , 433 , 506 ) . This is the foundation of the doctrine now more completely unfolded in this work , under the designation of " The Theory of Ideal Coloration of the Tithonic Rays . " 250 . From their constant association with light , it is difficult to give that clear evidence of the physical independence of the tithonic rays which may be given in the case of heat . Much weight may , nevertheless , be laid upon the circumstance that , by prismatic action , these rays can be proved to exist beyond the extreme violet region , and even beyond that ray which Sir J. HERSCHEL designates lavender . Evidence of the same kind is derived from the partial action of absorbent solutions and media , which act differently on each of these classes of rays . From observations of this kind tables have been formed , with a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Transactions of the Royal Society , Sir JOHN HERSCHEL has given some of the same sort ( Phil . Trans. , 1840 ) . My results were published in 1842. 251 . At one time much stress was laid on the power which certain media , such as bichromate of potash and quadrosulphuret of lime , possess in depriving a ray of its chemical force . This argument is still resorted to by inaccurate writers , as affording a very popular and palpable proof that light and the tithonic rays are different existences . " If , " it is observed , " a ray of light is passed through a solution of quadrosulphuret of lime , and is then received on paper covered with chloride of silver , it is found that the light alone has gone through , and the chemical rays have been absorbed . The one , therefore , exists independent of the other . " When I first observed the power of these yellow solutions , this was the conclusion I came to ( Ap. , 410 , 511 ) . But the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this argument of much of its force ; for the rays that are transmitted by such a solution are yellow rays of light , and yellow tithonic rays ; in these the chloride of silver does not change , its decomposition being brought about by the blue tithonic rays which have been absorbed along /z/ with the blue light . Tithonic rays are present in a beam which has passed through quadrosulphuret of lime , but chloride of silver can not detect them . 252 . An accurate examination of the quantity of light and the quantity of tithonic rays passing through given solutions has , however , restored this argument to its pristine force . Thus , it is proved , that of different media which have been tried , some transmit more of the luminous and some more of the tithonic rays ( Ap. , CH . XVIII. ) ; that the rate of transparency for one is often totally different from the rate of transparency for the other ; and although we have not yet been so fortunate as to discover any given medium which is opaque to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as has been done in the case of light , their physical independence is just as certain as though such a medium was known . 253 . After commenting in the preceding paragraph on the weak point in the argument drawn from absorbent media , it ought not to be left without showing how experiments of that class may be rigorously used as proofs of the correctness of the views given in 1837 . It only requires that the sensitive paper or surface used should be of such a character as to be affected by all the tithonic rays in the spectrum , irre spective of their order of refrangibility or ideal coloration . Such a substance is the bromide of silver . Sir J. HERSCHEL has used it with a similar object in view ( Phil . Trans. , 1840 , p. 38 ) . Suppose , therefore , we allow a solar spectrum to fall upon such a changeable surface , after having passed through a yellow absorbent medium , as the bichromate of potassa . The eye at once informs us that very little of the yellow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface for a long time exposed before the yellow and orange tithonic rays will have produced such a change as they would have produced in a few moments if the bichromate had not intervened . In this case the experiment is a fair one , and the deduction it gives holds good , because bromide of silver is easily decomposed by the tithonic yellow ray . The bichromate of potash , therefore , transmits yellow and orange rays of LIGHT copiously , but it transmits the corresponding yellow and orange tithonic ray to a far less extent . The two principles are therefore distinct . 254 . That there is nothing unphilosophical in supposing that an invisible principle such as that of which we are speaking should exist in solar light , is shown by the analogy of radiant heat , a principle equally invisible to our eyes , but of which the existence is palpable enough to our other organs of sense . In a dark room we are utterly unable to see a vessel of hot water , but its calorific emanations are plain to the hand , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogy is supported by the recent discovery of BECQUEREL . For a long time it has been known that there are certain bodies , such as calcined oyster shells , which shine in darkness after a brief exposure to . the light . A hundred years ago it was discovered that the transient light of an electric spark is sufficient to awaken the dormant glow of these bodies . Now BECQUEREL has shown , that to the rays which thus issue from an electric spark , and cause this wonderful phenomenon , glass is opaque , that light can pass through glass , but the phosphorescent rays can not . They also are invisible to the eye . 255 . It will be seen , by referring to CH . XII . of the A p. , that there are certain phe- /z/ nomena which may be explained on the supposition that the invisible tithonic rays es cape by radiation from bodies which have been impressed by them , those bodies simultaneously reverting to their original condition . These results , and similar ones , have of late years attracted much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved are beset by numerous difficulties ( Ap. , 708 , &c.).; There is not , however , anything impossible , or even unlikely , in this secondary radiation . A phenomenon of exactly the same kind is visible to the eye in the case of the phosphorescent rays , when the glow of light by radiation escapes away from calcined oyster shells after they have been illuminated by an electric spark . 256 . Dark , invisible rays thus exist in the sunlight , and carry on a variety of functions , and control a variety of phenomena . Of solar principles , four different kinds have been traced : rays of light , of heat , tithonic , and phosphorescent rays . The two former are admitted to constitute recognised imponderable principles . What are the latter two ? 257 . In the Philosophical Magazine ( see AP. , CH . XIII . ) I have some years ago brought forward the doctrine , that we are compelled to enlarge our catalogue of imponderable principles , and include these tithonic rays in it . More recently I have offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CH . XVIIL ) . 258 . This brings me to offer some remarks on the opinion expressed by M. BECQUEREL , that the phenomena now under discussion are due to the qualities of the receiving surfaces , and not to agents intrinsically different , coexisting in the solar beam . That the same beam of light , falling on sulphuret of lime , causes it to phosphoresce ; on chloride of silver , blackens it ; on the retina , gives rise to the phenomena of vision and colour ; on a piece of black cloth , causes it to become warm . This opinion seems to be surrounded with insurmountable difficulties , and , if admitted , would disturb some of the best-established truths of science . 259 . No one can feel more strongly the absurdity of supposing that Nature has created between forty and fifty elementary ponderable substances , all possessed of metallic characters , and all so nearly alike that even a chemist is often puzzled to distinguish them from one another . No one , upon satisfactory proof , would more willingly go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but so long as the evidence on the constitution of these bodies rests where it does , the laws of chemistry compel us to admit them to be simple and undecompounded . And , just in the same way that I am willing to admit the existence of forty different simple metals , so , upon similar evidence , I am free to admit the existence of fifty different imponderable agents , if need be . Is there anything which should lead us to suppose that the imponderables are constituted by Nature on a plan that is elaborately simple , and the ponderables on one that is elaborately complex ? That the former are all modifications of one primordial ether , and the latter intrinsically different bodies , more than a quarter of a hundred of which have been discovered during the present century 1 260 . Before admitting the correctness of the hypothesis of M. BECQUEREL , that the agent under consideration is one and indivisible , and that all the phenomena we discover are due to the receiving surfaces , and that there are as many spectra as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestations when exposed to the sun 's ray , we should make inquiries like the following : How is it that a piece of black cloth exposed to the moonbeams does not become warm ? How is it that a cannister of hot water is not luminous to the eye 1 In the rays that come from the moon , and those that are emitted by warm water , is there no intrinsic difference , or does the phenomenon depend on the receiving surface alone ? What becomes of the beautiful experiments of MELLONI , on the physical independence of light and heat , since these are mainly founded on the fact , that by the use of absorbent media we can separate one from the other ? How is it that the rays of an electric spark , passing through quartz , can make the Bolognian stone phosphoresce , but passing through glass , equally transparent and equally colourless , can do no such thing ? The receiving surface is the same in both cases , and , as far as human eyesight can discover , the light that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light that came through the quartz , but the results are diametrically opposed . And is it not more consonant to reason to suppose that the glass was opaque , or impervious to some agent existing in that beam , which freely passed the quartz opaque to it , but transparent both to light and the tithonic rays I 261 . We might multiply cases like these , and give similar arguments from chemical changes on sensitive surfaces ; but the instances already cited seem abundantly sufficient to overturn the hypothesis in question . Before it can be admitted , it must give a reason why the retina is not affected with the sensation of vision when rays from hot water fall on the eye , why a thermometer will not rise when placed in the moonshine , why sulphuret of lime or barytes will not phosphoresce when covered with a piece of glass . 262 . We are thus forced to admit that rays of light , rays of heat , tithonic rays , phosphoric rays , and probably many other radiant forms , have an independent existence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each other . 263 . It must , however , be understood , that the conclusion here arrived at essentially depends on the following facts : 1st . The constant visibility of light . 2d . The uniformity of the action which heat exhibits in expanding bodies . If the progress of science should require us to admit that there can exist light which impresses our eyes with a sensation of darkness , or heat which can neither raise a thermometer nor produce the sensation of warmth , then the force of the foregoing arguments will be essentially affected . Such extensive changes in the universal acceptation of words will , unquestionably , be very slowly received . /z/ CONTENTS : Examination as to which of the Principles mentioned in the preceding Chapter is engaged in the Decomposition of Carbonic Acid .

In the last chapter , and in the APPENDIX , CHAPS . XIII. , XV. , and XVIII. , we have given proofs of the separate existence of a number of independent imponderable principles in the solar beams , of which only one produces a specific effect upon the eye , the others being wholly invisible , and known to us by the chemical or mechanical effects they produce . 265 . When , therefore , a beam of light falls upon a prism , and is decomposed by it , and the resulting colours are received upon a screen so as to give rise to a spectrum , such as that represented in the frontispiece , in each portion of that spectrum these different imponderable principles are present . For example , in the region between the lines A and C there are red rays of light , red rays of heat , and red tithonic rays . They are mingled together there , fortuitously , through the optical action of the prism . Their existence is perfectly separate and independent , and any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others left . 266 . Confining our attention now to the yellow portion of the spectrum , in which region the decomposition of carbonic acid takes place , it is obvious , upon these principles , that there are coexisting there yellow light , yellow heat , and yellow tithonic rays . It remains for us to inquire to which of these three principles the decomposition of carbonic acid and the production of green matter is due . The phosphorescent rays may be : left out of the discussion , though these , with the other three classes , are spread all over the spectrum . 267 . First let us ascertain whether radiant heat , generally , has the quality of producing decomposition . To rays coming from a brightly-burning fire , I exposed some vegetable leaves in water holding carbonic acid gas in solution , and , to increase the effect , converged the calorific rays by a large metallic concave mirror . That no doubt might remain of the incapacity of heat to produce the phenomenon , the temperature of the water , under the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 140 Fah. , a much higher point than is ever attained under natural circumstances . But neither at low temperatures , nor at these elevated ones , did any visible decomposition /z/ take place ; showing , thus , that heat alone can not cause the digestion of plants . Moreover , as is well known to chemists , carbonic acid gas may be passed through a tube that is white hot without giving the most remote appearances of decomposition . 268 . The beautiful experiments of MELLONI have proved , however , that rays of heat emitted by bodies at different temperatures vary in their constitution . At a low temperature , such as that of the human hand , the caloric emitted is of a high refrangibility , and possesses invisible violet coloration . As the heat rises , rays of a lower refrangibility are sent forth , so that if we examine the character of the rays coming from a series of bodies , the temperatures of which are successively higher and higher , as the hand , a vessel of boiling water , a red-hot iron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the radiant heat possessing a calorific tint , which successively descends through the colours of the spectrum , the violet , indigo , blue , green , yellow , &c.; From the sun , the temperature of which , therefore , must be excessively high , radiant heat is emitted which occupies a region in the spectrum corresponding to the red rays , and even below that is found beyond the region where red light has ceased to be visible . In the sunbeam , therefore , rays of heat of every refrangibility and every colour are found ; they occupy a space commencing with a region beyond the extreme violet , and , descending through the whole length of the spectrum , are found beneath its lowest extremity . 269 . This is a phenomenon analogous to what we witness under similar circumstances in the case of light . When a lamp , the wick of which is placed very low , is first lighted , it burns with a violet-coloured flame , giving forth little heat , and possessing small illuminating power . By-and-by , as the combustion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigo , and presently becomes of a purer blue . If the wick is now elevated , and air more abundantly supplied , the light increases in brilliancy ; and , if seen through a prism , all the colours begin to be perceptible from the violet to the yellow and orange . Lastly , if fed with oxygen gas , or consumed in one of the improved burners , the light assumes a beautiful whiteness , and , if dispersed by a prism , exhibits all the colours of the spectrum . It is to the presence of these that its whiteness is due , for white light contains all the coloured rays . 270 . In these beautiful and perfect analogies , which may thus be traced between the phenomena of light and heat , there are some points which require to be considered in the case we have before us . As common observation assures us , rays of light of different refrangibilities excite in our eyes specific sensations ; the most refrangible ray affects us with that sensation which produces in the mind the idea of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the lesser refrangible ray , a red . And now these impressions , thus passing along the optic nerve to the brain , originate in specific changes which are happening to the constitution of the retina , for this delicate expansion must , in the nature of things , be acted upon under the influence of the light , in order to give rise to a mental sensation . The different rays of light , each one for itself , operates in its own way and produces its proper result . 271 . Considerations like these would , therefore , lead us to suppose that rays of heat of different invisible colours ought to have the property of producing specific changes . /z/ To them all is apparently given a power of producing expansion in bodies , and to each one , probably , its own specific chemical powers . The experiments of Sir J. HERS CHEL seem already to give proof of this fact . That the decomposition of carbonic acid by leaves is not due to yellow heat , may be proved by causing the active light to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of an orange-yellow colour . This ray , thus treated , appears to carry , on the decomposition with nearly the same activity as the direct solar beam ( Ap. , 788 ) . In an experiment which I made , using it in a stratum of certain thickness , it seemed to transmit the yellow and orange light with very little loss ; but acting more energetically on the calorific ray , it transmitted of it only - 26 . Had this heat been the cause of the decomposition , the rapidity with which the action took place should have been proportionally reduced . 272 . From such results , it is to be inferred that radiant heat generally , and the yellow rays of heat especially , do not produce the decomposition of carbonic acid gas in the structure of vegetable leaves . 273 . This narrows the question down to the inquiry , whether it be the yellow ray of light or the yellow tithonic ray ; for , as has been observed , the phosphorescent rays may be left out of the discussion . 274 . Experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way , with that already cited , serve to determine this point . If a beam which has passed through a solution of bichromate of potash retains its power , as we know by experiment , it remains for us to inquire whether that solution acts as feebly on the yellow tithonic ray as it does on the yellow ray of light . We have already shown ( 251 ) that this is not the case , for the tithonic ray undergoes an abundant absorption , its force being greatly diminished , so that bromide of silver , which is easily changed by the yellow tithonic ray , undergoes , in this disturbed and absorbed beam , a slow decomposition . In the same way , therefore , that we determine that it could not be radiant heat , we also determine against the tithonic rays . The decomposition of carbonic acid , the production of chlorophyl , and the greening of plants go on with great rapidity under that yellow solution , because , although it has absorbed , and therefore removed these imponderable agents , it allows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 275 . The observation made in 237 is now understood . Analysis by the prism serves only to point out in what particular region of the spectrum given phenomena are produced ; it therefore narrows our discussions down within certain limits . By introducing , in addition , the action of absorbent media , we are enabled to point out , with a certain amount of precision , the exact agent which is involved . This use of absorbent media conjointly with prismatic analysis , which was introduced into these inquiries in 1837 ( Ap. , CH . X. ) , may be expected continually to yield interesting results . 276 . To the LIGHT , and more especially to the yellow light of the sun , we are to impute the production of this , the most interesting phenomenon of organic chemistry . Rays which come from artificial sources , such as lamps and gas flames , can also bring it about to a degree corresponding with their intensity . . 277 . Whether that peculiarity of light by which it gives to us the sensation of spe- /z/ cific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not say whether the quality by which we are led to impute to a given beam a yellow colour is the same quality which is involved in this decomposition . Whether , in short , yellow light , because it is yellow light , produces this change . Would any other coloured ray , such as a blue , if its intensity were sufficiently elevated , produce the same result ! For we can imagine a blue light so to be re-enforced as to possess the same intrinsic brilliancy or illuminating power as a yellow . Under such a change , would its decomposing action also be exalted ? 278 . Prismatic experiments serve to show ( Ap. , 782 ) that the rapidity of decomposition follows very closely the order of illuminating power . And this result affords an argument , imperfect and feeble it is true , that an affirmative answer will be hereafter given to that question . 279 . But there are other reflections which naturally arise , and tend to an opposite result . There seems to be a general relation , though the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a particular refrangibility and ponderable substances of a particular kind . Thus , in the case of most of the salts of silver , the point of maximum action falls in the violet ray . In the same way the question naturally arises , Does the point for the maximum action on carbon compounds fall in the yellow space , and the yellow , for that reason , become the active ray in decomposing carbonic acid , and giving a green colour to leaves 1 Is it for this cause , also , that , received into the eye , the yellow ray impresses us with the greatest illuminating power I It would be a beautiful result of these researches to co-ordinate phenomena apparently so widely apart as the formation of chlorophyl in a leaf and the regulated destruction of the retina in the chamber of the human eye in producing the phenomena of vision . In nature there are many results which are apparently equally distinct , and which the progress of knowledge has shown are intimately allied . That to our organs of vision yellow light is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a carbonaceous compound of which the changing nervous expansion is constructed . Had it been possible for Nature to have formed a retina in which a salt of silver formed the basis , the maximum of brilliancy of light would have shifted , and the blues would have been among the brightest rays . Is it in the optical peculiarities of the carbon atom that all our ideas of harmony among colours and beauty of external objects have arisen I 280 . Experimental science will probably before long trace a close connexion between the physical properties of atoms and the physical properties of light . It will show that molecules of a given weight can be moved most easily by ethereal waves of a given length , as a stretched string is thrown into vibration by atmospheric undulations of proper dimensions ; that the transverse vibrations of the ethereal particles can agitate in a corresponding way ponderable atoms of a proper magnitude and constitution . We shall then have no difficulty in understanding how it was that among metallic substances , those first detected to be changed by light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all high atomic weights ; and such as sodium and potassium , the atomic weights of which are low , appeared to be less changeable . /z/ CONTENTS : Estimate of the Extent and Power of the Solar Radiations .

IN pursuing our discussion of the phenomenon which we have under consideration-r-the digestion of plants we have successively traced the source of action to the yellow region of the spectrum , and to the ray of LIGHT . 282 . In what manner , then , does this light act ? How does it come to pass that it can exert so great a force as to effect the reduction of carbonic acid in the cold ? We have briefly seen what are the results it impresses on the forming vegetation , that the leaf turns green and oxygen is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to the light 1 Action and reaction are always equal , and if a given beam can produce a result which demands the most energetic chemical force , it is reasonable to suppose that in doing so it undergoes itself a change . 283 . These considerations show us that the question in what manner yellow light acts in controlling the function of digestion in plants , is not only exceedingly interesting in a physiological point of view , but also that it involves the whole theory of the action of radiant matter , whether it be of light , heat , or tithonicity , in producing chemical change . 284 . There are few authors who have written on the action of light or the tithonic rays in producing chemical changes , who have not directly ascribed all those changes to absorption of the imponderable principle . The connexion between absorption and the production of these phenomena is clearly apparent . Still , however , in looking over what has been written , we find little precision in those views ; instead of a distinct conception of a plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 285 . In animals , voluntary and involuntary motions are under the government of the nervous system . Each movement which is executed is attended with a corresponding consumption of organized matter , either in the muscular or nervous tissues , or both . The motions which my fingers are executing in writing these lines do not spring forth from nothing , but are the offspring of the destruction , in a regulated manner , of organized matter originally derived from food . How perfect , then , is the animal machine , which , fed from day to day by a small portion of carbonaceous matter , executes motions with an inconceivably small expenditure of material ! How great , also , are the results which may arise from the return of those organized atoms to their pristine inorganic /z/ state . Thrown out from the mechanism , after their office is over , they leave behind them marks of the changes through which they have passed , and of the facts to which they have given birth , and thus stand at last in connexion with events to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the combustion of small quantities of carbon , we see , in improved steam engines , how great an amount of force can be originated , and by the oxydation of a few grains of zinc in voltaic batteries , what surprising chemical results arise . From those more ordinary cases of changes accomplished by the action of light , which appear to be feeble and slowly produced , we should form the most erroneous opinions of the force of the sun rays . General considerations might lead us to know that the principle which has in charge the keeping up of the constitution of the atmosphere , and regulating the vital functions of plants , is of great intensity . Thus , I have found that the rays which are emitted from a common wax candle are superior in chemical force to the current which is evolved by a cell of Grove 's battery , the most powerful of voltaic combinations known , for they could effect the recomposition of muriatic acid much faster than the battery could decompose it , and yet that battery was found competent to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of Dr. FARADAY are correct , was evolving more electricity than is developed by any thunder storm . If this is the case with a candle , what , then , shall we say of brilliant rays of the sun , which impinge on the earth on all sides ? 287 . That force , therefore , the mode of action of which we are now to discuss , is far from an insignificant power in Nature . In generality and intensity it rivals any that is known ; in interest it is superior to them all , for it stands in connexion with organization and living things . 288 . Even after having undergone that enormous reduction of intensity which must take place in reflexion from the surface of the moon , the solar rays still act with energy ; for the moonshine produces all kinds of decompositions , acting like the sunbeam , though in a feeble way , being probablv reduced to JVTCT part of its original power ( Ap. , /z/ 289 . This force , thus affecting in a radiant form vegetable organizations , produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained of its feebleness is utterly inaccurate and wrong . 290 . In proceeding now with the more immediate object of this chapter , I shall follow the course of thought which has presented itself in my experiments . At the risk of dwelling somewhat in tedious detail , I shall also describe the different experiments from which the final arguments are drawn ; and as it will be found that the rays of light and the tithonic rays are eventually under the government of the same laws , similar expressions including the phenomena of both , I shall commence with giving the theory of the absorption of the tithonic rays first , and then show how the same theory includes the phenomena of light . This leads naturally to a division of the subject under two heads . I. Theory of absorption of the tithonic rays . II . Theory of ideal coloration. /z/ To the first of these the present chapter is devoted ; the following chapter to the second . 291 . When a beam of light has fallen on any changeaWe surface , such as a Daguerreotype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be found to have impressed a change on the sensitive surface , greater or less in amount , according to the period of its action . In effecting this it also suffers a change itself , and if received on a second similar sensitive surface , is found to have lost the quality of giving rise to the decomposition again . Two changes have , therefore , occurred , a change in the ponderable body , and a change in the incident beam . The particular experiments in proof of this fact are given in /z/ 292 . Again , let us take a second instance . As is shown in AP. , CH . XVI. , a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen in equal volumes undergoes combination by the influence of the rays of a lamp , and a rapid action , amounting to an explosion , by the brighter beams of the sun . As these gases can be obtained in a state of uniform purity , and their combination is attended with mechanical results , this forms a favourable case for a minute investigation . With one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may fall back on it for illustrations , as new phenomena arise . 293 . A mixture of chlorine and hydrogen , such as has been referred to , was placed in a vessel made of plate glass , having flat and parallel sides ; it was 7 inches high , 2 broad , and 2 ' 6 deep . It was so arranged on a small porcelain trough , that it could be used as a gas jar . The rays of an argand lamp , properly situated , were made to pass through it ; they therefore went through a depth of the compound gases of 2-6 inches . In Jig . 123 , A is the lamp , so adjusted as to burn steadily , B the vessel containing the chlorine and hydrogen , C the porcelain trough , in which was placed a saturated solution of common salt , which acts on the chlorine slowly , and therefore allows us to make any necessary experiments without much change happening in the gases under trial . At D was placed a tithonometer ( Ap. , CH . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after they had emerged from the chlorine and hydrogen . 294 . Two separate phenomena were now apparent : first , the mixture of chlorine and hydrogen began to unite under the influence of the rays of the lamp ; second , the rays which had passed through the mixture had lost very much of their chemical power . It was not totally extinct , but the tithonometer showed that it had undergone a very great diminution . 295 . We see , therefore , that on its passage through a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen , the beam has become detithonized . Simultaneously , and in producing this result , we see that the sensitive mixture has become tithonized . The connexion and sequence of the phenomena are apparent . The beam has undergone a change itself in producing a given change in the ponderable matter . But this is the same conclusion that was furnished us by the rougher experiment with iodide of silver above quoted ( Ap. , 595 ) . 296 . At this stage of our inquiries , therefore , we have already fallen upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for we perceive that , whenever tithonic rays produce a change on a sensitive mixture , they must necessarily undergo a change themselves , and become partially or perfectly detithonized. /z/ 297 . From this point our inquiries naturally branch in two directions . First , The consideration of what happens to the substance which is thus in the act of being changed or tithonized . Second , What happens to the ray in undergoing its converse change , or being detithonized . These I shall discuss in succession . 298 . Phenomena of the Tithonization of Chlorine and Hydrogen . The tithonometer enables us to ascertain the leading phenomena in a very satisfactory manner . Its sensitive material being ( Ap. , 838 ) the very mixture the properties of which we are considering , to determine the changes , and the rapidity of the changes which take place in that mixture , we are only required to place a tithonometer in the rays of a lamp , remove all external sources of disturbance , such as the action of radiant heat , &c.; and note the results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed the arrangement represented in Jig . 124 . A is an argand lamp , which , during the period of observation , burns with uniformity . In front of this , and at a distance of about two inches , an arrangement of double convex lenses , B , is placed . Beyond , at a distance of 7 inches , is a second convex lens , 3-5 inches focus . Between B and C , a metallic screen , E , is arranged , so that it can be easily removed or replaced , according as it is desired , to allow the rays of the lamp to fall upon the tithonometer , or to cut them off . 300 . The mode of action of the lenses of this arrangement is , to give a uniform disc of light , M , on the sentient tube of the tithonometer . When a piece of white paper is placed so as to receive this , in front of the instrument , there is a circular disc , which is equally luminous all over . If this condition be not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be moved and adjusted until the illumination is sensibly the same . We have then the sentient tube of the tithonometer plunged in an area of light which remains uniform in intensity during the period of our researches . 301 . In this invariable disc of light we have to expose the mixture of chlorine and hydrogen , and mark on the scale of the tithonometer the progress of its union . This we do by noticing how many seconds elapse before the contraction arising from the production of muriatic acid begins , and then how many seconds elapse as the liquid in the index tube passes over each division . 302 . In a particular experiment of this kind , the following numerical determinations were obtained : 303 . On removing the screen E , and allowing the rays to fall on the sensitive mixture , first of all an expansion , amounting to half a degree upon the scale , was observed . In sixty seconds this expansion ceased . 304 . The mixture now remained stationary , no apparent change going on in it . At length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contract , and muriatic acid to form . 305 . At the end of 45 seconds more , a contraction of half a degree had been accomplished ; the dimensions of the mixture were therefore now the same as when the experiment first began ; this half degree of contraction compensating for the half degree of expansion . 306 . The number of seconds which elapsed as the liquid descended over the scale , /z/ through contraction of the sentient gases , was now determined . These numbers are contained in the following table . In one column is given the number of each division ; in the adjacent one , the period of contraction through it . Spaces . Time in Seconds . Spaces . Time in Seconds . Expanded degree in . . . ' /z/ Movement commenced . . . /z/ Reached J degree of expansion /z/ Let us now take these observations and project them , as is done in Jig . 125 , the amount of contraction representing the quantities of gases that have united being laid off on the axis of abscissas , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of rays which have fallen on the sentient mixture ; consequently , the ordinates of that curve represent the quantities of tithonic rays , and the abscissas the corresponding chemical effects . 307 . Inspection of the curve shows its peculiarities at once . We see that after the first preliminary expansion has taken place , expressed by that portion between a and l , for a certain space of time , although rays are constantly falling on the mixture and being absorbed , no visible effect is produced , there being neither expansion nor contraction , as is shown by b c . A certain space of time , amounting in this instance to 270 seconds , being now accomplished , contraction , from union of the gases , begins . In that portion of the curve c d which represents the progress of the phenomenon , the curvature is perpetually diminishing , and at d approaches sensibly to a straight line . From d to e , which includes the remainder of the observations , the line preserves its rectilinear character . 308 . The study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , serves to prove that when chlorine and hydrogen unite under the influence of the tithonic rays , there are four distinct periods of action . 1st . For a brief space the mixture expands . 2d . For a much longer period it then remains wholly stationary , neither expanding nor contracting , although the rays are constantly falling on it and it is absorbing them . 3 . Contraction arising from the production of muriatic acid begins , commencing at first slowly , then more and more rapidly . 4th . And after that contraction has fairly set in , it goes on with uniformity , equal quantities of muriatic acid being produced in equal times by the action of equal quantities of the rays . 309 . If , therefore , it is permitted us to generalize from this case of the action of rays on one of the most sensitive substances known , a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen , we AND WITH DISTANCE OF THE PLATES . g wire being introduced , and the slender one taken away , the needle came again to zero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tension on the current than the slender one , either by momentum or otherwise , more electricity should have passed the secondary wire when it was used , which is not the case . 284 . Again , I took a copper wire 242 feet long and T V inch in diameter , and adjusted to it a fine iron wire as before : the extremities of this wire were tinned ; it was 12f inches long . Either of these wires being used as a discharger , brought the needle to the same point of the scale . On using the secondary wire and the long wire together , I adjusted the needle accurately to zero , and then passing the current through the fine wire and secondary wire , it came again to zero . And this was repeated often , and so near was the adjustment , that , when an assistant turned first one and then the other wire on , it could not be told which was in action , or whether the current had come along the long or the short wire . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a current , but merely serves as an obstacle ; for , in the first case , we had one wire sixteen times longer than the other , and in this we have a wire more than 230 longer than the one with which it is compared , yet the tension has increased only to the same amount in both . 285 . And the same results were obtained by the voltameter. 286 . The current that flows in a simple closed voltaic circle may be resisted in two ways : 1st , the length of the wire connecting the plates may be increased , as in the foregoing experiments ; 2d , the connecting wire remaining of constant length , the distance of the plates may be increased : the result is the same in both cases , a rise of tension . /z/ Ex . Distance of the plates in inches . Quantity . Tension . /z/ Ill /z/ So that , whether we obstruct the current by lengthening the connecting wire or by increasing the distance of the plates , the general effect is the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the plates themselves , and not to the channel of conduction . This brings us to the third proposition , 287 . " That there are two different methods of accomplishing these disturbances , and thereby of raising the elastic force of a current . 1st . That tension may be augmented by the sacrifice of quantity ; VOLTA 'S plan of a reduplicated series , and HENRY 'S riband coil in its condition of equilibrium , being examples . 2d . By the introduction of new affinities in the exciting cells ; batteries charged with nitrosulphuric acid or sulphate of copper are examples . " 288 . A single pair of plates , under the influence of a long wire , or the spiral coil , presents a remarkable analogy to Volta 's pairs arranged in reduplicated series . In point of fact , they may be considered as scarcely differing from each other either in mode of action or in effect . The study of the single pair under this condition reveals at once the theory of the voltaic action . 289 . If we inspect tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished with the fundamental fact which is the basis of explanation . When we compare together the tension and /z/ quantity of the electricity flowing in the primary wire , we are struck with the fact , that whenever the one has increased , the other has diminished . No matter what the other conditions may be , whether the communication is made by a long wire or a short one , whether the plates are near or far apart , whenever the quantity is diminished , the tension increases ; and whenever the quantity increases , the tension is diminished . 290 . The remarkable analogy of the ponderable elastic fluids , which , when their volume is diminished , or , in other words , condensation takes place , experience an increase of tension or elastic force , is here too broadly indicated to be mistaken . 291 . When I first saw that removing the plates to a greater distance apart determined a given rise in the elastic force of the current , for a time it appeared to me that Dr. FARADAY 'S theory of the tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must certainly be incorrect . A more extensive acquaintance with the facts has reversed that opinion . If the tension be determined by the affinity of the metal for oxygen , which must be a constant force , how comes it to pass that moving the plates to a greater distance apart can cause it to increase ? This apparent paradox , when properly understood , forms a fine illustration of the truth of the doctrine advanced in the 5th , 7th , and 8th series of that philosopher 's researches . In what follows I shall , therefore , regard those doctrines as established . 292 . Let us take a given pair of plates , and connect them together by a slender wire . We find that the quantity that the plates generate is diminished , and its tension is increased ; but that this has not happened either by gain of momentum or inductive influence in the channel of communication , and we are compelled to refer the effect to the resistance of the wire , placing the plates and the electrolyte between them in a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium , we might suppose that by continually increasing it we should continually increase the tension , and when it became infinitely great , the tension would be so too . But what is the true action of a slender wire , connecting in this way a pair of plates 1 A certain amount of electricity passes along it , but not the whole quantity that the plates could generate in a given time ; yet we can not suppose that all that does pass comes from the whole surface exposed , and not from a fractional part thereof . The water and zinc are ready to generate , and , as it were , attempting to drive a fresh quantity of electricity through the wire ; and , accordingly , as the quantity that actually passes becomes a greater and greater portion of what the system actually tends to put in motion , the tension becomes less and less . The tension would therefore become zero if the whole circle wires , plates , and electrolyte could carry all that the zinc and water could generate . The limit prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the worst conductor of the system . 293 . This hypothetical condition , of a tension ranging near zero , is most nearly approximated to in a thermal pair . 294 . Suppose , now , that everything remains the same as respects wires , electrolyte , distance of plates , &c.,; except that the dimensions of both plates are doubled . Shall we increase the tension t No ; for although the surface in action is doubled , and the absolute quantity which the system could generate is doubled , yet the quantity that /z/ passes both the primary and secondary wire is also doubled : the ratio - is therefore a the same as before . For this reason , increasing the magnitude of the plates increases the quantity only , and not the tension . 295 . Under all these circumstances , therefore , the tension depends on the ratio of the quantity that does pass the combination , to the quantity that the system tends to put in motion . 296 . Before , however , we can go farther in the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrangement of Volta , and a single pair under the influence of a long or thin wire , are , in point of fact , alike in principle , it is necessary that we should understand the nature of the different disturbing actions that may arise in the generating cells of the electromotor. 296 . I took a zinc plate 7 inches long and 3 wide , and a corresponding copper : the surface of the former was amalgamated and the latter brightened . The plates were fixed at an immovable distance from each other , and immersed in a jar containing 34 ounces of water . SULPHURIC ACID was then added by half drachms successively . /z/ Exp . Quantity of acid in drachms. qwq /z/ 298 . Here we have an exemplification of the converse of the fact already so much insisted on . As the quantity developed from the same surface gradually became greater and greater , the tension became less and less , due to the increased conducting powers of the fluid medium . It is the same effect that would have been produced by constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of increasing doses of sulphuric acid ; let us now see how NITRIC ACID will act . The copper plate being repolished , and the zinc reamalgamated , and everything else being as at the commencement of the former trial , the latter acid was now added to the cell in the same way that the former had been used . /z/ Elp .

In the general discussion of the measures given by tables E , F , G , H , I , we still see the operation of the same general law , that the tension rapidly diminishes as the acid is added , and that when the same quantity of electricity developed from the same amount of surface by these different acids is presented to the secondary wire , the quantities that can pass that wire are very different ; and on making use of these different agents , it would appear that they can give rise to currents from the same metalline surface , equal in point of quantity , but differing greatly in point of tension , in the following order , beginning with the most powerful : Sulphate of copper , Muriatic acid , Nitric acid , Sulphuric acid , Nitrosulphuric acid , 304 . Of these bodies , the muriatic acid acts probably in the way that Dr. Faraday has pointed out , but the immediate cause of the rise of tension in the others is to be traced to the circumstance that they furnish oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary current is made to depend on the tendency of the zinc and oxygen to unite , it is reasonable to suppose that that tension will increase if a new affinity be introduced , the action of which should correspond with and abet that of the zinc for oxygen . This takes place when nitric acid or an oxysalt of easy decomposibility is added to the solution . The tension of the current is not then determined by the af THEORY OP TENSION OF THE VOLTAIC BATTERY . gg finity of the zinc for oxygen only , but by all the affinities that can take place among all the bodies in the exciting cell . We are , therefore , here led to expand Dr. Faraday 's theory , and to regard what follows as directly opposed to the theory of contact . 305 . Upon these principles , in an ordinary arrangement of copper , zinc , and sulphuric acid , the tension of the current is determined , by the sum of the affinities of zinc for oxygen , and hydrogen for copper , diminished by the sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen , and hydrogen for zinc. 306 . But as , under all ordinary circumstances , the affinities of hydrogen for zinc and copper may be neglected , they being exceedingly small in comparison with the others , we may assume , 307 . That the tension of the current is equal to the affinity of oxygen for zinc , diminished by the sum of the affinities of hydrogen and copper respectively for oxygen . 308 . If now we introduce into the exciting cells nitric acid or sulphate of copper , the affinity of the nascent hydrogen for oxygen is satisfied , and the resistance from this source is nearly exterminated , and the tension of the current is then equal to the difference of the affinities of zinc and copper for oxygen . 309 . By thus exterminating the resistance arising from the affinity of hydrogen for oxygen , we succeed in raising the tension greatly ; if next we get rid of the affinity of copper for oxygen , the tension ought to become still higher . This may , in a measure , be effected by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimentally . 310 . In all these cases , in which the tension increases without loss of quantity , we directly trace the action to a disturbance in the exciting cells . In ordinary voltaic arrangements , the maximum tension is never reached , because the affinity of zinc for oxygen , which determines the current , is counteracted to a certain extent by the affinity of oxygen for hydrogen . If we satisfy that affinity , an increase of tension is the result , and accordingly as this is more and more nearly effected , more and more of the hydrogen that ought to be evolved disappears . This remarkable disappearance of hydrogen has been heretofore noticed , but the true office it served has not been detected . If a battery is charged with nitrosulphuric acid , the hydrogen evolved is no longer the equivalent of the zinc expended ; in point of fact , the gas evolved is no longer hydrogen , but a mixture of hydrogen and the binoxide of nitrogen , as is proved by its burning with a green flame . I took a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platina freshly cleaned , and placed them in a mixture of six ounces of water and one drachm of sulphuric acid , arranging an inverted tube over them , so as to collect the gas from the platina plate . I determined by weighing the zinc plate how much was expended in evolving a given quantity of gas ; and then successively adding sulphuric acid until the total amount had reached eight drachms , it appeared that in each instance it required very nearly 1-79 grains of metal ; but on adding one drachm of nitric acid to the mixture , the quantity expended rose at once to 2 ' 25 grains , and on adding a second , to 3-00 grains . 311 . Therefore , unless care is taken that no oxidizing body is present , the voltameter will give deceptive results . This important precept should be perpetually borne in mind by those who employ it in investigations . A few drops of nitric acid will at /z/ once vitiate its indications ; and there is reason to suspect that , under certain circumstances , even the dilute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deoxidation , and the evolved hydrogen indicate an amount of electricity less than is actually passing . 312 . We are , therefore , in possession of two distinct methods of indirectly increasing the tension of an electric current . The first depends on the reduction of quantity ; the second , on satisfying in the exciting cells affinities which tend to antagonize that which determines the current . // principles . It is a fact admitted on all hands , and , therefore , into the proof it is unnecessary now to go , that the apparent quantity circulating in the whole battery is not greater than that which any one of the pairs could generate . Dr. FARADAY has already shown how an enormous quantity of zinc is thus expended , the equivalent of electricity being entirely sacrificed for the sake of increasing the tension . Let us see what are the facts in the case . The first pair of plates develops by the oxidation of a portion of its zinc a certain quantity of electricity , which , passing through the electrolytic conductor , arrives at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a transit without decomposition is impossible , a decomposition which it is unable to effect . Continually tending to pass , without the passage actually taking place , it remains , as it were , on the surface of the second zinc plate , in a condensed state , reacting on the electricity which that plate is generating , compressing and being compressed by it , and , therefore , increasing its elastic force . And the same action continually occurs , and increases the tension throughout the series . 314 . A flat spiral coil , or a long connecting wire , obviously acts in the very same way . It opposes a resistance to the passage of the current , and the plate instantly becomes in a forced state . We might almost regard the electric fluid as existing upon the surface of the zinc , exerting to the utmost its elastic force to pass the barrier , and failing that , compressing the evolved fluid as fast as it is generated , and being compressed by it . This , also , is the case in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the riband coil acts simply as a long wire , and this may be regarded as its primary or statical effect . But , besides this , it gives rise to an action of an entirely different character , which Professor HENRY pointed out and explained . In the act of making and breaking contact in a system of which it forms a part , Faradian currents are generated by its successive spirals ; these currents under the latter condition , breaking contact , coincide in direction with the primary current then just ceasing to pass . We must , however , carefully distinguish between these currents and that which induced them . In this respect some philosophers have unguardedly fallen into a very remarkable mistake ; it has been supposed that when a thermo-electric current was passed through this coil , and a spark obtained , the thermal light was seen ! The case is exactly analogous to that in which similar coils pass the jaws of a horseshoe magnet ; no one supposes that the spark then elicited is due to the electricity of the magnet itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very same thing takes place when the thermal current runs through the spires of a flat coil . So /z/ far as I am informed , the magnetic spark and the true thermo-electric spark have never yet been seen . 316 . These observations are made in order that I may not be misunderstood . It is not my object to consider the different arrangements that can generate a Faradian current , and , therefore , in this point of view I dismiss the flat spiral . 317 . We now come to the fourth and last proposition , which is , " That the law which regulates the connexion of the diminution of quantity or condensation with the increase of tension , is the same as that which regulates the analogous phenomena of ponderable elastic fluids. " 318 . I have not hesitated to use the terms " compression , " " condensation , " " elastic force , " in reference to electricity , though I well know such an application is unusual . But it has seemed to me that a single pair might almost be likened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steam escape by a wide tube , its elastic force is less and less , accordingly as the escape is more free ; but , if you put upon it a narrow tube , the vapour rushes with vehemence through it , reaction in a moment occurs in the boiler , the elastic force increases , and the accumulated steam pressing heavily on its surface , the water boils in a more laboured way : this narrow tube resembles HENRY 'S coil , or a long or slender wire . 319 . The following table exhibits numerical results obtained by the aid of one of DANIELL 'S constant batteries , the tension being continually increased by the addition of successively increasing lengths of wire /z/ Quantity . Calculated . Tension . ye /z/ posed . ( EnTo'f'ditto , /z/ Wire interposed 6 feet long /z/ 320 . From this table it would appear that the addition of successively increasing lengths of wire of invariable diameter diminishes the absolute quantity of electricity flowing , but at the same time the tension is exalted . By taking the angle of torsion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is also evident that the law of the conducting power of wires given by M. LENZ holds in the case of a hydro-electric pair . This may be regarded as of some interest , inasmuch as the late Dr. RITCHIE , in certain papers read before the Royal Society , opposed to the very last this view , by the aid of numerical determinations made with the torsion balance , the instrument here employed . In reference to the third column of the table , I have calculated it in the manner given by LENZ , the value of the constant to be deduced from the reciprocals of the angles of torsion being in this case 1318 nearly . 321 . While , therefore , these results confirm , in the most pointed manner , the reasoning of that able philosopher , they at the same time compel us to advance a step far- /z/ ther , and to expand , to a certain extent , OHM 'S theory of the voltaic pile . It is a condition , in tracing the action of wires of different lengths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is under all circumstances constant , and hence it may be conveniently represented by unity . But the electromotive power of any pair plainly depends on two things : the quantity of electricity that the pair can evolve , and its absolute tension . The theory of OHM , as may be gathered from the memoir of Professor JACOB : on electromotive machines , and also from M. LENZ 'S papers , confounds those two important conditions . 322 . Now the results given in the foregoing table , proving that wires conduct in the inverse ratio of their lengths , prove , also , that the addition of increasing lengths of wire does not in any wise alter the electromotive power ; yet we have clearly shown that this addition is inevitably attended with an increase of tension . Here , therefore , is an apparent contradiction . 323 . But this contradiction is only apparent , and , when properly understood , leads to a most remarkable result . 324 . It is true that we are compelled to assume that the electro-motive power of a pair is independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constancy of electromotive power does not necessarily imply that the relations of quantity and tension , which conjointly produce it , are not themselves variable . In the case before us , we have direct proof that the tension increases , and also that the quantity decreases , as the connecting wire becomes longer , and the converse ; yet the electromotive power varying directly with them both , they must of necessity bear such a relation to each other , that their product shall always be equal to unity . Hence we infer , 325 . That the law of MARRIOTTE in relation to the ponderable elastic fluids holds , also , in the case of electricity developed by voltaic action , the elastic force or tension of a given quantity being inversely as the space it occupies . 326 . The following table will at the same time establish LENZ 'S law in the case of thermo-electric currents , and prove that even in cases where the tension is so exceedingly low . the elastic force of a given quantity of electricity follows the above-named law . /z/ Quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /z/ Interposed wire 1 foot long /z/ /z/ The current here experimented with was generated by a pair of wires of copper and tinned iron T V inch in diameter , and one foot long , the soldered extremity being immersed in a bath of boiling water , and the free extremity carefully maintained at 59 Fahr. ; the third column in the table being calculated by the aid of the constant 1527. 327 . As respects electricity of high tension , a law extremely analogous to that here indicated may be traced . The striking distance varies directly as the quantity accumulates . If a given jar be successively charged with quantities of electricity , as the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , &c.,; the intervals of air through which the spark can pass vary di- /z/ rectly as those numbers . This is abundantly shown by the experiments of LANE , HARRIS , and other philosophers . 328 . Now upon what does this striking distance depend I Plainly upon the elastic force of the coerced fluid , and therefore the striking distance will measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given surface increasing quantities of the electric fluid , and find that the law in relation to its elastic force is , that the tension of a given quantity is inversely as its volume . But this is the law of MARRIOTTE in relation to the ponderable elastic fluids. 329 . The following numerical determinations were made by adding successive plates to the first single hydro pair , and taking the values of the current on each addition . It is offered merely as an illustration of the chief fact under discussion , and is not to be regarded as absolutely correct , though every precaution was taken to avoid changes in the current . It shows the decrease of quantity and the increase of tension in VOLTA 'S instrument . Of course , in reasoning upon it , the hypothetical action of each plate is assumed to be equal to that of any other in the series . /z/ No. of Plates Quantity . Tension . /z/ 330 .

The beautiful experiments of BECQUEREL , and the equally elegant repetition of them by Dr. GOLDING BIRD , show that the view I have here taken of the action of a single pair is correct . The latter chemist found , that not only could a single pair decompose bodies , such as iodide of potassium , &c.,; which easily yield up their elements , but that the ammoniacal amalgam might be formed , potassium reduced , and , in point of fact , any decomposition effected . And what is the plan followed 1 The current is forced to pass , in the electrolyte that is to be decomposed , an obstacle or resisting medium ; the tension instantly rises , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle , which measures only the quantity passing in an indivisible portion of time , is barely affected . Yet , by continuing the current for a great length of time , the resulting decomposing effects are finally the same as those obtained more speedily by the action of many pairs . /z/ 332 . How far the experiments given in this memoir bear upon that part of Dr. FARADAY 'S researches , in which he has determined the relation of common and voltaic electricity by measure , would form a most important subject of investigation . The results at which he arrives are in themselves very astonishing , and are fully borne out by his decisive experiments ; but when we come to reflect that these results were obtained by the magnetic needle and electro-chemical action , we may , perhaps , pause . We may ask whether it is possible to determine by either of these means the absolute quantity of electricity that passes . Both measure , so to speak , the volume that flows , the one in an indivisible portion of time , the other that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but do either of them measure the true absolute quantity 1 Can we tell the absolute amount of a gas without first knowing its condition as to condensation ? Can we know how much electricity is upon a prime conductor , or compare it with that evolved by a voltaic pile , without first knowing its state of condensation I shall be excused for employing these expressions in an unusual way , and for reasoning about this subtle agent as though it were a ponderable body , inasmuch as it serves , without introducing any hypothesis , to give us more tangible and distinct ideas of what we might otherwise vainly attempt to express . 333 . In the December number of this journal ( L. and E. Phil . Mag. , vol xiii. , p. 401 ) , which has just reached me , I find some remarks of Dr. JACOBI on the galvanic spark . Some time ago I came , by another method of experimenting , to the same conclusion . If this spark be really projected by the tension before contact , it ought to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it will be found , on making the trial , that if an iron electrode be sealed into the upper part of a barometer tube , and the mercury made to rise gradually towards its point , the spark does not pass until apparent contact takes place : this was found in an analogous , but vain attempt to show the thermo-electric spark . It can not , however , be entirely , as that philosopher supposes , " simply a phenomenon of combustion , " as it is difficult to understand how mercury can enter into combustion in a vacuum . /z/ ( From the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine for June , 1840 . ) CONTENTS : Object of the Memoir .

BECQUEREL , /z/ as well as himself , has made experiments to determine the quantities of electricity set in motion by known increments of heat . From these experiments , they conclude that through the whole range of the thermometric scale , those quantities are directly proportional to each other . 335 . But as thermo-electric currents are now employed in a variety of delicate physical investigations , and as there appears to be much misconception as to their character , I propose in this memoir to show , 1st . That equal increments of heat do not set in motion equal quantities of electricity . 2dly . That the tension undergoes a slight increase with increase of temperature ; a phenomenon due to the increased resistance to conduction of metals , when their temperature rises . 3dly . That the quantity of electricity evolved at any given temperature is independent of the amount of heated surface ; a mere point being just as efficacious as an indefinitely extended surface . 4thly . That the quantities of electricity evolved in a pile of pairs are directly proportional to the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the comparative march of electric development , with the rise of temperature , in the case of pairs of different metals . 337 . The experimental arrangement which I have employed is represented m Jig . 31 . A A is a glass vessel about three inches in diameter , with a wide neck , through which can be inserted a mercurial thermometer , b , and one extremity of a pair of electro-motoric wires . The wires I have employed have generally been a foot long , and one sixteenth of an inch in diameter . The extremity , s , of the wires thus introduced into the vessel ought to be soldered with hard solder ; their free extremities dip into the glass cups , d d , filled with mercury , and immersed in a trough , e , containing water and pounded ice . By means of the copper wires , ff , one sixth of an inch thick , communication is established with the mercury cups of the galvanometer . The coil of this galvanometer is of copper wire one eighth of an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are astatic . The deviations were determined by the torsion of a glass thread , in the way described in Chapter VIII . 338 . It is surprising to those who have never before seen the experiment , with what promptitude and accuracy a copper and iron wire , soldered thus together , will indicate temperatures . 339 . In the arrangement now described , when an experiment has to be made , the vessel A A is to be filled two thirds full of water , the bulb of the thermometer being so adjusted as to be in the middle of the vessel , and the soldered extremity , s , of the two wires being placed in contact* with it , and a small cover with suitable apertures adjusted on the top of the vessel , so that the steam , as it is generated , may rush up alongside of the tube of the thermometer , and bring the mercurial column in it to a uniform temperature . The communicating wires , ff , are then placed in the cups , and the trough , e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded with a flannel cloth . The /z/ water in the vessel A A is then gradually raised to the boiling point by means of a spirit-lamp , and kept at that temperature until the galvanometer needles and the thermometer are quite steady . The same plan must be followed when any other temperature than 212 is under trial , for the thermo-electric wires changing their temperature more rapidly than the mercury in the thermometer , it is absolutely necessary to continue the experiment for some minutes to bring both to the same state of equilibrium . 340 . When a temperature higher than 212 Fah. , but under a red heat , is required , I substitute , in place of the vessel A A , a tubulated retort , the tubulure of which is large enough to allow the passage of the bulb of the thermometer and the wires . A quantity of mercury sufficient to fill the retort half full is then introduced , and the tubulure being closed by appropriate pieces of soapstone , the neck of the retort is inclined upward , so that the vapour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incommoding the operator . As in the former case , it is here also necessary to continue each experiment for a few minutes , to bring the thermometer and the thermal pair to the same condition . There is not much difficulty in obtaining any required temperature , by raising or lowering the wick of the lamp . 341 . The metals I have tried were in the form of wires . They were in the state found in commerce , and therefore not pure ; they were obtained in the shops of Phil-adelphia /z/ Names of the pairs of Metals . Temperatures ( Fahr. ) . /z/ Copper and iron .

The quantities of electricity evolved , as estimated by the torsion of a glass thread , are ranged in columns under their corresponding temperatures . Each series of numbers is the mean of four trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly ever amounted to more than one degree . 342 . Now if this table be constructed , the temperatures being ranged along the axis of abscissas , and the quantities of electricity being represented by corresponding ordinates , we shall have results similar to those given in Jig . 32 , in which it is to be observed that the curves given by the systems of silver and iron , copper and iron , and palladium and iron , are concave to the axis of abscissas ; but those given by platina and copper , silver and palladium , and platina and iron , are convex . 343 . Let us now apply the numbers obtained by these several pairs for the calculation of temperatures , which will set their action in a more striking point of view . The following table contains such a calculation , on the supposition that for the 90 degrees from 32 Fahr. to 122 Fahr. , the increments of electricity are proportional to the temperatures . /z/ Temperatures by the Mercurial Thermometer . /z/ Water boils . . ercury bo Is * I Copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Iron and palladium g. j Platina and copper !

We are therefore led to the general conclusion that , in these six different systems of metals , the developments of electricity do not increase proportionally with the temperatures , but in some with greater rapidity , and in others with less . 345 . The results here given I have corroborated in a variety ot ways , and with a variety of wires . A pair , consisting of copper and platina , gave for the temperature of tin , when in the act of congealing , 452 Fahr. instead of 442 Fahr. , the point usually taken . For the melting point of lead , it gave 942 Fahr. , instead of 612 Fahr . The melting points of tin , lead , zinc , and occasionally of antimony and bismuth , were in this manner employed , for they allow time for the working of the torsion balance , and , with the exception of bismuth , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a granular condition , before they finally solidify . The action of these metals on the thermo-electric pair is easily prevented by dipping it into a cream of pipe-clay. 346 . A pair of copper and platina gave for a dull red heat 1416 Fahr. , and for a bright red 2103 Fahr. 347 . A pair of palladium and platina gave for a dull red 1850 Fahr. , and for a bright red 2923 Fahr. 348 . Some of the combinations into which iron enters as an element give rise to remarkable results ; thus , if we project the curve given by a system of copper and iron , we shall find it resembling , " 1 . 33 , where the maximum ordinate b occurs at a temperature of about 650 Fahr. ; the point c appears to be given between 700 and 800 degrees ; d by a dull red heat ; e is very nearly the point at which an alloy of equal parts of brass and silver melts , for if the pair be soldered with this substance , it fuses when the needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder solders , or with wires simply twisted , the curve may be traced on the opposite side of the axis towards its ordinate increasing with regularity . At 60 Fahr. , taking the length of the ordinate corresponding to a temperature of 212 Fahr. as unity , the length of the maximum ordinate at b is 1-85 , very nearly . 349 . A system of silver and iron gives also a similar curve , the point b occurring at a temperature rather higher than the analogous one for the preceding system , but still below the boiling point of mercury . 350 . Now all these things serve to show that we can not determine with accuracy unknown temperatures by the aid of thermo-electric currents , on the supposition that the increments of the quantities of electricity are proportional to the increments of temperature throughout the range of the mercurial thermometer . 351 . Let us now proceed to the second proposition , " That the tension undergoes a slight increase with increase of temperature , a phenomenon due to the increased resistance to conduction of metals when their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , on consulting the following table , that pairs of different metals , at the same temperature , have tensions which are apparently very different . 353 . The currents , the tensions of which are here indicated , were generated by keeping one end of the thermal pair in boiling water , the other ends being maintained at a temperature of 32 Fah. /z/ A pair of Tension . A pair of Tension . /z/ Lead and palladium . . . /z/ Tin and iron /z/ Silver and nlatina . /z/ Platina and tin . /z/ We perceive , therefore , that there apparently exist specific differences in the qualities of electric currents derived from different sources . If , for example , we take a pair of platina and palladium , and expose it to a temperature which shall generate a current capable of deflecting the torsion balance through 1000 degrees , and then obstruct it by a wire of such dimensions as to stop one half , or only allow 500 degrees to pass , and repeat the experiment with a current generated by bismuth and antimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deflection of 1000 degrees , on making this pass through the same intercepting wire , perhaps not much more than one eighth of it will go through the galvanometer. 354 . It might be supposed that these characteristic differences of thermal currents , derived from different sources , were due to some modification of the electricity itself , similar to those of radiant heat derived from different sources , or at different temperatures , which M. MELLONI has attempted to show are analogous to the colours of light , being , like them , of different degrees of refrangibility , and permeating absorbent media with different degrees of facility . For in the same way that we regard glass as transparent to light , and rock salt as transparent to heat , so , too , we might regard a copper wire or any conducting medium as transparent to electricity . 355 . But this peculiarity of thermo-electric currents depends on the conducting resistance of the system that generates them . It is possible to give a current a higher or a lower tension , by simply making use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the foregoing table , the current from platina and palladium had a high tension , because slender wires of those metals happened to be used to generate it ; and the current from antimony and bismuth had a low tension , because thick bars of those substances were employed . In the former case , the conducting resistance was greater than in the latter , and hence the tension of the current was higher . 356 . That this is strictly true will appear on examining the current evolved by any number of systems under the same condition of resistance to condition . I took a pair of copper and iron , and soldered it to a simple pair of platina and copper , as is shown in fig. 34 , so as to form one continuous metallic line . The point of junction formed by the wires i ( iron ) and p ( platina ) was kept carefully at 63 Fah. , by immersion in a water-bath ; the point of junction , p ( platina ) and c ( copper ) , was treated in like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 212 Fah . Under these circumstances , it was found that 181 degrees of electricity were evolved , of which fifty went through a given /z/ secondary wire . Then , raising the junction p and c to 212* Fah. , and bringing e and i to 63 Fah. , there passed at the galvanometer 71 degrees , of which 19 could traverse the same secondary wire , but As 181 : 50 : : 71 : 19-6 ; and hence I infer that , where the conducting resistance is the same , the tension of currents from different sources does not differ . 357 . These results inform us how much the tension of a current depends on the resistance to conduction of the system which it traverses , as well as on the dimensions of the system itself ; an observation the value of which we shall presently see . 358 . In a great number of trials which I made , I failed in getting any trustworthy results as respects tension of currents at high temperatures , on account of the difficulty of maintaining the thermo-electric pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , a small blacklead furnace , to which was adapted a covered sandbath , into which the wires could be plunged , I succeeded at last ; for with this arrangement a regulated temperature could be kept up for a length of time . 359 . The experiment was made with care in the case of two systems of metals : 1st , copper and platina ; 2d , copper and iron . 1st . At the boiling point of water , a pair of copper and platina , the unexcited extremity of which was carefully maintained at 67 Fah. , evolved as a mean of four trials , three of which were absolutely identical , 123 degrees of electricity , of which 23 could pass a secondary wire . Then , by the aid of the furnace and sand-bath , the temperature was raised until the pair evolved 783 degrees as a mean of four trials ; of these 163 could pass the secondary wire . Now , As 783 : 163 : : 123 : 25 instead of 23 , showing , therefore , a slight rise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron gave , at the boiling point of water , 300 degrees , of which 57 passed the secondary wire . The temperature was now raised , with the following results : 490 degrees passing the primary , 95 the secondary wire . /z/ It will be understood , that although the quantities of electricity indicated in the first column do not regularly increase , the temperatures were , notwithstanding , going regularly upward ; to this peculiarity of the systems into which iron enters I have already alluded ( 348 ) . Let us now compare these measures with those obtained for the boiling point of water : As 490 : 95 : : 300 : 58 instead of 57. /z/ We find , therefore , that in the case of both these systems of metals , the tension slowly rises with increase of temperature , being much better marked in the latter than in the former instance . /z/ 361 . The increase of tension here detected depends unquestionably on increased resistance to conduction , which the wires exhibit as their temperature rises , as the following experiments show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a current at the boiling point of water , which , passing through a wire of copper eight feet long , was determined at the galvanometer to be 176 degrees . Having twisted a part of this wire into a spiral , so as to go over the flame of a spirit-lamp , 8 inches of it were thereby brought to a red heat ; the deviation of the needle fell now to 165 , being a deficit of 11 degrees . In thi , s experiment , care was taken that no heat should be transmitted along the wire to the connecting cups . 363 . The same was repeated with a piece of iron wire , of the same length and under the same circumstances . The current at first being 90 degrees , as soon as the spiral was made red hot , it fell to 61 degrees , being a deficit , therefore , of nearly one third the whole amount . 364 . To the increased resistance to conduction , occasioned by an increased temperature , we are to impute the slight rise of tension observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . 365 . We have next to show " that the quantity of electricity evolved at any given temperature is independent of the amount of heated surface ; a mere point being just as efficacious as an indefinitely extended surface . " 366 . The quantities of electricity evolved by hydro-electric pairs has been shown to increase with their surfaces , but it is not so in thermo-electric arrangements . A pair of disks of copper and iron two inches in diameter were soldered together ; they had continuous straps projecting from them , which served to connect them with the galvanometer cups . At the boiling point of water they gave 62 degrees ; on being cut down to half an inch in diameter , they still gave 62 . On the disk being entirely removed , and the copper made to touch the iron by a mere point , its extremity being roughly sharpened , the deflection was still 62. 367 . By means of a common deflecting multiplier , I obtained the following results : 1st . A copper wire being placed in a bath of mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped into it a second copper wire , the temperature of which was about 60 Fah. ; the galvanometer needles moved through 15 degrees . 2d . The cold wire being sharpened to a point , and plunged deliberately into the mercury to the bottom of the bath , the deflection was 19 degrees . 3d . But when I touched the surface of the mercury with the very point of the cold wire , there was a deflection of 60 degrees . 368 . Having laid a plate of tinned iron upon the surface of some hot mercury , it was touched with the point of the cold wire . There was a strong deflection of the needles in the opposite direction to what would have been the case had the mercury been touched , and not the iron . The under surface of the iron was therefore acting as a hot face , and the parts round the point as a cold face , being temporarily chilled by the touch of the wire . 369 . These results explain the anomalies observed by some of those who investigated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . /z/ nods in eternity ; but , whether we consider the scale of space , or of time , on which the universe is constructed , we can see that our minds are so constituted as to be equally unable to appreciate either extremity ; that we can attach no just idea to what is either infinitely great or infinitely small ; and that therefore our views do not always justly apply in natural events . Of one thing we may rest assured , that no matter how great the periods that may be required for the phenomena of the universe to transpire , there has been , and there will be time enough for their endless repetition . 385 . From considering what takes place when a green leaf is enlightened by the sun , we are thus allured to pass on step by step to reflections on the history of the solar system , and to changes which have happened to the earth . In the same way that the stem of an exogenous tree is a lasting record and memorial of the returning summers it has witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one season , and being , so to speak , an index of the amount of light which has been at play ; or , when casting our eyes over the climates of the earth , we observe in the tropics a rank vegetation , and trees and flowers flourishing all the year round ; or , coming to the temperate zones , we find a hardier growth , and the soil only yielding its fruits to human industry and skill ; or , passing towards the poles , the stunted plants , and lichens , and mosses , and great plains covered with perpetual snow , and even in these inclement regions all vital operations under the control of astronomical causes . Do not all these serve to set forth the entire control which the solar rays have over these phenomena , and teach us that the same kind of reasoning which applies to things taking place in our time , applies also to things which have preceded it ; that if the section of an exogenous stem , or the climate-distribution of plants , point out a present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those fossils which are dug out of the ground point to similar relations in former times ; their magnitude and luxuriance indicate a more brilliant ray . From the beginning of things no natural law has ever changed ; results are obtained in these times by the same operations or mechanism by which they were obtained of old . As with us , so then , when the sunbeam falls on a leaf the yellow ray is absorbed , and if carbonic acid is present , it undergoes decomposition , green matter is rapidly formed , a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen gases is emitted , and carbon , oxygen , hydrogen , and nitrogen are fixed in the plant . The seat of this action is now , as it was then , that face of the leaf which is exposed to the sky ; and the nutritious juice thus formed turning over to the under face of the leaf , is there concentrated by the evaporatory action of the stomata . From these chemical changes mechanical forces arise , and the nutritious sap is impelled downward , or brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sugar , and gum , and starch , and woody fibre , albumen , fibrine , &c.,; are formed , and these are lodged in various parts , or stored up for the farther purposes of the economy . 386 . I regard , therefore , the sunlight , when acting upon plants , as operating exactly in the same way as the chemical rays or radiant heat , when they produce their specific phenomena . That , first of all , a certain absorption takes place , which seems to be unattended with any direct effect , and of the nature of which we have only an indistinct idea ; that when this is over , the rays continuing to act , and the tissue of the leaves /z/ being filled with water holding carbonic acid in solution , part of which acid has been derived from the air , and part brought through the spongioles from the soil , decomposition takes place a decomposition accomplished under the law of the definite action of light ; that if the rays increase in brilliancy , the chemical result goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chemical result correspondingly declines ; that this action goes forward at a maximum under the influence of the yellow ray , the orange and the green coming next in rank , and the others following in the order of their illuminating power ; that from this circumstance , the extreme violet and extreme red seem to possess little activity , and the tithonic rays appear to be in no manner engaged , or engaged only in an indirect way , after the same manner as radiant heat . As fast as carbonic acid , dissolved in the vegetable juices , is disposed of , new quantities are taken up , some little coming with the ascending sap from the ground , but the great part being supplied from the air ; for , through the air , by diffusion , gases pass with great rapidity , and percolate through their films of water ( Ap. , 80 ) . By aerial currents , by the movement of the leaf an extensive and continually renewed contact with new portions of air is established ; from this the carbonic acid is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brought under the luminous influence , it undergoes decomposition , its carbon and a portion of its oxygen being appropriated ( Ap. , 818 ) , and a volume of nitrogen equal to the volume of oxygen thus appropriated , evolved along with the remaining oxygen . There is , therefore , a removal of water and carbonic acid from the air ; a fixation of carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , and nitrogen in the plant , and an evolution to the air of nitrogen and oxygen . From the constant appearance of the former of these bodies , we are led to suspect that the light acts primarily on some azotized body , the destruction or eremacausis of which is essential to the total action ( A p. , 824 ) ; while all this is going on , chlorophyl is abundantly formed , and so long as the process is accomplished , the leaves retain their green colour . 387 . On several occasions it has been said , that the phenomenon here described answers to a true digestive , and not to a respiratory process ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function ; but it is obvious that it does not answer to respiration , either in mode of operation or in result . Respiration is an oxydizing process , the object of which is to maintain the animal machine at a fixed thermometric point a result which implies direct combustion or burning ; an animal , rigorously speaking , burns carbon like a locomotive engine . But in this action , on the contrary , carbon is reduced from carbonic acid , and there should be a descent of temperature instead of an elevation , a large amount of heat being absorbed heat which is furnished , under natural circumstances , by the sun , along with his light . The continued supply of heat in this way prevents us from discovering that reduction of temperature which should befall the leaf ; and , besides this , it is exposing to the open atmosphere its broad surface , and any thermometric disturbance is at once compensated by external agencies . It is possible , indeed , that the decomposing process could not go on , save under the conjoint presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these agents discharge may be different . The action of leaves in the sunshine bears , therefore , no sort of analogy , either in manner or in result , to the respiratory processes /z/ of animals , no matter whether the mechanism be the lungs of a mammalian or the branchial organs of fishes . Every variety of breathing apparatus has for its object the evolution of heat by the oxidation of carbon , or of carbon and hydrogen conjointly ; but the object of the agency of leaves upon the air is to obtain from it carbon , or carbon and hydrogen . At certain periods of their history , plants themselves become machines of combustion , when the process of fertilization requires that for a time , in a given place , and for a specific object , there should be an elevation of temperature . Resort is then had to those same processes which obtain in animal systems ; and sugar , or what comes to the same thing , honey , is burned . /z/ CONTENTS : Movements described .

' Connexion beticeen the Colour of the Sky and the Vertical Position of Stems . The Roots recede from the Violet Light . Movement begins in the Violet . Lateral Flexure of the Roots . It is towards the Red . It commences with the Yellow Ray . 388 . THE tendency exhibited by the parts of plants to move under the influence of light has been known for a long time . Such motions are produced in a striking manner when a beam enters a dark cellar in which plants are caused to grow , their stems directing themselves to the luminous place . Under other circumstances a reverse motion ensues , and the vegetable parts , instead of moving to the light , seem to retreat from it . 389 . Artificial light , such as that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are very flexible . A crop of young turnips , which has been caused to grow in the dark , when set before a lamp soon exhibits the phenomenon in question . Each plant is disturbed from its perpendicular position , and is caused to incline to the rays . While this result seems to hold very generally with the stems , it is different with the roots . When plants are caused to be developed on the surface of water contained in glass vessels , in many cases their roots retire from the light , as M. PAYER has observed in the cabbage and white mustard . This action appears to take place upon the spongiole , which is the only part increasing in length , so that as it grows the rootlet curves . The curvature differs entirely from that of the stems , in the case of which it is only transient . Stems which have been disturbed from their perpendicu- /z/ larity by a lateral light recover their original position in the dark , but in the case of the roots the flexure remains . 390 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum-ray which directs these singular movements . In 1817 , Dr. FOGG ion attempted the solution of the problem in the case of the stems , by comparing the flexures obtained in the violet and red rays . His experiments were , however , roughly made ; for , not possessing a heliostat , or any means of rendering his spectrum stationary , he resorted to the tedious and uncertain process of following the movements of the ray in the dark chamber by the hand . He came to the conclusion that the violet was three times as powerful as the red ray . 391 . The first correct solution of this problem was obtained in 843 by Dr. GARDNER , and less perfectly , about the same time , by M. PAYER , whose memoir , presented to the French Academy , was reported upon in June , 1844 , by a committee , consisting of MM . MIRBEL , BECQUEREL , POUILLET , and DUTROCHET . This commission repeated the experiments of Dr. GARDNER , and verified them , and corrected those of M. PAYER . 392 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised in the dark to a solar spectrum fixed by a heliostat , Dr. GARDNER discovered that the young stems bent in two different directions : 1st . They bent towards the prism , or the light , and that under the influence of all the coloured rays ; 2d . They bent towards the space which is illuminated by the indigo rays , so that the plants illuminated by the red , orange , yellow , green , and blue rays , on one side , incline towards the space illuminated by the indigo rays ; while , on the other side , the plants illuminated by the violet incline towards the same indigo region , the crop taking the appearance of a field of corn blown by two opposite winds . The plants which are illuminated by the indigo rays offer but one of these tendencies to flexure , that which directs them towards the prism or towards the light . " " From these experiments , he concludes that the force which produces the bending of stems laterally in the solar spectrum resides in the indigo ray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they are much more easy to bend . It requires but one or two hours for the phenomena to manifest themselves . They are equally observed in making use of the light of the moon . " 393 . " The first movement which is observed in vegetable stems is that of their flexure towards the prism , that is to say , towards the light . This movement always commences to manifest itself in the stems submitted to the violet rays . To this we have never seen an exception . The motion of flexure towards the prism is then exhibited by the steins iu the . indigo and blue , and ordinarily , at the same time , in the lavender rays , which form the almost invisible continuation of the spectrum beyond the violet . Then the steins situated in the yellow and green rays commence to bend ; then follow those in the orange . The stems which are situated in the red bend the last . " 394 . " We have hitherto said nothing of the lateral flexure of the stems discovered by Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself until half an hour , or even an hour , after the flexure of the stems towards the prism in the violet rays . This lateral flexure or bending in the direction of the length of the solar spectrum commences always in the stems situated in the yellow , and there it often precedes /z/ the flexure towards the prism or the light . In this case we see the stems bend themselves exclusively towards the space illuminated by the green rays . A little later , when the tendency of flexure towards the prism manifests itself in the stems situated in the yellow rays , they cease to be bent exclusively in the longitudinal direction of the solar spectrum , and follow obliquely the resultant of two rectangular tendencies which solicit them . The stems situated in the orange and green rays , adjacent to the yellow , soon take on the same oblique lateral flexure ; it manifests itself then in those situated in the red ; then , in the last place , in the green and adjacent blue . In the indigo , the stems remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an hour after the stems situated in the yellow rays have commenced to bend laterally , that those situated in the violet , long before bent towards the prism , begin to take a lateral flexure , which is in the opposite direction of that of the red , orange , yellow , blue , and green ones . They bend then obliquely towards the stems situated in the indigo rays . " ( Extracts from the Comptes Rendus , Juin , 1844. ) // lateral flexure takes place is commonly in the indigo , there are cases in which this is departed from . Once they saw it in the violet , and , in another instance , they met with two points , one , very feebly marked , in the violet , and the other , much more strongly , in the green . While the movement towards the prism often extends a considerable distance beyond the two visible extremities of the spectrum , the lateral motion is never seen in plants placed beyond those limits , nor is it manifested at all in feeble lights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prismatic spectrum as taking place in two directions , 1st . Towards the source of the light ; 2d . Towards the indigo rays ; the following tables exhibit the relative activity of the different rays in producing these several effects : 1st . Direct motion towards the light is brought about by the rays in the following order : 1 . Violet . 2 . Indigo . 3 . Blue . 4 . Lavender . 5 . Yellow . 6 . Green . 7 . Orange . 8 . Red . 2d . Lateral motion towards the indigo ray is brought about by the rays in the following order : 1 . Yellow . ( Red . ( Orange . , Greenish blue . ' Greenish yellow . It has been suggested that the cause of the lateral motion is the indigo light reflected by the plants which are in that ray ; for , being brightly illuminated by it , they send it in all directions , each plant becoming thus a distant source of disturbance . It is known that the amount of light necessary to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion commences in the yellow , and not in the blue ray , which , from /z/ its position , might be supposed to be under the most powerful influence , as being nearest to the source of disturbance , admits of a ready explanation ; for in the yellow ray the tendency to move towards the prism is so small , that a slight lateral force is sufficient to turn the stems entirely in any direction , while in the blue , the tendency to the prism being very great , the lateral motion is correspondingly less apparent . 397 . The indigo ray thus directing the movements of stems , Dr. GARDNER suggests whether this may not be one of the causes which bring about the upright growth of trees . Obviously , upon these principles , the blue colour of the sky , acting like the blue portion of the spectrum , ought to exert an influence on steins , bringing them into a perpendicular position ; but that this does not account for the phenomenon entirely is evident from the circumstance that , although stems may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright . 398 . The roots of many plants , as has been said , recede from the light . When white mustard is made to grow upon the surface of water , the seeds being supported on pieces of cork , the roots bend from the light and the stems towards it . If this experiment be made in the spectrum , after the course of a few hours it will be found that this motion of retrocession commences in the violet ray , then goes on in the indigo and blue , then in the lavender . Thus the first movement of the roots occurs in the same ray as that of the stems , and the order for the other rays appears to be nearly the same . 399 . A lateral flexure for the roots is also observed . It commences in the yellow , then in the orange , then in " the green rays which are next to the orange , then in the green and blue . It is directed towards the red space . This flexure being combined with that of retrocession from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of the roots are curved in the resultant of these tendencies . 400 . " Thus the retrocession from the light by the roots commences in the yellow rays , as is the case for the flexure of the stems to the light , and for their lateral flexure ; but all the movements of the roots are the inverse of those of the stems . For the stems there is flexure towards the light and flexure towards the space illuminated by the indigo rays , while for the roots there is flexure to retreat from the light and flexure to retreat from the indigo space . The latter mode of flexure is not presented to us in roots submitted to the red rays , nor in those which are in the violet , and this probably because in those two rays the tendency for lateral movement is to the feeblest extent . Even in the case of stems , when the light is not sufficiently intense , lateral flexure does not manifest itself in those same red and violet rays . " ( Comptes Rendus. 401 . In estimating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments , it should be recollected that there is a difference between its apparent and true place , that difference being greater according as the ray is more refrangible . This arises from the circumstance already pointed out , that at the violet end of the spectrum the colours are widely spread out ( 183 ) . The increased dispersion which these rays undergo of course affects the position of the maximum point , and renders the force of the ray less than it ought to be . If the prism gave the same concentration to the indigo and violet region which it gives to the red and orange , the relative activity of /z/ those regions would be greatly increased , and the position of maximum action changed . In addition to this , it is obvious that , in such experiments as this of the bending of stems , the entire appearance of the resulting phenomenon may be affected , when we contrast the action of rays so widely apart as the violet and the yellow . By the action of absorbent media , it appears that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other of the principles in the solar ray . When troughs containing coloured solutions , such as bichromate of potash , or sulphocyanate of iron , are employed to intercept the rays previously to their impinging on the stems , it may be proved that the calorific and chemical radiations are not involved in these operations . /z/ CONTENTS : Subdivisions of Nervous Mechanism in Animals .

Conclusion . // attention of physiologists to the fact that different portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spinal axis there is one column devoted to sensation , and another to motion . This division of offices is doubtless carried to a far greater extent than we have at present any means of proving . Analogy would lead us to suppose tha-t every function is represented by its own appropriate mechanism . It is not alone in the great and more striking characteristic divisions of action that these divisions of machinery are observed ; the cerebrum , the cerebellum , or the sympathetic system , being each devoted to its specific end , they doubtless , also , exist on a far more minute scale , in connexion with more trivial purposes . 403 . If , thus , the intellectual processes and processes of movement , which are things appertaining to the interior constitution of the animal system , are under the control of a divided agency , a similar plan is resorted to in the case of those functions which put the system in relation and communication with the exterior world . On these , the outward physical agents have to expend their operation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the images of outward forms , transmits them to the brain . To that cerebral tract to which it goes , the power is given to be affected by luminous /z/ agency ; it is immaterial whether that agency consist of undulations of an ethereal medium , or spend itself in producing a chemical change of the retina . Theportio mollis of the seventh pair , also , exposes itself in the cochlea of the ear , and having the function of audition committed to it , vibrates correspondingly to those oscillatory movements in the atmosphere which constitute sound . So , too , with the olfactory nerve , which , pushing its way through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone , expands in a million of ramified branches on the Schniderian membrane , and is ready to be impressed by odours or smells . There is no such thing as a mutual convertibility of the offices of these different machines ; no vicarious interchange of action ; each one has its own duty to perform , each has to discharge its proper task , and the construction of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of result arises ; the telescope will not answer for a piano , nor the piano for a telescope . 404 . While thus the different senses of sight , of smell , of hearing , of taste , and of touch , and all the different functions which occur in animal frames , are carried on by their own appropriate enginery , and resort had to optic , auditory , olfactory , and respiratory cords , these several contrivances are so arranged that the final result of their operation converges inward , and is at last expended on the same point from which also spring all the various acts of thought and intellectuality . Of that central point which is thus in incessant agitation during the continuance of animal life , perpetually receiving impressions from outward objects or the external world , perpetually , also , reflecting back again the various determinations of the mind , how rapid and how constant must be the movement ! We can not comprehend how it is possible that an ethereal particle , vibrating so as to produce violet light , oscillates backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millionth part of a second ; yet this is a fact as well established as any other fact in the domain of science . What , then , shall we say of that central point of reception which is within the brain , which stands ready to execute at once all the synchronous movements impressed upon it by the various colours of light , all the vibrations of simultaneously occurring and harmonious sounds , all the impressions which are brought to it by the apparatus of the senses ! During the time of wakefulness , how is it agitated by these various movements ! and during the time of sleep , its activity is still expressed by those phantoms which we see in dreams . As , at a telegraphic station , the observer watches the various signals through his telescope , and reports to his government the intelligence which is arriving , so that central vibrating point reports to the MIND the telegraphic despatches that are coming along the different nerves . Nor is it impossible that one material atom , or even a small congeries of atoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand different ways ; a particle of water on the surface of the ocean may be simultaneously affected by millions of waves , which may go forth from it and separate without disturbing the movements of each other ; a particle of ether may be acted upon by every possible ray of light that can reach it it will be affected by the general action of all , and each one will go forth and separate from all the others , undisturbed by , and undisturbing them . But even were it not a single physical point a physical point in our ordinary idea of that termeven were it the whole brain which is thus agitated and acted on , what but /z/ a point in comparison with the world from which it gathers its intelligence , is the whole mass of the brain ! Is it not affected by light which has come from systems of suns at the uttermost ends of the universe ? Does it not watch the rotation of double stars of different colours , which occupy enormous periods of time to complete their revolutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nervous action in animals is thus carried on by a complicated mechanism , and the nervous agent , though ordinarily spoken of as " one and indivisible , " presents itself to our view as the reunion of many forces , or as one force with many modifications . To the immaterial and responsible principle which is within us , it stands in the character of a minister and messenger , to connect it with the outward natural world , to gather impressions and enable it to react on material things . Hence arises that subdivision of functions of which we have been speaking , a subdivision not only affecting external impressions , but also the corresponding individual actions . The nervous and optical mechanism of the eye is so arranged as to have entire charge over the reception of impressions conveyed by the luminiferous ether ; the auditory mechanism of the ear is constituted so as to receive undulations of gaseous bodies like atmospheric air ; and , correspondingly , if intelligence has to be communicated to a distance , and received by other minds through the agency of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in action , the fingers move , and letters appear upon the paper . 406 . In steam-engines or other automatic machines , our admiration is chiefly aroused by the regular and consentaneous manner in which their movements are performed . At the proper instant the proper valves are sprung , and the intricate motions go on with regularity . No one can have seen a large cotton or silk factory in which the machinery is driven by one of these engines without being struck with this remark . Perhaps it is weaving an elaborate pattern , and , with a discretion that almost simulates intelligence , is putting in or leaving out the variously-coloured threads . To produce this , a series of contrivances is made to intervene between the point of action and the motive force , and accordingly as the result is different , so must that intervening mechanism vary . In animal systems , the same observation holds good : impressions which come to us from the external world , and movements which result from mental operations , are all transmitted by their proper channels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been observed that the type on which vegetables have been constructed bears a remarkable relation to the type of animals . In the latter all the processes of organic life , such as digestion , respiration , secretion , are carried forward in interior cavities ; in the former they are surface actions . Thus , the stomach , the digestive organ , is enclosed in an interior space , but the leaf , which is the analogous organ for plants , is freely exposed , and digestion takes place upon the surface . So , too , with respiration , the lungs of the mammalia are placed within the walls of the chest , and receiving oxygen from the air , transmit it by the arterial blood to the capillary vessels , in which the combustion of carbon is going on ; but when in plants the same result is to be attained , oxydation takes place on the petals of the corolla , which is another surface action . In animals the attempt is to centralize everything , to make all the functions subservient to the perfect development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sensation go , and from which all volitions and motions arise . In plants , the attempt is to diffuse everything , to have no centre of action , but to execute upon the periphery . It is true that the lower order of animals are constructed on this type of diffusion , and it is interesting to see , when in more advanced tribes the attempt at centralization begins , how rapidly it goes on to perfect development . The appearance of an isolated organ of digestion a stomach is the signal of an isolated organ of circulation a heart no matter though that heart may be a mere tube , as the dorsal vessel of many insects . 408 . If thus , in animal existence , we find the various nervous machines divided off , and the impressions of light , of sound , of taste , committed to separate apparatus , how is it with plants 1 The rays of the sun are the true nervous principle of plants ! And herein we see how closely the type of surface action is observed . On all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and offer a broad surface to the sky . On these the rays fall , and direct the digestive and other processes . When they are carried on in interior cavities , and the living system assumes a certain mass , an oxydating machine is demanded in order to keep up the temperature of the whole by the burning of carbon , and lungs , or gills , or other suitable contrivances , are resorted to . But the principle on which the vegetable organization is constructed is simple , and except on those particular occasions to which reference has been made ( 387 ) , an apparatus of combustion is not wanted . For with the rays of light which come from the sun there are also rays of heat , and these impinging on the outside surface , which is the seat of all the vegetable activity , are absorbed , and bring up the temperature to the required point . What need is there for the burning of carbon or of hydrogen , when on all sides radiant heat is pouring in 1 Nature , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this elevation of temperature , and when the direct beams do not reach them , warm currents of air that rise from the heated ground are everywhere present . 409 . In a chemical point of view , it is the quality of light to produce the organization of molecules , that is , to determine the positions of atoms as respects each other ; it is the quality of heat to determine their distances ; for the accumulation of caloric in a body produces an expansion , a diminution of it a contraction . Light and heat , therefore , have totally different offices to discharge , and the seats of their respective actions are in most instances distinct . In horizontal leaves it is chiefly on the upper face that light acts ; this , looking towards the sky , is ready to receive rays coming from every part ; it is on the under face that heat operates , directing in a great measure through the stomata the evaporation of water . An advantage for these latter organs is , therefore , gained . Exposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual disturbance , every cloud which passed over the sun would keep them in a constant agitation , and interfere with their regularity of action . One of the most prominent differences between light and heat is in their mode of propagation through bodies ; the force of the former is expended on the point upon which it falls ; there is nothing after the manner of conduction or lateral propagation ; it is also the same with the tithonic rays ( Ap. , 608 ) . For this reason , when an image falls on a sensitive plate /z/ in the camera obscura , a photogenic copy is obtained , every line being represented with mathematical accuracy and the utmost sharpness ; the radiation , having impinged upon the plate , does not spread itself out laterally or undergo a process of conduction , but only produces its effect on the portions which lie directly in the lines of light . With radiant heat it is very different : a beam of this agent falling upon a limited portion of a metallic plate , slowly affects all the rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to point , and by-and-by the whole mass undergoes an elevation . While light and the tithonic rays , therefore , are not liable to conduction , the reverse holds in the case of heat . Applying these reasons to the instance before us , the rays of light which control the digestive operation could only act in an imperfect way on the under side of a horizontal leaf ; they must produce their maximum effect on the surface exposed , and operate elsewhere through imperfect translucency , finding their way through short distances , because the tissues are not perfectly opaque . But the rays of heat , which , with the light , fall on the upper face , are conducted with facility , or transfused by warming the watery juices which are circulating through the organ . Whatever changes , therefore , take place abruptly in the quantity of the incident rays , as when clouds are suddenly crossing the sun , are not abruptly felt upon the stomata , for the leaf , thin as it is , acts as a regulator , and , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the ascending sap also , which is coming through the petiole , is coming at an elevated temperature , for , in the course of its ascent from the roots , it has been warmed in its passage through the stem which is enveloped in its dark-coloured bark a colour well adapted to receive the effects of the rays of heat . There is , therefore , a reason why the stomata are secreted in the shade , and why the seat of the digestive action lies on the upper face of the leaf . 410 . Besides these well-marked differences of action produced by the rays of light and of heat conjointly in the sunbeam , there are specific effects produced by the various coloured rays ; thus , the yellow seems to control digestion , and , as Dr. GARDNER has proved ( Phil . Mag. , Jan. , 1844 ) , the blue ray motion . Investigations of the different effects produced by the other rays of light , such as the green , the violet , the red , or by those other principles which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet be said to have been made . Each of these comprises rays differing in constitution , and differing in refrangibility , and , doubtless , to each one specific effects are due ; thus , it appears from the experiments of DAGUERRE and NEIPCE , that the tithonic rays have the quality of changing the constitution of resinous bodies . There is , indeed , scarcely one of the productions of vegetable life which is not characterized by the facility with which it undergoes mutations under the influence of these principles ; thus , wax , which is yellow , bleaches rapidly ; chlorophyl , which is green , turns gray ; the volatile oils harden , as is often observed ; the oil of oranges turns red ; guiacum , from a yellowish brown , turns green or blue ; the colouring principle of most petals is destroyed ; for example , the beautiful red of carthamus , and the purple of violets , is rapidly bleached ; woody fibre also undergoes a disintegration , and , indeed , there is scarcely a vegetable product on which some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The extensive series of experiments made by Sir J. HERSCHEL on the /z/ action of light on different vegetable colours serves to prove that there is scarcely a ray which is not implicated in these processes ; sometimes it is the red , sometimes the yellow , sometimes the blue . So , too , with rays differing specifically , the rays of heat of different refrangibilities , and the tithonic rays . 411 . In the lower orders of animal life , the controlling influence of the same agents which are thus so active in the vegetable world is well marked ; the movements of the polygastric infusorials are well known to be directed , to a certain extent , by light . There seems to be a diffused sensibility to that agent possessed by the entire surface of these beings . Comparative anatomists have traced how , from this , which is the obscurest development of specific nervous action , the nervous material begins to be collected in centres , and locomotive or respiratory ganglia make their appearance . In the case of insects , the metamorphoses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successively through the larva and pupa states , and finally reach their imago , or perfect condition , so far as the nervous system is concerned , all the transitions tend to a concentration ; the development of a new instinct , or the production of increased locomotive power , is at once expressed by changes in the magnitude or position of the nervous ganglions , or their connecting cords . It is true , that as soon as this concentration appears , it brings with it new qualities , and , in the more elevated orders of life , one of the great functions of the nervous system seems to be the establishing of sympathetic connexions between organs which are carrying on processes that are essentially different ; between the digestive , the respiratory , the secreting apparatus . Among plants , this high state of centralized organization is not required ; the sap , driven , as we have seen , by mere mechanical forces , makes its way from the spongioles to the leaves , and then commences its descent . This circulatory movement is the only bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For this reason , therefore , botanists are fully justified in their assertion , that a tree is not a simple individual , but rather a colony of individuals . It possesses no interior nervous system , the office of which is to bring into connexion parts that are distant , because the type upon which it is constructed requires no such machinery . 412 . But there are considerations which enable us to trace analogies between the mode of action of the nervous principle , even in the most elaborate forms , with those more obscure , which belong to the vegetable world . As has been fully proved by physiologists , all the nerves of special sensation take their origin amid the minute ramifications of bloodvessels ; and it is the changes which occur in the circulating fluid which impress a specific action on the nervous terminations an action at once transmitted to the centres , and there disposed of . Thus , by the heart , venous blood , from which the elements of carbonic acid have to be expelled , is thrown into the minute ramification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with the terminal fibres of the par vagum , it impresses upon them an influence an influence which is in an instant propagated to the respiratory nervous centres , and there is expended in producing a reflex effect . Through the proper nervous channels , the diaphragm , the intercostals , and the various muscles engaged in respiration , are put in action ; the capacity of the chest increases ; a few cubic inches of atmospheric air enter the trachea , and fill the /z/ larger bronchial tubes . In an instant , by diffusion ( At. , 50 ) , the oxygen of this air leaves its nitrogen , which in these circumstances is a more slowly-diffusing gas , finds its way to the minutest air-cells , passes in an instant ( Ap. , 53 ) through the thin vascular coats , interchanges with carbonic acid , and the act of arterialization is complete . The arterialization of the blood is , therefore , nothing more than an ordinary chemical process , and the nervous agency which has been brought into action is for no other end than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act of respiration is eventually carried on under the operation of chemical laws , mechanical movements have to precede . A division of those nerves puts an end to the process , not because respiration is the result of a vital , a nervous , or any other such agency , but simply because the necessary movements which end in the introduction of oxygen gas can no longer be accomplished . 413 . Now let us turn to the vegetable kingdom . As long as the sun is above the horizon , his beams , impinging upon everything , occasion an elevation of temperature . The various objects exposed the leaves of trees , the grass , and the surface of the ground become warm . Participating in this elevation of temperature , the atmospheric air has its capacity for vapour increased , and that transpiration of steam which is copiously going forward from the exposed vegetable surfaces , from the soil , and from water , raises the dew point . But on the going down of the sun , and even before the close of day , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accomplished , the temperature of the ground and of the leaves begins to fall , and by-and-by the dew point is reached , and now drops of water form on those organs , and under its influence they begin to recover the parching effect of the preceding day . The reduction of the atmospheric temperature down towards the dew point , thus brought about by the conjoint agency of the ground and the exposed parts of plants , in an instant puts a check upon evaporation from the leaves ; this , in its turn , reacts upon the ascent of the sap ; it is like putting the cover over the burner of a spirit lamp ; evaporation from the reservoir is stopped , and simultaneously , also , the current along the capillary fibres of cotton is checked . With this check upon the ascent of the sap , that store of carbonic acid gas which exists in the soil , and which arises from the decay of humus , or from artificial manures , is also preserved ; carbonic acid which , during the day , comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is decomposed by solar light . But , now , if a cloud intervenes , or the sky at night be uniformly obscured , no radiation can be accomplished , no reduction of temperature takes place , the dew point is never reached , and evaporation goes on from the leaves , and carbonic acid gas , drawn up from the spongioles , is expended . The reflex action of that radiant heat which came from the sun during the day is cut off , its passage outward into the regions of space arrested , and the dependant physiological phenomena cease to be performed . There is an analogy of effect between the temporary action of an overhanging canopy of clouds at night on the vegetable world , and the permanent injury which results to an animal when the par vagum , one of the offices of which is , at proper moments , to introduce a measured quantity of oxygen gas into the system , is divided . 414 , Where , then , do these things carry our reflections 1 What are the elevated /z/
