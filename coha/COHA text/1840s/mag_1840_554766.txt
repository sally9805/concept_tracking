txt THE Steamboat , during the last twenty years , has been the means of peopling the West with millions of enterprising and prosperous citizens . It has built up large and wealthy cities , and placed within their reach all the means of comfort , all the elegances of refinement , and every blessing , social , religious , and literary , enjoyed by the inhabitants of the seaboard . It has borne to every foreign region the surplus of those productions , with which the teeming earth has rewarded the Western cultivators . In fact , it has been just as essential to the growth of the nations , that are now expanding themselves in all the vigor of healthy , thriving youth over the prairies and forests , as the rich soil , whose products must otherwise have lain useless on their hands . And it has enabled the whole West to anticipate , by centuries , the tardy growth which seemed to be in prospect for it , when a toilsome voyage of months was necessary to bring up , against the strong current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessaries and comforts , produced in older and more civilized countries . Such magnificent results could not reasonably be expected , without some accompanying evils . The cup of good has never yet been administered unmixed to human lips ; and the amount of property that has been destroyed , the hundreds and thousands of human beings , that have been ingulfed by the turbid stream , the aching hearts of surviving // friends and bereaved families throughout every part of our country , give abundant proof , that the Father of Waters will ever and anon rebel against the dominion of man , and that his angry torrent has not yet been subdued into a safe thoroughfare , over which to float himself , and the various trophies of " his pride , his pomp , bis skill . " In truth , the accidents involving destruction of life and property , have become so frequent upon the Western rivers , that we look as regularly , when we open a newspaper , for a steatnboat disaster , as for the foreign news . The importance of the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bringing on the country , have led to statutory regulations on the part of several States , and have at last attracted the attention of the national legislature . The first result of this awakening has been , the passing of the " Act for the better security of the lives of passengers on board of vessels , propelled in whole or in part by steam . " For ourselves , we hail the movement as auspicious ; and , however short of meeting the necessities of the case , or of answering the purpose for which it was designed , this Act may be , ( as we shall have occasion in the course of this article to show that it is , ) yet , as indicating on the part of our representatives a disposition to investigate , and to do something in a matter of such extreme importance , we are disposed to rejoice , in the hope that it is the commencement of a course of leg* islation , which , if properly pursued , and rigidly enforced , must be productive of great good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our legislators to act in this business , and much of the misapprehension which is so prevalent everywhere , arises from an ignorance of the subject , - not very surprising when we reflect , that but few even of those who travel most on these waters give themselves the trouble to investigate it , and that the interest of those concerned in the building and running of boats , while it gives them the requisite information , makes them very generally unwilling or unsafe witnesses , - we hold it very desirable , that all those who possess information should give it publicity ; and it is with an earnest desire to contribute our mite towards the disseminating of correct views , that we approach the subject . The intercourse between the East and the West has become so continuous , that there are few families on the seaboard , // but have relatives or friends whose lives and safety are occasionally intrusted to a Western steamboat ; and few Eastern merchants , but are interested , more or less directly , in the safe transportation of merchandise by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times afloat on the Western waters , probably not less than fifteen thousand human hem bs , and an amount of prop*rty , in boats and cargoes , hard to be calculated . An inqtliry into the causes that render unsafe the transit of so many people , and so much property , to produce any valuable result , should extend beyond the researches of science , or the experiments of the laboratory , or the institute . We must look to the peculiar characteristics of the Western rivers , and to the construction of the boats that navigate them ; to the composition and character of their crews ; to the qualifications and habits of their captains and other officers ; and to the temper , wants , and deportment of the class of people who form the majority of their passengers . And the result will show , how far any laws that have been yet enacted are likely to go towards remedying the evils at which they are aimed , or whether those evils are within the reach of legislative remedy at all . Ingenuity may exhaust itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploded simply from the gradually increased pressure of the steam , confined by an overloaded safety-valve , from the collapsing of a bare and overheated flue , or from a certain much talked-of and mysterious explosive gas . Yet , as long as the management of so tremendous an agent as steam shall be abandoned to the control of careless , ignorant , or intemperate engineers , no perfection of boiler or engine , no strictness of periodical examination , will insure any exemption from explosion . The statutes of the general and State governments may be filled with enactments for the punishment of carelessness on the part of owners , or captain ; but , so long as boats shall be intrusted to the care of men , unfit , from their youth , inexperience , or want of moral principle , for the responsible station , so long shall we hear of their sinking , burning , and running each other down . In a community such as ours , it has long been held , that a free competition must inevitably compel those who look in // any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wants and convenience of their patrons . And there is no question , but the proverbial shrewdness of our countrymen has enabled those of them engaged in the steamboat business , after a thirty years ' experience , to settle down upon the description of conveyance , and the style of accommodation , which , by satisfying the greatest portion of the travelling public , assures to them the largest patronage . An extended experience enables us to say , that the qualities which will most effectually fill the cabin of a Western boat are not ( generally speaking ) the greater stability and experience of the captain , the safer or more substantial construction of the boat , or engine , but rather , a reputation for speed , which promises a progress of a few more miles a day , or the difference of a few dollars less in the price of the passage . It is in vain to hold it out as an inducemcnt to passengers , ( we have seen it tried , ) that any boat is furnished with the patent safety-valve , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved the faster in a trial of speed , leaves port crowded , while the empty cabin of the former causes captain and owners mentally to resolve , that the next boat they build , shall at all events he a fast one . The peculiar character of the rivers themselves forms one of the chiefs obstacles to their safe navigation . The " falling-in* ' banks of the Mississippi , Missouri , and some others of the streams , covered , as they mostly are , with a heavy growth of forest , are constantly filling the channel with obstructions of the most dangerous description . A huge tree is precipitated into the stream , and the earth adhering to the roots sinks them to the bottom , while the buoyancy of the leaves and branches , causing them to float , gives it of course a direction slanting with the current . The deposit of mud that the river ever makes about any obstruction soon anchors it . The running ice and drift-wood remove all the smaller limbs , and sharpen the main body of the tree , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a snag . Some of these snags show themselves above the surface of the water , others are entirely below it , being more or less submerged according to the stage of water . The former can of course in the day time , be easily seen and avoided ; but the latter are at all times dangerous , the break that they cause // in the current , especially if far below the surface , not being always distinguishable . The danger from this source is increased by the style of boat-building now almost universal . It was formerly usual to put a mass of solid timber in the bows of boats , and they consequently often came off from these encounters with impunity . But it was found that this substantial mode of building gave them too much draught , and that boats so constructed hadto lie by , sometimes for several months , in the season of low water . Lightness of draught , therefore , has recently been a quality especially sought after ; and it has been attained to such an extent , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more buoyant , and more frail , than the lowwater steamboat . The look-out that is kept , while the boat is under way , is by no means in general adequate to safety more especially at night . For , though this is understood to be the business of the portion of the crew on watch , yet it is a duty often but carelessly performed , and the whole affair is frequently left to the unaided vigilance of the pilot . Knowing all this , the traveller may well press an anxious pillow , while in the darkness of the night the boat is still rushing by a succession of obstacles , like those whose black and sharpened points he had watched , as they presented themselves by daylight with alarming frequency . The labors of the officer , who for several years past has been engaged , under the authority and at the expense of the United States , in removing these and other obstructions , have been doubtless most beneficial ; but , as they are continually forming , the task of their removal must be reiterated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber , which can only be effected by the cultivation of every acre of the river banks , can effectually arrest the evil . But the reasons are obvious , why , even after the whole of the interior of the countries bordering these rivers shall be settled , years must elapse before the wet and sickly bottom-lands will become the chosen and habitual residence of man . Another description of accident of frequent occurrence , arises from boats ' coming in collision . In this case , the weaker boat of the two is very apt to sink , and sometimes almost instantaneously . To the nature of the rivers , again , we must mainly look , for the frequency of this casualty . Nearly all of the Western streams run in a series of curves or // bends ; the point of one bend frequently shutting out all sight of the river beyond it . Each of these points throws the strength of the current across , and into the centre of the river , forming under itself something like a slackwater . The ascending boat takes advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore . A boat in descending , availing itself of the strong current , keeps the middle of the channel . Consequently , so long as the boats are " in the bend , " there is but little danger of collision . It is during the night , in emerging from behind these points , when it becomes necessary for the ascending boat to cross the river to get into the hollow of the next bend , or in coming suddenly from behind some one of the islands , with which the Mississippi and many of its tributaries are dotted , that these accidents mostly happen . As the two boats come instantaneously in sight of each other , their fire doors are flung open , and a prodigious glare of light is thus thrown across the waters ; hut this serves only to convince the pilot of either boat of what he was well aware of before , - that is , that his boat is in dangerous proximity to some other , while , as to the precise course the other may be steering , it affords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not surprising that the pilots sometimes lose their presence of mind . In fact , the situation of the two boats can be best understood by noticing the perplexity which sometimes attends the meeting of two persons in the street ; and the alternate dodging , the indecision , and the final collision that often winds up the encounter , afford no unapt illustration of the case in hand . There is no accident , the consequences of which are generally more frightful than this . The crash of the meeting boats , more terrific than words can express , the screams of the affrighted passengers , the utter confusion , need only the concomitant horrors of darkness , to complete a scene such as those who have once passed through it can never forget . It is impossi* ble , of course , to ascertain at once the extent of damage , or the degree of danger ; and , though one boat may go down at once , and the water be covered with her struggling crew , the alarm and confusion on board of the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the rendering of any effectual assistance ; and , when the subsiding of the panic , and the return of authority and reason , permit // an attention to the dictates of humanity , the few moments so important to many a drowning wretch may have elapsed . The astonishing depth of the Mississippi adds greatly to the danger to life , when a boat sinks from any cause . On the Ohio or Upper Mississippi , or in fact on almost any other river but this , the great height of their upper works would prevent these boats from being entirely submerged . But there are many places on this mighty stream , where a line of three hundred feet has failed to find bottom ; and this depth is retained to the very edge of the perpendicular and crumbling hank . We remember to have seen the place where a large boat sank , after being made fast to the shore , indicated only by remnants of the lines by which she was fastened to the trees . Next , perhaps , in point of frequency and danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A consideration , again , of the peculiar character of these rivers , of the construction of boats , and occasionally of the nature of their cargo , will account for the destruction of life attending accidents from this cause , on rivers , where ( as the shore is never very distant ) an easy means of escape would seem to be always at hand . It not unfrequently happens , that there are reaches on the rivers , of considerable extent , where it is impossible for boats of the larger class to land on either side . A large boat , many years ago , coming up from New Orleans , having among her freight a considerable quantity of turpentine and gunpowder , took fire at a place , where , on the one side , a falling-in hank had filled the river to a considerable distance with logs and other obstructions , and on the other a bar made out , on which she would have grounded in seven or eight feet of water . By the exertions of the captain and crew the fire was extinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suspense , of those who knew the true state of things , can hardly be imagined . A more combustible mass than the whole upper works of these boats it is difficult to conceive . And this must necessarily be the case , since lightness of draught must be united with a considerable extent of accommodation . They tower story over story , a huge pile of pine boards , ready , it would seem , to be ignited by any one of the shower of sparks which the chimneys are continually pouring over the whole boat . A spark from this source , communicating with something easily combustible , has been the origin of most of // these conflagrations . The carelessness manifested on this point is in fact appalling . It is not enough , that the piles of dry wood are placed in such dangerous proximity to the furnaces , that , every time the fires are stirred , showers of sparks are poured into the inflammahie mass ; hut crates of earthenware , every description of household furniture , and carriages wrapped in straw , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations . And , in the " cotton boats , " hales of cotton are piled over the guards and whole outside of the boat , even littering and obstructing the engine-room to such an extent as to interfere with the motions of the engineers and crew in the discharge of their duty . The burning-off of the tiller ropes , one of the first consequences of a boat 's taking fire , frequently prevents a landing even in places where it could otherwise he effected . And in order , it would seem , to preclude all possibility of escape under these circumstances , steam vessels have been known to leave port without any small boat attached to them. * Though the bursting of boilers is generally more dreaded by the inexperienced Western traveller , than any other accident , yet its consequences can be more easily avoided by the passengers in the cabin than those that ensue from most of the others . It is the deck passengers and crew , who in this case are the principal sufferers . From the greater frequency , however , with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims , it is entitled to a prominent place on the list of casualties . It is sometimes contended , that the frequency of these explosions is in no way attrihutable to the use of high steam , which is universal in the Western boats . The only plausible argument in favor of this theory is drawn from the circumstance , that , in order to meet the increased pressure , boilers are made proportionally strong , the smallness of their diameter , even when constructed of materials of no greater strength , affording a greater power of resistance . The fallacy of this argument hardly needs pointing out . For in the first place , granting that there is no greater liability to explosion in the one case , than in the other ; yet when *t* March 2d , 1838 . The Tangipaho took fire about four miles from Bri . tort Island . She had no boats attached to her . The master , pilot , and a passenrer. left the vessel on hatches , and were drowned . The mate , with the assistance of some negroes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of temporary sails . " - . Report of J. C. Larue to tire Secretary of the Treasury , p. 310 . We have made a passage in a steamboat , unprovided with any small boat whatever . // an explosion does occur with a high-steam boiler , it must be productive of a wider extent of mischief , exactly in proportion to the strength of the boiler to be overcome before it gives way . But the truth is , the whole position is a false one . Steam is now currently used , at the West , with a pressure of one hundred pounds to the square inch ; and boilers are constantly , - we believe universally , - submitted to this strain , without any previous trial whatever . There is no law requiring such trial , and none of the engine-builders , we believe , ever think of proving them . Whatever weak points there may be , that a few pounds of additional pressure might show , it is left for an excited and reckless engineer to discover , when a crowded boat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the engine-shop would have been harmless . Moreover , the peculiar construction , now universal in boilers applied to the propelling of boats , renders them liable to an accident much more common than exploding , or bursting , strictly so called . It requires no knowledge of mechanics to convince any one , upon a glance at the construction of the flue boiler , of its being much more insecure than the simple cylinder . The danger to the boiler in question arises from the water getting low , and leaving the flues bare , and liable to become red-hot from exposure to the fire , the result of which is the collapsing or forcing in of the flues , and the escape of the hot water and steam through the orifice to the destruction of every thing within their range an accident liable to happen from a variety of causes , ( such as a defect in the forcing pump , and the rolling of the boat to one side , thus allowing the water to run from the upper boilers into the lower , ) all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unremitting vigilance . The facility with which steam can be generated with a small quantity of fuel , and the less weight of water that they carry , are the advantages which have recommended these boilers to such general use . The expense of the lowpressure engine will ever prevent its introduction in these boats , as long as they are constructed with so strict a view to economy . Its complication and the consequent difficulty of repairing any derangement , and its liability to be disordered by the deposit from the muddy water , are serious objections , while long voyages have to be performed through a wilderness , where no mechanical aid is within reach , occasionally , // for hundreds of miles . And the greater weight of this description of engine , where every pound added to the machinery is grudged , as so much deducted from the ability of the boat to carry freight , adds one other and a formidable objection to its use . Passengers themselves often cause the collapsing of a flue , by rushing simultaneously to one guard of the boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An explosion on the Mississippi several years ago , one of the most destructive which , up to that time , had ever happened , was occasioned by the passengers crowding to one side , in their anxiety to witness a chase on the river , after some fugitive negroes . The same heedlessness manifests itself in the zeal with which the passengers will most generally participate in the excitement produced by a trial of speed . Among the many singular phases in which the human character presents itself , few have appeared to us more unaccountable than this frantic desire to get ahead , no matter at what risk , or for what object , or haply for no object at all . A few hours gained in the time of arrival at the place of destination may not signify a sixpence to any one on board ; yet to gain these few hours a great majority of those concerned will sacrifice every consideration of prudence . When to this all-pervading spirit is added the excitement of rivalry , there is no longer any controlling of the mania , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frantic eagerness of his excited passengers to put additional weights upon the safety-valve , and to raise the steam by the application of any light combustible that may be at hand ; while they will wantonly expose themselves , and crowd about the place of danger , regardless of the warning given by the quivering throes of the over-worked boat , or by the whizzing of the steam from the straining boilers beneath their feet . We are not disposed to deny that speed is desirable , and should be a consideration in the constructing of a boat ; nor are we ignorant , that it is to this quality , as much as to any other , that our boats are indebted for their superiority over those of other nations . And , so long as boats excel in speed , by their superior model , and strength of engine , without extra strain or effort , the preference given to them is legitimate and reasonable . But the danger lies in the rivalry created in boats whose // structure and power do not make the same rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who form the majority of the passengers on hoard of these boats , may in part account for the disregard of danger manifested by them upon this , as well as upon most other occasions . Emigrants of slender means , Western merchants going to or returning from the markets of the East , young men sent out by their friends to seek their fortunes , traders who have been disposing of their produce down the river , range themselves evidently somewhat lower in the scale of civilization and refinement , than the tourists in pursuit of health , or pleasure , who , with their wives and families cover the decks , and regulate the tone , of the Eastern steamboats . And the lower we descend in this scale , the less is the estimate we find put upon human life , and the less is the horror felt at its violent or wanton destruction . The nourishing of the sensibilities into more active operation , is as evidently one of the results of the refinements of education , as is the improvement of the intellectual faculties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern traveller . He not only perceives it in the rude character of many of his fellow passengers , but it strikes him in the filthy condition of the engine-room , as he contrasts it , floating with water , and redolent of grease , with the ppnctilious cleanliness of the same parts in the Eastern boats . He sees it in the slouching look of the dirty cabin boys , in the " unwashed and unkempt " condition of the officers , and in the squalid raggedness that characterizes the crew . In the spring of 1838 , it was our lot to embark at St. Louis , in a new and very splendid steamboat bound for Pittsburg . Her captain was a young man of some experience on the river , and of a very ambitious and energetic character . The boat was evidently built with a view of embracing all the accommodations and improvements then known ; and our party were congratulating themselves upon the comfort and cleanliness of the cabin , and the order and neatness apparent throughout . Before casting off her fasts from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety , and the boat shot up the strong current of the Mississippi , and , turning above the town , dashed by the wharves with a velocity frightful to behold , but which seemed peculiarly exhilarating to both crew and passengers . As this , however , was no more // than the usual practice for crack boats on leaving port , we thought nothing of it ; but the haste , with which her necessary landings for wood and other purposes were managed , and the excited condition of her crew , soon made manifest ( what was afterwards confirmed by the express declaration of the captain ) , that it was intended to make a brag trip . Now there were , no doubt , some few among the passengers , whom a knowledge of this really alarming fact rendered uneasy and apprehensive ; but upon a large majority it produced no other feelings than those of pleasing excitement ; and the watching of her rapid progress , and estimating from time to time her rate of speed , seemed to form an agreeable relief from the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time encountered whose speed was equal to our own , and one after another was easily passed ; till , between Louisville and Cincinnati , a vessel was discovered in our wake , whose two escape pipes and double engine showed her to be one of the mail-boats that ply between the two places , and reputed to be one of the fastest boats on the Western waters . As each bend of the river occasionally disclosed her to view , it was evident , that she was gaining on us . The excitement on board of our boat now became tremendous . Captain and passengers vied with each other in stimulating the exertions of the firemen . Rosin was freely thrown into the furnaces , and the thundering of her paddles , and the quivering of the boat , told of the increased action of the steam upon her engine ; while no warning voice was heard from the passengers , those who felt alarm contenting themselves with keeping astern , as far as possible from the scene of danger . These efforts , as it proved , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by us ; while our captain concealed his mortification as best he could , swearing a deep oath , that the next time he encountered this rival , he would pass her , or blow his own boat out of the water . Fearfully was the pledge redeemed . His time , however , had not yet come . We landed in safety , and all tongues were loud in applause of our captain and his fast boat . The newspapers recorded the trip just accomplished as the quickest ever performed ; and the challenge was thus in effect thrown out to all other captains , to emulate this despatch . A few days afterwards , in Philadelphia , a friend , aghast with horror , informed us , that news had just arrived , of the // most frightful explosion which had ever signalized the Western waters . The question rose instinctively to our lips , - Was it the . IJilioselle ? It was but too true . The rashness of the captain had most fearfully recoiled upon his own head , hurling with him to destruction more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of an effort to pass the very boat which had outstripped him on his previous trip . This disastrous explosion , the most terrific , we believe , recorded in the history of steam , awakened for a time the public from their apathy . In Cincinnati , the scene of the disaster , a public meeting of the citizens was called , where , among other resolutions having for their object principally the relief of the surviving sufferers , one was passed , raising a committee of five , to inquire into the causes of this calamity , and " to report such preventive measures as may be best calculated hereafter to guard against like occurrences . " Upon Dr. Locke , one of this committee , devolved the principal labor of preparing their report ; and on the 15th of August it was submitted by the mayor to the city council , under the expectation that they would cause it to be printed . Several weeks , however , having elapsed , and no steps having been taken by that body towards giving it publicity , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was afterwards procured of Dr. Locke by a number of the citizens , and by them given to the world . This report , which thus struggled into light , was limited in its range , by the terms of the resolution under which it was prepared , to an investigation into matters connected with that class of accidents arising from explosions . Upon this point , much valuable information was collected , and many useful hints were suggested . The result of the Doctor 's investigations , brings him , we think , very justly to the conclusion , that the explosion on board of the . JiiJioselle , which utterly demolished the boat and destroyed the lives of one hundred and fifty people ( p. 2* ) , took place while there was a sufficient supply of water in her boilers , and was the natural and inevitable consequence of the increased expansive force of the steam , confined by an overloaded safety-valve , while she lay for fifteen or twenty minutes " with boilers closed , and a furnace as hot as dry wood could make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machinery of the safety-valve was of more simple construction , as ordinarily made , than at present . It consisted of a simple lever , or steel-yard , with an adjustable weight , which was occasionally raised by the engineer , by means of a cord attached to the extreme end of that lever , and passed over pulleys . This gave the engineer no power of holding down the valve . In the present more complicated and more objectionable plan , a long rod , or axis , running from the engineer 's station , at right angles to the steel-yard , engages it by a short arm for that purpose , in such a manner , that , when the rod is twisted auger-like , it shall lift the valve in one direction , and hold it down in the other . This rod terminates at the other end , near the engineer 's station , in a cross or T , like the handle of an auger ; but the two ends of this cross-piece are not alike , one is a handle by which to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressly for the application of extra weights . " - Report , *c. p. 32 . Satisfactory evidence was procured to show that this hook , significantly called the death-hook , was loaded with a weight , which would have required a pressure of steam of two hundred and thirty-seven pounds to the square inch to raise it . " It appears from the above , that safety-valve is a nickname . There is a valve , which can be raised to let off steam ; but , when thus indefinitely loaded , it scarcely affords safety . " - Ibid. , p. 53 . The evidence that the boilers were not empty , and consequently were overheated at the time of the explosion , is we think conclusive . The following fact , establishing this position , can not be explained away . Upon repairing to the scene of the casualty , " The first point to which Mr. Tift drew my attention , was the fact , that the leaden collets , called grum mets , which lie under the heads of the bolts connecting the boilers with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of the boilers , and at a part exposed outwardly to the fire , and at the same time so near the top of the water as to be first exposed to great heat when the water should become too low The fact , that the lead was not melted , was fully ascertained in the fragments of the boilers , of about fifty to sixty square feet , lying part of the way up the bank , opposite the place of explosion . " But yet so inveterate is the prejudice in favor of the " notion , " ( referred to at page 31 , ) " that the only thing necessary for safety is , that they should keep water enough in the boilers , " that this pregnant fact failed to convince many of // the spectators ; and the belief is now prevalent on the river , that the . Moselle exploded because her boilers were empty , from the effect of gas generated upon the sudden admission of water , on the starting of her forcing-pump . " Why not , " says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosive gas , so much talked of , has , by the way , never yet been detected by the researches of science . Hot iron xviii decompose water and evolve hydrogen , but hydrogen alone is not explosive ; besides , the heat required for this decomposition is far above that attained in cases of explosions attributed to the presence of gases . Nor is hydrogen explosive when mixed with oxygen , unless within certain limits not likely to be attaiIfd in steamboilers . Theo2etically , gaseous explosions of boilers are improbable , and , practically , they have been quite disproved. " - Report , p. 36 . Professor Hare , in bis answer to the Secretary of the Treasury , says " Every well-informed chemist knows , that in copper boilers hydrogen could not be generated , and that in iron boilers its generation would require a heat of which the consequent pressure would be irresistible by the strongest vessels , especially as the tenacity of the vessels xvould be much lessened ; that , if hydrogen were generated , it culd not explode per se ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the atmospheric oxygen , which could have no adequate access ; that , if atmospheric air were present , the intermixture of the steam would so impair its efficacy , that inflammation could scarcely ensue , and that of course , no explosion could take place . " - Letter , &amp;c. p. 383 . Why need we , as a palliative for recklessness or folly , look for some latent and mysterious cause , when a rational deduction from well-known and intelligible facts will furnish a solution ? " The expansive force of steam produced in a close boiler containing a sufficient supply of water increases as the heat increases , but not at the same rate , the force increasing faster than the heat . " - fleport , p. 29 . The expansive force , it appears from experiments , is doubled by every fifty additional degrees of heat . Noxv , in the case before us with the safety-valve loaded beyond the possibility of being raised , and furnaces heated by the continual introduction of d1 y veod , what difficulty is there in coming to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of the steam , were strained7 to their utmost limit of tension , and that the jar occasioned by the starting of the machinery produced the explosion ? The result of a jar , or slight concussion , upon bodies so strained , is well explained by several apt illustrations , at page 38 of Re ort . We have dwelt , somewhat at length , u on e history of this casualty , both because of its prominence on the list of disasters , and because we thought it well adapted to show the ignorance and wantonness of men to whose charge are sometimes committed the lives of so manyof their fellowcreatures , the blindness and infatuation of passengers , and the gauge by which steamboat performances are generally measured . Whether it is possible to guard against these manifold accidents , and to render steamboat travelling as safe on the Western waters as it has become genenlly at the East , - is a question , in answering which a great diversity of opinion may well exist . It appears to us , that the dangers we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrinsic to the Western rivers , will for a long time prevent the attainment of the same precision . and safety as now characterize the performances of boats on the Eastern waters . But of the effect of care and vigilance in diminishing risk , we have abundant proof . We know a captain , who , during sixteen years of service has never had a man scalded , nor ever met with any worse accident than the breaking of a shaft . He never allow amanin his employ to play at cards on board of his boat , and is careful to select men of temperate habits . We were gratified some time since to hear him say , that he was about building a boat , from which the bar ( that fruitful source of accident and death ) was to be utterly excluded . Whenever this example shall be universally followed , a moiety at least of the danger in these boats will cease . It is a well-known tkct , that accidents but seldom happen to the larger and more valuable boats , and the reason is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their owners , in the selection of commanders and crew , to exercise a care which a sense of responsibility , and the dictates of humanity , in all other cases demand of them in vain . We were long of the opinion , that public sentiment , the great corrector of all . abuses in this count , - bestowing patronage only on boats that were carefully managed , - // would , by addressing itself to the self-interest of boat-owners and captains , gradually bring about the change so much to be desired . But the experience of the last few years , during which accidents have been fearfully increasing in frequency and magnitude , seems to forbid us to look to this source with much hope of its speedy or effectual operation . The reason for this must be looked for , partly in the ignorance of the travelling public as to what are the qualifications of the boats o *ered to their choice . A stranger reaches Pittsburg , perhaps an emigrant with his family , who has never seen a Western steamboat . He repairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a*out to start for his place of destination . He goes on board , and sees in the cabin spacious and showy accommodations ; while the elevation above the water , and the entire separation of the passengers ' apartments from the machinery and dirt of the deck naturally please him ; but any correct information as to the character of the captain , the competency of the engineers and pilots , the condition of the hull , the safety of the engine or boilers , is as much out of his reach , as though he were on tl e other side of the mountains . For we can hardly suppose him so gullible as to place any reliance on the framed certificate ( of an inspector who knows no more about it , nor has much more chance of kuoxving , than himself , ) which sets forth , that , some six months beiore , hull and engi. e were in good order , and every way suitable for the t aesportation of freight and jmssengems . " He asks for information , a 1d the first person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat whose character he wishes iO learn ; and he is assured , that , by a fortunate chance , he now ha* an opportunity of embarking on bm i 'd the vary best boat , u.der the charg* of the most careftil captain , on the vTestern waters . e s eps into a commission store , belonging most likely to one of the owners of the same boat , and the s*me agreeable information is repeated . Nor , if his information be erroneous , is he likely ever to be undeceived ; for he will find but few who know any thing about it , and they who know rn*ht unfavorable are unwilling to tell it . Or , suppose the t ax cHar has some e *perience in the matter , and v*ould *rive the i*reference to certain boats they may be a thou uc urn s off , in a different trade ; or the time of their arrivul m * be uncertain . Pew are willing to incur the ex**ense aud ino* x of waiting ; amid the ceasequence // is , that the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The astonishing increase of travel on the Western waters has been another reason of the indifference of boatmen to the comfort and safety of their passengers , of whom the crowd is occasionally so great , that the existing number of boats , increasing too as they have been with unexampled rapidity , is altogether inadequate , at certain seasons of the year , to their comfortable or safe transportation . When boat after boat leaves port , as is often the case , in the busiest season of the year , with double the number of passengers for which they have suitable accommodations , it is no longer a question with the traveller which boat he will select , but rather how he can get a passage in any . Again , the great increase of boats renders it impossible to procure for all of them commanders of suitable age and experience ; and it is unfortunately too often the case , that property and lives are placed , in this dangerous navigation , under the charge of mere boys in age and intellect . The same cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more especially in the West , makes it difficult to procure efficient crews . It is of course impossible to enforce the discipline so necessary to safety , when each member of the crew is perfectly aware , that a discharge is at worst but a temporary inconvenience , so many are the situations where he can readily dispose of his services . Such is the demand for pilots and engineers , that their wages are enormous ; and a man , skilful , or reputed to be skilful , in either of these characters , can command a better remuneration than frequently rewards the efforts of a man in a learned profession , after devoting many years to his business , and expending much money to qualify him for it . The inevitable result of the rapid and easy acquisition of motley by men of coarse habits and uneducated minds , is to produce profligacy and its attendant recklessness ; and , though instances can doubtless be pointed out , of men , who under such trying circumstances have , by the practice of sobriety and economy , accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all those conversant with the subject , will pronounce these to be exceptions to the general rule . Among the circumstances which tend to the diminution of accidents is the practice , wherever it has been introduced , // of running boats as regular packets , for short distances , from one important J ) Oint to another . Several causes may be assigned why this practice should have such a result . Pilots , that are constantly passing over the same space , must of course acquire a more accurate knowledge , not only of the channel of the river , but of the situation of snags and other obstacles , than can be obtained by those whose observation is extended over a space of a thousand or fifteen hundred miles . The business , too , has a stability about it , which renders it more easy to secure the services of a steady crew ; and the boats and their engines are more easily kept in thorough repair . That much more can be done by legislative enactment , than has yet been attempted for the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe ; but it must be by a course of legislation , intelligently adopted , systematically pursued , and rigidly enforced . Without deliberate investigation , all demand for penal restrictions becomes senseless clamor , and compliance with it positively mischievous . Already has the recent act of Congress , become , as to some of its most important provisions , a dead letter ; and the defects of the bill are so glaring , and its structure so bungling , that it can be violated with impunity . The boatmen are so numerous , form so powerful a class in all the river towns , and have so long lived uncontrolled , - their waiidering life rendering them but little amenable to the laws , - that it is not to be expected the first attempt to bring them into order and discipline should be entirely successful . State legislation must always be ineffectual , from the impossibility of enforcing laws , where boats are passing so rapidly from one State to another , and frequently from the difficulty of deciding within what especial territory any offence may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer of 1838 , - namely , the explosion of the . lUioselle , the General Brown , the Orinoco , and the Pulaski , and the burning of the Washington , - were the immediate occasion of the law to which we have just alluded . The Secretary of the Treasury , during the same summer , was collecting information upon the subject of steam-engines generally , in obedience to a resolution of the House of Representatives ; and the result has been the presentation of a mass of documents , ill-arranged and undigested , as was perhaps unavoidable , from the haste // with which they were necessarily prepared . With regard to Western boats , the information obtained is singularly meagre . As was to be expected , from the number of people consulted , a great contrariety of opinion has been elicited . That doctors will disagree is here amply exemplified ; and the uninstructed reader will seek in vain to settle his faith , among the opposing theories submitted to bis consideration . This , we repeat it , is no more than might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest , if as many individuals were catechized upon any vexed question . But , because a correspondent on one page contemns , and deprecates , all legislative interference , and another , on the next , insists upon multiplying enactments , and increasing their penalties , our representatives should not be deterred from investigating the matter thoroughly , and from taking such steps as this investigation may convince them are salutary and right . Without intending systematically to review the " Act for the better security of the lives of passengers on board of vessels propelled in whole or in part by steam , " approved the 7th of July , 1838 , we may be allowed to point out some of its most striking defects , and to suggest some additional provisions , the introduction of which , it appears to us , would increase its usefulness . The first five sections relate principally to the dtities and compensation of inspectors , for examining periodically the condition of the bulls and engines of steam-vessels . Now it is perfectly manifest , that no examination , even when made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in port , can detect every imperfection in its construction , or every flaw or defect of its engine ; and the services of the skilful and conscientious , the smallness of the compensation will ever make it difficult to sectire . A far more effectual provision for the safe construction of boats and engines would be to reqtiire , that boat-builders should have each boat inspected during its progress , by an authorized inspector to establish some test to wbich each boiler should be subjected before putting it in use ; and then to exact , that one of the safety-valves ( for every boat should be furnished with two ) should be loaded with a specified weigbt , and placed beyond the control of the engineer . Any tampering with , or alteration of , this regulating valve should be prohib // ited under the heaviest penalties . This provision would supersede Section seventh , requiring the safety-valve to he raised upon every occasion of the boat 's stopping her en0ine , which , as it stands at present , is positively mischievous , and would , if oheyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intended to prevent . Its absurdity , from the first , caused it to be utterly disregarded . Section ninth requires all steamboats to use iron rods , or chains , in the place of tiller ropes . A recent judicial opinion , however , has decided , that this provision of the law does not reach the boats navigating our Western waters . As clumsy as may he the co. struction of this section , we think this decision a palpable perversion of its meaning . Certain it is , that it never received a moment 's obedience , even before judicial ingenuity pronounced it inoperative . it is very generally urged by the steamboat interest , that the adoption of these *h*in* or rods would render boats less manage able , and their navigation consequently in narrow or intricate channels more hazardous . Their great security in case of fire , should reader our lawgivers cautious in entertaining these objections ; but , in case they should be found to be valid , a spare tiller , kept always at hand , to fit into the rudder post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be found a great protection . A recent invention , however , the wire rope , would seem to do away with all objections , founded upon their unmanageableness , to metallic steering ropes . We have seen these wire ropes in use , as pliable as hemp , and yet pronounced to be as incombustible as a bulky chain . At any rate , whatever precautions against fire , whether in the surveying of buckets filled with water , a fireengine , or hose , or any other , ( except , perhaps , requiring them to be provided with an extra number of small boats , ) are exacted of lake or sea-going boats , should be extended in terms , clear , beyond the possibility of legal quibbling , to boats navigating the Western rivers . By Section tenth , boats running during the night are compelled to carry , in some conspicuous part , at least one signal light . It is obvious , that one light , suspended above a boat , can give no precise information as to the course she may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as has been already observed , which occasions such frequent collisions . If instead of one signal light , suspended at random // about the boat , it were required , that two lights of different specified colors should be displayed , the one above the bow , and the other at the stern , the pilot of each boat could tell at a glance the course and bearings of the other , and regulate himself accordingly . The latter sections of the act provide for the punishment of neglect , or carelessness , upon the information of those aggrieved . Now we would suggest , that , instead of leaving it to the sufferers to prosecute , ( a step that many causes may prevent them from taking ; for instance , poverty , ignorance , want of friends , and unwillingness to lose the time it would consume , or dread of incurring responsibility ; ) it should be made the duty of the surveyor , collector of the port , steamboat inspector , or other suitable officer , within a certain distance of whose post any accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking with him a specified number of respectable citizens , who should be sworn to inspect and examine faithfully and impartially ; all of whom should be well paid for their services . And their report it should be the duty of the officer to dispose of in some summary way , either by submitting it to the grand jury , if it be then in session , or to one or more magistrates , who should be required to receive the same , and , if recommended by the examiners , either commit for trial the offenders , or hold them to bail , to answer the charge which it should still be made the duty of the presiding officer in the district to prefer , at the first competent court thereafter to be holden . Yet it may well be asked , after all , How can the dread of legal penalties cause any additional vigilance in an officer , who knows that his own life will almost inevitably pay the immediate penalty of his negligence ? The engineer on duty at the time of any catastrophe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers of the boat , whether on or off duty , occupy the most exposed situations . Ignorance , therefore , we may fairly conclude , more often than negligence , is the cause of these accidents . And how can it be otherwise , than that , among the thousand or fifteen hundred uneducated men , who have charge of engines on these waters , there should be many who know nothing , or next to nothing , about the nature and properties of the mysterious and powerful agent , which is as yet in some respects an enigma even to the learned . The law which is prompt to punish , it may well be said // should not be backward to instruct , or should exact some test of competency . It has been suggested , and it seems to us with much propriety , that the government should either establish schools for the education of engineers , or should appoint boards for the examination of candidates for the station , which no one should be allowed to fill without a certificate from such board of his possessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We repeat it , however , that whatever laws are passed should be the result of deliberate investigation ; those passed like the one we have been examining , in haste , and under the influence of temporary excitement , must of course he crude and ill-digested , and may be mischievous . But it must he evident , we think , to those who have watched the signs of the times , - the progress of public improvement , - that a change is about to be wrought in the means of locomotion . The scene of danger and of risk to the traveller is about to he removed from the water to the land . The construction , rate of speed , and management of the steamboat will soon be a matter of as much indifference to the voyager , as the rate of sailing of a coasting sloop . It needs but the completion of the railroads already projected , to divert at once three fourths of the travel from the Ohio river . The rapidity , the ease , and we may add , the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially constructed railroads , ) would instantaneously demolish all competition upon a river , where ice in winter , low water in summer , a circuitous and tedious route at all times , interfere inevitably with precision and accuracy of movement . Indeed , the prediction is hardly a rash one , that as much as the steamboat has done for the West , the railroad is destined to do more . So long and winding is the course of the rivers , that a journey from the East to the far West is now , even when performed in the fastest boats , an undertaking to be measured by weeks . A glance at the map will satisfy us , that the " tireless speed * of the locomotive engine may , and will , traverse the space from the Atlantic to the Mississippi in three days . The increased traver , the benefits that would result to both sections of the country from the enlarged intercotirse , the additional bond it would be to the union of these States , it is no place to enlarge upon here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diminution of accidents and suffering // of every kind , which must result from the substitution of this mode of ' travelling for all others now known , we may sigh that we are horn fifty years too soon . Some of the remarks of one of the Secretary 's correspondents must , we think , have edified him , by their na*ve16 and piquancy ; and as they can not but amuse our readers , we will close with a few of them this article . CC Laws , to be of much public utility , must be based upon , and administered with , equal justice to all ; to be generally known , they must bc permanent ; and , to be respected , must be sure of enforcement . The great fault of the law-makers of our country , from highest to lo*vest , is too great a multiplication of laws and too little enforcement . They see a certain crime or species of injustice go unpunished , and straightway a law is passed against such crime or injustice , regardless of the laws already in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not follow by the old law should have been the subject of action . " In our peculiar form of government , where almost all officers are elective , even to the constable , no officer is willing to risk his own popularity by the enforcement of an unpopular law . " - " Thereby it is , that our laws are so little enforced that hundreds of our most valuable citizens are deprived of life against all law , because it would be against the interests of trade for an inquest to examine too closely into the causes of such fatal consequences , or to institute legal proceedings to bring the perpetrators to justice . " - " If half the citizens of this country should get blown up , and it should be likely to affect injuriously the trade and commerce of the other half by bringing to justice the guilty , no elective officer would risk his popularity by executing the law , without some alternative which should weigh stronger on his mind than the loss of office ; and perhaps an appointed officer would find it rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unaided by numbers , which he seldom has at command .
