SCENE I.  --  A STREET IN NEW YORK .  --  NIGHT CLOUDY AND DARK  --  NO LAMPS LIT.  --  A HOLE WHERE PIPES ARE TO BE LAID . ( A voice proceeds from under ground . ) Changeless . Jacob Changeless Heaven help me out of this cursed city ! What infernal hole have I fallen into now ?  --  The devil take the corporation  --  the devil take everybody  --  Watch ! Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What an intolerable and suffocating smell of gas !  --  I hear the rushing of the damned Croton water ! I shall be drowned !  --  Help ! Help ! Help !  --  Will nobody come to my assistance ?  --  Watch ! Fire ! Water ! Murder ! ( Enter Dick Meadows , and Andrew Ball , running . ) Dick . Dick Meadows Where the deuce did the voice come from ? I thought it was somewhere about here . Changeless . Jacob Changeless Hallo there  --  Hallo ! Dick . Dick Meadows What ! have we another Hamlet 's ghost on hand ? Change . Jacob Changeless ( makes desperate efforts to get out , and shows his head and hands ) . Help ! Andrew . Andrew Ball No , by my life , Briareus again . Change . Jacob Changeless ( from under ground ) . Confound it , young gentlemen , do n't stand there cracking your jokes , but help me out . Dick . Dick Meadows Well said , old covey : give us your hands . ( They help Changeless out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt from his clothes ) . And these are what you call your modern improvements , are they ? Dick Dick Meadows ( aside to Andrew ) . ' Faith , Andrew , this is a queer bird , though neither drunk , nor a blackguard , as I supposed . ( Aloud . ) I beg your pardon , sir , for keeping you waiting so long , but may I ask how , in the name of wonder , you came there ? Excuse me , sir , but you look precisely as if you had just been dug out from Pompeii , as far as I can judge by this dubious light we enjoy to-night . Change . Jacob Changeless How came I there ? there is nothing unaccountable in it , sir . I was very quietly and unsuspiciously crossing the street , when suddenly the earth gave way under me , and I fell headlong into that infernal pit . Dick . Dick Meadows But did n't you see it ? Oh , I forgot  --  ( looks up )  --  the corporation moon has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , sir , this is not the first disaster of the kind which has befallen me to-night . Besides divers other minor mischances , I fell through one of these confounded gridirons which are strewed in every direction about the side walks , and which cover the mouths of bottomless pits  --  vaults you call ' em . I thought my leg would have been sawed off , before I disengaged it  --  as it is , I shall be lame for a month . There 's another of your detestable modern improvements ! Dick . Dick Meadows ( aside ) . Gridirons ! Another martyrdom of Saint Lawrence in these later days , by Jupiter ! Change . Jacob Changeless Sir , in my day , people stored up their wood  --  we used no coal then  --  like Christians , like reasonable beings , sir , in outhouses and the like , not in holes in the ground , as squirrels hoard acorns . Dick . Dick Meadows I confess I am disposed to agree with you , sir  --  but just try some Dalley 's salve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Changeless Dalley 's salve ! Another intolerable modern improvement ! In my day , sir , it was simple cerate . As to home , sir , I never expect to get home  --  some of your diabolical modern improvements will kill me before morning . The streets are full of pitfalls of all descriptions . Dick Dick Meadows ( aside ) . ' Gad , one would think , from the old gentleman 's account , that this was a community of prairie dogs . Change . Jacob Changeless ( solemnly ) . I am a victim  --  yes , I know it  --  I feel it . It 's all over with me . I am a predestinated gone case  --  a victim to the march of mind ! But it 's my own fault ; I ought never to have come to town after forty years ' absence . Dick . Dick Meadows You have been in town before , then ? But forty years  --  that 's a long time  --  a very long time . Change . Jacob Changeless Ay , sir , to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I recollect the last time I led off a country dance in New York , as if it were yesterday . I was a great beau in my day , sir , and though I say it myself , and you may , perhaps , laugh at me for so doing , I was acknowledged to have the handsomest pair of legs in the counties of New York , Westchester , Richmond , and Kings . But there is no use in legs now  --  nobody sees them . Dick . Dick Meadows You must have seen changes , sir , in forty years . Change . Jacob Changeless Yes , sir , forty years here have done the work of four hundred in other lands . Why , sir , the very ground we stand upon was , within my recollection , so far out of town , that we boys used to come out into these parts to gather blackberries . Dick . Dick Meadows Yes , sir , the spirit of improvement  --  Change . Jacob Changeless Tut  --  tut  --  tut , do n't talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word . No , sir , it is the irresistible tendency of our institutions to make everything grow and expand to the utmost . It is the natural progress of events , sir ; it is the energy and enterprize of our people  --  Dick . Dick Meadows And what are energy and enterprize but the spirit of  --  Change . Jacob Changeless Stop , sir . If you do n't wish to disorganize my system for ever , sir ; if you do n't desire to give an irrecoverable shock to my nerves , utter not the word again . I fear I am detaining you , sir  --  good evening . ( Begins to move off . ) Can you tell me , sir , where the house of one John Progress , in Ninth street , is , and where Ninth street is to be found ? Dick . Dick Meadows What , Jack o ' Lantern ? ( Enter John Progress . ) Progress . John Progress Who calls John Progress ? Change . Jacob Changeless Ho , nephew , where are you ? Odds boddikins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about you , for may I fall into another man-trap incontinently , if I can see your face . Progress . John Progress Here am I. ( Comes up , and shakes hands with Changeless . ) Dick Dick Meadows ( aside ) . So , so , this must be the old gentleman who opposed my marriage with Julia , and thinks the modern young gentlemen are all " insipid . " I know he has been expected in town to pass judgment on me  --  Insipid ! By the genius of mischief , I 'll put that conceit out of his head . I 'll play the regular fox-hunter for him  --  I 'll astonish the old gentleman  --  Damme if I wo n't . ( Aloud to Andrew . ) Come , Andrew , the old gentleman has encountered a relation to take charge of him  --  so let 's be off . ' Gad , I wonder how uncle and nephew will agree ! The old light and the new light ! ( Exeunt Bob and Andrew . ) Progress John Progress ( taking Changeless ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Change . Jacob Changeless No , Johnny , nephew of mine , I will not stir from this spot till daylight , lest I be precipitated into  --  Progress . John Progress By the way , uncle , how came you here ? Change . Jacob Changeless How came I here ? Lord knows . That I am here , alive , and with no bones broken , I attribute in some sort to a miraculous interposition of Providence in my favor . Progress . John Progress But come , uncle , let 's walk . I 'll answer for your neck , never fear . My house is not very far off . I 'll insure you for one half of one per cent. , dangers of the seas only excepted . Change . Jacob Changeless ( beginning to walk carefully ) . Cautiously , nephew , cautiously ; I 'm glad you do n't live in this street , for I should certainly disinherit you if you did .  --  Ah ! what was that I stepped upon ?  --  Cautiously , nephew , cautiously ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Nicholas Content . ) Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead You see , sir , I want to have a railroad constructed here . Content . Nicholas Content A what !  --  and you have dragged me out of my house this cold , raw , chilly , dark , disagreeable night , to tell me of this extravagant project ? What would be the use of a railroad here ? Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead Hush , sir  --  not so loud  --  great secret . Use , sir ? Ca n't you see , sir ?  --  connect first and sixth avenues  --  run from Hudson to East river  --  make this a great thoroughfare  --  business street  --  raise the rent of houses  --  improve value of property  --  connect with Harlem railroad  --  go down to City Hall from here in less than no time  --  Great work  --  grand improvement  --  Wo n't you sign a petition to common council ? Content . Nicholas Content Mr. Go-ahead , can you really suppose that I will interest myself in a scheme which , if carried out , would prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a railroad in this street would keep my wife in a perpetual agony for the safety of my children , and them in a continual danger of being run over . Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead But the convenience of stepping right out of your house into a car  --  general satisfaction  --  public spirit  --  danger all moonshine . Content . Nicholas Content Mr. Go-ahead , I am perfectly content as I am . Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead Content !  --  a most unnatural state , sir  --  an antiquated , exploded notion . I never expect to be content  --  must be moving , sir  --  spirit of our institutions  --  never rest content , sir  --  contrary to democratic principles  --  aristocratic feeling  --  wo n't do in this country  --  never ! Wo n't you subscribe , sir  --  take stock , if we get permission to build from Common Council ? Issue scrip  --  seven per cent .  --  paid in five years from profits of investment  --  succeed no doubt  --  never have such a chance again , perhaps  --  flat rail , cheap  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't exactly understand  --  great thing though , no question of it . Look at Boston  --  flourishing city  --  all owing to railroads . Content . Nicholas Content Permit me to doubt that position , Mr. Go-ahead . Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead Use your eyes , sir  --  stretches out her arms like a polypus on every side , and rakes in the oysters from everybody 's banks  --  Boston and Albany railroad , sir , sweeps the West  --  Boston to Portsmouth collects all the products of the North  --  great city  --  cut out New York , if we do n't look sharp  --  must build more railroads , sir  --  vital importance to our prosperity  --  must be done  --  keep up with the march of improvement . Content . Nicholas Content By tearing along at the rate of thirty miles an hour , eh ? Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead Precisely , sir  --  that 's the ticket  --  must do it  --  if you do n't , fiz  --  pop  --  bang ! everybody goes by you like a flash  --  and you get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am satisfied to get in behind time ? Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead Ruined , sir  --  done up  --  bills protested  --  devil to pay  --  no help for it  --  must go  --  Now , do n't you think a railroad in this street would be a wonderful improvement ?  --  save time  --  shoe-leather  --  ca n't have locomotives , sir  --  that 's a pity  --  set fire to the houses  --  frighten horses  --  but will have fast trotters  --  ten miles an hour . Content Nicholas Content ( aside ) . What a man ! His ideas run always in one track . He even talks like a locomotive  --  spasmodically ; always in a devil of a hurry , and I bet he swallows his dinner in less than ten minutes . ( Aloud ) . Mr. Go-ahead , I must decline all participation in this scheme . I do n't like it , sir , and I ca n't stay here all night listening to you . I shall catch my death a-cold  --  uh  --  uh  --  uh ! Let go my buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead Well , sir , you 're decided , eh ?  --  good-night  --  sorry you do n't coincide with my views  --  great speculation , sir , nevertheless  --  regret one of these days you did n't join us  --  ca n't be helped , though  --  get somebody else to do it . Good-night , sir  --  must say , you 've missed it . ( Exeunt Content and Go-ahead , in different directions . ) SCENE II .  --  PARLOR IN PROGRESS ' HOUSE . ( Mrs. Progress and Julia discovered . ) Mrs. Progress . Mrs. Progress I wonder what detains your father so late , Julia ? He promised to come home early to-night . Julia . Julia Progress Perhaps he has gone to inquire about Uncle Changeless . Dear mother , I am almost afraid to meet my uncle now , though he has always been so kind to me . I fear he will take a dislike to poor Richard . Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress Hope the best , daughter . Misery comes soon enough , and is hard enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not so bad as you fancy , your chance of gaining his consent . Your uncle 's letters , to be sure , have been discouraging , but I hope he will think better of the match when he sees the young man . Julia Julia Progress ( sighs ) . Well , I hope so . But there are steps at the front door ; they are coming , I 'm sure . Yes  --  I hear my uncle 's trumpet nose , and his hearty country " hem ! " I feel almost like a guilty thing at his approach . ( Sinks into a chair . ) ( Enter Progress and Changeless . ) Change . J acob Changeless Well , Mary , my dear , I am glad to see you . ( Shakes hands with Mrs. P. ) But where is my little Julia , my sweet rose-bud ? Why is she not here to welcome me ? Julia . Julia Progress Here am I , uncle . Change . Jacob Changeless ( taking her hand ) . So you 're not gadding about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assemblies , and all sorts of routs and soirees , and jams , and tantrims . I dare swear , you wicked little hussy , you will say my eyes are growing dim , because I did n't see you before . You look rather pale , though ; I can observe that  --  not as blooming as when you were with me last summer . Ah ! you want my old housekeeper to coddle you up . But bless me , how the child trembles ! Why what ails you , Julia ? Julia . Julia Progress Nothing , nothing , I assure you , uncle . But what on earth has happened to you ? Your clothes  --  Change . Jacob Changeless Nothing ? Why your cheek gives the lie to your tongue ! It changes color twenty times a minute . Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress To tell you the truth , Mr. Changeless , the poor girl is in distress lest you should not fancy Mr. Meadows . Julia . Julia Progress Mother ! Change . Jacob Changeless Never mind , Julia ; it is always best for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows how to act . Since it is so serious a matter , rest assured I will not condemn the youth without reason . Julia . Julia Progress A thousand thanks , dear uncle . I feared you would not even grant him a hearing . I 'm sure you 'll like him . Change . Jacob Changeless I 'm not such a terrible tyrant as all that , you little culprit . As to liking , you commit the error very common among lovers , young ladies especially , of fancying everybody must be enamored of your choice . Julia . Julia Progress Yes , ( sighs , ) I know it . I fear I deceive myself . Change . Jacob Changeless Nay , nay , Julia , do n't go off into the dumps again . I promise to be a lenient judge . Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress Oh , Mr. Changeless , you must like him . Change . Jacob Changeless Madam , I wo n't like him , unless I please . ' Sdeath , nobody shall dictate to me whom I shall like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure , Mr. Changeless , I did n't intend to dictate to anybody , not I  --  I only meant  --  Progress . John Progress Never mind what you meant , Mary , but go and see that uncle 's room is ready for him . Julia , you look agitated ; you had better retire also . ( Exeunt Mrs. P. and Julia . ) Change . Jacob Changeless ( to Julia as she goes out ) . Good night , my little lady-bird  --  ah , this city spoils everything  --  you do n't kiss me as you used to do in the country . ( To Progress . ) No , nephew , I ca n't stay here to-night  --  my baggage is all at the house I stopped at . I have not even a clean shirt to put on in the morning with me ; besides , my trunk will be robbed to a dead certainty . Prog . John Progress Never fear , uncle  --  we 're not quite so bad as that in New York ; as to other matters I dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning we 'll send for your trunk . I take it hard you did not come here at once . Change . Jacob Changeless Well , as to that , I did not know how it might be considered in these times , to billet one 's self upon a man without any warning . Prog . John Progress Uncle , we have not much room to spare , to be sure , but you are always welcome , I assure you . Change . Jacob Changeless I believe you , Johnny  --  but , nevertheless , to-night  --  Prog . John Progress You stay here , uncle  --  now no denial . I can lend you a shirt and a razor , or , if you please , you can come down to the breakfast without being particular as to those matters . Change . Jacob Changeless Well , so be it  --  though in my time , people did not like to appear in public , even in the morning , with sullied linen , nor with a twenty-four hours ' crop of beard on their faces . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been revived again lately . But where is my namesake , that little double Dutchman Jacobus ? I ask his pardon for not missing him before . Prog . John Progress He 's in bed . He studies hard all day , and when night comes , is glad to get a little rest . Change . Jacob Changeless He must be nine years old by this time , is n't he ? Prog . John Progress Just nine  --  and coming on famously in his studies , I assure you . He is already in Ovid and Virgil , can conjugate the Greek verbs , and exhibits quite a genius for algebra and English composition . Change . Jacob Changeless Poor little boy  --  I pity him ! This is one of your famous modern improvements , John . You cram the luckless children 's brains with all sorts of stuff , which they neither understand nor can be expected at such an early age to digest ;  --  you overload their memories with an immense mass of crude information , which their minds are not sufficiently powerful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anthracite gas ,  --  and then you send them to college to go through in four years , or less , that which it has taken the genius of a Newton or a La Place years upon years to bring to perfection . After this process has been gone through , you turn them out upon the world  --  what ? Ignorant young men !  --  ignorant of all that a man ought to know  --  ignorant of the classics of their own language  --  ignorant of their native tongue  --  ignorant of the laws and institutions of their country  --  totally ignorant !  --  nevertheless their education is completed ! Prog . John Progress Uncle , I confess I ca n't agree with you . It is my conviction that the mind of the infant begins to expand at a much earlier age than is generally supposed ; that the ideas , as the expression is , may be taught to shoot much sooner than we imagine . Change . Jacob Changeless Well , sir , let them shoot of their own accord , not force them on like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir , the system is wrong , radically wrong . You begin too early . You induct them into Murray 's Grammar  --  that most complex book that ever was written , which I defy mortal man or child to comprehend  --  when they ought to be just beginning to learn their alphabet . Sir , man was intended to be an ignorant animal till he reaches the age of ten years . Prog . John Progress Ah  --  the tenth year is your starting point , eh ? One-seventh of man 's life . Change . Jacob Changeless Never mind  --  more or less . Let us educate a child now , in the present fashion . We take away his rattle , and give him a philosophic bauble . We teach him his letters scientifically by means of gingerbread capitals and pictorial alphabets . To pursue the course , we take away the Arabian Nights , and give him Moral Tales  --  we take away John Bunyan and give him Moral Tales  --  we take away Mother Goose and give him Moral Tales  --  we condemn Robinson Crusoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heroes . Then we send him to schools where he is cooped up in a hot room six hours or more without air or exercise , and then bring him home to study three , four , or five hours more . What can be expected of such an education but pale cheeks and spindle shanks , weak lungs and an early grave ? Prog . John Progress You see the result  --  he grows stronger in mind . Change . Jacob Changeless And weaker and punier in body . Stronger in mind ? I deny it . Does a man grow stronger by reason of swallowing immense quantities of mush , than by digesting a moderate quantity of nourishing meat ? No , sir ! Prog . John Progress Uncle , the analogy is far from perfect . Mind is immaterial ; body is material . Change . Jacob Changeless Confound analogy ! I 'm talking common sense . True , as you say , nephew , mind and body are different ; but both subject to certain rules . You can strengthen the body by moderate exercise ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the body to perform extraordinary feats ; but by no system of mental gymnastics can you force the mind to do uncommon things  --  or , if you do , ' twill be like a circus-tumbler , liable to rheumatisms , and spasms , and all such disorders . Prog . John Progress But , uncle  --  Change . Jacob Changeless Come , John , give me a candle and I 'll go to bed , for if we sit up here till daylight we shall never come to a satisfactory conclusion , but most probably to a quarrel . Prog . John Progress ( lights a candle ) . Well , uncle , I ca n't deny that your ideas are tolerably reasonable , but they wo n't do for this age . The time for them has gone by . Change . Jacob Changeless Out upon the age , then . I thought truth was always fit for any age . Prog . John Progress Why , I verily believe Dick Meadows would decide against you . He and I have some terrible arguments and disputations once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your notions . Change . Jacob Changeless Meadows ! that 's the name of Julia 's spark , is n't it ? I 'd like to see him dispute my opinions ; I 'll knock him down with arguments ; I 'll cut him up with satire and sarcasm ; I 'll pickle him with dilemmas and abuse . Prog . John Progress So , then , we should have alt Meadows . Change . Jacob Changeless No  --  that 'll never do . They are unhealthy , and breed musketoes . I 'll be less severe upon him . Good night , nephew . Prog . John Progress I 'll show the way to your room . ( Exeunt Changeless and Progress . ) ACT II . SCENE I.  --  THE STREET BEFORE THE DOOR OF PROGRESS ' HOUSE . ( Enter Dick Meadows . ) Dick . Dick Meadows I must gain intelligence of the enemy 's operations . How the devil shall I make my presence known to Julia without attracting attention ? I wonder if she would n't recognize my voice , if I played milkman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll try it . Ho  --  mil-luk  --  ho-a ! No , that will never do ; I ca n't execute the confounded howl . It terminates with a sort of shriek , I know that . Let 's see , a sort of Indian war-whoop it is . Who-a-a hook ! I ca n't go it , that 's clear . I 'll try something else . I have it . " Here 's your fine fresh green peas , here they go-a ! " Pshaw , that 'll never do for the middle of winter . How silly I am ! Oh , love , how you have distorted my judgment ! ( Several windows are thrown up . ) I must be off , I see ; as might have been expected , I have roused all the good housekeepers in the neighborhood . Change . Jacob Changeless ( opens his window and pokes out a long duck-gun ) . Stop your infernal yelling under my window , you scoundrel , or I 'll give you a peppering . ( Exit Dick Meadows in a hurry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Mr. and Mrs. P. and Julia assembled . Table laid for breakfast . Enter Changeless . ) Change . J acob Changeless What ! all down before me ? I thought I should steal a march upon you , but find myself mistaken . Glad to see you such early risers . ( They all sit at table . ) Julia , my dear  --  Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress Tea or coffee , Mr. Changeless ? Change . Jacob Changeless Coffee , if you please . Julia , I hope you had pleasant dreams last night ; for my part , I could n't sleep at all , there was such an everlasting hullaballoo . Julia . Julia Progress Why , uncle , this is the quietest part of the city . Change . Jacob Changeless Quiet ! Why there was a ceaseless uproar all night , as of a wagon going down hill  --  a rumbling , as of an earthquake in the bowels of the city . Julia . Julia Progress Now , uncle , if you had been lodged in a house in Broadway  --  Change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to lead me off from the subject of dreams . What pranks did fancy play with you last night ? Tell me . Julia . Julia Progress Well , I dreamt that you gave your consent to my  --  my  --  my  --  marriage with Mr. Meadows . Change . Jacob Changeless Bravo , blushes ! On the word of a gentleman , you are almost as sagacious a dreamer as Sir William Johnson 's Indian friend . But I do n't intend to imitate the knight 's conduct ; at least , not without further examination into the merits of the case . But where 's Jacob , this morning  --  not in bed yet ? Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress Oh , no  --  he went off to school half an hour ago . Change . Jacob Changeless And what time does he return home ? Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress About half past three ; and then , poor child , eats his dinner , and studies till near nine . Change . Jacob Changeless Humph ! About ten hours ' study per day . Somewhat less than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this system puts me in a passion . Julia . Julia Progress Take care , uncle ; while you 're growing warm , your coffee is cooling . Change . Jacob Changeless You 're right , Julia . ( Drinks his coffee , and turns his chair towards the fire . ) Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress What ! finished already ? Change . Jacob Changeless Yes ; a cup of coffee and a piece of toast satisfy me . ( To Julia , who brings him a morning paper . ) Thank you , Jule . And now I am about to issue an edict . Listen  --  tremble  --  and obey ! Julia Julia Progress ( smiling ) . I listen  --  tremble  --  Change . Jacob Changeless And obey ? As in the marriage service , that is the most important word here . Julia . Julia Progress Not till I hear what you have to say . Change . Jacob Changeless Ah  --  you suspect me . It 's about that Meadows fellow , I confess . He must not be permitted to enter this house without my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle , you are unreasonable in your demands . Would you be as despotic as a Chinese emperor ? Change . Jacob Changeless Try me ! Disobey if you dare . Nay , no remonstrance . Julia . Julia Progress I will speak , uncle . I , for one , will not obey you . Change . Jacob Changeless Very well , indeed  --  very well . You sha n't marry him at all then . I dare say he is a poor witless , miserable , slinky specimen of humanity  --  unworthy your affection  --  Julia Julia Progress ( reproachfully ) . Uncle ! Change . Jacob Changeless Like all the rest of the beaux in these degenerate days  --  tame  --  stupid  --  insipid ! Julia . Julia Progress Uncle , you ought to be ashamed of yourself ! ( Bursts into tears , and Mrs. P. leads her out . ) Change . Jacob Changeless Poor girl  --  I did n't mean to hurt her feelings  --  but I 'm so confoundedly hot-headed . ' Sblood ! I am always doing something I do n't intend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a good sign  --  shows she has feelings . Tears indicate heart , affectionate disposition , fond temperament . Yes  --  yes  --  I 'm glad to see her cry . The girl has spirit , too  --  none of your boarding-school young ladies ' deception about her . ' Gad , she flew in my face like a hen-partridge in fear for her young . I like to see it . ( Reads newspaper . ) Progress John Progress ( aside ) . Faith , as uncle says , he is a little hot-headed . ' T is a wonder that the frost of sixty odd winters should n't have cooled his blood a little . Somewhat cranky and eccentric is the old gentleman ; but with all his odd notions , his heart 's in the right place , after all . Change . Jacob Changeless ( reads aloud ) . " Ten men killed by a train running off the track ! Forty scalded to death , besides many seriously injured in a steamboat ! " This is your modern improvement , as you call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What say you to this , nephew ? Prog . John Progress I say that where one traveler is now killed by railroad or steamboat , ten were killed before in stages . Change . Jacob Changeless Nephew , I must say you are one of the most prejudiced men I have ever seen . Experience , nephew , experience teaches us that stages are the safest . Why , look at me ; here have I traveled for sixty odd years in stages , and have never had my neck broken yet . Prog . John Progress And was your neck ever broken by a locomotive , uncle ? Change . Jacob Changeless ( in a passion ) . Confound it , nephew , you are enough to provoke a saint  --  you would wear out the patience of Job ! You can never listen to reason , without asking some of your impertinent questions . This , I presume , is the modern mode of arguing . Prog . John Progress No , sir , it is nearly as old as the hills  --  the Socratic mode . Change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of it . But you wo n't deny that you have prejudices ? Prog . John Progress Perhaps not . But suppose I were to retort the charge on you ? Change . Jacob Changeless I prejudiced  --  you astound me ! Hark'ee , nephew . I have lived now nigh threescore years and ten , but never till this day has that imputation been cast upon me . Prejudiced ! I like that  --  impudence !  --  ( reads newspaper again . ) What a Police report ! Nephew , you must at least acknowledge that the human race is unquestionably degenerating . Prog . John Progress Pardon me  --  I ca n't allow that . Change . Jacob Changeless So , John , it is as I have understood . You have been led astray by these new systems of philosophy and morals . Prog . John Progress Yes , sir , I look forward to , and believe in , the infinite perfectibility of man . Change . Jacob Changeless The infinite perfectibility of humbug , you mean ! So , so , you belong to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owenites  --  Fanny Wrights ? I had better leave my money to an insane hospital at once , and have the credit of posthumous charity . Prog . John Progress But , sir , when we investigate the mutations of mankind , and study the history of our species , are we not authorized in coming to the conclusion that the human race is in a continual course of change , improvement , melioration ? Change . Jacob Changeless No , sir !  --  no , sir !  --  of change , if you will ,  --  of improvement , I doubt . ' T is true we find in ancient times , more examples of open , undisguised vice , but we find , likewise , more of brilliant unconquerable virtue . They were formerly separate , distinct , marked , like the various ingredients of a pie ; now they are more intimately blended , like those same matters baked in that pie  --  with a crust over them .

The age of gold has , in one sense , come again ; but , nevertheless , I believe that the Millennium has not yet commenced ! Prog . John Progress That 's not the question , uncle  --  but whether the human race is improving . I believe that it is . Change . Jacob Changeless Yes , and so do I , just as I believe that the race of chickens is improving under the genial auspices of the Eccaleobion ! Confound the word ! Will you credit me , when I assure you that a meddling neighbor of mine , who reads all the agricultural papers , and such like stuff , hinted to me the other day the propriety of sending all my eggs to New York to be hatched ? Prog . John Progress ( aside ) . I 'd have given five dollars to have seen the old gentleman when this proposition was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you answer ? Change . Jacob Changeless I told him , sir , that sooner than thus demoralize my hens , I would see him and all the scientific jackasses in Christendom , d  --  farther ! He seemed astonished at my warmth , and went off in confusion . Prog . John Progress Ha ! ha ! ha ! I think , however , you were rather hard on him , considering there was no harm in his proposition . Change . Jacob Changeless Harm ! I tell you , sir , you 're blind  --  the whole world 's blind . But I see it , sir  --  I feel it  --  I know it . There is a deep-laid conspiracy now going into operation , which has for its object , sir , the uprooting of the foundations of all filial affection in this world . They have begun with the chickens  --  " ab ovo , " as the saying is ; but think ye they will stop there ? No , sir , man will come in his turn , and we shall , ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves . Prog . John Progress Pshaw , uncle , you are letting your imagination run away with you . Change . Jacob Changeless I am not , sir . Do n't I hear about " communities , " and " societies , " and " unions , " and what not ? We shall all live in common one of these days , like ants . Prog . John Progress And why not ? What objection ? Change . Jacob Changeless Why not ? Ah , Johnny , if you had but a hundred or two thousand dollars in the banks , you would soon change your mind about this living in common . Thank Heaven , I shall not live to see the day ! If I were to live my life over again , I would emigrate forthwith to China ! Prog . John Progress Poh ! poh ! Delusions ! Dreams ! Change . Jacob Changeless " Poh , poh , " indeed ! " Delusions , dreams ! "  --  Yes , yes , everybody is wrong but Mr. John Progress . Mr. John Progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prog . John Progress Nay , uncle , I did not mean to insult you . Change .

I 'll leave the house . ( Moves off . ) " Poh , poh ! "  --  that 's no insult , I suppose , Mr. John Progress  --  was in old times  --  " Poh , poh ! " ( Exit Changeless . ) Prog . John Progress I 'm sorry I have offended the old gentleman , but I must say that he is confoundedly dogmatical , and averse to opposition and argument . His good feelings , though , will soon bring him back in a very penitent mood , and he always likes one the better , when he has had a regular quarrel with him . As to the infinite perfectibility of man , no one shall ever persuade me to the contrary ! SCENE III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking . ) Change . Jacob Changeless What possessed me to get into a passion ? Very impudent , though , in Progress  --  very impudent . ( Enter Dick Meadows . ) Dick . Dick Meadows Hollo ! antediluvian , how are you ? Any bones broken ? Your locomotion seems to be tolerable . Change . Jacob Changeless ( aside ) . These modern improvement gentlemen strike me as being deucedly cool and familiar to their seniors . I 'm totally unacquainted with this fellow  --  never saw him before , to my recollection . Now in my day  --  Dick . Dick Meadows Well , old primitive , do n't you intend to answer a civil question ? Open your mouth and speak , antediluvian . Change . Jacob Changeless Why antediluvian , at your service , youngster ? Do I look old ? Have I the moss of centuries about me ? Dick . Dick Meadows Not at all , sir . As to moss , if you mean hair , to be sure you have not much left , and that 's pretty white ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on parade ; being , I presume , militia troops , not of the regular line . Change . Jacob Changeless That 's a malicious observation . Dick . Dick Meadows And your phiz is a little wrinkled ; but , on the whole , you are very well preserved . I call you antediluvian , because I rescued you , if I am not mistaken , the other night , as it were , from the wreck of another world , and no offence , I hope . Change . Jacob Changeless Not at all ; rather the reverse , if I might venture to express a decided opinion in these days of non-committal . So you are one of those who dragged me from the public moat t' other night ? I thank thee , ephemeron . Dick . Dick Meadows Much obliged ; but why ephemeron ? Change . Jacob Changeless Because I perceive you are one of these infernal modern butterflies , popinjays , and  --  Dick . Dick Meadows So forth , so forth . That 'll do , antiquity . I knock under . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , and display me in a glass case or museum . Decidedly inconvenient and unpleasant . What say you , old moth-eaten ? But , father Time , whence came you , and whither are you bound ? Changeless Jacob Changeless ( seriously ) . I came from the mysterious past , and I shall be lost , ere long , in the mysterious future . Dick . Dick Meadows In plain words , how came you , Mr. Unknown , here  --  in this identical spot , I mean ? Do you know what you 're standing on ? Change . Jacob Changeless ( steps hastily backwards ) . Good heavens , no ! Dick . Dick Meadows You see that iron plate there ? Change . Jacob Changeless ( with curiosity ) . Yes , I see it . Dick . Dick Meadows Well , that covers a cap in a Croton water pipe . Change . Jacob Changeless So that , if that same cap had come off as I stood there , I might have been carried up sky high in the midst of a column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Iceland ? Dick . Dick Meadows There can be no doubt of it ! Change . Jacob Changeless Then I say , the Devil take all modern improvements . Is there no place where a man can be safe for one moment in this infernal city ? I am disgusted with it . I have a great mind to leave it , as I have just quitted my nephew Progress ' house yonder  --  in a passion . Dick Dick Meadows ( aside ) . Then this is Julia 's uncle , as I supposed . ( Aloud . ) And how came that , may I ask ? Change . Jacob Changeless Why , we plunged into a discussion about the infinite perfectibility of man , and I said some harsh things to him . Dick . Dick Meadows Served him right , I 'll be bound  --  poor Jack o'Lantern ! Change . Jacob Changeless No , sir , I did n't serve him right . I was wrong , sir , I was wrong . Young man , if you 're going that way , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one feels so deuced small to go like a baby , and solicit forgiveness . Dick . Dick Meadows I 'll do it with pleasure .

Dick Meadows Mr. Richard Meadows , at your service ; commonly called Cheerful Dick . But I must go and deliver your message . Change . Jacob Changeless No , no , no . Dick Meadows ? Do n't go , do n't go . They wo n't let you in . Dick Dick Meadows ( stopping in amazement ) . How do you know that ? Ah ha ! trust me to find my way . ( Hurries off . ) Change .

Yes , yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Exit Dick Meadows . ) Change . Jacob Changeless Stay  --  I 'll wait here and watch his movements . There he goes up the steps , as I 'm a sinner ! How disappointed he will be when he is denied admittance . Ha ! ha ! ha ! he would n't take my advice , and now  --  I declare I almost feel sorry for the poor lad .  --  Ha ! what 's that I see ? He enters , by Heavens ! The minx Julia !  --  but I 'll disconcert them  --  I 'll surprise ' em  --  I 'll make ' em all miserable for disobeying me .

I met a queer old fish up the street , and he assured me positively that I would n't get in . First , he gave me a message for your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver it . He must be your uncle ; I ladled him out of a corporation soup-tureen last night . Julia . Julia Progress Alas ! my Uncle Changeless ! He has declared that I shall not marry you . I fear he will not belie his name . Dick . Dick Meadows What objection does he urge when he can not know anything of me ? Julia . Julia Progress He does not set his face against you in particular , but he pronounces all the young men of the present generation to be degenerate , heartless , witless specimens of humanity . ( Enter Changeless unperceived ) . Dick . Dick Meadows Confound his old-fashioned notions  --  the ancient granny ! Change . Jacob Changeless ( aside ) . Thank you , Mr. Dick , I 'll take a note of that  --  ( produces a pencil and book , and writes . ) Dick . Dick Meadows The old curmudgeon , the worn-out bundle of obsolete prejudices , who would separate two loving hearts because he has been out of town forty years . What does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talk was about the youth of Babylon , he might be good authority . Change . Jacob Changeless ( aside ) . Thank you , Mr. Dick , not quite so venerable as that comes to . Dick . Dick Meadows I detest the old dried-up remnant of mortality . I scorn these meddling relics of departed ages . I hate him . Why does not the old fool die ? Change . Jacob Changeless ( aside ) . Go on , Dicky ! go on ! I 'll put all your flattering observations down . Julia . Julia Progress Nay , nay , dear Richard , do n't speak in that way of Uncle Changeless . He is a dear old man , and loves me well , I am sure . He has some queer old-fashioned notions about him , to be sure , which you must not blame , although they do come in our way . No , no , if you love me , do n't speak ill of him . Change . Jacob Changeless ( aside ) . What a dear little creature ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . The old fellow has some good points , I believe ; and I dare say is a fine old chap in his way ; but confound his prejudices , say I , as if a man were any the better or worse for having been born forty years sooner or later . Julia Julia Progress ( laughing ) . I assure you , Mr. Richard Meadows , that if you had been born forty years sooner , I should not have considered it a matter of no importance . Change . Jacob Changeless ( aside ) . Well said , little Julia . Dick . Dick Meadows That 's true . I did n't exactly mean that I wished I had been born last century , but  --  confound it , if the old codger had n't already seen me , I might have appeared in a gray wig and antique vest , and carried the day triumphantly . Change . Jacob Changeless ( aside ) . Thank you , Dick , my boy , for your opinion of my penetration . Does he think I 'm a blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must let me abuse him a little . It is absolutely necessary to the preservation of my health . Change . Jacob Changeless ( coming forward ) . A little !  --  oh yes , go on , sir , go on ! I like to hear it , and it seems to be a pleasant recreation to you . Speak out to my face . Do go on , now , I beg of you . Dick . Dick Meadows The old boy himself ! Julia . Julia Progress Uncle Changeless ! Change . Jacob Changeless Yes , here am I in person  --  here is the " ancient granny "  --  ( looks at his book )  --  the old curmudgeon or codger , the cotemporary of the Babylonish youth , who ought to be persuaded to die , the relic of bygone times , with other aliases too numerous to mention . Do n't let me interrupt you  --  Go on ! Julia . Julia Progress Oh , Uncle Changeless ! Dick . Dick Meadows Oh , Uncle Changeless ! Change . Jacob Changeless Cool , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have you to know , sir , that I never was your uncle , and never intend to be your uncle , sir . So away with you  --  ' Seat ! Dick .

Dick Meadows You , too !  --  then am I miserable indeed ! ( Turns to go ) . Julia . Julia Progress No , no ,  --  I  --  I  --  I  --  Change . Jacob Changeless Speak , Julia dear ; I would not have you say what you do not mean . Julia . Julia Progress I only mean  --  go  --  for the present . Change . Jacob Changeless A fine dismissal indeed !  --  ( Exit Dick Meadows , kissing his hand to Julia. )  --  And so , Miss , you really fancy the fellow ? Well , he has some good points about him , as he said of me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I see . But what if I veto him ? Julia . Julia Progress Dear uncle , would you break my heart ? Change . Jacob Changeless Dear niece , would you break my commands ? Julia . Julia Progress Alas , I have already done so ! Change . Jacob Changeless Then you opened the door , eh ? Nay , do n't blush ; I do n't think any the worse of you for that ! Come , come , we 'll give the fellow a fair trial . We 'll invite him to dinner . You shall make a mince pie for him . We 'll have a grand frolic . Yes , yes , we 'll invite him to dinner . We 'll see what he 's made of . Julia Julia Progress ( mischievously ) .

I must blow up a bubble somehow or other , or else make tracks at once , for the law will be down upon me shortly like a double-patent cow-catcher , unless something turns up . If I could only establish a joint-stock company  --  lay out a railroad  --  fill my pockets  --  and then persuade the state to buy it , or lend money on it , all the same , it would be a grand operation .

Meanwhile , I must plan some lesser scheme to keep me alive . And now for my daily perambulation in Wall street , on pretence of important business  --  necessary  --  must be done  --  people think you have money left  --  keeps up one 's reputation for wealth .

Too cool by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Progress Uncle , do n't be offended again . I only meant that I knew you could n't harbor resentment long , with no better reason than you had . Change .

Where 's my dear niece Julia ?  --  ( Enter Julia . ) Ah , here she comes  --  my little beauty  --  my cherry-ripe . I declare , your cheek reminds me of one of my genuine malicatunes  --  nay , I protest it surpasses the peaches . You look like one of the ladies of my time . Julia . Julia Progress Why , uncle , I 'm sure I have no wrinkles yet , that you should compare me with such antiquated dames . Change . Jacob Changeless Nonsense . I mean you 're not one of these white oak wheyey-looking women . You know a lamb from a turkey , that 's one comfort . You have breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know what green fields and meadows are  --  excuse me , Julia , I mean green fields and enclosures , pastures . Julia .

But I wished to see you about our projected feast . We 'll give our dinner to-morrow . Julia . Julia Progress To-morrow , uncle ? You know you want me to eclipse all the cheesy ladies , as you are pleased to call them , with my most exquisite beauty , my green field charms and peach blossom complexion , to-morrow night , at Mrs. Rauticumscout 's general mle . Prog . John Progress Mle ! True , when you cram five hundred people into a small house , the consequence must inevitably be a sort of well-bred riot .

Jacob Changeless Ah , I understand . So much the better . I can judge whether Dick possesses the virtue of self-denial , whether he bears disappointment philosophically or not . Say no more . It shall come off to-morrow  --  and here comes . ( Enter Mrs. P. ) Mrs. Progress , to be consulted about the arrangements . Mary , my dear , Julia and I have been plotting a great dinner for tomorrow . Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress To-morrow ! Why there will be no time to prepare the jelly , and blanc-mange , and syllabub , and  --  Prog . John Progress But , Mary , you can procure those things at the confectioners . Change . Jacob Changeless Confectioners ! Nephew , have you a design upon my life , that you suggest the poisoning of me with any of their horrible trash ? Prog . John Progress But the confectioners now-a-days  --  Change . Jacob Changeless I know what you 're about to say  --  they all understand chemistry , that devilish , deceitful , diabolical science . Yes , they make isinglass now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all such truck . Moreover , I do n't ask for any of your kickshaws at all . Give us a good substantial dinner , a good soup , a fish , a roast and a boil , and I ask for nothing more , except a mince-pie for the sake of old associations . As for desert , properly understood , Mrs. Progress , it is an extinct feature in entertainments , since the extermination of old woolly-headed cooks and Dutch housekeepers . Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress Mr. Changeless , I am rather inclined to dispute that position . ( Progress motions her to keep quiet . ) However , I 'll try what can be done at such short notice . Change . Jacob Changeless And now for the guests . Nephew , whom shall we have ? Prog . John Progress Let me see  --  there 's Nicholas Content . Change . Jacob Changeless What ! my old friend Content alive yet ? How has the world gone with him these many years ? Prog . John Progress He has gone with the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he has ever floated with the stream ; neither faster nor slower . He has been all his life as a cork on the surface of the current , carried unresistingly on wheresoever the flood chose to cast him , spinning round with the eddies , and always satisfied with the world as it happened to be . He has experienced reverses , but never been disheartened , and wears his years well , by reason of having never disquieted himself about the welfare of poor humanity at large . He is a complete optimist , and his philosophy teaches him to bow to the will of the majority , and to keep pace with the progress of modern  --  Change . Jacob Changeless Hush . We 'll have Content for " auld acquaintance " sake . Who else ? Prog . John Progress Then there 's Barnaby Imitate  --  perhaps he might fill a place . Change . Jacob Changeless Another of my acquaintances . I shall find myself surrounded by a sea of friends ere long . Has Imitate yet grown into any decided character ? Prog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can call it such , for he borrows his hue from foreign opinions . He dare n't decide on any question till he learns what the Quarterly Review thinks on the subject , and if the Edinburgh Review pronounced Shakspeare nil , he would succumb to its authority , and immediately follow suit . In short , he is an abject worshiper of the English periodicals . Change . Jacob Changeless Who have persuaded him , I suppose , that Napoleon was a wretched soldier , and , on the whole , a very ordinary sort of man . Never mind , we 'll invite him for the same reason as we admitted Content . One more . Prog . John Progress Mr. Layton Toothick ? Julia . Julia Progress No , I object to him . He overwhelms me with his first quality conceit , his second hand compliments , and third rate sentiment . I can not abide that class of men that plaster you , as masons do laths , with a rough coat of half-mixed , coarse , and undisguised flattery , and seem to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Changeless Right , Julia . This excess of compliments reminds me of my old dog at home , who slabbers all over your hand when he means to be particularly civil . Speak again , nephew . Prog . John Progress Mr. Temperance Gormandize ? Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress I veto him . He eats like a famished beast at your table , and depreciates your cookery afterwards . He expatiates on the sin of drunkenness , and even as he speaks , stuffs himself in a way that would disgrace a dog . Moreover , while he is thus feeding like a beast , he prates of the luxury and extravagance of the poor . Change . Jacob Changeless Condemned . Try again , John . Prog . John Progress Mr. Ammoniac Mole ? Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress Oh , husband , how can you think of him ? Change . Jacob Changeless Why , what have you against the dull-sighted gentleman ? Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress I was afraid you might not fancy him . He can talk of nothing but carbon , albumen , gluten , pollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peat , calcareous manures , clayey and sandy marls , slate , gray-whack , and all such incomprehensible compositions . Change . Jacob Changeless Ah , a conglomeration of soils , eh ? A Liebigian , Johnstoneian , Boussangaultian decoction ! That infamous chemistry will be the ruin of this country yet . We are a people that always run things to extremes , and we are at present all chemistry-mad . And you think me so illiberal , Mrs. Progress , as to object to him because of his fantasy ? Not I ; I will have him on that very account . No persons are such agreeable companions as those who differ in opinion . Variety for me . We 'll have a party of oddities , eh , Jule ? Julia . Julia Progress Certainly , sir . ( Smiles . ) Change . Jacob Changeless What are you laughing at , you baggage ? You have some mischief in your head , I 'll swear . Prog . John Progress Then there 's  --  Change . Jacob Changeless Hold ! Three strangers are enough . Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will have Dick , never fear  --  he is the very keystone of the arch  --  the origin , the end , the alpha and the omega , as we had it at college  --  Julia .

Boy Please , sir , a ticket , sir . ( Hands Dick a note , receives a shilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads to himself , then speaks ) . Hurrah ! the old gentleman thinks that , with proper cultivation , I may , some of these days , come to something . He is rather pleased with my vivacity , as he terms it . I 'll keep up the illusion  --  I 'll execute some maneuvers which shall be irresistible  --  I 'll win his heart by playing tricks upon him . ( Looks at the note again . ) So Changeless wishes Julia to go to a ball to-morrow night , and insists on her having her hair dressed by a professor , as in old times . Ha , a capital opportunity to commence operations . I 'll begin my experiments before the sun rises again by enacting a knight of the curling tongs , by way of a feeler . The fact is , though the old gentleman seems to be rather taken with me , I do n't see that I am likely to make much progress toward the grand result in a hurry . I must see if I ca n't push him on by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rival or two to bear on him , it might help .

As for Andrew  --  ( Enter Andrew Ball. ) here , in the very nick of time , he comes . Andrew . Andrew Ball So it appears you were thinking of me ? Dick . Dick Meadows Yes  --  I say , Andrew , you 're about to do me a great favor . Andrew . Andrew Ball The deuce I am  --  this is the first I have heard of it . Dick . Dick Meadows That do n't alter the case , my good friend . Your duty is easy of accomplishment . You are to fall mortally in love with a young lady for my sake ; be her most devoted admirer , and offend her uncle as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see  --  plain as daylight . Andrew . Andrew Ball Truly , a very fine plot . But , my dear fellow , I ca n't engage in this affair . I  --  I  --  to tell you the truth , I am in love with another lady on my own account . Dick . Dick Meadows I dare say the affair will keep warm without fanning for a few days . Besides , I do n't want you actually and literally to fall in love with her , but only to keep up the semblance of a most terrific attachment . Andrew . Andrew Ball But , suppose I were to captivate the lady 's young affections ? What a scrape I should be in ! Dick . Dick Meadows Why , you conceited vagabond , never fear . The idea is absurd  --  most absurd . Andrew . Andrew Ball Do n't indulge in such infernally severe jokes , Dick , or I shall fly the track , and decline making love to unknown beauties . Dick . Dick Meadows But she is not an unknown beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Julia Progress , and I trust you will lend me a hand in winning her . Andrew . Andrew Ball And you expect me , I suppose , to badger that old pepper-pot we encountered the other night ? My dear Dick , you might as well request me to board a fire-ship in full blast . Dick . Dick Meadows His bark is worse than his bite , as I know from experience . Andrew . Andrew Ball Will you pay all doctors ' bills , and other debts incurred in this adventure ? Dick . Dick Meadows Certainly . I hold myself responsible for all damages . Andrew . Andrew Ball Cracked skulls ? Dick . Dick Meadows On my word , I should say yours a pretty tough affair  --  a sort of maple knot . I insure your head-piece . Andrew . Andrew Ball Broken necks ? Dick . Dick Meadows Yes  --  neck or nothing . Proceed . Andrew . Andrew Ball Bloody noses ? Dick . Dick Meadows I 'll purchase a bottle of the eau Brocchieri for your especial benefit . Andrew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll salve them up with the balsam of sympathy . Andrew . Andrew Ball No , no , none of your quack specifics . Dick . Dick Meadows Then I 'll soothe them , as wise women do burns , with the oil of thyme . Time is infallible . Andrew . Andrew Ball And when shall I essay this perilous exploit ? Dick . Dick Meadows I must first see Julia , that she may understand and be prepared for this sudden attack of affection . Andrew . Andrew Ball Let it be soon : I already begin to feel the fury of adventure growing upon me . I long to rescue the maiden from the jaws of the dragon . Dick , I find I am a perfect hero  --  a modern Perseus  --  a Guy of Warwick  --  a Scandinavian monster-slayer  --  another Putnam . Dick .

What a situation  --  what circumstances !  --  a lone youth , in the heart of a great city , beneath his lady-love 's windows ! Pitch dark  --  not a light to be seen in heaven or on earth , and no danger of interruption . Faith , if it were not for the absurdity of now receding , I would give up my enterprise , and take to moralizing like a drunken man for the benefit of the mud-gutters , those uncomplaining and ill-used servants of the city government , who do most of the dirty work of the contractors , and get none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may .

It almost frightens me . I have a great mind to be off . ( A window is opened , and Changeless puts out his head . ) Change .

What the deuce can have carried that scapegrace of a fellow off at this time of day ? There was a time when a gentleman was scarce fairly dressed and powdered for the day at this hour . If the rascal do n't return soon , there will be the devil to pay . I shall go off in disgust , Dick will miss his invitation , and Julia will be discontented . I presume I must mount guard , and patiently await his return . Let 's see what Dick amuses himself with . ( Walks to a table and takes up a paper . ) What 's this ? A caricature in pencil ! What can be the meaning of the inscription underneath ? " O. K.  --  S. S. has been outmaneuvered. 10,000 certain . " O , that 's old ; but K. , what on earth can K. stand for ?

Jacob Changeless There , ( thrusts the paper in his face , ) look , look , look , and answer for yourself ! Dick . Dick Meadows Well , sir , I see nothing there that has anything to do with my character . Change . Jacob Changeless You do n't ! Why do you not sink through the floor with shame ? These are modern morals , principles , actions . A gentleman makes love to the niece , and caricatures the uncle ! Dick . Dick Meadows Ha , ha , ha ! So you take that for a caricature of yourself ? Change . Jacob Changeless Yes , sir ! If you deny it , explain instantly . Dick . Dick Meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a bet with a gentleman on a certain election . My friend , Andrew Ball , knowing this , has probably been here this morning and left the caricature , for he has a knack that way . The explanation I take to be this : O. K.  --  that 's common  --  all correct : S. S. , Samson Shouter , has been out-maneuvered. 10,000 majority against him certain . So I win my bet . Change . Jacob Changeless I 'm glad you have explained it , Dick , and I hope you wo n't be offended . I 've lived so long alone , that my imagination gets the better of my reason sometimes . But betting on elections , Dick , is wrong ; a very dangerous practice . Dick . Dick Meadows I know it . It is not a habit with me , I assure you ; but I could not resist the temptation , in this instance , of cutting down a dinner-party politician , who boasted in great style of what his candidate would do . Change . Jacob Changeless Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning ? I have waited here this half hour . Dick . Dick Meadows In search of amusement . Amongst other incidents , I encountered a former rival of mine , and we had a talk . Whether he has yet entirely given up all pretensions to Julia I doubt , for he is one of your enterprising fellows . Change . Jacob Changeless What 's his name ? Dick . Dick Meadows Mr. Elihu Go-ahead . Change . Jacob Changeless Hum  --  Go-ahead ! Bad name  --  detestable ! Dick . Dick Meadows He is a sort of perpetual motion machine  --  an uneasy , restless spirit ; ever plotting , planning , surveying , scheming ; always desiring to improve on things that every reasonable being is satisfied with already . Show him the finest statue in the world , and he would volunteer to cut a better with a jack-knife . He can scarcely breathe , except when he 's going at the rate of thirty miles an hour , and does everything in the shortest possible time . He feeds himself as he would a locomotive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  drinks on the same system ; walks , thinks , talks , and , I half believe , sleeps , twice as fast as ordinary mortals . He is the embodied spirit of change . Change . Jacob Changeless I understand . One of these modern pests of humanity , which torment you on every subject , from railroads down to pins . Dick . Dick Meadows Yes , I recollect a fellow in a seedy coat , who almost insisted on my buying some shares in a South Carolina gold mine . " And what do you hold them at ? " asked I. " Par , sir , par ! " was the reply . I declined buying , although he eventually offered them as low as ten per cent . on the dollar . He then wanted to sell me insurance stock at " par , sir , par , " which I , in like manner , declined . He forthwith produced a miraculous salve or balsam  --  the Vegetable Extract of Caoutchouc , which he assured me was indispensable for weak lungs , inasmuch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs would answer my purpose without it . Whereupon he prophesied my approaching death , and finally wound up his exhortation by begging two shillings to purchase a dinner . I gave him half a dollar , in consideration of his originality . He then went off with his portfolio stuffed with inestimable scrip , stock , and shares . Change . Jacob Changeless ( aside ) . This really seems to be a sensible young man . ( Aloud . ) You call him an original . Their name is Legion ! Dick . Dick Meadows He was a new character to me then . I saw him once afterwards , on board a steamboat at the foot of Barclay street . His coat had grown still more seedy , and he had descended in the scale of society , for he now retailed magazines . I purchased one of him , and gave him half a dollar , and waited for the change . He examined the coin , and asked me if it was a good one . " Yes , sir , " said I , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me sheepishly , when at that moment the cry was heard , " All ashore that 's going ! " My friend darted off , was ashore in an instant , and in the confusion doubtless forgot that he owed me twenty-five cents change . Change . Jacob Changeless Yes , sir , that 's the principle they all go upon . Oh for the good old days of honesty and regular habits ! The progress of luxury is really shocking . Will you believe it , Dick , a rascally hair-dresser actually routed us all up at two o'clock last night , to dress Julia 's hair ? Dick . Dick Meadows Is it possible ? What depravity ! But I have been told , Mr. Changeless , that the ladies in old times used often to have their hair dressed the night before , and sit up till the hour came for them to be exhibited to an admiring multitude . Change . Jacob Changeless Scandal , Dick ; or if they did , they were worth looking at when they showed themselves , I can assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius . But I must tell you the most curious part of last night 's adventure . On inquiry , nobody had engaged the rascal . I wish I could come across the vagabond . I caught a sore throat opening my window , and am so hoarse I speak with difficulty  --  hem  --  hem  --  hem . Dick . Dick Meadows I was just about to ask when you caught such a cold . Change . Jacob Changeless ( aside ) . I suspect the fellow very much . He wears such a guilty look of lamb-like innocence . I 'll try him . ( Aloud . ) Julia too  --  poor Julia  --  Dick . Dick Meadows Good Heavens , Julia ? I had no idea of the foolish joke ending so fatally . I must go  --  Change . Jacob Changeless So you were at the bottom of it , you young scamp ! I 've found you out , have I ? Do n't be alarmed ; I was merely about to say , that Julia seemed a good deal put out at being roused so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seriously offended , Mr. Changeless . Change . Jacob Changeless No , you rogue , I am not  --  only I wish there had been some point to your joke . I have a great mind to cheat you out of an invitation to dinner I bring for you to-day at my nephew 's , though I suppose Julia would rate me well if I were to venture on such an assumption of responsibility . Dick . Dick Meadows It would be very unbecoming a plenipotentiary , no doubt . Change . Jacob Changeless That reminds me , Dick , of an idea I had . As you seem to be an adventurous youth , we will enter into articles of agreement  --  diplomatic stipulations . Dick . Dick Meadows Let me hear the conditions I am expected to ratify . Change . Jacob Changeless First , then , remember you are not to enter my nephew 's house unless specially invited . Dick . Dick Meadows ( aside ) . How shall I get out of this scrape ?

Jacob Changeless So , you are one of those who landed me on terra firma the other night ? Come to St. Lawrence County , sir , next spring , if you are fond of angling , and I will show you better fishing than that . Andrew . Andrew Ball Thank you , sir ; I believe I will avail myself of your kind invitation . Change . Jacob Changeless Do so , sir ; I shall be always happy to see you . You will confer an obligation . Strangers are scarce in my part of the world . Andrew . Andrew Ball As to the hieroglyphics , Dick , I thought you would understand them at once . Sampson Shouter has been defeated . Change . Jacob Changeless Dick , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman 's honor to be a sufficient guaranty for the truth of his words . It used to be considered so . But , who is this Shouter ? Dick . Dick Meadows Quite a distinguished man in political life , sir ; who aspires to high office , and bases his claims pretty much on the strength of his lungs and of his arm , for he will bring down his fist on his desk , in the way of argument , in a style and with a momentum a blacksmith might envy . For aught I know , he has the presidency itself in view . Change . Jacob Changeless Ah , in my early days , the people had some discrimination . Dick . Dick Meadows And they have not yet lost it , let me tell you , Mr. Changeless . They may be deceived in minor matters by scheming demagogues , with which , I grant you , we are overrun , but they are very apt to come out right on great questions after all . Change .

No , sir , carry as little baggage as you possibly can , or we shall never agree . I myself will fit you out like a genuine sportsman . Good day again . I must to Wall street for an hour .

But if he should refuse  --  I can not bear to think of it . Dear , dear Richard ! ( A bell is rung . ) His ring  --  I know it . How quick these earthly senses do become when true affection and the cherub Love the chords that are the holiest in our nature thrill .  --  But I must chide  --  chide him I most of all , and before all else on earth , do love  --  rebuke him for his follies .

If your uncle do n't give his consent soon , I shall certainly do something horrid . Julia . Julia Progress Do n't talk so , Richard dear ; you make me uneasy . Dick . Dick Meadows Fear not . I am not thinking of blowing out my brains , but I shall cut some diabolical caper , I mean , to please Changeless .

Richard , I would have nothing to recollect in the lover which I should be ashamed to see repeated when a nearer and a dearer tie has bound us more closely together . There is a certain publicity in thus confiding your attachment to a friend , which is not agreeable to me ; and for him to be brought up here to impose on my good uncle  --  I can not consent to it . I beseech you to dismiss the idea . Dick . Dick Meadows You 're right , dearest  --  high-minded now , as ever . I regret my folly , but fear I can not help it . By nature , age and constitution I am wild , but I shall no doubt sober down , one of these days , into a most admirably quiet and dull husband .

( Aside . ) There 's no persuading him to the railroad , that 's clear . I 'll try the other project . ( Aloud . ) Mr. Changeless , one of the greatest improvements of the age is the economy practiced in the burning of fuel . Now I , sir , have invented a stove which exceeds everything yet , but I find myself in want of the capital to enable me to introduce it successfully to the public . If you would wish , therefore , to purchase part of my patent right , I should be disposed to be accommodating as to price . Extraordinary invention  --  soon become universal  --  economy  --  air-tight . Change . Jacob Changeless Mr. Go-ahead , if I could instantly annihilate every stove , and all recollection of them , from the face of the earth , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , they are one cause of the degeneracy of the human race . Air-tight !  --  one of those diabolical contrivances , I suppose , that explodes , if you do not spend half your time in attending on it . Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead I assure you , sir  --  Change . Jacob Changeless Assure me not , for I have made up my mind not to believe you . Sir , a man who is so wedded to railroads , who invents air-tight stoves , is not deserving of credit . Mark me , sir , I say it is impossible that he should speak the truth . Truth and stoves I hold to be incompatible . When you find a man that warms himself by a good , roaring , cheerful , sparkling , hearty , old-fashioned hickory fire , trust him implicitly without further inquiry . Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead Mr. Changeless , these are very strange opinions  --  would n't meet with the public approbation . Change . Jacob Changeless Opinions !  --  I express my sincere conviction . Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changeless Yes , sir . Ten thousand times , yes . I would see you and your whole generation crammed into the mouths of your stoves , before I would condescend to interest myself in sheet-iron and such like economical nonsense . Besides , it 's a wicked plot  --  it 's no better than manslaughter . Why , sir , the average of human life is shortened at least ten years by the prevalent use of stoves . To be sure , there is economy in that . Elihu . Elihu Go-ahead Sir , you are behind the age  --  three hundred years at least  --  public opinion , sir  --  spirit of the nineteenth century  --  Change . Jacob Changeless Away , Beelzebub , prince of diabolical inventions ! Vanish , spirit of the nineteenth century , or I shall do something I may be ashamed of . I can contain myself no longer  --  I shall be obliged to put myself into a strait-jacket  --  ( Advances furiously upon Elihu . ) Elihu Elihu Go-ahead ( aside ) . An escaped lunatic , as I 'm a sinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Change . Jacob Changeless So , nephew , here have I had a sort of patent man , who tried to inveigle me into railroads and air-tight stoves , and I know not what ; but I became warm , and told him certain dry truths which seemed to disagree with him . Elihu Go-ahead , he called himself . Prog . John Progress Ah , my old acquaintance , Elihu . A man of comprehensive views , that , but sanguine  --  too sanguine . He 's poor now  --  was rich , but lost his property in the service of his country , by laying out towns  --  Change . Jacob Changeless On paper , I suppose . Prog . John Progress Railroads , canals , and in other enterprises of the like nature . He was very attentive to Julia last year , and I rather encouraged him . I liked his energy and opinions , but Julia would have nothing to say to him . Change . Jacob Changeless I do n't wonder . A woman might as well marry a steam-pipe or an electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recollect Dick told me of him . Damme , what possessed me to quarrel with Dick ? I wish I could find the fellow  --  I would marry him to Julia at once to save her from that monster . ( Enter Mrs. P. ) ( Raising his voice . ) I 'll go into the other room and write him an apology . Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress No , no , you must not go in there . Change . Jacob Changeless And why ? Mrs. P. Mrs. Progress Uncle , you ought never to ask such questions of a good housekeeper . Change . Jacob Changeless Ah  --  it 's being swept , I suppose , or dusted . But I wo n't be there half a minute . ( Opens the folding doors between the two parlors . ) How ? What 's this ? The pigeons ' nest , as I live  --  the retreat of the turtle doves . Dick , you scoundrel , where 's our treaty ? ' Sblood , who invited you here this time ? Dick . Dick Meadows Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks at Julia . ) Besides , you will recollect our conference was broken off before I had ratified that article . Change . Jacob Changeless Ah , you saucy dog ! However , I give my consent , lest worse come of it . Lovers , I perceive , are like rats . You can not keep ' em out of the They come forward . ) Nephew , Mary , the affectionate pair have now only you to deal with . Ha ! this makes me young again  --  I shall dance at a wedding once more  --  we 'll have an old-time frolic . Julia Julia Progress ( clinging round his neck ) . Now you are again , indeed , my good uncle . Change . Jacob Changeless Ay , that 's the way with frail humanity . Refuse a request , however unreasonable , and you become at once  --  by magic as it were  --  old , mean , tyrannical : grant it , and until the obliged party happens to be denied something else , you are elderly , generous , amiable . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you might have made a worse choice . He 's a good-looking fellow  --  rather handsome dog  --  looks a little like me when I was young  --  before the flood , eh , Dick , you scamp ? But , Dick , you must quiz the dilapidated remnant of antiquity no more . Dick Dick Meadows ( gayly ) . No  --  now and here do I renounce all foibles , follies and levities , except such as are incident to human nature in general , and to myself in particular . Change . Jacob Changeless Oh , unprecedented reformation ! What say you to the embryo ascetic , Julia ? Julia Julia Progress ( looking at Dick ) . I say nothing , but believe . Dick Dick Meadows ( taking her hand ) . I thank you , Julia . Here I firmly resolve to turn over a new leaf , and become a valuable member of society . The happy can be wise and good . Prog . John Progress Yes , Dick , who knows but you may become an illustration of the infinite perfectibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia ) . Julia , dear , I thought I noticed a hole in your stocking . Change . Jacob Changeless ( rubbing his hands together ) . And when shall we have the wedding ? I should like to stretch my legs once more in a dance before I die . Recollect , I must have the prettiest partner in the room , and the first kiss after the bridegroom . Hey , Dick , shall it be soon ? Dick Dick Meadows ( aside ) . Now for my proposition  --  I should like to put an end to all uncertainty . But how to introduce it  --  I am almost afraid . Change . Jacob Changeless Zounds , Dick , why do n't you speak out ? One would think you were naming the day to be hanged , instead of married . Must I refer to Julia ? ' Sblood , man , shall it be soon , I say ? Dick . Dick Meadows With all my heart . This very day , with your permission , we 'll take a hack , and settle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Changeless ' Sdeath , sir , none of your ungodly modern improvements ! No , Dick , we 'll have a parson  --  and punch  --  and a supper  --  and music  --  and dancing ! None of your solemn , dull , melancholy modern weddings for me ! THE END .
