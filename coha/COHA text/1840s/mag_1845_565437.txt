txt THE religious systems of heathenism are worthy of being studied , not only in a scientific view , but also in order that the contact of Christianity with them , which is now taking place more and more in all parts of the world , may result in its thorough triumph . The adaptation of Christian truth to the heathen mind , requires something more than a knowledge of the names and attributes of the deities of the popular mythology . It is not in the mythic embodying of religious ideas that the strength and infatuation of heathenism lies ; this is but the outward expression . The essential , even in the rudest forms of religion , is some deep seated principle , more or less fully developed in the mind , according to the varieties of civilization . Faith in a mythology may be entirely cast away , while the mind entrenches itself the more securely in its secret and perhaps unconscious philosophy . We learn also rrom ecclesiastical history , that when Christianity was first promulgated , it became tainted in the very process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who speculated on religious subjects , unaided by revelation . The reason of this is to be found partly in the want of a discriminating familiarity with the religious speculations of the heathen ,  --  their sources and their mutual bearings . Appearances de ceived ; affinity of doctrine was seized upon as an argument in favor of Christianity , and in many cases , the truth itself became corrupted by this sort of treaty with error . Another reason is the perverse ingenuity of the mind in inventing doctrines respecting the nature of the soul , and the being of God , which accord with a depraved moral state . It was not so easy for Christians to grapple with these doctrines , without injury to personal faith , and the intermingling of foreign elements with Christianity . 1-low shall similar results be avoided in the renewed invasion of the realms of pagan superstition and philosophy , in this age , unless a more thorough acquaintance with the antagonist forces of heathenism is obtained by those who bear the Christian standard on heathen groand ? With a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , we offer the following sketch of the Buddhistic system . No heathen system of religion , perhaps , is more deserving of attention than this . There is some reason to believe that the oriental subtleties of the later Greek philosophy came from this source ; and if so , Christian dogmatics have been already seriously affected by the speculations of the Buddhists ; Buddhism has also contributed , more than any other religious system , to create the civiliza // tion of a large part of Eastern Asia , comprehending the islands of the Indian and Chinese Seas ; and it is that which still holds captive the minds of fully half of all the heathen ,  --  the inhabitants of China , Farther India , Ceylon , and as is probable of Upper Asia , being mostly Buddhists . In speaking of Buddhism , we shall not have to make any reference to a mythology , for it owns no mythology in particular , but takes to itself whatever mythological notions may happen to have been handed down any where , from former time , only putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part , is undoubtedly to be ascribed its extensive prevalence . What we shall attempt is , to give an insight into the speculative peculiarities of Buddhism , though here the want of sufficient materials restricts us to a narrow compass , and afterwards , in connection with an outline of its history , to exhibit the ecclesiastical organization connected with it , which is an interesting and important feature of the system . The doctrine of the Buddhists concerning God is a radical deism . The Brabman looks upon every object of creation as an emanation of the substance of the Supreme Divinity ; a divine essence pervades all things the vedas are divine in this respect , that they had their origin in the substance of Brah ma , upon which is grounded the Brahmanic idea of revelation . Subordinate beings are indeed supposed , through whom " that which the mind alone can apprehend , which is incognizable by the senses , which is without visible parts , eternal , the soul of all creatures , incomprehensible , " gave form and arrangement to existing things ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the primary cause of creation , and a continued activity by which all things in the physical , intellectual and moral world are kept in their appointed courses . The Deity of the Buddhists , on the other hand , is a perfect abstraction of Being . Not only is it not conceived as having had any part in the creation of the world , but it is even devoid of all attributes . Deism may result either from a negation of hereditary faith , through the overmastering of sentiment by the logical faculty , or from the displacing of ancient reverence by disgust , without any intervention of reason . It is too dreary a doctrine to be embraced by a mind not under some constraint . That notion of the Supreme Being which the Buddhists have , apparently owes its origin to a revulsion from the practical pantheism of the Brahmanic religion . The traditions respecting Buddha 's conversion lead us to believe , that the moral impotence of the pantheism of the Brahmans had much to do with the formation of the new doctrine . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , becomes suddenly alarmed by the sense of a moral void within ,  --  and this awakening of the conscience may be no unusual occurrence among the heathen ; - he resorts , as is natural , to those austerities which the established religion of his country makes the means of moral renovation ; he finds , however , from observation of the manner of life of the hermits of the woods , devoted to penance , that these austerities are a mere formality ; but he is in earnest , and can not be satisfied with what is merely external . In this state of mind he would be quick to recognize a reason for the inefficacy of those austerities ; while the truth , that God is a distinct being , would command the assent of his awakened conscience . But this truth impressed upon his mind , and contrasting itself with the teaching of the Brahmans , that every thing is Deity , would serve to explain that immorality which had scandalized him , and would become to him the foundation of a new system . This new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus attained , might develop itself freely , unbiased by bearings upon old established doctrine , or it might shape itself somewhat correspondently to that , though essentially different from it . The latter we should presume would occur , rather than the former . Accordingly , the negation of pantheism did not retain that moral quality , which had well nigh brought the Hindu mind to the apprehension of the truth in respect to the Divine nature , but it was brought down to the spheA* of mere speculation . The idea : of a Deity sui generis , became rtmtured in the form of a denial of those attributes by which , according to the received theology , the Divinity was communicable ; in other words , Buddha made God to be mere abstract Being , or in Buddhistic language , self-immanent Substance . Some have thought that the Buddhists are atheists , and certainly their speculation tends to atheism ; yet much of the language which seems to imply that they are really without the belief in a Deity , may have been borrowed from the Brabmans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *nexistent . The view of the Deity which we have endeavored to explain , connects itself , naturally , with fatalism ; for a being htiving no attributes could not be supposed to have made the world . The Buddhists assume Nature as the ultimate principle of all things , which they conceive to have been originally in a state of absolute quiescence ,  --  its only perfect condition . Happening to get into motion , it lost this perfection , and has since developed the various forms of spiritual and material existence . The world exists therefore by an accidental imperfection in Nature ; so that it is throughout imperfect by the very fact of existence . This is the theory most generally received among the Buddhists . Yet it is interesting to observe , that they seem , to some extent , to have restored attributes to the idea of God . The theory just stated gives no account of the marks of design in creation ; that things exist as they are , could not be accounted for by a divine purpose , consistently with the notion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this notion may have commended itself as serving to remove the difficulty of evil in the world , which has ever embarrassed the mind in connection with the idea of a personal God . The experience of man , however , is not limited to evil . There is a rich profusion of good in the world , the reference of which to a designing First Cause , is far more grateful to the sensibilities than to be shut up to a blind fatality ; and this readiness of the mind to believe , that the good comes through some sort of adaptation of means , may have given rise to the doctrine , held by a sect of the Buddhists called Aisvarikas , i. e. to whom there is a lord ,  --  that the ultimate principle of existence is Intelligence , which , under the name of Adhibuddhn , is also the Supreme Divinity of this sect ; the subtle notion of the self-immanent Substance having been dissipated , together with its associated fatalism . Another sect is distinguished by a more concrete mode of conceiving of an intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who recognize active property , who hold , that the first principle is a conscious moral and intellectual agent , whose activity does not merely consist in the original spontaneous expansion of his being , but who has planned all things , and made them to be as they are , agreeably to his own will ; while the doctrirte of the Aisvarikas , notwithstanding its departure from fatalism , appears to be a system of emanation . But these are speculations which diverge from the range of doctrine properly Buddhistic. // The idea of virtue , in Buddhism , has an intimate relation to that of the Supreme Being which we have seen to belong to the system . This accords with the universal fact , that the mind conceives of no perfection higher than what it places in the nature or character of God , and can not systematically assume a standard of virtue which does not comprehend that sort and degree of perfection ascribed to the Divine Being . Abstract entity. , separate from all attributes , being the perfection of God , in the view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature , by a putting off of all conditions and qualities of being , is their great moral aim . As the accident of the disturbance of the primitive quiescence is made the root of all evil , and as all things which exist are consequently supposed to be imperfect by their very existence , so the recovery of the undeveloped state of Nature is regarded as the highest perfection-as the chief end of man . The Buddhists , therefore , . recognize no original distinction of moral good and evil ; such is the essence of evil , that it is more or less involved in all conduct- But certain external actions and exercises of mind are allowed to be preferable to others , inasmuch as they are more allied to the quiescent state , having less of the inherent evil of existence- The moral prescriptions of Buddhism are : I. to kill no living creature ; 2. not to steal ; 3. not to lie ; 4. not to drink wine ; 5. to live chastely ; 6. not to perfume the hair , and not to paint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays ; 8. not to repose on elevated and luxurious beds 9- not to eat after the proper time . It is required of the monastic order : 1 . to live by alms , without property ; 2. to wear no rich garments ; 3. to drink no wine ; 4. to live chastely . These precepts , however , do not constitute a Divine law , for , according to the Buddhistic theory of the origin of the world , man acts quite irrespectively of Divine authority . Yet they are not left without the support of an external sanction . They are supposed to have been revealed by Buddha , i. e . Intelligence , a being evolved together with matter by the first movement of Nature out of its state of quiescence , and hence imperfect , though comparatively exalted . This superhuman being , having of itself no active power but that of contemplation , is supposed to have become incorporated in the person of a human individual , imparting to him a sort of inspiration , by which he was raised to a higher sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men how the chief good might be attained , as well as the true doctrine of existence . The incarnate Buddha is the Great Teacher of the Buddhists , whose authority , however , since his disappearance from among men , has been communicated to certain official personages , of the monastic order , his representatives upon earth We may farther observe , that obedience to the precepts of this religion does not seem to be made absolutely indispensable to the attainment of the chief end of man ; for the natural course of t*hings is considered as tending to that end , the development of Nature being a regularly progressive process , which is to go on to a certain point , to be succeeded by a gradual retrogression to the undeveloped state of absolute quiescence . The influence ascribed to the observance of the teachings of Buddha appears to be , to open a shorter way to perfection , to check the evolution of Nature sooner than it would be stopped , if left to itself , and thereby to bring the soul back more speedily to the quiescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to human will , made to pertain to the development of Nature . Man has the power of controlling his , own destiny , // even in spite of an adverse fatality . We will now take a rapid view of the external history of this religion , so far as it may be considered certain , which will prepare the way for some observations on the ecclesiastical organization pertaining to it . It is sufficiently ascertained , that the individual whom the Buddhists reverence as their Great Teacher , commonly called Buddha , but sometimes the Sakyn-saint , from his family name , and Sakya alone , died B. C. 543 . The disciples whom he gained over during his lifetime , formed distinct religious communities ; but as these were common among the Brabmans , they may have awakened no suspicion of defection from the religion of the Vedas ; indeed , it is probable that Buddhism announced itself , at first , rather as a reform of conduct , than as a philosophical speculation , while in those communities its philosophy was maturing . But the religion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Magadha , a powerful empire of large extent , which had its seat in Central India . There was a special reason for the favor so soon shown to the Buddhists by the sovereigns of India , for all classes were admissible to their societies , which made a strong , though silent diversion against the all-engrossing influence of the ancient priestly caste , whose supremacy had subjected even royalty to itself . Three councils were held under royal sanction and protection ,  --  one in the year of Buddha 's death , another after the lapse of a century , and a third about two centuries later ,  --  the first for the promotion of Buddhism , by a definite determination of its doctrines , practical and speculative , and the others , as occasion required , for the reassertion of the pure doctrine , in opposition to the opinions of schismatics . The middle of the third century before our era was a period of great discouragement , on account of certain wily antagonists , who sought to sap the foundations of the new religion , by pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teaching doctrines inconsistent with it . But when it recovered from the effects of this insidious hostility , as it did through the favor of the reigning sovereign of Magadha , a new vigor was infused into it . Opposition at home , and a newly awakened religious zeal , directed the attention of the Buddhists to seeking asylums for their faith , and other fields of propagandism , out of Central India . At the same time , Buddhism itself assumed another phase , for we consider it probable that the distinction between lay and clerical Buddhists now became marked . The widest extension of the religion , as well as the state of civilization in some of the countries into which it was carried , was incompatible with gathering all disciples into separate communities ; it was indispensable that there should be a lower and easier grade of discipleship established , in order to win the multitude . The religion now became disseminated in the recesses of the Himalaya , and perhaps beyond that mountain-range , northward ; in the Indus country , and within the borders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kingdom of the Ptolemies ; and in the country of the Mahrattas , and Ceylon . There are still to be seen monumental vestiges of Buddhism , which probably belong to this great age of its missions . We refer to the columns of Delhi and Allahabad , inscribed with royal edicts in favor of this religion ; to some of the topes or tumuli of the country of the Indus , and westward of that river , which were places of deposit for pretended relics of Buddha ; and especially to certain of the rock excavations of the western coast of the Deccan , which , by means of // the deciphering of inscriptions and architectural examination , have been proved to be of the third century before Christ ,  --  the abodes of Buddhist monks of that period . Subsequent to this missionary era , we are compelled to pass over several centuries , during which we are ignorant what was the fate of Buddhism in India . We may conjecture that it experienced alternate prosperity and decline , according to the fluctuation of the relative strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter half of the fifth century of our era , Brabmanism prevailed ; the Buddhist Primate retired to China , and , though an exterminating hostility was not declared until sometime in the seventh century , it is probable that from the close of the fifth century the disciples of Buddha had no longer a quiet existence in India . In the country watered by the Indus and its tributaries , Buddhism declined as early as between the commencement of the sixth century and the middle of the seventh . China had received this foreign religion before the Christian era , through Upper Asia , perhaps by missionaries from Rhotan , more commonly known as Lesser Bochara , which appears to have become even so early a center of Buddhist propagandism , and may have been reached across Cashmere . Many of the local names in Khotan , it has been observed , betray a Sanskrit origin . In the first centuries after Christ , there was frequent communication between the Chinese and Hindus , for the cause of Buddhism ; but it was not extensively propagated in China , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred the exile from India of the Buddhist Primate . About the time when this event took place , we find the Buddhists spreading themselves into countries where their religion had not before been taught , and this still wider dissemination may be regarded as the result of their troubles in India , correspondently to what we have already noticed at an earlier period . In the fifth and sixth centuries , Buddhism was cnrried " from several countries beyond sea , " among which a region west of the Indus is particularly specified , to Japan . Early in the seventh century it was introduced into Tibet , apparently from India . That form of it , however , which still exists in Tilx*t , where its principal seat is at present , originated under Gengis Rhan and his successors in the thirteenth century . It may be presumed , also , that many of the hordes of Upper Asia received it about this time , in consequence of the Mongol conquest . Turning in another direction , we find that it was planted in Pegu , between the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was then , and probably had been , since soon after the first establishment of the Buddhists there , a central point , from which their influence extended . The countries on the eastern side of Farther India seem to have been first visited by these enterprising propagandists from Java , where their religion became nationalized early in the Christian era . We know that , in the fifth century , the religion of Buddha had entirely lost its hold in Java , and there is reason to believe that its disciples , being obliged to give way to other religious influences on that island , spread themselves from thence to other islands of the Indian Archipelago , and to the continent . We have thus marked some of the most important periods in the history of Buddhism , showing its wide diffusion in ancient times , and the circumstances under which it was introduced where it still flourishes . The followers of Buddha , it has been seen , have ever been eminently propagandists , and there is little doubt , that their missionary operations are // still carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of place to consider , in some particulars , the development of that instrumentality by which the field of their influence has been made so large . The missionaries of Buddha are a fraternity of clerical monks . We have said , that originally all those who embraced this religion devoted themselves to a religious life ; having renounced secular cares and pleasures , they were associated together for the purpose of discipline and instruction ; the distinctions of caste were disregarded ; they were a brotherhood . Some subordination was , to be sure , essential to the attainment of their object , but higher or lower rank seems to have been determined by the degree of perfection , according to the rules and requirements of the order , which different individuals mi*ht reach ; and when these associations became numerous , there was a fraternal interchange of counsel and instruction between them , through their respective Heads . But with the recognition of the distinction of lay and clerical Buddhists , the position and character of the religious fraternities became changed . They then began to appear as made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severer habits of life than their fellow disciples , and discharging duties , in some manner vicarious , in behalf of these . They became exclusive interpreters of the Buddhistic rule of faith and practice , which it was the part of the laity reverently and without questioning , to receive from their lips ; to the members of the clerical order confession of sin was hunThly made by the laity , who sought to be instructed how they might obtain absolution ; religious ceremonies also were performed by the clergy , to procure benefits for the unconsecrated , and to avert from them evils . In this way the key of knowledge and the reins of conscience came into their hands . At April , the same time , by a natural consequence , the lines of distinction between the different members of the religious fraternities them*elves were made more definite and fixed . The gradations of rank now became more official ; the station of Head of the order was less distinguished as a degree of perfection to which an individual might rise , merely by the force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetuated by successive appointment ; the foundations of a prelacy were laid , of which the investiture seems to have belonged to the sovereign . We suppose that the re-establishment of Buddhism , in the third century before our era , led to these modifications of the system ; while the missionary enterprise of that age gave them a stability and unfolded them farther ; for the Buddhist missionaries did not go forth , on their own individual authority , but were commissioned , under royal sanction , out of the clerical body ; they went abroad to execute a work of which they were to render an account , and this especial responsibility on their part would of course increase the sway and power of the Primate . But the principle of ecclesiastical subordination was destined to have a yet more decided manifestation , among the Buddhists of Tibet , several centuries later . We allude to Lamaism . It was natural that the missionaries of Buddha , having introduced themselves , should soon gain a commanding position among an uncultivated people such as the Tibetans were , previous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior knowledge , and as has been observed , the tribes of Upper Asia , notwithstanding the simplicity and rudeness of their.nomadic life , seem to be peculiarly susceptible to influences , connected with the mysteries of religion . History indicates , that these missionaries brought new ideas of social order into Tibet , the prevalence of which must have heightened their // authority and the estimation in which they were held by the nation : it appears , also , that the Tibetans were first taught the art of writing by these disciples of Buddha ,  --  an art exceedingly adapted to awaken the slumbering powers of* uncultivated intellect , and to open the mind to new impressions . All this tended especially to aggrandize the Lamas , or spiritual Guides of the Tibetans ; and to it was added , in the thirteenth century , the policy of the Mongol emperors , who , to confirm their dominion in Tibet , invested the ecclesiastical Head of the Buddhists with a temporal power , which , even after it had passed away , threw its shadow over him , rendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as towards a sovereign . The Tibetan Primate was also constituted " king of the doctrine in the three lands , " or primate at large throughout the Mongol empire : Such was the origin of the worship of the Grand Lama . We will conclude this sketch of some of the features of Buddhism and its fortunes , with an estimate of the character of its influence upon the world . If then we consider its doctrinal principles , we find that its view of the Deity is as little conformable to truth as the theology of the Brahmans , from which it is an offset . The original doctrinal tendency of Buddhism , as opposed to pantheism , was good ; but we see here how little able is unassisted reason under the influences actually operating upon it , to hold even that truth relative to the Divine Being , which it would seem to recognize . The Brahmans make every thing to be Deity . The Buddhists , rejecting this doctrine , are driven to the opposite extreme of conceiving the Deity to be a mere abstraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions , from the recognition of a Supreme Being exalted above all comparison with humanity , yet having respect to His creatures , and administering a government over moral beings , of which the very foundahon is the fact of their dependence . The Buddhistic doctrine of God , developed as we have supposed under the impulse of a quickened conscience , failed no less than the Brahmanic theology , to lay a foundation for the distinctions of a moral law . But while Buddhism removes the Deity from all authoritative relations to mankind , it disavows human passivity , which Brahmanism teaches . It sets forth the Divine perfection as an object which maybe attained by the active effort of man in spite of an opposing fatality ; it stimulates the power of will . It makes virtue to be the voluntary imposition of self-restraint , and the exercise of those faculties which man possesses as his inherent prerogative ; in other words , self-improvement , the cultivation of the natural capabilities and of the native moral sense , irrespective of a Divine rule . Virtue with the Buddhists is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated . Self-culture , however , even though imperfectly understood , is the highest gratification of which the mind , conscious of higher powers , is capable ; and its final issue being conceived to be a participation of Divinity , it could not but call forth energy and boldness of spirit in the pursuit . Here we may discover the secret of that civilizing influence which Buddhism has unquestionably exerted . It is highly interesting to consider the effect of this religion , attested by history and the observations of modern travelers , upon the wild tribes of Upper Asia . There appears to have been no civilization in Tibet before its introduction there ; and the Mongols were humanized by the religious principles of their Tibetan subjects . It can scarcely be doubted , that the proinulgation of this religion was connected // with the cessation of those devastating incursions from the north of Asia , which at several successive periods , after the commencement of the Christian era , overwhelmed empires of the West . Lately , a distinguished Hungarian savant , Csoma de Kdros , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time in the interior of Tibet , and at another on its borders , receiving instruction from a Tibetan ecclesiastic , in the language and literature of his country ; and the reports of travelers show , that these monastic schools of learning , maintained by disciples of Buddha , are scattered over a large part of Upper Asia . Nor is it here alone that we can trace Buddhism as the pioneer of civilization . With its importation , the island of Java , the continent of Farther India , and perhaps Ceylon , first became possessed of alphabetical characters ; while all the literature which belongs originally to these countries is Buddhistic . It is a circumstance which strikingly indicates the efficacy of this religion in promoting intellectual culture , that the dawn of clear history is coeval with its establishment in most of the countries of Eastern Asia . This is to be attributed to the incitement given by it to the mass of society . It is reasonable to suppose , that the elevation of the prerogatives of the clerical order served only as an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Buddhist friar was attainable by any one-no institution of caste presenting an insuperable barrier ; nor is it certain , that the monastic vows were absolutely irrevocable . Mental cultivation would therefore become a more general acquisition , and popular influences would be strengthened ; while there would be proportionately a more lively concern among the people in respect to national interests , and a care for the reminiscence of important events . We should not expect to find a distinct or quick historical sense , where either rude force or the power of an exclusive priestly caste , holds the mass of a nation in slavish subjection . Legends might arise in such circumstances , celebrating conquests , or throwing a halo around the personal endowments of princes ; but either the exaggerations of servility , or the interminglings of " pious fraud , " would inevitably corrupt their integrity . The Hindu traditions anterior to Buddha , are so interwoven with mythology , betray so much tampering of the Brahmans , the only literary class , who gave shape to national story , that their light is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious revolution by which Buddhism was established , architectural and sculptured monuments , the work of the people and designed for the popular eye , began to form links in the chain of authentic history , which are for us invaluable . So , whatever we know of the history of Ceylon is subsequent to the age of Buddha ; and Farther India and the Indian Archipelago as well as the countries of Upper Asia , are first brought into the light of history by the introduction there of the religion of the Buddhists . Another aspect of the influence of this religion is its bearing upon the social position of the female sex . We have not the means of judging of this so fully as we could desire ; yet in view of the historical fact , that in India women were early admitted to clerical privileges among the Buddhists , being gathered apart in female communities , where culture and discipline similar to that which occupied the inmates of the monasteries , was their employment ; and in view of the difference which , in some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made between Buddhist women and others , by putting into the mouths of the // former the pure classic language , and into those of the latter a vulgar dialect , it does not seem hazardous to ascribe to Buddhism a favorahie influence , to some extent , upon this class of society , which the social and religious institutions of the East generally have assisted each other to degrade . In connection with Buddhist propagandism , the opening of communication between China and the countries of the West through Upper Asia , deserves also to he noticed . The earliest distinct account which we have of such intercourse , presents to our view missionaries of Buddha traversing those unexplored regions of the North , hearing their religion from the West to the Chinese province of Chensi : this was two centuries before our era ; and similar expeditions were repeatedly undertaken in later times . The Buddhist pilgrims , seeking as they would every where to acquaint themselves with the condition of the countries through which they passed , with reference to their great object and disseminating their religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important information respecting the western regions ; and they could turn their knowledge and influence to good account hy opening avenues of wealth to the Chinese empire , on condition of being protected and patronized in their schemes of religious propagandisrn . It is more than probable , that in this manner were established by degrees those extensive and intimate commercial relations of China with the West , which so long enriched the nation , and perhaps contributed more than any thing else to give splendor to the empire and to foster imperial pride , by attracting foreigners  --  the agents of the traflick-who were secretly regarded as so many bearers of tribute to the Son of heaven . From this brief estimate of the influence of Buddhism upon the world , it appears that we owe much of our knowledge of the East to this religious revolution ; and that , practically considered , it has in different ways promoted not slightly the civilization of eastern nations ; and , although its doctrines are sadly remote from the truth , we cherish the belief founded upon what we know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been wandering in an entirely devious path , but unconsciously led by a Divine hand have , upon the whole , made actual progress under its influence ; and that the way has been prepared by it for the propagation of Christianity in Eastern Asia , more effectually than would have been , had any other known form of oriental religion gained a similar predominance . How admirable is the benign wisdom of Providence , which thus brings good out of evil ; and by the force of mere human enterprise , as seen in the great field of Buddhist propagandism , adjures those who bear the Christian name to be true to their Divine impulses ,  --  emulous to enlighten and quicken with the doctrine of Him who is indeed the Great Teacher , and to enlist new energies in His cause of truth and righteousness.
