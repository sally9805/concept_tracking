Main text SCENE I. An hour before sunset . A thickly-shaded bower in the forest . Glimpses of the ocean through the trees . A Poet sitting in an attitude of dejection , with torn fragments of paper containing pencilled snatches of songs scattered about . Thinks aloud . Poet . Poet My burning thought leaps up in rhyme , And sets itself to many a chime ; Like deep , long-hidden , glowing fires , Through all my soul it yearns , aspires , And worships at some fairer shrine Than here I see ,  --  aye , more divine . I can not bear this thought that burns , And ever so intensely turns To some strange altar deep within , And strives my outer self to win ; It makes me lonely in the crowd , O'er all that 's fair I see a shroud , The things of life seem poor and vain , I have no wish to taste again . There 's discord in each tone I hear , For from the soul 's deep-hidden sphere There ever comes a voice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to thee . " What fills me with such great unrest ? What aching void is in my breast ? What clouds of darkness and of night ? What yearning for a purer light ? That , sick at heart , I turn away Still more and more , day after day , From what the world calls bright and fair , And feel ' t is vain ,  --  for me no share ; From what seems great and good to men , To sit me down alone again , And listen to the ceaseless din . Of elements at work within , That seem to struggle in their power , Each one for victory in its hour ; And hear the deep and solemn tone In some strange temple grave and lone , That stands within my inmost soul , Whose anthems ever ceaseless roll ; And strive to enter at its gate , No more to watch and weary wait , And find the beautiful within , And cleanse myself from every sin . What leaps like lightning through my soul , Sudden and swift beyond control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Or some half-God a power had lent , Or , like Prometheus ' stolen fire , In pity at my long desire , Then dies away , its source unknown , And leaves me still more sad and lone ;  --  Aye , leaves the weary , wasting pain , That preys till it shall come again ? A pause I would do something worthy life ,  --  I 'm weary of this fruitless strife ,  --  Something that lends a golden ray , Like sunset to the parting day . Immortal longings in me rise , An earnestness that never dies , To smite the rock within my soul , And make its living waters roll . Are there no powers within me deep , Half-latent , rising from their sleep , By virtue of their innate strength To find an utterance at length ? Consuming fires within me burn , Whichever way my soul may turn , Still scorching , eating out the heart , Till thought becomes a fiery dart To pierce my spirit through with pain , Until I pray for rest again . Fires long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will yet have birth ; Some Etna or Vesuvius wakes , Or Earth unto its centre shakes . Thought pent within the human mind , At last its inborn powers shall find , And mightier that so long it 's lain Bound by a hidden , potent chain , It bursts its bands at last with might , And springs to meet the morning light . Rouse up , O soul within my soul ! That yearns for some mysterious goal ; Hast thou not strength to burst away , And feel thy power and hold thy sway ? Droop not so sadly every wing ! I hear thy plaintive murmuring : Speak not so mournfully of light , As if ' t were shrouded in the night ; But find thy might , and burst forth strong : Thy time has come , thou'st waited long . Call up rich powers , thyself to speak , And stand erect  --  no more the weak ; Let thy best thought find burning word By which the human soul is stirred . Burst forth , O soul ! why may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not some free utterance take The place of thy long silence ? Break The seal from off the inner shrine , And breathe in words its thoughts divine ! Burst every chain ! at last be free ! Give forth the thoughts that burn in thee ! Take some rich harp , its numbers try , And sing thyself , or , striving , die ! Spirit of Poesy . Spirit of Poesy I have heard thy deep prayer , and the answer is given , I will breathe through thy soul like a voice from the heaven ; I will tune every string of thy spirit 's deep lyre , Till it thrills and it speaks of thy soul 's hidden fire ; I will pour through its cells such a power and a strength , That each thought shall leap up in its armor at length , And shall rush forth to mingle in songs of the earth , And thrill through the mind where rich thoughts have their birth . I will whisper to thee with a voice small and still , Till each fibre shall tremble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks up where she smiled , And wraps in her mantle and claims thee her child ; And she clothes in sweet music the words as they fall , Till they bind with a spell the true spirits of all . I will touch with my wand the god-Genius that sleeps Far down in thy spirit , far down in its deeps , Till he wakes from his slumbers , leaps up in his power , And acknowledges thee thrice baptized in that hour . He shall touch thee anew from his altar of flame , With the fire of his power and the light of his name , Till in strength thou shalt rise , and his spirit and fire Shall accomplish for thee all thy heart 's long desire . I will bathe thee in beauty , I 'll bathe thee in love , Till thy voice has a tone like the angels above , Till thine eye speaks the fire that is burning within , And it beams and it beckons all others to win ; Till thy lips have a purpose , a strength , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shower , And thy words strangely thrill through the depths of the heart , Long after the breath from these lips shall depart . I will take up thy soul like a lute , and each string With melody soft ' neath my fingers shall ring ; I will sweep o'er thy heart like a harp with its chords , Till each string has a voice , and each tone breathes in words . I will touch the rich keys with my long-practised hand ;  --  It shall be like an organ , prophetic and grand ; It shall wail as in grief , it shall speak as in joy , Be a promise of glory no night can destroy . It shall rise into grandeur , or sink into pain , Then sweep and echo , and echo again . I will pour o'er thy soul all my magic divine : I have heard thy deep prayer , and my gifts shall be thine . Poet . Poet Whence came that voice , those burning words ? They seemed from earth or sky ; At times so very far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Spirit of the wind ? Queen-fairy of this wood ? Or Genius of these summer waves ?  --  I 'd reach thee if I could . Thy voice gave answers to my prayers ;  --  Oh , could desires take word , From out my yearning soul would come The very tones I heard ! And have I thought until my brain , Bewildered , weaves this spell , And airy fancy plays me false , And says , " All shall be well " ? Oh , speak again ! if aught beside Gave forth that tone of heaven . Speak ! give me proof , that gifts like these , To me can , will be given ! Spirit of Poesy . Spirit of Poesy I am the Spirit of Poesy , I am the Soul of Song , I have waited and listened to thee , soul , Waited and listened so long . Deep in thy spirit I 've seen the germ  --  Germ of a power divine ; I have watched and I 've waited its growth , soul , Waited to call it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stronger it grew each hour , Till the time for the waiting is past , soul ,  --  Now thou shalt rise to thy power . Far in the deep recesses of mind , Into thy spirit I come , And my mantle around thee I 'll fling , soul , Wrap thee , and make it thy home . Doubt me no longer ! Thou feelest now Strangely within thee rise All the powers I have promised to thee , soul , Powers that exalt to the skies . Rouse to the work that is waiting thee ! Trust in the power divine ! And the spirit of song thou hast craved , soul , Thine , shall in fulness be thine . Poet . Poet I can no longer doubt , for in my heart I feel a newer , richer life-blood start ; And all my soul is quivering with delight , And glows like some new day just sprung from night . My very brain seems quickened with a spell , And floods of harmony within me swell , As though some pitying angel 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Had troubled all the waves within me deep , And waked long-silent voices from their sleep . It is as though my heart sang , and each vein Caught up the tone and rolled it on again ; As if each breath to each in rhyme was set , And every thought its promised joy had met . The wind is whispering through the forest trees ,  --  They answer , swaying to the passing breeze ; The rill that leaps and dances at my feet , The music of the whispering winds repeats . And every flower , with upturned , trusting eye , That gazes toward the deep blue summer sky , And every hill and every mountain dell Is wrapped and bathed in this mysterious spell . And as I gaze , the sky that hangs above , Droops over me with look of tender love , As if ' t were mantle of the passing God , That trailed toward earth to tell where He has trod . Upon the whole with thrilling awe I look : At last it stands revealed ,  --  a Living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And filled and glowing with intensest power . ' T is one grand Poem : in my soul I see Line after line unfold and speak to me , Rich , full of gems of priceless power and thought ; Here is the treasure I so long have sought . I 've read earth 's poets , thought by thought conned o'er , Turned page on page of old , mysterious lore ; Bright gems I 've found on many a brilliant page , Of poets , teachers , written in their age ; But here I see the Mighty Thinker , here Stands out the lesson of a higher sphere , A living Poem written by God 's hand , And worthy of the Artist , solemn , grand , And yet so sweet , the heart can dream of Heaven , And of the Giver by what he has given . I read this Poem ; in its every line Great Nature 's truths in starry beauty shine ; And solemn grandeur never felt before Steals through my soul  --  I worship , I adore ! An hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joys for me , and they of little worth ,  --  But now it spreads , a type of that bright home Beyond the misty darkness of the tomb . It opens like a scroll to meet my view ; I see God 's finger writing something new . E'en as I gaze , still line on line is given , Still pointing nearer to the gate of heaven . Why , everything 's a song , and sings its soul In its true life ; the parts but make the whole . And oh , how poor are words ! how more than weak ! Beside this work of God I can not speak . This mighty poem , in each different part , Strikes home with awe sublime , and fills my heart , Until each thought rolls back in its despair , And dares not utter its weak idyl there ; So small , so slight , beside this word of God , I bow in silent worship on the sod . A half-hour since I felt such rising power , It seemed my soul could spring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one star of thought To light my little life ; yet , ere I caught And held the power , and fashioned to my will , To consciousness I woke with sudden thrill ; To know mysterious beauty round me spread ,  --  This God-like Poem ,  --  and I bow my head , A silent worshipper at this great shrine , And feel as naught amid this work divine ; Hushed into silence by this mighty Word That all the depths within me strangely stirred . One gleam of sudden and of thrilling light Swept o'er my soul amid its darkest night . It cleared my vision , Nature 's truth to see , Unveiled its deep and hidden mystery ; It showed my utter nothingness to grasp The mighty truths thy Spirit did unclasp . It showed me small beside the Grand and Great , Until I tremble at the open gate , And dare not enter with unhallowed feet The temple , where the Artist I may meet , Who poured his Spirit into every line , And left the impress of a soul divine . What am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My poor , faint words in childish rhyme and weak , Beside Thy anthem in its grandest roll , Whose words are stars , the universe the whole ? I can but prostrate lie in silence deep , Hushed , wrapped in awe , and closely round me keep Earth 's veil material , shading half my eye , Lest , seeing more , I with thy greatness die . With this one prayer : O Father , pity me ! I can not check the wish to be like Thee ! Though crushed and humbled that I nothing stand , Beside the work of thy eternal hand , Still in this darkest night of my despair To see the garb of littleness I bear , Yet is there something deep within me , deep , With all my strength I can not hush to sleep . It will keep crying through the weary night , It will keep turning toward thy heavenly light , It will lift up its forehead from the dust , And seek audacious to behold the Just , And pass beyond the temple-gate , and know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow ; That will not turn away its restless eye , But prays to see , if , seeing , it must die ! Spirit of Beauty , Spirit of Beauty singing . We rejoice ! we rejoice ! for the River of Life Has been poured over thee , with its beauty all rife . Thou hast caught but one glimpse of the soul of the sod , And thy spirit hath bowed to its Spirit , its God . Thou hast seen but one gleam of the Great and the Grand , But one volume that 's writ by the mightiest Hand , And thy soul has shrunk back at its greatness sublime , And thou fearest to pass to that far purer clime . It is well , it is well . Had it waked no new power , Thou wouldst stand in thy strength and rejoice in this hour ; But the light of the Greater has dawned in thy soul , And its anthems drown thine in their mightier roll . But rejoice , O thou dreamer ! for thee there is hope ; With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the weakness , the trembling , that comes to thee now , Shall yet stamp with God 's signet thy thought-tortured brow . Thou hast bathed in the fountain ,  --  ' t is well , it is well ! Thou shalt bathe yet again till a far brighter spell Shall be woven around thee , and thou shalt be strong .  --  This the proof that thy soul has not waited too long . Genius . Genius Lie not so prostrate in the dust Because the God is great ! Or lose thy faith in inborn powers , Or tarry at the gate . Thou sayest well ; the power within Keeps crying every day , To know God 's truth ,  --  and even God Will not be thrust away . Because it is one tiny spark Of that Immortal Mind , And like its Sire  --  the mighty God  --  No power can wholly bind . Chain down thy thought  --  it breaks the chain  --  And crush it with strong hand , It Sampson-like shall upward leap , And burst away its band . Shalt thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done , E'en though , with all this mightiness , Thy God has just begun ? Thou art a creature of his hand , And wilt thou call it naught ? Thou art a part of His great plan  --  A strength should thus be taught . Thou art a Poem in thyself , One writing every day ; Line after line is every thought , Ne'er to be swept away . Thou art a part of that great whole  --  The whole , so grand , sublime , Without thee would be incomplete  --  One necessary rhyme . Then in this thought arise ! be strong ! Though now it binds thy sight , Soon thou shalt better read thyself Within its purer light . The very greatness shall awake Somewhat more grand in thee , Till strong and earnest in thy thought , Thou shalt grasp hands  --  be free . No matter , soul , how small a part Thou findest here to fill , Be up and ready for that work , And do it with a will . As grand as earth may lie outspread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planets pass , And fill their place on high ;  --  Yet is thy soul  --  though small and weak  --  Far greater than them all , For it can hear Jehovah speak , And list the angels ' call . And it can reason , think , and will , And leave its impress here , And do the work the God has done , Though in a smaller sphere . Man is the one Grand Poem , one ,  --  The greatest God has given ; Its first low strains are sung on earth , ' T is finished but in heaven . Then write thyself , thy living soul , In strong , deep words of love , And cast the Godlike thought o'er earth , That thou hast caught above . Pour out the fulness of thy soul In anthems strong and deep , And other hearts shall catch them up , And all their sweetness keep . ' Twill be one voice among the rest . A diapason grand , To sweep in one eternal tone , And echo through the land . Take heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make thee weak ; Thou art a part of that Great Power , Thy life of his must speak . ' T is earnest of what thou shalt be , That thou art born of him ; Lift up thy forehead from the dust , And enter boldly in ! Thy smallest thought has something good ,  --  It gives the mind a strength By which it sends another forth , Which shall have power at length . Press forward in the search for good , Press forward in the race , And in God 's beauty and his truth Thou'lt see him face to face ! Poet . Poet I will look up ; though slight and small Beside the God , yet I am all His power has fashioned me to stand ,  --  I am the work of His great hand . As such I must be worthy him , Though poor and weak , though faint and dim Beside the glory of his power ; Yet am I living in this hour A tiny spark from that great Sun , A life in littleness begun , But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioned by His hand . All nature stretches grand and great , To meet the sky in royal state ; Its varied beauties perfect shine , Wrapped in a glory most divine . I must be moulded with the rest , In my own place as surely blest ; And I will stand upon this sod , Yet lift my face to find the God . I am thy child , O Artist grand ! One little stanza by thy hand , Thine offspring ; I 've a claim on Thee ,  --  I know thou carest yet for me . And Thou wilt give me strength and power , And over me thy glory shower , If I stand up all pure and free , And like a child shall ask of Thee . Prays . O Father ! guard me with thy power  --  A spark struck from thy sun :  --  Wilt give me strength to do my work , Somewhat as thou hast done ? O Father ! claim and call thy child , And let me hear thy voice ; All reverent I ask of Thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy great parental Love Flow deep through all my soul ; I hear the anthem of thy power In mighty cadence roll .

Angels Angels singing in the distance  --  Voices drawing nearer . Child of earth ! how sweet the music Of an asking , waiting soul ! To the inner courts of heaven Do its richest anthems roll . We have watched and waited for thee ,  --  Waited through the weary hours : color=redPage 23 Thou hast risen into beauty ; In it thou shalt find thy powers .

Thou shalt stand like ancient priestess In the temples long ago ; From thy lips strange words prophetic Half unconsciously shall flow . Thou shalt be a link uniting Worlds that seemed so far away , Thou shalt be like beam of morning , Ushering a golden day . Keep God 's mantle close around thee , Lest the world shall stain thy soul , And the rich strings lose the beauty . Of their anthem 's deepest roll .

Keep the beauty of thy spirit , And we 'll pour our wealth o'er thee , Till thy presence brings a blessing ; In it souls shall spring forth free . Thou shalt be thyself a Poem , All thy life an anthem grand , Rising , swelling , upward sweeping , Its last strain in spirit land . Child of earth ! we stoop to bless thee , Take the power we gladly give ! Beauty , genius , strength be with thee , Grandly wear them , grandly live !

Poet . Poet My God ! what vision fills my soul ! I seem to near my wished-for goal . How have I yearned to hear some tone Of those I loved and called my own , Passed strangely to the other shore , Haunting my spirit evermore ! And did I hear the angels sing , Whose echoes through my spirit ring ? And shall I have that promised power ? O God ! I bless thee for this hour ! And all my soul floats out in song , I 've watched and waited , prayed so long ; Yet dared not hope this bliss would come ,  --  That beings from that Brighter Home Would give me power to see and know , And thrill my spirit with this glow Of living light and fire divine : O Father , all my soul is thine ! Spirit of Poesy . Spirit of Poesy Take this harp ! and let thy spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts ensphere it , Till they answer back again . Wait not , thinking , still divining What the song that thou shalt sing ! Pour the wealth thy soul enshrining , Trembling over every string ! Poet . Poet The words of song come floating to my lips , Like perfume on the wind ; Aye , thought keeps struggling into rhythmic words  --  Long pent within my mind ,  --  As though my soul would tremble forth in song , In freedom 's ecstasy ; And lift itself with one great sunward flight , And lose itself in Thee . Fountain of light , of truth , and perfect love ! My soul leaps forth to try , Upon the wings of Song , to reach thy home , Or in its efforts die ! Improvises . I spurn my prison-house of earth ,  --  The body where I 've lain Like captive in his cold , damp cell , Thrice-bound with heavy chain . The grated bars that hid my view , And shut me dark within , The massive door , the heavy bolt , Shall never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has never come to me ; But now a hand has loosed the bars , And I will step forth free . I gaze upon truth 's sunny sky , I list the song of love , And Beauty with her starry eyes Bends o'er me from above . And oh ! within myself I feel A burning power to know , Beyond the prison-gates to pass , Let watch and warder go ; And leave behind me every power That dared my soul to bind , And follow after my desire That 's fleeter than the wind ,  --  Beyond the earth , beyond the glow Of sunshine on the stream , Beyond the visions of my youth , Beyond each fairy dream ; And never tire and never wait , Until the thirst within , Is slaked at some bright fountain far From earth 's tumultuous din . Oh , how like falcon from his gyves , On hunter 's hand set free , My lightning thought takes sudden flight , And whistles back for me ! Speed on , speed on , O eagle-eyed , And find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gate , Till God 's rich truths are given . Cling closely when the angels pass , Till they shall take thee in , And wash thy garments pure and white , To stain no more with sin ! On , on ! like deer that hears the sound Of hunters on his track ; And if thou findest thy true home , No power shall send thee back ! The harp falls from her hands , while her eager face , upturned eyes , her outstretched arms and whole attitude reveal the soul just ready to leap its barriers and follow the song . Genius . Genius Call back thy thoughts , nor let them burst away In such delight toward regions of bright day ! ' T is well to form thy soul 's deep wealth in song , But not alone to airy flights belong The Poet 's gifts ! ' T is beautiful to feel The fountain leap within the soul ,  --  its seal All broken ,  --  while the living waters free Toss out their spray toward eternity . There 's such a rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fire the soul had caught ; There 's such a luxury in the rising power , I marvel not it bears thee in this hour , Like some white bark amid the tossing night , On through the breakers , toward the beacon light . Yet not for that alone we give thee power , But for still greater use has come this dower . The Poet 's mission is to deeply think : Not always should he rise , but he must sink His soul unto the level of each thought ;  --  From every phase of life his power is caught . Like Franklin , he may fly his kite toward heaven , And catch the lightning when the clouds are riven ; But yet , like Fulton , he must bring this power To each day 's use , fit for each passing hour ; And then , like Morse , must send it on its track , Till thought to thought in souls shall answer back . The poet has been called a dreamer vain , Who idly sings his still more idle strain , To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch imagination passing by ; A thing of beauty , like the summer flower ,  --  To live , to bloom , to perish in an hour . But ' t is not so . The Poet of the soul , Whose thrilling tones in strange , deep music roll , Who sends the lightning of his thought to men , Shall bring a burning answer back again . The world 's true Poet teaches common things , And makes a living power of what he sings ; Catches the Real for his corner-stone , And builds his pyramid , with power unknown , Of real life , of real burning tears , Of real soul-deep grief , and real fears , Of heroes living in the present day , As well as heroes , martyrs , passed away , Of true devotion in the lowly heart ;  --  And every passion still must bear its part ;  --  Of love requited , and of love misplaced , That leaves a mark no outward eye has traced . True moral worth must be the crowning head , True spiritual beauty the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch above  --  The rainbow , bending o'er it all in love , Mingling the whole ; the base ( the granite rock Of real strength and power to bear the shock ) Of common facts and common thoughts of men ,  --  The heart 's deep passions glowing out again ; The soul 's Ideal looming in the skies , Toward which man turns his weary , aching eyes , Until it grows the real of his life , And smoothes his path , and hushes all his strife . It is the Poet 's mission to descend , And all the influence of his spirit lend To those who still pursue the beaten way , And think of nought beyond the present day ; And scatter flowers , and rainbow tints , and song , To mingle with the dull , material throng , Until they learn to love , and to aspire , And reach for beauty , till it draws them higher . The Poet is the prophet , if he 's true ; He grasps the past , and points unto the new ; He links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands , " one foot on sea and one on land " ; Sings of what is , and then of what must be , When man from all that 's gross arises free ; Points with an eye of hope and hand of power Unto a brighter , better , coming hour ; With heart of fire and tongue of living flame , Withers the thought that ever stoops to shame , And makes each soul its own true birthright see , And rise from what it is , more pure to be . The Poet is the priest , to walk the sod , And stand the type , the image of the God : In noble word , in noble deed sublime To live , and send his power to future time ; To speak such words as seize upon the heart , And , half unconsciously , a nobler part Help it perform ; and thrill the listening mind Until no chain that spirit 's strength can bind . Until each latent power shall upward leap From out its long , mysterious , dreamless sleep , Quick-started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to fulfil Its higher work , its destiny on earth ,  --  To make still other souls of purer worth . Else is he no true Poet ; though he sings , And airy fancy round him closely clings , And rainbow mantles wrap him in their light , And morning 's glories gather fair and bright ; He 's but a mid-day meteor in the sky ,  --  An hour shall pass and all his light shall die . But he that burns and beams with steady blaze , Like some fair planet in its heavenly rays ,  --  Mild but intense , that lights the blue of heaven , And has eternal life unto it given ,  --  ' T is he that lights the wandering , darkened race , And sees God 's beauties ever face to face . He 's the true Poet , who shall daily bring To man this rich and soul-deep offering ;  --  The knowledge of himself , his inborn power , The use , the beauty of each present hour , The hidden meaning of great Nature 's laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . He is the Teacher who shall point man 's way Unto a brighter and a better day , With winning words of beauty and of love , Calling his soul for evermore above ; Still making purer with each thought he speaks , Still urging higher as he onward seeks , Refining still each thought , until his soul Shall rise where it can grasp and see the whole ; Making the common mind press forward still , Until with grander thoughts each chord shall thrill , And power shall wake to lead him toward the skies , And he becomes the strong , the good , the wise . The Poet is the Thinker ; he must trace Through nature up to see the Father 's face . It is no light , no common thing to wear The mantle of true Poesy , and share The brightness of her triple crown of light ,  --  Power , Purity , and Beauty ,  --  these her might . It is a solemn thing to reach thy hand To grasp her treasure , and to seek to stand Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  now must thou worthy be . Be but the REAL POET ! be the true ! While bright around thy path our gifts we strew ; Or let thy harp forever mouldering lie , Never again its thrilling strings to try . Attempt the best !

Catch rich , grand thoughts from fountains pure above , Then pour them out with thine own thoughts in love ! Mark every place with flowers where thou hast trod , And let thy path lead always toward thy God ! Then , though thy strains are faint , and low , and weak , Something of beauty must within them speak ; Something of greatness , truth , within them shine , Sooner or late to tell their source divine !

This thy reward ,  --  not perfect freedom given ,  --  To know thou leadest others nearer Heaven ! Poet . Poet I will be strong . These words of truth I 'll keep Treasured within my spirit 's chambers deep . And I will only turn my watching eyes , And send my thoughts afar beyond the skies , To catch rich treasures from the bright above , To pour o'er others , in their earnest love .

Content if but some hearts are strangely stirred , And feel new powers awake their depths within , That rise and work , and stand above all sin . I 'll be the Worker , not the dreamer here ; Or only dream of some far brighter sphere , Because I know that dream is good and true , And real , though to others strange and new .

Fairies of the Greenwood We have heard thy prayer , And we bring the fair From flowery cup and bell ; And the greenwood tree , From its leaves to thee , Shall whisper a fairy spell . The mosses so green In their silver sheen , Shall send thee the spirit of rest ; And the violet 's eye , As it looks to the sky , Shall speak to thy soul of the blest . And the Druid oak Hath its oracle spoke , It beareth a strength to thee ; For its stalwart limb , And its trunk so grim , Are the symbols of the free ;  --  While the clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach the sky , Closely round its form , Through the sun or storm , And with it would gladly die ,  --  Is a type of the Love That shall rise above All selfishness here below ; Unasked it is given ,  --  Like a breeze out of heaven , Uncaring , unthinking , will flow . The sunshine and shade Through the forest laid , On its carpet of green so bright , Is the type of this life , Of its bliss and its strife , Grief 's darkness , and joy 's pure light . And the wind that sweeps Through the forest deeps , Till the green leaves tremble within , Is the type of pure thought That is poured unsought , And saves and cleanses from sin . And the anthem grand , When the mighty hand Of the tempest is on the oak , Is the voice of Him  --  When the day was dim  --  That " Light " for Creation spoke . Oh , under the tree There is wealth for thee ! Far in the dim wood-shade , Where no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will show thee where they 're laid . Then come to our nooks ! They are living books , Where the soul may gaze and read ; And treasure it well , There 's a hidden spell To hearts that will take good heed . And seek us for aye ! Through the summer day , Thou shalt often hear our tone ; We 'll reveal to thee , ' Neath the greenwood tree , Our truths until then unknown . Kind Nature shall teach What no lips can preach ,  --  Shall teach on her own green sod , Thrilling truths to man , Of the laws and plan Of her own  --  Great Nature 's God ! Then come where we dwell ! We will weave a spell That shall burn through the songs you sing ; Keep close to the sod , Yet looking to God , And our mantle around thee shall cling !

In the mountain spring there shall be a thought , That in vain , perhaps , through the years you 've sought . From the brook that flows to the river grand , We will sometimes lift it  --  our magic wand ,  --  And a beauty send to thy spirit 's deep , That shall wake some thought from its midnight sleep . III . Thou shalt hear us best when thou art alone ;  --  Though unseen by others , to thee well known . In the little lakes , in the mountain dell , There shall lie all mirrored our magic shell ; Thou hast but to look , and our best truths see , And the things of God be made known to thee . IV . Thou must never think that the waters lie , With no truth to speak in their murmured sigh . There are spells of beauty on every sod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ; But the founts are clear , and they show a trace In their clear , bright depths of His very face . V. By the rill 's pure bed let thy coming feet , All the sprites that live in their depths oft greet . By the mountain spring let thy steps still stray , And be wandering oft to earth 's founts away ; And a charm shall come to thy voice and word , That has never before from thy lips been heard . VI . In their mirrors bright thou shalt see thy face , And shall learn to add still a newer grace . In the pure , rich thought that shall come to thee , La the light that makes all thy spirit free , Thou shalt learn to weep nevermore , nor pine , For our founts shall leap , and the spray be thine ! Spirits of the Air . Spirits of the Air Yes , we hasten to answer thee , hasten to come From our palace of splendor , the sun-lighted dome ! We have treasures of beauty , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more mortals were willing to share ! We have brought the sun 's rays  --  they shall make thee a pen That shall tip as with fire all thy words unto men ; And we 'll bring thee for paper , on which thou shalt write All thy songs of pure joy , and thy visions of night , E'en the clouds in our heaven , in their lights and their shade , With the gleams of pale sunshine that over them strayed . When thou writest of sin , we will bring thee the cloud That is dark with the tempest ,  --  the storm 's blackened shroud ; When thou writest of joy , we will give thee the gold- Tinted clouds , with a sunbeam in every fold . When thou singest of hope , " silver linings " we 'll bring , Till far brighter and sweeter the songs thou shalt sing . When thou speakest of woe , and of carnage and blood , We will bring thee the clouds where the sun has just stood , Gleaming gorgeous with crimson ,  --  the hour ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dark foe he met , Till they grappled in frenzied and deadly embrace , And this deluge of blood had enveloped his face , And he lay on his bier in his gorgeous array , With his clouds that trailed crimson while passing away . We will bring thee the blue from the deep , summer sky , On thy breast as an gis protecting to lie ; We will bring thee the winds that sweep strong through the heaven , With the hurricane 's voice , as in thunder ' t is given ; And the whirlwinds that pass in their storm-bannered car , For a moment so near us , then travelling far . And all these thou shalt have when strong powers thou wouldst wake , When the tyrant should tremble and shivering quake , When the patriot 's harp should leap up with one gush Of true love for his country , then onward would rush , Like the hurricane 's sweep , till he falls on his foe , Like the whirlwind , to scatter , like that to bring woe . We will send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will woo and will beckon the spirit above .

But if thus they have died in defence of the Right , Not sad dirges alone , not the shadows of night , Will we bring thee to shed where their silent forms are , But the glory and light of our own morning star . In the hour thou wouldst write of a soul that has sprung From some error or stain that around it has clung , Or some mind that was tempted almost to its fall , Yet arose in its strength still triumphant o'er all ; Of great deeds in their splendor , of good they have brought , Of the light and the glory the strong mind has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wrong , That arose from the conflict , triumphant and strong , We will send the grand anthems that sweep through the sky , Eternal , unceasing , that never can die . And when thou wouldst speak of the soul that has past Through the portals of death , and its dark mantle cast , Yet immortal shall live on some far brighter shore , To rejoice in pure bliss , evermore , evermore , We will bear the bright rainbow to glow through thy speech , With the power of its beauty life 's promise to teach ; For its grand arch triumphal shall rise o'er it all , And disperse the dark clouds that hang round like a pall . We will snatch the bright stars from their place in the heaven , All their brightness and truth to the world shall be given ; And the lights streaming up through the north in their fire , We will send thee , to teach every soul to aspire , Till they quiver and burn through thy songs as the sky , And they bear on their wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts . If thou turnest to see And know of our glories , we 'll give them to thee . Genii of the Ocean . Genii of the Ocean We have heard in our depths profound , From thy lips a murmuring sound , And we thought it breathed a prayer ; And that spirits of the air , And the naiads bright and fair , Had taken thee to their care , And were weaving spells for thee , Underneath the greenwood tree , In the fountains , on the lea , In the fair blue sky we see , Till the voice came down , and we Have arisen from our deep , Where our royal court we keep , Where the brave young sailors sleep , Where the mermaids o'er them weep , And the sea-weeds round them creep ,  --  Yes , to bring each bidden spell , From the caves wherein we dwell , And to let our own tones swell , With a sound like ,  --  " It is well !

And we 've brought the coral shining , And the sea-weed ever twining , And a thousand nameless things , That around our portal clings ; Gems and jewels from our caves , Spray and foam from out the waves , And the treasures of the world , Into our deep caverns hurled , Ere the light was wide unfurled , To bless the earth in love ; Just to teach what unseen worth In all unknown deeps has birth , Hidden from the outer earth , Never brought above , Till some kindly hand has lent All its energies , and sent Some one on this mission bent , To find the treasure deep ; Some skilful diver of the soul , Who dares the waves that round him roll , To find each part and learn the whole , As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such deep treasures thou wilt find , Though the form seems rude ; Underneath some frowning mask , If thy soul knows how to ask , Thou mayst find a good .

Under every ocean wave There is still a hidden cave , With its pearl and shell ; Deep in every human soul There are powers that ever roll , Each a potent spell .

There 's inspiration in the tone , There 's knowledge of the great Unknown , To fill thy mind with awe ; There shalt thou see His mighty power , There listen in each passing hour , And read his written law .

The members of the family , also a lady friend , seated at their separate employments . The father throws down the evening 's paper , and turns to his daughter . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour What keeps thee , Ida , poring o'er that book ? I scarce have caught a single welcome look . Had I not found my slippers waiting there , All warm and nice beside my easy chair , I should have doubted if thou wert at home  --  Come , tell me what thou'rt reading , daughter , come ! She lays down her book , seats herself on his lap , and lays her head affectionately upon his shoulders . Ah , not too old to be my little pet ! I know thou art a woman  --  yes , and yet It hardly seems a day has passed since thou Wert but a little babe , a child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy heart , And leave for me not even one small part . How is it ,  --  shall I lose my summer flower ? It would , indeed , be but a mournful hour . Pats her cheek . Ida , Ida Seymour playfully . Oh , never fear , I know there could not be A man in all the world so kind to me , As thou , my father , and I mean to stay As long as hearts would miss me if away . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Well , well , no more ; thy mother 's half in tears I do believe , at just these playful fears . But , stay ! thou hast not told me yet what page Has held thee bound as silent as a sage . I know thou art a book-worm , but to-night I almost thought thy mind had taken flight . Ida . Ida Seymour The book indeed is wonderful . Each line With strange , rich gems of thought and beauty shines . I wonder where the poet found the power O'er every page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the pen was tipped with fire , To touch the soul , and teach it to aspire . Not lofty , far above the common mind , But where each heart its own desire can find Rewritten , and its answer strangely given , Till led unconsciously on toward its heaven . There is an earnestness in each new thought , Some holy purpose every line has caught ; I can not tell the beauties that I see , But it has woke new powers and thoughts in me . It seems as though I could not sink again To common thoughts and common cares and pain . If I could keep the spirit of the page , There 'd come to me at least the Golden Age . It does not give the author 's real name , I find no clue to tell from whence it came . Its title , " The True Life : "  --  ' t is given well ! And binds me strangely with an unseen spell . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour And yet , a book that leads the mind away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With airy flights of fancy soaring high , That leaves the listener floating in the sky , Is not the power to make thee firm and strong To meet the cares that unto life belong . We find it not on any written page ;  --  My daughter , we must make the Golden Age ! Ida . Ida Seymour I did not mean it took my thoughts from earth ; It waked within me those of greater worth . It made the tasks of life seem like a joy , Its cares , its ills , too trifling to annoy ; And shed a calm and softened light o'er life , That strangely swept away its cares and strife . I say again , if I could keep the power I 've caught from that true Poet in this hour , The world would be all beauty ; for the hand Of some great earnest work would ever stand Revealed to me , and in my life 's true light I 'd still work on , because it leads to Right . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Then was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like these  --  it makes my heart rejoice . I would not have thee throw thy life away In careless ease , and childish , petty play : I 've prayed , a true and earnest life for thee ,  --  To see thee live it , will be heaven to me . Loses himself in thought . I 'll read the book  --  I like an earnest thought . There 's much that 's trash , much better if unbought . Hast read this book , Kate Walters ? Kate . Kate Walters No , not I ! For me ' t is much too prosy , and too dry . I beg thy daughter 's pardon , but I heard Her read some parts , yet did not hear a word That 's in my style . I like Byronic verse , Not Pope 's nor Cowper 's ;  --  this is even worse , Forever bringing down to real life ;  --  I 'd rather burst away from all its strife , And plunge into some deeply thrilling book , Like Byron 's " Corsair , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange , new notions it is filled . Let parsons preach , I say , what God has willed , But this points out to life such lofty use , Rather than try to live , I 'd beg a truce . ' T is my belief that when a person dies , ' T is time enough to pass into the skies ; That life on earth is given to enjoy What good there is , ere it has time to cloy . And then I think the heroine takes a stand In that position God assigned to man . I do n't believe in " Woman 's Rights ; " such stuff I dread ; I 'm sure that I have rights enough ! Mr. Seymour , Mr. Seymour laughing . No one doubts that , as on some future day Some luckless wight may have good cause to say ! Kate . Kate Walters Well , have thy joke ! I 've my opinion still . I have no doubt thy daughter will fulfil A higher life than mine , that runs to waste ; I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste . Mrs. Seymour . Mrs. Seymour Why , Kate , I really thought thou hadst a heart , That , when once touched , would see a better part . Reared in such luxury , thou canst not know , From what or whom thy countless blessings flow ; But with thy love of case and happiness , Thou hast not found the greatest charm to bless . Joy lies not in the getting , that 's not bliss ; This is the secret test ,  --  thou'lt find it this : " Give , give , forget thyself , and always give ! " Thus find God 's blessing , thus in pleasure live . Kate . Kate Walters It may be ; but I think I 'd rather get . And , with thy own belief , should I regret . I make the giver happier that he Finds God 's rich blessing when he gives to me ? A true philanthropist in my own way ;  --  Who 'll dare dispute it , Mr. Seymour , say ? Mr. Seymour , Mr. Seymour ( smiling . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heiress , belle , young Clifton 's bride elect , To look on life with unveiled , earnest eyes , Or stop to weep where human suffering lies . I well remember in my youthful day  --  I half forget my hair is turning gray  --  How thoughtless unto mirth I gave my heart , Until keen anguish pierced it with her dart , And woke me sudden to the sense of pain In other hearts ;  --  it never slept again . A child of fortune , like thyself , I clung To pleasure , till my father 's death-knell rung . He died insolvent . O'er his honored name The cold world hung the blackened pall of shame , And called him base . It broke my mother 's heart , And I was left alone to bear my part , With such a sudden sense of life 's first pain , As when once borne , can never come again . I sank at first beneath the dreadful blow , But soon I felt a deeper life-blood flow , And all my soul rose up . That point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . I firmly breasted life 's impetuous stream ; I have succeeded far beyond my dream . Wealth , fame and honor , now the world calls mine , Two jewels for my heart forever shine ; And in the love that gathers round my hearth , I might forget the misery of earth , But for this first great blow ; now my great prayer Is that my bliss each human heart may share . And if a day has passed , no act of mine Has given joy for which the thousands pine , I count it lost ; and with me , heart and hands , I need not say that Mrs. Seymour stands . Thou knowest her well ; the poor know better far ;  --  I need not tell thee what her merits are . And this , my daughter , round whose life my heart Clings with a love in which self bears no part ,  --  The only pledge of our long , mutual love ,  --  More than all else I 've striven , far above All thoughtlessness to elevate her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That women often loses reared in wealth . And , blessed with beauty , grace , and joys of health , I could not bear to see her spend her youth , Careless and vain , coquettish , proud , in truth Like thousands whom indulgent parents rear , So all unfitted for a woman 's sphere ,  --  Just pretty women , fit to while away Man 's leisure hours some quiet summer day ; With winning smiles , and doll-like , quiet face , And genteel small talk done with artist 's grace ; With thoughts , opinions , aspirations tame , And not one thought of life 's true end and aim . It pains my heart to see these fragile flowers Step forth in life without a woman 's powers , And yet assume a woman 's duties , state , And failing , meet a sad and early fate . It grieves me much  --  I speak it as a friend  --  To see one blest as thou , thy best powers spend In what seems so unworthy , trifling , vain ; And yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I see thee move in light , Amid the crowds in pleasure 's halls at night , And think such bliss is all in all to thee , Thou canst not guess the pang that comes to me . I loved thy father , and I love his child ,  --  Though far too wayward , and albeit too wild ,  --  And I can see beyond this brilliant haze , To real life , and earnest future days , When woman 's duties come , sweet , but yet stern , And call to thee from thoughtless scenes to turn , And lay thy soul 's best offering at a shrine Where thou must mould still other minds by thine . And if unequal to the task that 's given , How will thy heart with many a pang be riven , And joys that seem so full of beauty now , Will turn to dust and ashes on thy brow . I would not have thee less the glad and gay , I love thy leaping sunshine every day , The waves of joy that sweep across thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll The germs of earnest purpose hidden slept , And nobler , loftier thoughts their vigils kept , To leap like Genii from the ocean cave , Should storm and tempest come thy bark to save . Forgive me , that I 've spoken words so plain , Perchance sometime they 'll come to thee again . Who knows ? You smile ; but words unheeded now , May echo back in after days , and thou Wilt give them audience , with better grace Than I expect to win from that young face . Kate . Kate Walters I feel thy words , their truth and earnest love . Thou knowest I have no friends I prize above Thyself and thine ; if aught could tame my heart , And make it good and great , thou hast the art . But , ah , I fear ' t is useless ! I must sip The cup of pleasure while ' t is at my lip , And let the world go on its beaten way , And with the selfish have my little day . And should life bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to drink it up ; And when strikes home its keen and piercing dart , Perhaps I , too , shall have a better heart . Till then I shall not be a saint , I fear , Or fill what seems to thee a woman 's sphere . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Well , here comes Clifton ! So at once I yield The subject , ere I 'm driven from the field . I have no hope to make a convert now , At least , until he 's made his parting bow . Besides , thou'rt just the woman he admires ; He 's no ambition thou shouldst have desires Beyond the pretty women of the world ,  --  To have thy toilet nice , thy ringlets curled , With dimpling smiles that make thy face their home . But hush !  --  " Behold , the Conquering Hero comes ! " Enter Walter Clifton , a man of wealth and fashion , and husband expectant of Miss Kate Walters . Ah , Clifton ! Have a seat ! Myself and Kate Have just been holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that woman 's grace Depends upon a stylish form and face , And that her only province is to make Herself so fascinating , she can take By storm , the heart of every man she meets ,  --  Her greatness measured by their sure defeats . Dost like the portrait , Clifton ? Does it suit ? Give us thy heart 's ideal ! I 'll be mute . Clifton . Walter Clifton Thou hast not given me time for sober thought . But when a man has once been fairly caught , He 's sure the power by which he met defeat , Must be of all the world the most complete . Thine own experience must have taught thee this , That to be conquered has sometimes its bliss . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour True , I was taken captive years ago ,  --  I 've had no wish for freedom since , oh , no ! But serious now , a truce to every jest : How shall a woman fill her true sphere best ? Clifton . Walter Clifton Why nature points the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To him belong The sterner duties . Woman was not made For life 's rough highways , rather for the shade ;  --  To soothe man 's hours when weary with the strife That meets at every step his way in life . She who best makes her home a place of cheer , Fills most and best a woman 's higher sphere . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour I grant her province there . She moves the Eve Of her own Eden . We should sadly grieve ,  --  The poor lost Adams of a suffering race ,  --  If there we could not see her smiling face . That first , and always first . When she assumes The duties of a wife , when she presumes To rear and mould the soft and plastic mind , That with her own high nature is entwined , No other duties should take place of these , No other pleasures have such power to please ; The voice of her true love she should obey , And cast the light to make their brightest day . Though hard the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother finds reward enough in Heaven . But is that all a woman 's hand can do ? Must she but this one phase of life pursue ? Has she no thoughts and energies like man ? Has she not right to do what e'er she can ? To use the gifts of mind she finds most strong , That lend her power to overcome the wrong ? What time her higher duties do not call , What should prevent her doing good in all ? Clifton . Walter Clifton Thou surely dost not mean by such a plan , That she should labor side by side with man ? Do just the work her fancy points to do , Though course and rough , or radical and new ? Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour I mean these powers to her of right belong ; To follow her own impulse deep and strong , And choose herself employment ;  --  take the pen , Or brush or scalpel , side by side with men . In short , do any work her heart deems good ,  --  Her right God-given . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , I think I understand thee now Quite well enough , and yet thou must allow A difference of opinion on this point ; I fear thou'dst find things sadly out of joint With this , thy plan . To such a motley throng No woman of refinement could belong , And keep the charm that lies in her pure heart , And all the sweetness of her winning art . ' Twill do perhaps for her to wield the pen ,  --  " Blue-stockings , " though , are terrors among men ;  --  Yet I 've no fancy that a wife of mine , Among the literary world should shine . ' T is apt to spoil the beauty of the home , And then the stains of ink so sure to come On her fair fingers . Better jewelled rings Become white hands than any such foul things . And faugh ! to see a pretty woman stand With keen , dissecting instruments in hand , Dividing lung from lung , and bone from bone , A perfect Gorgon , turning one to stone ! I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been noted for dissecting hearts . Next , in the pulpit thou wouldst have her place , Or in a public hall expose her face , Be merchant , or mechanic , at her will , Perhaps at building ships might try her skill ; In legislative halls should take her seat , While men should listen at Gamaliel 's feet ; Nor pause until she 'd grasped the reins of fate , And ruled supreme , presiding o'er the State ! Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour I think a woman 's own good sense would guide Her thoughts and actions , in a field so wide ; And being finer in her nature still Than we , the finer posts from choice would fill . Instead of going down to find her place , Would elevate her task , and give it grace . Men , termed the civilized , are half like Turks , So apt to sink to level of their works ; But she perhaps might teach them to be wise , To lift their labor up , and with it rise . And mingling more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would make them see Her purity of soul , until ' t would shame Their baser natures with its silent blame . A true-souled woman with a purpose high , Who draws her strength from native purity , Can walk amid the darkest stains of sin , Amid the direful sound of passion 's din , And winning words to hearts polluted speak , Without one breath to stain her spotless cheek . The true , the good , in woman never fail . Dost doubt ? go look at Florence Nightingale . Who does not honor her heroic name ? It puts inglorious case to deepest shame , And that false fear that woman 's skirts may stain Through earnest work where vice and sin has lain . Outside her home , a fearless woman then , Amid the ranks of coarse and brutal men , Shone like a watch-fire through the camp , when strife Had left the wounded struggling back to life ; And smoothed the pain from many a fevered brow That bends with grateful blessing toward her now . And brighter grew her spirit all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile ; And when the soldier kissed her shadow on the wall , It proved her sphere triumphant over all . Let woman like true heroine nobly stand If needs be , with the scalpel in her hand ; It turns to balm , to win back life again , That hand as soft to soothe the sufferer 's pain . No voice like hers to man was ever given , To speak of hope , or point the soul to-heaven . And who can better teach of God above , Than she who has a higher sense of love Than man can know ; in whose aspiring soul Devotion in its richest anthems roll ? I say most earnestly , I think her place Is side by side with man when saving grace Is named ; except her home , if there 's one sphere Where woman most belongs , I know ' t is here . In private or in public , ' t is no shame For her pure lips to speak God 's Holy Name . With all her power , wherever woman can , It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Seymour smiling . We read , thou knowest , that Woman first of all , In Eden tempted man unto his fall ! If but as punishment for that old crime ,  --  For which we 've groaned and toiled throughout all time ,  --  And to redeem her wrong , she ought to teach . This proves undoubtedly her right to preach . If she was first to drag Man from the skies , Now , let her tempt his soul again to rise . If done as easily as was the first , With wicked men we 'll not be long accursed ! Clifton , Walter Clifton laughing . Thou hast the argument ! I 'm forced to yield , Not to thy husband , but thyself the field . And though I 'm not convinced , I bide my fate , Aside . If thou wilt only be the tempter , Kate ! Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Well , well , we 'll see . The world is growing wise , Another age may prove what this denies . It has been so through all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last .  --  But where is Bruce ? He tarries somewhat late . Clifton . Walter Clifton Ah , that 's the very thing I wished to state ! ' T is quite in keeping with our talk to-night , He called to ask my aid to make all right . A friend of his , you know him very well , The great reformer and fanatic , Bell , Has found a prodigy ; and so invites A few choice friends to share in his delights . It seems we 've got a Poet , fresh and new , And sudden as the northern lights , if true , Who writes us books all crowded full of thought , With power from unimagined helpers caught . And not content with that , must improvise Songs snatched all fresh and new from out the skies , Until ' t is said the city 's half awake . I ought to hope ' t is true just for thy sake , Because the Poet is a woman , helping prove The very theory thou seem'st to love . Ida . Ida Seymour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  This , Mr. Clifton ! wilt thou please to look ? I 'll wait till Henry comes  --  I 'm sure he 'll know . I 'm glad he 's there ! How I should like to go ! Do tell me more ! Does she recite , or sing ? And from what power do all her talents spring ? Clifton . Walter Clifton You must excuse me . I but just now heard The simple fact , and not another word .  --  But Bruce is coming round ; if not too late , He 'll be most happy every fact to state . He 's head and ears in love with these new things , And every poet wins his offerings . Kate . Kate Walters Not more than Ida ! Why , she 's lost her heart Already with this witch 's written art ! If meeting the enchantress , who can tell How readily she 'll bow beneath her spell . Perhaps she 'd bind her with a chain of rhyme , And all around her cast the fragrant thyme ; Perhaps her own mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . How is it , Ida , would it suit thy taste , With poet 's starry mantle to be graced , Till thousands hung enraptured on thy word , And every spirit to its depths was stirred ? Ida . Ida Seymour It would indeed . I 'm not like thee in jest , I 'd like it of all things in life the best . I 'm dying to have Henry come , to tell If he has fallen , too , beneath this spell ! Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Well , here he comes ! I hear him in the hall . He little dreams how we await his call ! Enter Henry Bruce , a man of intellect , travel , and liberal views . An old friend of Mr. Seymour , and on terms of intimacy with the whole family . What recompense for having made us wait ? Mr. Bruce . Henry Bruce I beg thou wilt excuse me , though I 'm late ; I 've just been having what I call a treat , And one that every day I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much  --  I come And go like one who feels himself at home . And as ' t is early yet , I just dropped in To tell the news  --  let that excuse my sin ! Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour By Clifton we have just been kindly told You 've been the Improvisatrice to behold ; And Ida thinks the same who wrote this book ; It lies beside thee there  --  just take one look ! Mr. Bruce . Henry Bruce The very same ! I know not what to think Of this strange woman ; for she seems a link Between the dwellers of the earth and sky ; I can not fathom all this mystery . I was told candidly by Mr. Bell , Who 's known her from her early childhood well , That ever from her earliest days of youth , She 's borne the stamp of virtue and of truth . And yet it seems untrue , that all unsought The songs she sung were by her spirit caught , And that the words I heard her lips recite , Were fresh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improvise had past , Or lingered only in Italia last . Old Scotia 's minstrels long have sunk to rest , The sod lies damp and heavy on their breast ; And this cold climate slowly fosters song , Yet was the inspiration high and strong . I heard in Italy those people sing ; To me some thrilling charms around them cling , There 's such a spirit of deep , wild unrest , With which the heart that listens is impressed . The music , wild but sweet , that fills the air ,  --  The words that in the music 's richness share ,  --  And all fresh gushing from the hidden soul , Where deep within , its living waters roll , Like fountain leaping with its silvery spray , In wild , fantastic , and spontaneous play . No studied thought to fashion style or rhyme , But free and gushing , fitted to the time . Though ofttimes simple  --  songs from out the heart  --  Yet has my soul when weary of cold art , Loved better far this voice of Nature 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Than all the words the world 's famed poets sung , When science , art , had trained their pen and tongue . But this was richer than I ever heard ; A thrilling grandeur swept through every word . At times the spirit seemed to soar away , As if it knew the path to endless day ; And then the tones died soft and strangely sweet , As if some echo caught them to repeat ; Then , springing upward with a sudden flight , Flung back the shadows into blackened night . Then came her recitations , full of thought , As if the fire of genius she had caught , And poured it o'er her words , until the heart Sent back response to all its thrilling art . It lifted one from each corroding chain That bound the soul , and gave it strength again . And that which in the whole I most admire  --  She would compel the spirit to aspire . And when she stood in simple greatness there , With that strange smile the features ever wear When lit with thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power springs into birth , With words that strangely on the soul could win , I thought of Italy 's far-famed Corinne . Not crowned by mortal hand she stood to-night ; Yet wore it well , all queenly , royal , bright , Thought 's fresh , green laurel on her youthful brow  --  I almost think I see and hear her now . Clifton . Walter Clifton Just what I said ! I knew thou wouldst go mad O'er this strange spirit in mortal garments clad . But candidly , I must confess , I doubt That she pours forth such thrilling strain without Premeditated thought ; such things are strange , And go beyond the vision 's common range . Is it not reasonable to suppose , That she is artful , and , because she knows Men love the marvellous , takes this novel way O'er thousands ' hearts to hold a stronger sway ? I know not why she has such sudden power ;  --  True talent springs not strong in one short hour . This Bell may be deceived . He finds a spell In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didst thou hear her speak herself of this , Or where or how she found such power or bliss ? Bruce . Henry Bruce I simply heard her say , for weary years , With silent prayers and efforts , and with tears , She sought for power to speak her thought in word , Until at last her earnest prayer was heard , And strangely answered . O'er her came a power , Swift , sudden as the morning 's coming hour , And all her thoughts leaped up with sudden start , Like life-blood flowing outward from the heart . She says , the power e'en to herself is strange ,  --  Not yet accustomed to this wondrous change . But all her soul seems looking toward the heaven , In one thanksgiving unto Him who 's given . Ida . Ida Seymour And was she gifted in her natural mood ? And did she seem as one that 's true and good ? Was she like mortal , fairy , witch , or elf , Or d 'd she look a woman in herself ? Bruce . Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A soul of goodness beaming from her eyes , Yet nothing marked to tell the power within , That , when aroused , so many hearts must win . She 'd mingle in the crowd , and scarce be seen , With thoughtful face , and modest , graceful mien ; But when her harp is once within her hands , And rapt , inspired , before the world she stands , A glow spreads over all her face and brow , Before which others can not fail to bow . And in her eye is kindled burning fire , As if ' t were filled with an intense desire For something beautiful it caught afar , And beams and beckons like a morning star . It seemed as though some angel 's presence shed A glory over all , and round her spread The influence of a higher sphere divine , All through her being in pure light to shine . I can not think , like Clifton , that she played A part most false , when such true words she said ; Her look and manner were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was herself a lie . Though strange , though still I can not understand , Yet as I see her , harp within her hand , With that unearthly look that brighter grew , I could not , if I would , think her untrue . Ida . Ida Seymour I 'd give the world to see her , hear her speak ! For this strange power with all my soul I 'd seek . Is there no way for me to reach this shrine , And-pay her homage ? for this book won mine . But then , how could she care for one like me , When thousands flock her wondrous power to see ? And yet it seems , if I could see her face , And in it all the living goodness trace That I have found impressed upon this page , ' T would give me strength and power , almost an age . It made some chords within my spirit thrill , That once awake , I know I can not still . And could I know her , even though but slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength to something in me that would speak , That yearns , aspires , and yet is all too weak .  --  Laugh , Kate ! I do not mind ;  --  I know I 'm young ; Life 's harp to me is only newly strung ; But I shall follow out this whim of mine , In spite of that mischievous smile of thine . I love the power that speaks of life within , That wins the soul away from vice and sin ; And to avow my love I 'm not ashamed ,  --  No , not if by the censuring world I 'm blamed . Now Henry , Father , do contrive to make Some place of meeting , just for my poor sake ! Bruce . Henry Bruce Well , that is quickly done . For , but next week , Within some public hall she is to speak , And thou canst see and hear her there , and then In after-time perhaps may meet again . Ida . Ida Seymour Oh , I 'm delighted ! I shall count the hours , Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kate . Kate Walters Why , Ida ! wouldst thou go to hear her there ? I 'm sure I would not wish such joy to share . I think a woman in a public hall , The thousands round her to promiscous call , To criticise her dress ,  --  if ' t is with grace , To analyze her form , her eye , her face , And hand her name about in public streets , Where every loafer , privileged repeats , Lets herself down from woman 's lofty sphere , And I for one , would never go to hear . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Well , everybody to their taste ; but I The gifts of this strange being mean to try . If destitute of power to wisely teach , Incapable the soul 's deep chords to reach , I think she 's out of place . But if she 's power As my friend Bruce proclaims for her this hour , I think she 's standing just where woman should , When she has power to do the world a good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'er again ;  --  My real thought , perhaps , might give thee pain . Although I think ' t would bring to friend of mine Disgrace enough , yet if thou wilt , she 's thine . Let each one to his own opinion cling , And if she will , why , let her talk and sing ! ' T is naught to me . I only go my way ,  --  ' Twill be forgotten by another day ,  --  While thou'lt go thine . And Ida , I expect ,  --  Nay , even now I think I can detect The poet 's power half lurking in thine eye ,  --  That thou this woman 's skill will seek to try . Now please to write some eulogy for me : With thy vocation though I ca n't agree ; Yet should I kneel at any poet 's shrine , Depend upon it , Ida , ' twill be thine . It matters little which is wrong or right ,  --  But I must go , so say to all , good-night . Exeunt Clifton . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate and Clifton entertain , Of woman 's sphere ! Of course , they would not deign To step on such unconsecrated ground , As that where public teachers may be found In woman 's form , though pure as drifted snow , And though an angel 's speech might through them flow , To purify each spirit that might hear  --  Because " they step from woman 's lofty sphere . " And yet they listen with intense delight , And countenance , applaud , night after night , The Drama , in whose scenes must woman take An active part ,  --  half its attraction make ;  --  Women whose souls , not always clean and pure , To virtue 's paths the listener 's heart to lure ; Women whose lips speak oft the fatal word , By which some heart to vice at first is stirred ; Women who act ignoble parts , that shame True woman 's nature , without word of blame ;  --  Nor think , though immorality they hear , That women there has stepped from out her sphere . Or , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors , pandering to the base in men , To low and vitiated tastes ; that smile  --  And shame their better natures  --  at the vile , Degrading passions in the human breast , In virtue 's garb by talent almost dressed . I do not mean by this , that I ignore The drama 's true-to-nature , thrilling lore , Or that I would demolish , in disgust , The Stage ,  --  though much it panders to man 's lust ; For , rightly managed , ' t would prove mightier power Than e'en the pulpit , in the present hour ; Because the clergy are too much inclined , To space so limited to chain the mind , And narrate facts , and coldly speak their thought , While life and inspiration have been caught By the true Actor ; he , the facts , the men , In voice , and look , and action , lives again . The preacher carves the statue cold and still , The actor with the living soul can fill . One hangs a glowing picture on the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall bid the figures from the canvas start , And step forth men , with living brain and heart , To thrill through eye and ear , and reach the soul , Until he triumphs , victor o'er the whole . If men would act the Christ on this same Stage ,  --  His life as pictured on the written page ,  --  And throw a truthfulness in every word , As Booth stood forth , another " Richard Third , " ' T would take such hold upon the gazing heart , As seldom comes from any preacher 's art . Like Christ , the earnest actor then should stand , With blood-stains in his side , and foot , and hand ; And in his power , the scene long passed away , Should be enacted in the present day ; Till unbelieving Thomas , rapt , should cry , " I do believe  --  like thee I 'll live  --  thou'rt nigh . " There have been preachers with this thrilling art , Who dared to touch with living fire the heart . Paul must have been like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fountain draws . And in our day , the Beechers , Chapins , thrill , And move , and sway the human heart at will , Because their spirit glows through every thought : Old creeds and doctrines , thus new fire have caught , And burn and brighten on the hearts of men , Until old manna seems like new again . Let men like these tread this degraded Stage , And renact what 's called the Sacred Page ; Let women , like our Jenny Lind , but sing The songs of Miriam 's daughters , now to ring ; Let others in our midst , whose pen has been The bright interpreter of thoughts within , O'er whom the star of Intellect has hung ,  --  Whose brightest rays are purity ,  --  find tongue , And act no part except the pure and high , The Drama in the dust no more would lie ; But from the chains of vice and sin be free , And upward spring to native purity . There are some noble souls , I know , that now Live Actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not , like the rest , degrade their heart , But act their lives as nobly as their part . I honor them ; but round the Stage there clings Such filthy rubbish from foul offerings , Such fallen women , and such worthless men , I seldom go to Theatres ; and then When some one worthy of a higher place , With life and genius pure , the boards may grace . The people are to blame ; they should demand The fallen Drama now to take a stand Above the mass , and be the impulse given , No more to drag toward hell , but point to heaven . It might not pay the managers as well ( And so for gold they feed the flames of hell ) In its first start , but when the fires once burn , Of Genius , pure , refined , the good would turn  --  That now are kept so far by vice away  --  And honor it , and help it bear its sway ; Until its clear and ever lofty tone , Should move the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power for good , to truth to bind , Where now the youthful but a tempter find . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Thou'rt right . There lies the field for such great good , And yet , how thoroughly misunderstood ! The vile stand ready at its open gate , The good , disgusted , leave it to its fate . All wrong . And yet how hopeless seems the task , To renovate the tastes of those who ask For such vile trash ; then coldly turn away En masse ,  --  like Clifton and like Kate to-day ,  --  With careless thought , without a noble aim , And idly bow at pleasure 's shrine ; yet claim An aristocracy too high , too grand , To tread the ground where God 's own martyrs stand , Whose path through thorns is marked with sweat and blood , While sinners in high places men call good . I almost thought I was severe to-night To Kate , but now I think it was but right Her father was a man of noble mind ,  --  She 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done my best . She 's thoughtless , heartless still ;  --  With her I have exhausted all my skill . I grieve . Her father was my truest friend , And on his death-bed begged of me to lend My aid in moulding Kate 's young , careless mind ; But all in vain , day after day we find . And now she weds herself to one more vain , Whose character is not without a stain ; But rich , and fond of pleasure , full of mirth , Like thousands , she mistakes it all for worth . Before two years are past , I fear she 'll know The pang of life 's first , great , heart-crushing blow . Bruce . Henry Bruce Whoever marries Clifton , may expect  --  Though at the first with flowers and jewels decked  --  To find him selfish , arrogant , and vain , And get at least their share of this life 's pain . ' T is well for her  --  the day her soul repents  --  That nature gave her not that finer sense Of right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That of another such high standard claims . It pains my heart to see a woman , fine And delicate , whom God made half divine , So keenly sensitive in feeling , thought , By misalliance to the level brought Of some coarse , brutal , and unfeeling mind , That by strange spell is round her own intwined . To have her noblest thoughts thrown back unknown , Appreciative or responsive tone Never awoke within his careless breast  --  Perhaps considered worse her very best ; And see him drag her down to his low plane , As years pass on , or know the soul 's deep pain Consumes the life ; though breathed not one complaint  --  Bearing its burden like God 's chosen saint ,  --  Till weary of its martyr pathway here , Like summer bird it seeks a brighter sphere . It makes one wonder if a Higher Power Can watch , unmoved , such bitter trial-hour ; Or if such " marriages were made in Heaven "  --  I 'm sure , God 's sanction was not asked or given . Mrs. Seymour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strife So apt to mix itself with married life , And when I see such feelings of unrest , Half hidden , half exposed in many a breast , I shudder at the thought of our escape , And wonder how stern destiny could shape Such bliss for us as only comes to few  --  Two souls that met , and keep their love still new . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Ah , yes , while pity rises in my breast , I 'm yet more grateful we have been so blest . May Ida be as happy in her choice , If ever comes the time when her loved voice Shall answer back to some fond , loving heart , And from her home we see her steps depart . Ida . Ida Seymour Now , father , now I shall begin to think Thou dost believe I 'm just upon the brink Of matrimony ; for thy words , thy tone , Are sad as if I were already gone . My head is quite too full of poets now , At any other shrine than theirs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago I saw the work . I will this moment go And get it , and refresh again my mind , Anticipating thus what I shall find , When I at last this new Corinne shall see , And listen to her words with ecstasy . She passes into the library , that opens from the parlor . Bruce soon follows her . Bruce . Henry Bruce I thought I 'd come and help thee find the book ,  --  I do n't believe thou'rt competent to look . Parnassus ' dust I know has filled thine eyes , In this thy swift ascent to poets ' skies . Be careful ! Pegasus is no safe steed ; He throws the rider who takes little heed ; And all Castalia 's waters may be found Still insufficient to assuage the wound . Perhaps the Muse has visited thee ; thy brow Bears poet 's seal , I see it even now . Ida . Ida Seymour Ah , jest ! I 've found the book , and here it lies ,  --  That proves which of us two has better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd rather fall , than always stay in night . And if my soul could get , for once to drink Castalia 's waters , I would tempt the brink Of any mount , however steep and high  --  Despite the look I see within thine eye . Bruce . Henry Bruce What didst thou see ? I do not jest , indeed ! I only wish my hand had power to lead . Sit down a moment . Let us talk of this Bright gift , that seems to thee so much a bliss . I 've often thought , when I have heard thee speak , With such a burning glow upon thy cheek , And such an earnest , radiant , soul-lit eye , Of life , of poesy , and all things high ; And when I 've seen thee sit all lost in thought , As if some unseen power thy soul had caught , And borne it from thy body 's power afar , With lightning 's steeds , and thought 's bright-burnished car , That thou must have an artist 's soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brow . I know most unmistakably this hour , That if thou wilt , thou canst rouse latent power To answer to this ardent wish of thine . Confess thy heart ! thou canst confide in mine ! For I suspect that thou hast tried thine art At writing rhymes  --  Ah , Ida , why that start ? Now tell me all ; my interest is strong ; In thy heart 's earnest wish I 've seen it long : And let me be in this to thee a friend , And if I can in aught , my best powers lend . Ida . Ida Seymour Oh , wilt thou ? Then shall I feel truly blest ; For much and long I 've tried , and yet my best Has been so weak , so more than wholly vain , I 've often thought I 'd never try again . But then some new desire impels me on ;  --  I strive and fail again , as I had done . I 've always kept it secret until now , Not even my dear parents would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've hid from them since first my life begun . I could write nothing worthy of a smile , And so I kept it hidden all the while . But now thou know'st the fact , I gather strength , And feel as though I 'd found a friend at length . Thou couldst do much to help me , very much ,  --  Such help , oh , I have always pined for such ! Thou hast a critic 's eye , at once to see Defects that might be hidden quite from me ; Thou hast such true poetic taste to train , Assist my own , I shall take heart again . Such range of thought , of history , of fact , And scholarship , and travel , would exact A higher style than I alone could reach , Without some mind like thine to train and teach . And then I know so kindly ' t would be done That I 'd grow strong e'en with the censure won . At least I can but fail , and if I do , Thou must catch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that thou dost never write The thoughts that in thee shine like stars in night . Perhaps to this true motto thou hast clung : " The sweetest songs are those no voice has sung . " Bruce . Henry Bruce The motto is most true . Those who have spoke The words that into life the heart has woke , No matter how the song may thrill and burn , Though lofty souls in reverence to it turn , Yet , deep within their souls in sweetness ring , Songs richer , deeper far , they can not sing . To these belongs no Anglo-Saxon word ; The soul 's dim aisles alone by such are stirred : And only they with spirits just as fine , Can catch these " wordless songs " almost divine . As they who listen to some murmuring shell , That in its plaintive melody will tell Forever of its home , the far-off sea ; So soul speaks ever of Immensity . No doubt the artist whom I heard to-night , Whose words were filled with such a power and light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her richest songs will still remain In far unfathomed depths , yet sing for aye , As if to mock , with rich strains far away , Those she has caught and pours o'er others here , With visions of a more melodious sphere . And yet those very pains but serve to wake Still richer gifts , far sweeter songs to make . The power within that shames the work best done , Is that which has most glorious victories won . The grand Ideal gives the mind no rest , Until a second work shall shame the best : Thus drawing deeper ever from the fount , Thus scaling higher still Progression 's mount . Yet , Ida , those who best succeed , and give The world best songs , too apt in sadness live , Because their greatest power gives them to know Still richer wealth in mind 's far depths below , And feel the link that binds them to the Soul From whence these powers through all their being roll . It is a solemn thing ; for they , the great , Stand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effulgence ever pouring through , While of its gifts their souls can use so few . And yet ' t is not because I feared to use The mind 's rich gifts , that I would such refuse ; For nature gave me not the power to sing , Though at such shrine I pay rich offering . My song sare all in thought ; I have no word ; Alone my heart by their rich tone is stirred . But ' t is not so with thee ; I watch and wait To see thee enter at the outer gate . Ida . Ida Seymour I can but knock ; though I am more afraid , After the words by thee so truly said . But yet , I 'm weary waiting in the cold , And that perhaps has made me overbold . The faint in heart shall never win , they say , So I will not despair , at least , to-day . And sometime when thou hast a leisure hour , I humbly beg thou'lt test my want of power , By reading just a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet vainly  --  many times ,  --  To make suggestions and to criticise , To tear them into shreds till each one dies . Though at their weakness I feel deepest shame , And dread the ordeal , yet thou wilt not blame , But point to better things , till all my pain , Though hard to bear , at last results in gain . Bruce . Henry Bruce You 've little to expect from me , save this : " Two heads are better than is one . " The bliss Of making one poor effort for thy sake , And watching oft the progress thou shalt make , Will be a greater favor given me , Than all the little good I do for thee .  --  Why not to-morrow morning ? I 'll come in ;  --  Such pleasant task I 'm anxious to begin . Ida . Ida Seymour Thou'lt weary soon enough , I have no doubt , To find what foolishness I 've been about . But any time , it matters not how soon ;  --  I fear I 'll lose my confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic 's face I 'll lock my papers closer in their place . Bruce . Henry Bruce Then I 'll come early . I 've no wish to lose This promised treat ; and then thou canst but choose Fulfil engagements made in such good truth , Lest I should hold responsible , insooth . Fearing another moment thou'lt relent , I 'll thank thee for this hour so richly spent , And say , good-night . May pleasant dreams be shed Through all thy soul  --  leave blessings on thy head . He passes into the parlor as Ida retires , and finds Mr. Seymour alone . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Well , Bruce , with eyes of both I think it took Rather a tedious time to find the book . With reading , I went fast asleep , I own , And when I woke I found myself alone . Sit down , my friend , ' t is not so very late ,  --  And then thou'st no one in thy home to wait . Bruce . Henry Bruce " No one to wait for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ' t is really quite too bad That thou hast such a home , such happiness , While I have none my heart or hearth to bless . We grew up side by side , as schoolmates , boys , Almost the same our interests and our joys ; But I have been a wanderer over earth ,  --  Culling , ' t is true , oft here and there its worth ,  --  And now at thirty-five I cease to roam , And find thee with a wife to bless thy home , And such a daughter ! If I dared to speak The thoughts for which all words are powerless , weak ,  --  Can I presume upon our olden love , To say without restraint , I prize above All other bliss that life may have in store , Thy daughter , whom I know thou dost adore ? And as I heard thee say to-night , dost dread The hour when she , who o'er thine own has shed Such light , shall bless another 's heart and home . I know with what bad grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since that first hour I saw her face , has slowly woke a power No other face or voice has caused to thrill , A love intense , I have no power to still . I 've striven long to check this love , that came So silently ,  --  I have no cause for blame ,  --  Because I knew ' t would be so hard for thee To yield her unto any , thus to me . And she so young , so full of artless grace , I can not look upon her fair young face , Without a pang . How can I hope to win Her heart 's first love ? It seems almost a sin To ask to wear in this poor heart of mine , A flower so fresh , that seems so half divine . I had resolved on silence , till to-night Her mind awoke with such a glow of light In our discussion , showing such a soul , In whose rich depths I hear sweet anthems roll , That all my heart arose with sudden power , And would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou dost not speak . I shall not blame thy word , Though all my soul unto its depths is stirred With keenest anguish ; for thou hast the right ; I hardly hoped for less than this to-night . I do not know that I might ever win One thought from her , nor would I e'er begin That task , though ever hopeless it might be , Until ' t was sanctioned by a word from thee . No look or tone of mine has ever shown Thy daughter that my heart was all her own . I 've closely guarded look and word , till now I stand beside thee with an unshamed brow , And say , that in thy daughter 's hand must lie  --  In her pure love ,  --  my future destiny ! Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Pardon me , Bruce , that I have seemed so cold : For thou thy thoughts so suddenly hast told , And on this subject nearest to my heart , I could not act the friend 's , but father 's part . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldst love this treasured child of mine ; Thou , who hast seen the beauties of all lands , To have thy fate in such a young girl 's hands Seems sudden , strange . Though with a father 's love I cherish her all others far above , Except her mother , could I give her up ? Yet sometime , doubtless , I must taste that cup . And now , I think there 's not another heart For which I would so soon with Ida part , Or one that with such tenderness and truth Would love and cherish her , and guard her youth . If I , so young could think to let her go , I 'd yield to thee , if she , too , willed it so ; But hardly seventeen , a child at best , Accustomed only to be loved , caressed , She is not fitted yet to be thy wife , And mingle in the duties , cares of life . When she shall leave her home , the fond hearts here , I wish her fitted well for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ask that she should leave thy side , Or dare to think of her as my fair bride , As yet . I only hoped at best to gain Permission ,  --  though perhaps I give thee pain ,  --  To strive to win her young heart to my own , Until it sends me back an answering tone . If I but win her love , though long and late Thou dost delay , I can with patience wait . To see her , hear her voice , and win her smile , Is happiness enough for me the while . True love is void of self , it seeks alone Another 's happiness before its own ; And if one feeling in my heart is pure , This love for her is steadfast , earnest , sure . I never bowed before at woman 's shrine , And why at her 's I hardly now divine , Save that I see in her pure soul a ray To burn and brighten to a glorious day ; And every look , and word , and act , reveals The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not clothe in words ; and over me It casts a spell of peace and purity . I came from Europe , sick of all the world ,  --  The giddy mazes where the people whirled In outward joy , life 's burning grief within , Their best thoughts blasted with the fire of sin ,  --  A sad misanthrope . Joy 's first morn was o'er . I sought for peace upon my native shore , But with no thought there could be joy for me ; And in this mood I first encountered thee . It took me back to childhood 's early days , It gave my heart its few first sunny rays ; But only when I saw thy daughter smile , With that child-woman face , so free from guile , My heart from its long lethargy awoke , And morning 's glory through my midnight broke ,  --  Not suddenly , but soft as comes the ray , The first that ushers in the golden day ,  --  Until grown brighter with each added beam That lit the sky with still a richer gleam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose with voice , " Let there be light ! " And shall it shine for me , give joy again , Or will it only mock me with my pain ? ' T is not becoming that my lips should speak The things of my own self , that thou might seek In one who would make claim her love to win ; I only say , through my whole life I 've been A seeker for the good and beautiful in all : I could not bear to let my standard fall . And so ,  --  though finding much of good in man , Yet poorly carried out each noble plan ,  --  I grew more weary of my life each day , Cared not how soon it should be swept away . I craved a heart to answer back to mine , And wake within me chords still more divine ; And finding not , as year by year past on , My hope to find at last was wholly gone . And yet I could not stoop as thousands do , To win a love as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid the crowds I stood , Silent and cold , and never understood ; While in my heart still burned the living fire That for some nobler life would still aspire . And now , when I had closed my hopeless task , When I had almost ceased such gift to ask , I find a soul to give my own such rest ,  --  If with as fervent love I might be blest ; And I could shrine it in my heart of hearts , With love undying , till all thought departs . And could I win thy daughter for my bride , She stands my equal : I have long defied The laws that make the woman subject to the man  --  A rule time-worshipped , but a barbarous plan . From every thrall of mine as far she 'd be , As now she moves in her own purpose free . Unworthy of the marriage rites the word , " obey ; " If love rules not , no other power can sway . A woman of true spirit spurns control , Yet when love asks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thy happy life , So high and free from all that petty strife . I yearn for happiness like thine to share , A look of calm content like thine to wear ; And I would ask no other boon but this  --  Thy daughter 's heart and hand  --  to bring such bliss . And could I know such bliss would be my fate , The time thou askest I would gladly wait . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Thou art most honorable . I know thee true , That thou hast come to me , ere first thou drew Confession from her lips of love to thee : It has won thorough confidence from me . I always knew thou hadst a noble heart , And in this matter such a generous part Hast thou now acted , that although I must Take time for thought  --  excuse me , I 'll be just ,  --  So sudden came thy purpose to my mind , So closely round my heart she is entwined  --  I bid thee welcome to my home and hearth , As thou hast been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts are calm and free from pain , Ere long , we 'll talk this matter o'er again . Meanwhile , of this be well assured , that none But thee couldst speak such words as thou hast done , And win a second thought , for doubly mine In friendship 's bonds thou wert , if she were thine . Bruce . Henry Bruce I take thy words . They bear a hope to me , And there is one more chord that binds to thee . Forgive the lateness of the hour ; a spell Has bound me here to-night , but now , farewell ! SCENE III . Evening . A large public hall crowded with people of all classes . Mr. and Mrs. Seymour , Ida and Bruce , seated near the platform . Ida . Ida Seymour ' T is near the time . I 'm glad ' t is getting late . In such a place , how tedious ' t is to wait ! Bruce . Henry Bruce Yes , in such public gatherings every kind Of influence meets , and every class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' T is seldom one finds comfort in his seat .  --  I hope the entertainment will commence Ere long , just to relieve thy heart 's suspense . Perhaps I set her gifts that night so high , ' Twill disappoint in the reality ; And yet I have no fear . Here lies the charm Of every Improvisatrice ,  --  in the calm Or thrilling look of eye , and of the face , The voice that catches some peculiar grace , That sends the words home with such burning power , They sway thee at their will , and charm the hour . And then the thought that fresh from out the mint Of mind , just newly-coined ,  --  though seen in print It must lose half its charm ,  --  when one can hear , Strikes home with such a wild-bird 's note upon the ear , It seems as though the soul of one who sings , Leaps sudden forth , and like a fountain springs To meet thine own , and thou hadst caught the spray Of real , living waves of song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrapped like a glittering rainbow round thy head . Here mind meets mind , fresh-gushing , young and new , The soul stands half revealed , if true , or if untrue . Catch up these words , and write them on a page , They 're like a wild-bird drooping in a cage ; His song rings not so sweet and strong and clear , As when through forest-aisles it met the car . There every tree caught up the wild notes sung , And back again in richer sweetness flung . Now , but the voice is heard , and in such hour His heart sings not ; there lived his greatest power .  --  She 'll enter soon ; then judge with eye and ear , Whether " she 's stepped from woman 's lofty sphere ! " Ida . Ida Seymour I wonder where Kate is to-night ? Suppose At party , ball , or theatre  --  who knows ? Bruce .

I love the music , but detest each word . To-morrow night , ' t is " Norma , "  --  hast thou heard ? Ida . Ida Seymour I have not , though I read it with delight . Bruce . Henry Bruce We must be sure to go to-morrow night . I 'll ask thy parents now ,  --  ' twill be so fine ,  --  If they 'll consent to go , I know I 've thine . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Bruce , Ida , hast thou heard those people there ? I think thy pet from them will get her share Of vile abuse . Just list a moment , do ! Stranger Lady . Stranger Lady I do n't believe a word ! It is untrue To think it comes impromptu , without thought : With such transparent sham I 'll not be caught ! Young Gentleman , Young Gentleman with white vest , jewelled rings , and mustache . Perhaps she 's beautiful ,  --  would show her face : Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows but I may fall in love , first sight , And failing to win her 's , may go bedight ? Young Miss , Young Miss with a simper . In love ! I never thought thou hadst a heart . Young Gentleman . Young Gentleman In justice then thou ought to give me part Of thine .  --  Stranger Lady . Stranger Lady I think it is a real shame ! I feel , myself , as very much to blame For coming here to-night . If Mrs. Brown Should know of this , she 'd think us letting down Our dignity , to mingle in this crowd .  --  Such things as these ought not to be allowed . Middle-Aged Gentleman , Middle-Aged Gentleman with an air of careless indifference and mischievous look . I like to have the fun go on . I see One and another look surprised at me , And wonder much what motive brought me here . But then I am not proud , like thee , my dear ! Lady . Stranger Lady Proud ! No indeed ! And so I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But come alone hereafter , if thou wilt ! I 'm sure , I hold it hardly less than guilt To countenance such things ; she may be vile , And use this new-born power as artful wile : No woman with a pure , unsinful heart , Would in a public place take such a part . Middle-Aged Gentleman . Gentleman Not quite so bad as that , perhaps , my dear ! There 's so much said about a woman 's sphere Just now , perhaps she thinks she 'll take a stand , And make her woman 's voice ring through the land . Let 's wait until we hear , and then decide , Without regard to fashion , vanity , or pride . Elderly Gentleman , Elderly Gentleman with white neckcloth . Sir , at the best I deem it real sin , For her to stand such public place within . You know that Paul says , sir , " It is a shame For woman publicly to speak . " I blame Her very much ; and then I have been told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had no fear of God or man ; But I 'm determined to defeat this plan Before ' t is older ; and I came to-night To hear her words myself , and just indite The heads . Next Sunday , I intend to preach A sermon , to denounce the whole , and teach My congregation of this deadly sin , Before she can commence their hearts to win . I mean to warn my people , sir , to stay Within the fold , and not be led away By such strange women , teaching stranger things , Though with deceitful , siren voice she sings . I 'll do my duty , though it is a cross To come ,  --  in Heaven I shall make up the loss ! Sighs . Bruce , Henry Bruce to Mr. Seymour , laughing . We have gone back to Pharisees again ! He thanks his God , he 's not as other men . No matter , truth will bide the test of all , And by it let our poet stand or fall . I hope he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here she comes ! They just turn on the light ! Improvisatrice . Improvisatrice Enter Improvisatrice , preceded by an attendant bearing a harp . Intense silence in the audience . She leans over the harp a few moments , then raising her eyes toward heaven , touches the strings and commences singing . I seek no homage from the crowd , Though hushed in silence long ; I sing at last because my soul Will pour itself in song ; Because a fountain leaps within , Whose ever-dashing spray Can catch the light , and bear it back , Like golden beams of day . It matters not to me , the thought That others round me fling , When on this altar now I lay My heart 's best offering . Far from the world I wrap me up In robes that none can see , And find true joy in Thee , my God , If none shall smile on me . I only care that other hearts Should feel this thrill of mine ,  --  A chord electric that would draw Each soul more close to Thine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul its chain , A gift to win the tears that wash Away each guilty stain . O human heart ! that throbs and beats , So wrung with bitter grief , Cast every sin from out thy midst , And thou shalt find relief ! When pure and clear as crystal shines The human soul shall be , There is no place within its depths For such deep misery . The light of heaven shall beam and burn Unto its depths below ; Through crystal walls it enters in , Like mist , dispersing woe . And round its shrine for evermore The golden rays shall cling , And through its aisles in thrilling strains , The angel , Peace , shall sing ! She pauses , leaning again upon her harp . Enter Attendant , bearing a letter to the Improvisatrice . She reads , exchanges a few words with him , and he then calls the attention of the audience . Attendant . Attendant It is requested by some persons here  --  Who marvel much at this strange power , and fear The songs thus sung are first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought Before the public in this novel way , To exercise on all a greater sway  --  That some one in the audience this hour Themselves should give a theme , to test the power Of this strange poet-songstress  --  something new ,  --  And if she sings at once , it proves her true . She cheerfully consents , because ' twill prove The truth of this strange art she claims and loves .  --  The gentleman who gave me this request , Will please step forward . Let it be addressed  --  The subject  --  in a voice distinct and clear , That every person in the hall may hear ! Gentleman , Gentleman stepping forward . This power , so strange , seems hardly to belong Except to Italy , the land of song ; And I must be forgiven , if I doubt The power that brings these strange results about . Though much I 've heard of this strange singer 's power , If she shall sing as readily this hour From subject I propose , I will believe , And as a truth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I speak it with an honest heart : " From whence  --  what power  --  has come this singer 's art ? " The Improvisatrice Improvisatrice turns her eyes upon the audience , touches her harp , and without a moment 's thought , chants in a clear , sweet voice , these words :  --  From the dancing rill That will leave the hill For the brooklet far away ; From the mountain springs , From the fount that flings To the sunbeam , crystal spray ; From the ocean caves , From the foam-capped waves , From the shells and coral deep ; From the rock-ribbed shore , Where the sad waves pour All their deep anthems loud and deep ; From the forest aisles , Where the sunbeam smiles , And with flowers the sod is dressed ; From the shadowy vale In the twilight pale , When the sun has gone to rest ; From the clouds that sweep Through the azure deep , In their gold and crimson light ; From the starry eyes Of the summer skies , That will shine because ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up to Nature 's God , " Has the unseen power been given ; Till it led my soul Through the mighty whole , To the gates of yon bright Heaven ! With each human mind There 's a cord entwined , And a hidden , unseen law ; That have given the power , In each passing hour , From its wealth and strength to draw . From the Angel band In the summer land , Where the loved ones ever go , There 's a wealth of thought By the spirit caught , When their inspirations flow . There 's an inner shrine That is more divine Than a mortal eye can see ; And in all that lives , There 's a soul that gives Of its best gifts unto me . When I 'm most alone With this deep unknown , Then the strongest is its power ; When my thoughts are pure , Then I know ' t is sure O'er my soul its best to shower . In the busy strife Of this careless life , From my soul it hides away ; But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my spirit bends to pray . From my own deep soul Do the anthems roll , Till they mingle with the rest ; Oh , many a mind Has the power to find , For their heart , this welcome guest . And my fervent prayer , Is this robe to wear , Wherever I press the sod ; Then to bear it back , In my homeward track , Unstained , to the giver , God ! She pauses enrapt , leaving the audience in breathless silence . Gentleman , Gentleman rising . I rise to say that I believe no power Had framed that song until this present hour . My doubts on that point now are set at rest  --  I think the owner of such gift is blest . Resumes his seat . Improvisatrice , Improvisatrice Leaving her harp and stepping forward , gives immediately the following , in recitation . Ay , blest ! my soul is richly blest this hour , That even one heart sees and knows this power , And deems me truthful as I stand to-night , And worthy of this golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this ; It could not bring my soul a greater bliss . And as I see the eyes that look on mine , And know behind them lies a soul divine , That yearns forever of God 's truth to know , And fain would learn from whence all thought must flow , I could not stoop to give my soul to sin , A thought of homage from this crowd to win . I see some faces here whose thoughts I trace , That think a public hall is not my place Because a woman ; others who would blame And cast reproach unkindly on my name ; Others who know not what to think the while , But half between their praise and blame , they smile ; And others still , who fear what some may think , Though to their lips the cup they dare not drink . But more than all the rest , through eyes , the heart Of many kindly look upon this art . To such my soul goes out in earnest speech , Those hearts I know my words will soonest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth be given ; On motives true , I stake my hopes of heaven .  --  What shall I speak to thee , my friends , this hour ? Voice in the Audience . Voice Explain , as far as possible , thy power ! Improvisatrice . Improvisatrice That will I gladly do . And yet no word Can speak the power with which my soul is stirred . For years I prayed for speech to tell the thought That burned within my soul , with beauty fraught ; And though it thrilled my being with a spell , I could not speak it , had no power to tell . But in an hour when all was hushed and still , My soul woke up with strange and sudden thrill ; It seemed , the voice of every greenwood tree , And rill , and star , and wave , conversed with me . And Nature stood revealed before me then , In grandeur that I can not lose again . I caught new inspiration from the sod , And in its voice I heard the voice of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , More beautiful than Earth , like Angels fair ; That all through nature , voices called my name , And these , my latent powers , obedient came , Touched , quickened by the spirit of the night , And beautified by angels of pure light . Something within me sudden rose and spoke ,  --  The light of new creation o'er me broke ; And since that day my powers leap up at will , And burn and quicken , all my being thrill . And when I stand before thee as to-night , And round me falls a mantle of delight , And through my mind there comes a power divine , As though superior minds were blent with mine ; Until to all its depths my soul is stirred , And must find utterance in its song or word . When song , the soul of Music comes to me , Until each key is tuned to harmony ; Then like a prisoned bird it bursts away , And with my song , I soar where all is day . Yet my poor speech is faint and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be shared By others , better fitted for the power That over me I feel bright Angels shower , And spirits of the beautiful and free , Through earth and heaven , that give in love to me . This does but herald brighter things to come , Before whose beauty shall the earth sit dumb . Voice in the Audience . Voice Dost think departed spirits give thee power ? Improvisatrice . Improvisatrice I do . With Nature 's voice that speaks through all , With my own powers that in me ever call , I do believe to me by God are given , Strength , power and beauty , through the saints in Heaven ! Excitement in the audience . Voice . Voice Thou dost blaspheme ! ' T is infidel , such thought ! Improvisatrice . Improvisatrice Then am I infidel ! For I have sought , E'en from a child , to win from Heaven a voice : And now I 've heard , my friends , with me rejoice ! And learn that all at last may see and know Heaven 's brighter joys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two worlds far apart : The loved shall meet !  --  Oh ! thank Him from thy heart ! Indications of disturbance in the audience . Improvisatrice , turning to her harp and lifting her eyes to heaven , chants with beseeching pathos and look of deep devotion , this Invocation . Sweet darling of the mother 's heart ! Look forth from out thy Heaven , And tell her with thy starry eyes Thy presence still is given . Look forth ! and tell her God is great  --  That He has opened Heaven 's gate ! Fair maiden ! fading in thy spring , Laid darkly in the tomb , Beam like a star from thy bright home , Or flower in summer bloom . Beam out ! and say that God is great , That He has opened Heaven 's gate ! Loved mother ! passing into night To leave thy darkened hearth ,  --  A shadow resting in thy place , For those thou left on earth ,  --  Look down ! and say that God is great , That thou dost wait at Heaven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To one who loved thee well , Who keeps thee treasured in his heart , Still binding with a spell , Burst forth ! and teach that God is great ! And pass to him through Heaven 's gate ! A hush in the audience ; many in tears . Improvisatrice , Improvisatrice reciting . God 's truth has ever been unknown to earth , Because in way expected not its birth ; And gazing eyes , while looking for its light , Have seen it pass , and called it cloud of night . For this the true of earth have been defamed , Their teachings false and infidel proclaimed , While Error wears a robe of rainbow dyes , And men exalt her proudly to the skies .  --  But sometime Right shall take the place of Might , And sometime day be ushered in from night . Great Nature 's laws men do not understand , They break them wilful , trespass with high hand , Or through strange ignorance sink deep within The dismal gulf , the noisome cell of sin . And when a voice says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks , and thou art in the wrong , " Because ' t is something new , they have not known , They answer with a sneering , scoffing tone .  --  But sometime Right shall take the place of Might , And sometime day be ushered in from night . The soul that wins one gleam of light from heaven , Can bear the sneers that men have ever given , Can look unmoved upon a scornful face , Can list a scoffing tone with angel 's grace . For in the soul a presence half divine , Keeps ever feeding at the inner shrine The light that burns with truth 's immortal flame ;  --  All earth can never put that soul to shame . And sometime Right shall take the place of Might , And sometime day be ushered in from night . So calm , unmoved , I stand , with waves of joy Still sweeping through my soul : none can destroy The angel Peace that sits with radiant wings Within my soul , and ever sweetly sings . No hand but mine can break the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrines to dwell . Oh human hearts ! Oh eyes now turned on mine ! Hast won her yet ? If not , oh , seek her shrine ! And then God 's Right shall take the place of Might , And then God 's Day be ushered in from Night . Man , Man rising in the audience . I am not satisfied with that one test ! The subject was familiar . Well her best She might do with such theme . I give a new , And if she treats that just as well and true , Then may we well believe she has some power .  --  I offer this , to test her gift this hour : The Life of Perseus  --  his exploits and skill : Now let her answer , if she can and will ! The Improvisatrice Improvisatrice lifts her eyes , and in a moment , a strange , beautiful expression comes over her countenance , and her eyes kindled as if the gods themselves came to her aid ; then raising her arm majestically , she commenced the recitation . Perseus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sire , To Danae came in golden shower of fire , From his Olympus ;  --  Danae captive there , In brazen tower , and wild in her despair , Beneath her cruel father 's iron rod . Ah , wonder not she turned to meet the god , And gave him love for love . Her heart was riven : He lit her midnight with the hues of heaven . Beside his face all else was faint and dim , And she forgot the world , herself , in him . Thus Perseus was the offspring of their love ; Though half a mortal , yet he caught from Jove Olympian fire , the lightning of the sky , The power that carved heroic destiny . Yet when Acrisios , his mother 's sire , Knew of the child , it roused his utmost ire ; For he had shut her from the world away , Because the oracle had dared to say That by his grandson 's hand should come his death , Determined in his day none should have breath To thwart his fate . But Destiny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned , Burst every band that mortal power could place , And gave him one that bore a god 's true grace . With angry heart he sent them out to sea , When all its waves were sweeping angrily , In bark so frail he knew it would be driven Upon the rocks , and their cold forms be given To Neptune 's caves , no more to visit earth ;  --  Destroying thus the danger of his birth . And ere an hour was past , their bark was tossed , And rent , and wrecked , and they had both been lost ; But when the Goddess of the Sea beheld Their forms , her heart with pity swelled . She sent the winds to rest within their caves , And Neptune for her sake hushed all the waves . She placed them tenderly in Ocean 's arms , Who bore them gladly far from reach of harms , To that calm haven in the gean Sea , Where Seriphos ' fair island laughed with glee To see the boy-god with his mother come , Safe from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured when the voyage was o'er , That they must turn and leave them on the shore , Alone and desolate , and drenched and cold ; So twined the sea-weed in full many a fold And chain , about each pure , white form , To shield them from the coming , angry storm ; And decked with shining pearl and coral shell Their sandy bed , until protecting spell , And strange rich beauty all around them spread ; Then placed their richest gems upon their head . And as the sea , impatient at their stay , Called after them , could brook no more delay , Turned toward their home , yet sent their mournful tone Through all the isle , " Ah , leave them not alone ! " Good Dictys heard , and left his nets to dry , And on them cast a kind and pitying eye , And took them from their cold but gorgeous bed ,  --  While many a tear o'er their sad fate he shed ,  --  And bore them to the King , who saw the child So beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed on , young Perseus grew in power , And genius , prowess , till the fated hour He came the King remembered with regret , Grown jealous now ; besides , he wished to get His mother , Danae 's love , hard to be won ; Yet most he feared the anger of her son . So made a feast , requiring those who came , In honor to his royalty and fame , To each present him with a horse of power ,  --  Impossible with Perseus that hour . Who , most unwilling to be ' neath the best , Thus Polydectes in his power addressed : " O King ! I can not bring the gift required ; Yet will I give what most thou hast desired  --  Medusa 's head . I know full well , O King , It is to thee a welcome offering ! " The King most readily gave glad consent , Because he knew if on such errand bent , He must be slain . So bade him quickly go , And though his mother 's tears in torrents flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears , With hopes of sure success assuaged her fears , Then quick made ready for his bloody part ,  --  The gods assisting with their wondrous art . They knew his innocence , and lent their power To give protection in that dreadful hour ; For gods love most  --  ' t is said of old  --  To help the strong of heart , the pure and bold . Old Pluto came from his dominions dread , And placed a helmet on his fair young head , Which had the power to shield him from all eyes , And Mercury gave him wings to thread the skies , A dagger made of diamonds , sharp as bright , To catch but not reflect the morning light ; While wise Minerva whom the cowards fear , ( To whom the enterprise was doubly dear , Because Modusa , with the ocean-god , Her sanctuary had unbidden trod ) , Gave up her buckler to the hero brave , That with its mirrored depths would wholly save . And in her care he traversed air and sky , Until he came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wisdom , then Her courage , valor , for the bravest men , With but one look , by some deep power unknown , The monster Gorgons could convert to stone . He found them sleeping  --  the strange sisters three  --  And knew this hour must speak his destiny . He dared not look upon them as they slept , For through their curling hair the serpents crept , That never closed their eyes ; at each slight sound Their awful hisses through the caves resound , That all the silence in strange terror breaks , And into consciousness the sleeper wakes . But with a firm , and still a dauntless heart , He falters not until achieved his part ; And on the shield his eyes he 's but to place , To see it there  --  each monster 's awful face . Though frightful ,  --  e'en its image brings a chill ,  --  He will not let it bend his iron will ; But without fear , without one thought of dread , He severs instantly Medusa 's head . Then woke the sisters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried , " What hand has wrought for us such utter woe ? From our dominion he shall never go , But stand a statue , desolate and lone , One look this moment shall transform to stone ! " The serpents hissed in concert with her word , Until each hair with serpent life was stirred ; The caverns echoed to their heart-felt groans , And sent them back in dismal , pitying tones , Until Minerva pitied so their pain , She made a flute to catch the mournful strain , And give it back ; that all the world might know In what sad strains the deepest grief can flow . Then Euryale , Stheino , sudden sprung ( While writhing serpents round their faces clung ) To find their foe , and with one look of hate , And vengeance dire , forever seal his fate . But Pluto 's helmet hid him from their view , With Mercury 's wings swift through the air he flew . Safe , safe from harm , and with him bore his prize  --  Like meteor flashing through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaping vein , The life-blood flowed as flows the summer rain ; And where it touched the soil a serpent sprung , And round the sands of Lybia 's deserts clung , To perish not ; but through all coming time , To fill with poisonous breath the sandy clime . Still on he swept , till , weary of his flight , Amid the shadows of approaching night , He passed King Atlas ' palace where he craved His hospitality , for he had braved Great perils , and his spirit needed rest . The King refused to welcome such a guest , Because he claimed himself a son of Jove , And oracles had said that one would prove His foe , and rob him of his wealth and power ; So gave nor food , nor rest , nor home , that hour . And even sought to kill , until at length , When Perseus saw his foe had greatest strength , He held Medusa 's head before his eyes : One look !  --  then speech , expression , action , dies , And monster-like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Afric 's lands . Yes , stands there yet ,  --  the mount still bears his name ,  --  A monument to cast intensest shame On those who turn the sons of God away , And scorn and fear His truths the present day . When morning came with bright and golden ray , Young Perseus took again his homeward way O'er Lybia 's plains , until he neared the coast Of Ethiopia , and he felt the boast Of such exploit would Polydectes win , To take him back to favor once again . When lo ! there met his eye a thrilling sight That froze his veins with horror and affright : A maiden , beautiful as morn 's first beam , Ay , fairer than a poet 's wildest dream , Stood , with the sunlight on her suffering face , The very image of the purest grace , Yet chained , chained to a rock , and from the sea  --  While both her parents stood in misery , Her mother , wringing in her wild despair Her snowy hands , and pouring on the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  A monster rose , and cleft the foaming wave With his dread power , as he approached in wrath , While breakers roared around his fearful path . Just ready now to seize , devour his prey , When , swift as sunbeam from the realms of day , Down swept the hero . With one deadly blow He laid the monster in his heart 's blood low ; Then turned with tender hand and tone , And rent the chains from her , the fair unknown , And raised her fainting from the damp , cold earth , While love from pity kindled into birth . And when her parents knelt in fervent prayer , And blessed him , rising from their dark despair , Then , as the maiden silent by him stood , Robed in the mantle of her gratitude , That found no utterance save in blissful tears ,  --  Each one that fell to him yet more endears ,  --  Unable longer to conceal his love , His eager thoughts that still to her would rove , He spoke : " I love this maiden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life betide ; I 'd guard her in my heart by night or day , Within my home in regions far away . Let not my heart 's best boon be now denied ; Say but these words , ' That she shall be my bride . ' " Then answered Cepheus , " It is better so , That with her brave deliverer she should go From danger threatening , lest she yet be slain ; That were indeed to us far deeper pain . " Then Perseus said , " Whence came this cause of grief , From which , by chance , my hand has brought relief ? " " I caused it , I , " said Cassiopeia then ; " For vainly boasting once and then again , That she was fairer in her beauty 's light , Than were old Nereus ' daughters , though so bright . There came vile in their fear and dread , Consulted oracles that sternly said , The plagues should haunt us , ever linger by , Until this death Andromeda should die . The angry god had chained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror such a shock ; But thou hast come and dashed this bitter cup From her dear lips ; we cheerful give her up . " Then Perseus bent his eye upon the maid , And with love 's own rich tone he softly said , " Wilt go with me ? thou art my destiny . " She only lifted up her tear-dimmed eye To meet his own , then drop beneath its glow : No need of words , the look best said , " I go . " " My brother Phineus has sought to wed Andromeda , " then Cepheus quickly said ; " He might assail thy life , and thou be slain , So brave and good , my daughter chained again ! " " Ah , never fear , " said Perseus boldly then , " I have a power that triumphs o'er all men  --  Medusa 's head ; one look transforms to stone ; And when I wed thy daughter , if there 's one That dares assail , I have but this to show , And worse than slain he lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may'st tell thy friends to shun The dreadful sight ; its work is surely done . " Yet at the wedding feast the brother came , From Perseus ' hands his promised bride to claim , And with his friends attacked the bridegroom there , Who made a sign , then showed Medusa fair , And each a statue turned , and kept his place , With awful look of horror on his face , To gaze on vacancy , cold , still , alone , While Perseus claimed and bore away his own . Arrived at Seriphos , how Danae met Her hero-son ! all passed her wild regret ; For fame had wreathed her laurels round his brow , So nobly was fulfilled his earnest vow . And with him came , fair as the morning star That sends its beams from some bright world afar , His cherished bride ; her life seemed bright once more , And in her heart she said , " My griefs are o'er . " But Polydectes , still more jealous grown Of Perseus ' power , because so widely known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though with the deepest pain his bosom swelled ) To show Medusa 's head , and with its shock Old Polydectes then became a rock . And Dictys , who had saved them at the first , And Danae after , from a fate accurst , Was placed upon his throne by Perseus ' power , And all three turned and blessed him in that hour . Then turning from his labors to find rest , He drew his bride still closer to his breast , Gave back his wings to Mercury again , His helmet sent to Pluto 's world of pain ; Then to Minerva for the power she shed , Upon her gis placed the Gorgon 's head . And in the bliss he found within his home , Resolved no more from its loved shrine to roam . But soon Acrisios from off his throne Was hurled , whose brother claimed it as his own ; And with true magnanimity of heart , Brave Perseus chose to act a noble part : ( For though in childhood cast upon the wave To perish , vengeance lives not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he threw His power against foul Proetus ,  --  him he slew ; And gave Acrisios again his crown , His throne , from whence he 'd cast the tyrant down . Until the king , his grandsire , wept for shame , And even more , that Perseus would not blame ; With joy and gratitude acknowledged then His Danae 's son with pride before all men . Fain would we let the hero rest ; but now The Fates must be fulfilled ; they break no vow . So when one day performing some great feat Of wondrous skill ( with him none could compete ) , The king , with admiration of his power , Beguiled in happiness the passing hour ; As if some evil demon aimed the blow , Some Fury prompted where the quoit should go , It struck Acrisios upon his head ; At Perseus ' feet he fell , alas ! was dead ; That thus the oracle in truth might stand , " That he should die by his own grandson 's hand . " In vain was Perseus ' grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to life again ; And mourning o'er his grandsire 's tragic end , Could hardly bear another hour to spend At Argos ; hoping sooner to forget The thought that filled his soul with such regret , The deed to his true heart so half like guilt , The city of Mycen then he built ; And ceased from mingling more in scenes of strife , But with Andromeda he spent his life . And from their sons came Hercules ; for fate Designed that e'en his offspring should be great . And even in his death he could not die ; For those who loved him placed him in the sky , With famed Medusa 's head still in his hand , And close beside him there his household band , As constellations bright , with shining star To beam for wandering feet from homes afar : King Cepheus with his sceptre stretched in air , And Cassiopeia with her golden chair , Andromeda still chained , while Perseus nigh , Seems hastening to her rescue through the sky . And though ' t is but a myth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , Yet under all its symbols , strange , absurd , There runs through every allegoric word A vein of truth , a beauty and a thought , To bless the world when once that truth is caught . He sprung through force combined of earth and heaven , A mortal 's heart , a God 's true valor given . Thus one true mind that 's caught from heaven its fire , Can therefore to its greatest powers aspire , May thus win helmet , shield , and even wings , And smite that Gorgon where each serpent clings ; Though Error is its modern name , one blow From such an arm shall lay it sudden low . It is because to few such power is given , To few that Zeus comes down in fire from heaven , That still Medusa lives , defies our power , And can transform to worse than stone , this hour . For his great valor passed he to the sky ; The ancients could not bear to see him die ; And as mid-heaven he holds Medusa 's head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid in its richest grace , While gleams a nebula to light his face ; And eight beside , the constellation bears ,  --  Terrestial light of heaven , at least , he shares . So shall the soul pass into yonder sky , That labors for the growth of purity , With angels of his household , gleaming bright , To share with him its stars , its power , its light ; To live forever , shining like the star On earth 's dark night , from its pure world afar ;  --  Celestial light to gild its pathway now , And its own deeds a halo round the brow . Old heroes , martyrs , saints , can never die : Not always visible to naked eye , Yet not the less the constellations burn , Though mortal eyes to see them may not turn . If souls could find a telescopic power . They 'd see them gleam through heaven this very hour . But Herschels of the present day men hate , Because they 've power to see when bid to wait ; And if their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's celestial sphere , And name it Truth , and number with the rest , And feel themselves in this new knowledge blest , The rest refuse to look , and call it vain , And bid them act Galilco again . But like the constellations , when the clouds Have wrapped them in their darkest midnight shrouds , They gleam as brightly on the other side , And gild those clouds that their best power defied . So truth shall gild old error 's clouds of night , Disperse her mists and shades with golden light ; And known at last shall be God 's great unknown , And man unshamed shall claim it as his own . The truths of God I 've found , till then I 'll speak , Though small my power , and though , alas ! so weak ; And like the dew upon earth 's flowers I 'll lie , Till God 's great sun exhales me to the sky . She ceased speaking , while her whole attitude and expression were an embodiment of her last words ; and as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her float-exhaled in a mist from their sight . Then suddenly turning to her harp , she softly touched its strings and sang . Sweet Peace ! descend with noiseless wing , And seek each human breast , And through the night in sweetness sing , And soothe to quiet rest ! Smooth every aching brow of pain , Till busy thought shall sleep , Till morning light shall come again , Keep thou thy vigil , keep ! Good-night , O eyes that look on mine ! Hope 's golden dreams for thee : May morning 's hour bring joy to thine , As daybreak to the sea . Good-night ! My soul pours out its prayer , That Heaven 's eternal light May be the mantle thou shalt wear , Good-night , good-night , good-night ! As the last notes of the song died away , the Improvisatrice glided through the door of the ante-room and disappeared . The audience , after a moment 's breathless silence , rise to leave the hall . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Ida ! in tears ? I can not blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words beguiled . I quite forgot myself in her strange power , And thought Jove came again in shower of fire Bruce . Henry Bruce The words , " delightful , " " wonderful , " I hear ; They 've half forgot she stepped from woman 's sphere ; The magic of her words is on them now , To-morrow , with a thoughtful , captious brow , They 'll find excuses for this glow of light , And some , no doubt , can do it here to-night . Hark ! there 's our friend the Pharisee once more . Let 's see what came to him from out this store ! Clergyman . Clergyman I did believe this all a sham ! She might , Perhaps , have said each word she did to-night , Without much effort ,  --  needed slight enough ; I never heard from lips more trashy stuff ,  --  Except the last . Unless he hit a theme She 'd given out , it truly would not seem She could compose so readily each part , Because , besides her skill in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And facts , and skill that no one ever claims . And I 've no longer doubt she gets her power From the Arch-Fiend ; he knows how best to shower His gifts , to lure , entrap , and to beguile The hearts of men with all that 's vile , In guise of truth and virtue , as to-night ,  --  When once they 're chained , he 'll burst to sight . I 've heard enough . There are no words too strong , With which to warn my people of this wrong . It must be stopped ! She 'll make to vice a slave Faster than I the souls of men can save ! Middle-Aged Gentleman . Gentleman Why so ? With all the fiends , it seems to me She ought to be less strong than God in thee ! Clergyman . Clergyman True , true , but God sometimes permits such things : And men hear best if but a siren sings . Stranger . Stranger Well , let them sing ! for such Circe as that , I must confess , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious , even in the least , That I the more bear likeness of the beast . I think this modern Circe 'll hardly charm One human heart to aught that can be harm . I never had my thoughts so raised to heaven , Or such divine and noble impulse given , To higher life or purer trust in God . Stranger Lady , Stranger Lady passing Mr. Seymour 's group . I thought her dress looked really very odd ! Too plain . I think her taste is bad to wear No ornaments , and plainly dress her hair . She must be low ,  --  so very little style ! And then her collar , who could help but smile ? Gentleman . Gentleman Now I admired her dress ,  --  so little show ; But I forgot it all in that strange glow That lit her features when she turned to sing . To-morrow night , Louisa I shall bring ! Lady .

Ida Seymour How can the world speak coldly of a voice That bids the mourner 's heart like hers , rejoice ; And with a look more light , condemn as naught What seems to me must be from heaven caught ? Cold words and vain , grate harshly on my ear , Just tuned to sounds from some far purer sphere . Like the last speaker , how I wish to see And hear her talk ! Now , father , ca n't it be ? It might be done with ease , through Mr. Bell , Her friend , I 'm sure , because you know him well . I should not dare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converse were joy again . Mr. Seymour .

Mrs. Seymour I can not tell when all my soul has stirred , As here to-night , with every thrilling word . I wish to see her , too . The world may frown ; Thou knowest I 'm not afraid of " Mrs. Brown ! " Bruce , Henry Bruce as they pass from the hall to the street . How sweetly , purely , shines the moon to-night , While over all like mantle falls her light ! It seems like fairy-scene ; and such a hush And stillness , after all this noisy rush Of feet , I feel transported to a scene Like that whence came the gift of this Song-Queen . How can the hearts , so full of lofty pride , And vain conceits , that all her powers deride , Step forth into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn all swept away ! Yet , if God 's truth appeals to them in vain , The sunlight of the spheres , that shines so plain , The fairy moonbeam with its gentler art , Can have no power to find their darkened heart . See , Ida , how that star attends the moon ! So thou art following in her steps so soon , To brighten still upon the brow of night , And pour like her o'er other hearts thy light . SCENE IV . Evening . Mr. Seymour 's back parlor . Bruce and Ida seated on a sofa , reading from a manuscript . Bruce , Henry Bruce laying down the manuscript . ' T is but a year since first I knew thy power , Just then in bud , and now it blooms a flower In this thy work . I 'm proud to know it thine ; For in it thoughts of real beauty shine .

Ida Seymour I know ; but I have wished my work to hide From even them , until my best I 've tried , And something worthy their approval given ; And I have earnestly and hourly striven , Because in this , as other things , my heart Yearns in their sympathy to have its part . Oh , I have worked so long to win their smile , Still hoping , trusting , waiting all the while , And now I 'll leave thy judgment to decide If this has aught to give a moment 's pride . The little good that seemed within its leaves , Has vanished , thinking how the world receives All but the best the poet ever gives , And then sometimes approves not while he lives . Besides , Miss Raymond 's last , you know , has wrung Praise even from the lips of those who clung To that strange wish to do her talents wrong ;  --  She triumphs now ; she has not waited long . How can my glowworm 's spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one mind ? Bruce . Henry Bruce Her work is very fine . And , by the way , I wish to read ( I think I heard thee say Thou hadst not read the whole ) the sweetest thing I yet have known her write or speak or sing . But not till thou hast promised I may show This to thy parents . ' T is their time to know . Ida . Ida Seymour Well , as thou wilt ! If fitting that I should , I humbly hope they 'll find within it good ! Enter Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Wrapped-up in musty manuscripts , I see ! They 're hieroglyphics , I suppose , to me . Bruce . Henry Bruce At least , they may not always thus remain , Although long time in mystery they 've lain . Mr. Seymour .

Ida , I think ' t is time thou hadst begun To try thy skill  --  why hast thou never done ? A year ago , Miss Raymond had such power , I thought she would transform thee in an hour ; And now here comes another half as bright , And yet thy muse still lingers out of sight . Bruce . Henry Bruce Please read the poem ! That perhaps may wake Her sleeping powers , and this long silence break . Mr. Seymour , Mr. Seymour smiling . I will indeed ; for who of us can tell , With my good reading , what might be its spell ? Reads . COME AGAIN . BY CORE LEE . The billows moan upon the shore , In never-ending pain , They sigh and weep forevermore , " Come again , come again .

" A mourner stands on Life 's bleak shore , Calling in vain , in vain , Upon the loved ones gone before , " Come again , come again . " Time 's billows beat upon the coast Where she must still remain , With sullen murmur , tempest tost , " They will not come again . " The summers come , the summers go , With her the same sad strain , While with Time 's waves her tear-drops flow ,  --  " Come again , come again .

Henry Bruce If thou wilt promise to forgive this sprite , I 'll tell thee now that Ida did indite These poems ; but disguising her own name Through fears . Now do not therefore blame . She wished for something worthy of her pen , And waited for thy sympathy till then . Mr. and Mrs. Seymour , Mr. Seymour , Mrs. Seymour in one breath . Does Ida write these poems that we love ? Bruce . Henry Bruce Her burning , tearful face I think will prove . Mr. and Mrs. Seymour , Mr. Seymour , Mrs. Seymour embracing her . My child , my child , how couldst thou thus deceive ? Ida . Ida Seymour Oh , my dear parents ! hear me and believe , ' T was but because I could not bear to tell One thought , until I came to do it well ; Though I have pined for one approving word , Which in disguise sometimes I 've gladly heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry has the want of taste to say , He thinks is good , and so I let him speak . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour This gives me much of joy . Perhaps I 'm weak , But I have always yearned to see this child , On which our warmest love has ever smiled , Pursue a useful life , with cultured mind :  --  In this beginning much of hope I find . But what is this just finished  --  let me know ? No more refuse , my child , thy works to show . Ida . Ida Seymour Oh , no indeed ! It pays for all my sighs , And fears , that ' t is to thee such glad surprise . Bruce . Henry Bruce Here is the manuscript . I think it ought , Before the world , with her own name be brought . I 'll read some parts , then for thyself thou'lt see , If this , thy daughter , speaks of hope to thee . Reads several lengthy extracts . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour I 'm not ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  it gives me joy to-night . Draws her to him affectionately . Thou naughty girl ! to keep this all from me . I shall suspect some other mystery , If this 's the way thy confidence is kept ; I wonder how I could so long have slept . Mrs. Seymour . Mrs. Seymour How could we think ? for Ida 's heart and eyes Were always clear to us as summer skies . Ida . Ida Seymour Forgive me this ! I promise ne'er again , In any mystery long to remain Mrs. Seymour . Mrs. Seymour But I 'm not ready yet to meet our guest ; I must make haste .  --  My darling , be thou blest ! Retires . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour But Ida , tell me when thou first began , And how , to carry out this secret plan ? Ida . Ida Seymour Two years ago , I first began to write , But no one knew the fact , until the night That Henry heard Miss Raymond sing at first  --  The thought of her great powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw ' t was vain ( For some way , all unknown , he caught the strain , ) To play concealment , and he promised then To aid me in the efforts with my pen . And well and truly has he kept his word , I owe him much , for each has been referred To his good taste and judgment , ere I gave The little waif to float upon the wave . And then Miss Raymond has been such a friend , So always ready every aid to lend , To make suggestions , criticise with care , And praise my best  --  when I would half despair  --  Without a jealous thought . It seems her aim , To make me worthy as herself , of fame ; So unlike many , who , with envious eye , Can bear to see no other soaring high . She kept my secret faithfully the while , Though she would sometimes shake her head and smile , And scold me for my foolish dread and fear , But she shall know to-night ;  --  she 'll soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she had a noble mind  --  Such lofty souls we do not often find ; But now I prize her higher still . She 's done What few would do for thee , my darling one ! And I will tell her how my heart is stirred By acts of hers , that through thy lips I 've heard . On this , my child , thou surely canst depend , That while I live , she never wants a friend ! Relapses into thought . Bruce . Henry Bruce There 's still an hour before she comes . Not late . Let 's read her poem  --  why not  --  while we wait ? Ida . Ida Seymour Yes , I remember thou wert now to read ; There 's very little urging that I need . They pass to the library . Ah , here 's the book ! I never shall forget The first she wrote , or how her face I met . It seems my soul from hers caught sudden fire , And strength that would attain my long desire . And then her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hardly think I 've right to claim Much merit for my works , should any live , So much I caught the light each mind could give . Bruce . Henry Bruce Why , every mind has deepest inspiration given , When it approaches something nearest heaven . And such a mind as hers is like the sun , That sheds its rays  --  though swift its course may run  --  To fall on others ; they to catch the light , As earth absorbs the sun 's , and leaves her night . And should the earth the radiant sunbeams spurn , While still for light and power it ever yearns , And say , " I dare not of another take , For all my light within me must awake ? " Ah no ! for God designed that sun to earth Should send its beams , before the flowers have birth . So mind with mind must meet and deeply blend , Each unto each its inspiration lend , Before the strongest powers to life awake , And through the soul the beams of morning break . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some richer truths came forth to meet thy sight , She has fulfilled her mission unto thee , And thou thine own ; and as for aught in me That could inspire thy soul , would it were so ; It were such happiness that thought to know . But I am prosy . Let me read thee here What gives my soul such mingled hope and fear . Bruce , Henry Bruce reading . And yet there was one true and noble soul , To whom she seemed for all his life the goal ,  --  One who had gazed upon her from afar , As unapproachable as summer star In its own azure ; glowing with delight , And shining for itself , and not his night . Too fair a flower for his strong hand to take , Too soft a harp for his rude touch to wake . Bruce continues to read a lengthy extract from the book , descriptive of the progress of this attachment , that reveals points of resemblance to his own for Ida , and which , after many doubts in the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this little artifice , he delicately prepares the way for a declaration of his love to Ida Footnote : 1Kb Bruce , Henry Bruce dropping the book . Oh Ida ! could I ever win from thine , Thine eyes or lips , such answering love to mine , Then would my only wish on earth be given , I would not ask for more this side of heaven . Oh , I have loved thee long ,  --  so very long , With love , true , earnest , thrilling , deep as strong ! Nay , turn not from me those dear eyes away ,  --  I could not live without their cheering ray . And this dear hand , oh , let it rest in mine One moment , darling , with its touch divine !

Henry Bruce First , Ida , tell me that thy heart does love Enough to give me time my own to prove ! First tell me , darling , that thou wilt be mine ,  --  Mine ever , as I must be wholly thine !

But then , I 'm not a man , And so am weak ; yet sometimes one turns friend , And then upon their strength I can depend ; And so I work . Now I 've conspiracy Well laid , to get a little help from thee . Bruce . Henry Bruce Well , name thy wish ! I know but to obey ! A woman first or last will have her way . Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford street , To open some good place , where all may meet Of those poor creatures who are sunk in sin , And see if something can not tempt them in , To hear such words as haply may unbind The chains from here and there a suffering mind , And win them back once more to light and truth , And to the better feelings of their youth . I want to get some good and noble souls , Whose every heart-chord charity controls , To meet and talk to them of all that 's right And noble in the spirit 's truest sight ; And I will go and improvise in song , And speak to them of all their sin and wrong , And give such words as come to me each hour . May not there be a hidden , latent power , A gift spontaneous like my own might wake , And burst the chains no other hand can break ? So much of real pity might be given , ' T would tempt some feet to turn again to heaven . To save but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue or pen ; For that will pass away in coming hour , But such freed souls shall ever grow in power , Still brighter through the years , and still more free , A light for others through eternity . Besides my duties , writing , speaking , all , I could meet once a week . If I could call A dozen good and noble souls like thine , To help in such a work , ' t would be divine . Bruce . Henry Bruce I like it much ; and I for one will do All in my power to help this purpose through . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour And I ! I think it worthy of a saint , To win such souls , and hush their sad complaint ! Ida . Ida Seymour There 's naught that I can do , except to go And cheer thee with my eyes , when there shall flow The words I know full well to them will come , To wake the memory of their childhood home . Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond I 'm truly glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind of Mr. Bell , And several others . We shall soon begin This work , and do our best to try to win . We can but fail . But then we 'll try again ; The noble only seems to fail with men . God takes it up , and bears it onward still ; We can not fail when we but do his will . But who of us shall ever dare expect To do great good , beginning with effect , When with the men of wealth , of power , and fame , And even civil power , oft lies the blame ? Night after night , in halls where gathering meet To hear me now , the fashion , the elite , I see such brows that wear the mark of Cain , So many a soul that can not hide its stain From eyes intuitive ; that through the day , At God 's or Mammon 's altar kneel to pray ; Yet , worse than bandit , at the midnight hour , Rob virtue , innocence , of all its power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And worship God as ardent as before . ' T is terrible to see the tempted fall , While God 's own angels all unheard may call ; Their hours of suffering must be sharp and stern ;  --  " The way of the transgressor 's hard , " they learn . But there 's no law with such avenging power To grasp their souls , as his , who , in that hour Has been the tempter to their sin and woe ,  --  There is a Law that will not let him go . He may escape the justice of the earth , And men mistake his real guilt for worth ; Or through his wealth , or power , position , name , May cast on others , and escape each blame ; Yet God has laws that none may e'er describe , And judges that no man or gold may bribe , Police who 're ever watchful on their round , Who see each act , and catch the slightest sound , That never let the culprit ' scape his fate , But hold to recompense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doom . It matters not Though thunderbolts may blast not on the spot , Stern Justice binds him with an unseen spell , And kindles in his heart the flames of hell ; And though he bears the sway in others ' room , There comes an hour when he must meet his doom . I sometimes feel such bitterness to those Who work for innocence such utter woes , I can not bear to see them honored stand , But almost pray for God 's avenging hand To smite them from the earth , no more to be Arch-fiends , with skill betraying purity . Then comes the thought , I need not lift the rod ; They 'll not escape the vigilance of God . Such hearts I also seek to reach ; for then , Then only , when we have pure-minded men , Shall woman shine like stars amid the heaven . Must she stand strong , with all these tempters given ? Ah , well , we work not always as we would ! At disadvantage must we do our good , And but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest sins we hardly touch . I should despair , only I know the drop Of rain , will not for some great deluge stop , But takes its place , perhaps in some flower 's heart , And is content to do its little part , Instead of looking o'er the parching earth , To say , How great the need ! I 'm little worth ! Let me refresh one flower , and not in vain I live my hour ;  --  I shall take heart again ! Bruce . Henry Bruce Friends , we have dwelt upon this saddening sight , Until from every face is gone the light ! Now let us bring it back , and keep it there , To be the sunshine , still , for every care , All ready to be poured o'er others ' woe , As healing balm wherever we may go . Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond That 's true philosophy ! If we would give To others sunshine , in it we must live . Now , Ida , sing us something that shall bring A blessing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Bruce Yes , Ida , sing that little song of thine , That Page set to his music so divine ! Ida . Ida Seymour Well , I will try to cast my little light ;  --  We ca n't expect to hear from thee to-night ? Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond Ah , no . To-night I take as time for rest , And in this little group I feel so blest . Now sing my soul to some bright , fairy dream , Until I hear my native mountain stream . Ida Ida Seymour seats herself at the piano . Bruce follows to turn the leaves . She sings . Shine on me like a star from Heaven , That trembles with delight , Where on life 's sea my bark is driven , Till I forget ' t is night . Shine on me , till thy tender beam Fills all my soul like fairy dream ! Shine on my soul ! ' t is dark and dread . I find but midnight here , Save in thy beams that round me shed A glory calm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has made my midnight bright as day ! Shine , worshipped idol of my soul ! Oh , give me love of thine ! And waves of joy shall wake and roll Through this lone heart of mine . Shine , where no soul has shone but thee , And be my type of Deity ! Bruce , Henry Bruce in an undertone , bending over as if arranging the music . How thrills my soul to all that song to-night , And trembles to its depths with sweet delight ! Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond How sweet the words ! The music is divine ! For Page 's fair brow the laurel yet shall twine . Bruce . Henry Bruce How pure the moonlight falls ! ' T is like the night That Ida heard thee first with such delight . Let 's take a round on the piazza , do ! Wrap up in shawls ,  --  the moon invites thee , too . It is not colder than an autumn eve , New strength and vigor we shall all receive . The three pass out . Bruce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surprise , we had to-night ! Thou , too , deserved to witness such a sight , When Ida 's parents learned at last , through me , That their own daughter was our " Cora Lee . " And I am glad the Rubicon is past ;  --  I hope she 'll have more courage now at last . Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond She must , she will . The world compels a strength , When one is launched upon its waves at length . With critics , flatterers , we must take a stand , And though before we needed helping hand , We grow by stern necessity to power , Though as it comes we wonder every hour . Thus Ida will be strong . Oh , how I shrank From public notice , while at first I drank Its turbid stream ! But when the world once spoke Its sentence , such a power awoke Within my soul , enough to meet it then , And stand uncaring at the sneers of men . It gives the soul a broader view of life , To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the world is but society the same On larger scale , and bearing different name . What matter if one town , or two , may speak Of what is strong in thee , or what is weak ? Or state , or states , or hemisphere , or world ? One priest or ten , anathemas have hurled ? Nine critics or nineteen dispute thy fame ? Five presses or five thousand praise or blame ? I care as little for the thousands now ( And would no sooner to their mandate bow ) As once for personal friends . I bide my fate : Through praise and blame the same I work and wait . And Ida , when thou takest now thy place , Let it be done with quiet , gentle grace ; But firm , unfearing , as the rock that stands Where ocean-waves clutch at it with their hands . Ida . Ida Seymour Ah me , I fear ! and yet I feel more strong Than when I lingered undecided long . With two such friends and helpers at my side , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce I know thou canst . The true and steadfast still Must bow the world beneath their potent will . It needs but one strong purpose that defies The sternest power to crush that ever tries . Ida . Ida Seymour Excuse one moment ! for my cloak 's tog thin . Is thine ?  --  I 'll get some warmer , and be back again . She enters the house . Miss Raymond , Miss Raymond looking after her and smiling archly . Confess now , Bruce , that with her magic art Unconsciously she 's stolen all thy heart ! Bruce . Henry Bruce I do confess , Miss Raymond , that to me She is indeed the " Type of Deity . " I loved her at the first , and deeper grows The feeling in my heart , as on it flows . And more than this , from her own lips to-night I heard the words that give me such delight ,  --  That she returned my love , and sometime now She 'll be my bride . And I would tell thee how This came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  I feared I could not win Her heart 's young love , and doubted how to tell The love in mine , lest it might break the spell , And lose for me the confidence she gave :  --  I must confess I was not over brave . But in thy latest poem was a scene , Where Morton won the love of Eloine ; Thou dost remember well the thrilling place  --  I know it by thy earnest , speaking face . I read that to her but this very night , With heart divided between fear and light , And caught the strength thy inspiration gave , And poured my love out like an ocean wave , And met return . Thou wert the helper , thou , Thou knowest not half I owe thee , even now . Thy help to Ida , thy unselfish love , Thy noble nature evermore must prove ; And I shall ever claim my dearest friend One who to her such helping hand would lend , Smiling . Then wrote the words with which to win her heart : Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Raymond I 'm truly glad that I can speak one word By which the depths of other hearts are stirred . This compliments my skill all else above , If I can write distinctly others ' love . Bruce . Henry Bruce If thou canst write of love so passing well , Thou must indeed have felt thyself the spell ; Perhaps e'en now thy heart is not thy own , Its very sweetness but another 's tone . Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond Ah , no , indeed ! I never loved as yet . Perhaps life 's picture I might truer get , Were such the case . But be that as it may , I only hope beneath god-Cupid 's sway I may not bend ; and yet I give thee joy . In this thy happiness , may naught destroy ; But may the star of love but brighter beam , And life be almost like a fairy dream ! Ida , Ida Seymour joining them . I 'm here at last ! commissioned though to say , That none of us outside must longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The sunlight , moonlight , starlight , all are gone . " Bruce . Henry Bruce I did forget myself ! At once we 'll go ! He will forgive us readily , I know . Miss Raymond retains Ida a moment as they pass in . Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond Ah , Ida , I congratulate thee much ! Not every day can woman find one such True soul as thou hast found to-day : May blessings be on both thy heads , I say . My two dear friends , how shall I love to see The happiness that comes to such as thee ! He is like night , all set with stars of thought ; Thou art like morning when it first has caught Aurora 's beams : the two shall blend in one , And day shall beam resplendent with her sun . Ah , bless thee , Ida ! May thine eyes be bright As now they beam with Love 's first sunny light ! Thy cheek as fresh with some glad thought within , As now it burns in rosy light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their glow , No change but joys , to mark the years that flow ! They pass in . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Well , Bruce , I think , has been most overbold , To keep thee out so long in all this cold ! As long as moonlight gleams , he thinks ' t is right : He 'd never know if cold or warm the night . Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond ' T was beautiful .  --  I had forgotten , too . But now forgive us all , I beg , please do ! Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour On this condition : that some one must tell What conversation could have had such spell ! Bruce . Henry Bruce Most readily . Miss Raymond says to-night , She prays to never bend to Cupid 's might ; That she has never been in love , not she , And more than this , she never means to be . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Impossible ! A libel all unheard ! I can not think her guilty of such word . Not wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companionship , some other mind , So like and yet unlike , to meet and blend , And higher , better powers through each to send ? Defend thyself , Miss Raymond , from the charge , The liberty he takes is quite too large . Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond Friend Bruce is right . I 've nothing to defend , However much I shock thee , my true friend ! Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Hast never been in love , nor wish to be ? If such is truth , do please explain to me ! Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond If I were not in such an element , Where love seems current coin , uncounted lent , I should say first , I do n't believe in love , Or if I do , in only that above , Such as the angels feel who leave their heaven To work for man on life 's wild ocean driven . But I must qualify . So little love I see , That sometimes I have doubts if aught can be Half worthy that pure name . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , I see such agony and such unrest , And such a bitter rankling in the breast , That , sick at heart , I sadly turn away , And think  --  " I 'm sceptical of love to-day . " Just look at Mrs. Clifton ! She , I know , Has such an aching heart beneath her show , ' Twill not be long before her lofty pride Will bid her wish , long years ago she 'd died . And thousands more that here I need not name With but the happy few ;  --  and where 's the blame ? I must believe in marriage : nature speaks : He who would fain evade , but vainly seeks . Great Nature 's laws are everywhere the same , But someway in the meeting is the blame . So much of ignorance , of self below , So much of passion through false love will flow , So much pretence , deception in the plan , That I shall sure evade it if I can . Let others love  --  the few as blest as thee ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour I am surprised , Miss Raymond , at such word ,  --  From other lips all unbelieved if heard ;  --  With all thy gentle nature and thy heart , To thus ignore this life 's first , noblest part ! Why , woman 's highest mission is to give To others being , in her place to live ; To mould the fresh , young mind with her soft hand , And place in other palms her magic wand ; To rear the youth to take his father 's place , More nobly fitted that he bears her grace . Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond I grant it woman 's place , whene'er she will , This most important mission to fulfil ; But yet so painful , that the martyr 's crown To her belongs ; for round her pathway frown Full many a phantom that would sore affright , Only she knows her path is toward the right . I honor one who does this mission well ;  --  She binds me with her spirit 's gentle spell , And I sit reverent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth I chance to meet ; But still , I think her happiness is slight , And that alone in striving for the right . And I fulfil my mission , sacred , too , The wrongs , mistakes of others to undo ; As far as may be , make another 's child More strong and beautiful , more meek and mild , That otherwise had sunk in deepest sin , But for some voice like mine , in time to win . I choose in life from hers a different part , Yet live like her , devoted to my art ;  --  To strive to do my good , to make the earth My home , and wake to still a brighter birth The souls I meet , unto my influence given , And point them ever some bright path to heaven . Like her , I 'll take my life within my hand , But unlike her , outside the hearthstone stand . Yet , if I do , it is that I may shed Light to more hearths than one , more thresholds tread , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And life , new life in virtue , help begin . The gift that came to me , I 'll bear for aye , A sacred incense round my path alway ; And robed within it , I will pass along , And seek communion with the soul of song , And all things beautiful and fair and bright , And scatter o'er the earth their morning light . Forgive these words . Yet do I speak them here Less strongly than in some far different sphere , Where not the semblance e'en of love is borne , And bitter sackcloth of the heart is worn . Then could I pour my soul out in a strain That now I will not ; it would give thee pain . God bless all lovers ! say I unto thee ; But portion out , Oh fate , not one to me ! Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Thou'rt wrong , I think ! but as thou wilt . Thy heart , I see , is wedded only to thy art . Perhaps ' t is well ; and yet some noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Raymond Not so ! I do not always please myself ! I 'm far from perfect  --  such a wayward elf ! And one that I could love , if such there be , Would be as much dissatisfied with me . When there 's a perfect man , and I am perfect , too , I think I might find happiness that 's true ; But never until then . Myself I hardly bear ,  --  What should I do if two should be my share ? Bruce . Henry Bruce Why , help each other bear ! I frankly own I should bear much to hear one loving tone , To know one heart , despite my faults , was mine , Despite its own , must lovingly entwine Its destiny with that I bear , and be A star of hope through all my life to me . And would'st thou then refuse the sun 's glad light , Because a few dark spots would meet thy sight ? Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond No ! but far rather I would bid it stay In its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could not help but trace Other and larger on its now bright face . And lest the sun itself , on coming near , Behold but weeds where now the flowers appear ; Each small defect in noon-day glare would see , And in disgust refuse to shine on me ! Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Hast thou no word to say in this debate , My daughter ? Dost thou , too , choose such a fate ? Ida , Ida Seymour blushing crimson . I fear I was but spoiled with so much love , As you , my parents , gave . But time must prove Whether I 've strength to stand like her , alone , And seek my joy in Art 's profound unknown . Miss Raymond . Miss Raymond But , see ! ' t is getting late . I must away ! The carriage sure is waiting . Now , I pray , Do n't think me Amazon , or Gorgon , yet , Lest in some after time thou might regret . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour I 'm only sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  --  an offering That thou would'st wear upon thy heart , and say , It shone the brightest gem to light thy way . I do believe that thou dost hate our race , Yet who could think it , with so mild a face ? Miss Raymond , Miss Raymond laughing . So far from that , I think so much of each , I could not bear to their far sphere to reach , And choose one to torment through all his life ,  --  So sure to be his fate were I his wife . Now , Ida , I shall soon expect to see Thy work forthcoming . Send the first to me ! Do n't work too hard , and lose thine eyes ' fresh light , And now , though hard the word to say , good-night ! She passes out . Ida pauses with her a few moments in the hall , while the rest return to the parlor . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour It took me by surprise ,  --  her sudden word ! And can it be she has her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loving mind ? So much of sympathy and help she 'd find ! I wonder yet  --  I think it very strange ; It must be sometime all her views will change . Bruce . Henry Bruce I think I can appreciate her soul , It can not brook the slightest earth-control , But bursts forth free , impulsively , and strong , To join with right , and wrestle with the wrong . She springs , soul forward , like the hurrying wave , The minds that others love to win and save . Unless she meets , as meets the wave the rock , Some noble soul , and the electric shock Of thoughts congenial , as does the wave in spray , Dissolves her theory in mist away ; She 'll live devoted to her art , till life Shall be no more , amid this care and strife ; But springing from the soil her foot has trod , She takes her soul unstained again to God . There are but few such souls ; they can not tread The path that others mark ; their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Like some bright evening star they stand alone . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour But few such souls , indeed ,  --  but very few ! Whate'er she is , I know her good and true . Mrs. Seymour Mrs. Seymour Ida can never leave her ; all her heart Seems drawn to her , as hers to her pure art . Bruce , Henry Bruce with emotion . Not all , I hope !  --  My friends , I wish to say , I won a hope from Ida 's self to-day , That my long , earnest love she could return ,  --  The greatest boon for which my soul can yearn ,  --  That if thou would'st consent , my bride she 'd be , And I would ask permission now of thee . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Then Ida loves thee , as I hoped and feared ! From but thyself , such words had hardly cheered . But , as I told thee , unto thee we give More willingly than to one heart that lives . Only a year or two let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee , Till she shall be a woman that can grace Most true and fairly any woman 's place . Bruce . Henry Bruce She can do that for me without an hour Spent waiting ; but thou hast the power To thus delay . I would not now destroy One of thy hopes , to sooner gain this joy . Her love , her presence , shall my heaven be , Her eyes the star of hope to beckon me ! And shall I seek her now , and wilt thou bless ? Before we sleep , seal this our happiness ? Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour Go , bring her then ! Thou hast from us beguiled Her heart ; yet we forgive thee , and our child ! Miss Raymond having just left , Bruce finds Ida in the hall , returning to the parlor . Bruce , Henry Bruce clasping her hands in his . Come , darling ! both thy parents wait for thee , To give their blessing to our love and me ! He leads her into the parlor . She throws herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with words of tenderness . Then , Bruce taking her hand , they kneel before them . Mr. Seymour . Mr. Seymour My children ! may thy love be strong and sure , Still burning clearer , ever growing pure , So strong , no cloud can ever wholly dim , But ever growing perfect , more like Him . Cling closer when the tempest in its sweep Has stirred the very fountains of the deep . And should the hand of pain be on the brow , Love only stronger than thou lovest now . And through affliction let each chord entwine Still closer , till thy love is all divine . O Father ! shower thy blessings on each head ! And when the buoyant days of youth are fled , Oh , lead them gently down the steps of Time , Through gates where Life Immortal stands sublime !
