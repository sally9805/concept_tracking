txt In a previous number* we reviewed the system of banking in operation in the State of New York , so far as it aimed to provide security for the redemption of bank issues of paper money , and suggested the applieation of that prineiple to the finances of the federal government . Since the publication of that article , the topics presented in it have been variously discussed in different sections of the country , and a disposition has been evinced to take into consideration the propriety of adopting the system there presented . It is not our present purpose to present anew the subject , treated in our former number , either to develope more fully its practical bearings or to urge the importance of its adoption . To that class of minds who are ready to adopt well considered plans of improving those systems that exist among us , however or disjointed they may appear to be , the presentation of a plan so simple and obviously effective , carries with it a force of conviction to which the most elaborate analysis and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have thought much , if not profoundly , on the subject of credit and banking , who deem any improvement engrafted upon the present system , as hurtful to the precise extent , that as an improvement it ought to be deemed valuable , inasmuch as it tends to postpone the period of its radical overthrow . For those with whom radicalism is a passion and not a mere misdirection of the logical faculty , who strew their way from the cradle to the grave , with wrecks , beginning with the toys and play-things of infancy , and ending with constitutions , no argument can supply the defects of nature or education . But happily much of the radicalism of the day is merely a logical distemper , and to which reason may address itself with a fair hope of being heard . The mathematical condition of mind , peculiar to this age , exhibits itself in a tendency to reduce all systems to a series of simple and demonstrable propositions . That which constitutes an excellence in mechanics , the habitual direction of the attention to the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements are devolved , frequently misdirects the mind in the study of economic science . In the one , that which is complex is derived , by variously combining powers and movements , simple in themselves , and in reality , only complex in the sense that the mind can not , at a single instant of time , grasp the separate and combined operation of each , while in the other , complexity is the result of an infinite number and variety of forces , operating upon the production of every result . In mechanical science the mind begins with a simple proposition , and proceeds constructively to the production of the highest results , while in the uncertain sciences of which political economy may be reckoned , the foremost , this method is impracticable , indeed , impossible . Beside the wheel , the lever and the wedge , the machine society reckons among its primary powers many moral forces , not to be guaged and coupled by arbitrary will , but acting with a certain self-direction , without the range of human control , and frequently of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms and complexities . It does not place man in the presence of the productions of a vast genius , superior to human , and command his study and admiration , but takes him to a vast engine room , and placing in his hand a lever , tells him that with it , the course of all things under the sun is controlled . It tells him that institutions and religions are instruments of his invention , and subjects of his control , and surely he should understand * American Review , February , 1849 , under title of " A plan for improving the national // the tools with which he works , or throw them aside and invest others within his comprehension . It denies to him no attribute of power , save the origination of his own species , and a certain minor authority which nature , as his house-keeper , garnishing and fitting his terrestrial abode for his comfort and pleasure , exercises within this his home and workshop . Since Lucifer fell , such presumptuous beings as the modern philosophers have not existed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy , lies through a state of mind as different from this as wisdom is from ignorance . There are certain great principles to be borne in mind-all economic systems have certain moral tendencies which it is as legitimately their office to exert , as to effect those physical and immediate results which are the apparent objects of their institution . Therefore , to adapt a system to the moral nature of man , is as essential as it is to construct it on such principles as to improve his physical condition . If it were otherwise , the argument so often used to vindicate tyranny that its subjects are better provided for in physical necessities and comforts , would be unanswerable . Again , let it be remembered that when experience has demonstrated the utility of a certain expedient , a fact has been ascertained which must have its place and weight in science , and if it is inapplicable or untrue to any theory of the subject , the theory gives way and not the fact . For certain expedients are as natural and as necessary by adaptation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they indicate the laws of his state . Of this nature is credit , morally the placing of faith and confidence by one in another , and physically the transfer of one 's possessions to another on the faith of a promise of a compensating return for them . Without exercising it man has never existed and can never exist . It is the first law developed in infancy , and draws after it the social affections which have their origin in confidence , first exhibited toward them to whom we are the objects of care and solicitude , and with the perfecting of the reason drawing within its influence a widening range of objects . Mingling every where in the intercourse of rational man with man , it is necessarily the great principle governing that intercourse , which has for its end the production by his industry of those things of which his nature has need for its sustenance . Credit is the great law of industrial intercourse . It is the result of the moral nature of man bearing upon his physical labors , and gives to his labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the labors of inferior and irrationa beings . It binds society together in mutual confidence and dependence , thus harmonizing in the common objects to which all legitimate institutions tend . We hear of friends and enemies of a credit system ; but it surely can not be that there are any who desire the extirpation of confidence from the human bosom . It is not against the principle of credit that any sane man wars ; but that which has beca technically called the credit system , is sometimes the object of his aversion . Essentially , the credit system consists of a series of restrictions to the natural and unrestricted application of the principle , or rather instinct of confidence , settled by long experience . Whether these limits are always set with due regard to the best interest of society , is a question for experimental solution , defying theoretic analysis . There is a reason running through this subject , ascertaining by fixed laws every result , but the question to be settled is whether the human mind possesses suffi ' - cient ubiquity to comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study this faintly illumined science by the aid of certain fixed facts , like beacon lights , set hither and thither to guide the mariner . And if we think more perfectly to illuminate the subject , we must not go about and extinguish the imperfect lights we already have , until by their aid we have set durable landmarks . Starting from the idea of credit as a moral instinct , we follow man into society and find the idea practically employed by a necessity inherent in his relations with other beings . He comes into the world naked and destitute-is sustained by affection until the faculty of laboring for himself is developed-thence-forward he is thrown upon his own resources . He possesses as yet only the faculty of labor , but  - -  *ov. // is without the means of employing that faculty . His instincts and his wants impel him to production . The question here arises of what does he stand in need-and how shall that want be supplied ? Man is in a peculiar though not altogether exclusive sense , as has been said , a tool using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material with which and upon which to exert those instincts which tend to sustain and perpetuate the life of their species ; but the wants of man in this respect are as much greater as his nature is more exalted than theirs . That which has already been produced out of the abundant stores of nature , and remains unconsumed , in the various forms in which labor has prepared it for future use , forms the store out of which he is to draw the means of employing his industrial power . This resource is capital , under which name may be also included those natural objects and productions which are the subjects of property . Out of it , the laborer is nourished until the fruit of his labor is realized to him . Out of it he is furnished with land to till and implements of husbandry , or with material tools and implements with which he can exercise his skill as an artizan . As yet the naked laborer has produced nothing , and accordingly has nothing with which to produce . Capital is in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hope to obtain it without an equivalent to offer for it , from those who have labored hard enough to get it to know the value of keeping it . Until the expedients of humane and civilized society are adopted , he has but a single resource , and that is to sell his labor to another , and become a bondman . It is an instructive though a well known fact , that the modern commercial system was ushered into being about the same time with that liberty and civilization , which distinguishes the present as the enlightened age of the world . It would be more difficult than profitable to endeavor to ascertain which led forward the other ; it is enough to know that without the other neither could subsist . For much of the liberty and civilization we enjoy , we are indebted to those causes which give dignity to labor . Among barbarous tribes labor is the service of a bondman reluctantly yielded to avoid hunger and the thong-with freemen it is the struggle of a fre* spirit to raise its physical independence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies not in the men , but in the institutions of the society in which they live . By assuring to the individual the products of his labor , and furnishing him with capital to employ it , we most effectually secure his physical and with it his moral liberty . By the aid of credit , one of its predominant ideas , modern civilization secures this happy result , not perfectly indeed , but to a decree , establishing on a sure foundation the soundness of the principle involved . The study of economic philosophy is directed to the best mode of applying capital to labor , so as to insure its highest productiveness . Capital contains within itself no power of increase , apart from labor both are equally helpless , but combined they become productive . The capitalist desires that his capital may be productive , as heartily as the laborer , that his labors may be crowned by production . Their interests are common , and in a well ordered community their efforts tend to the same objects . Then let the senseless cry about a strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply itself to a ismple fable teaching the importance of every useful member of living society to every other , and be silent . To accomplish the common purpose of the capitalist and the laborer , it is only necessary that the capitalist , or he who has more capital than he either can employ , or than he chooses to employ in connection with his own labors , should loan the laborer so much of his capital as the latter may stand in need of , upon the faith of a promise to restore it again to the lender , with a certain propor*on of the profits produced with it , by way of compensation for its use . This is credit representing the confidence of the lender in the borrower . Need it be asked-can any other result take place ? Not unless the instincts of humanity are crushed , and men roam apart through a wilderness world , devouring one another like wild beasts . So far we have the imperfect credit system of a scattered primitive society . Complexities are begotten in multitudes . It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of simplicity , but it is oftentimes a simplicity pervading complexity as its reason or law , as the vibration of a thousand strings and pipes may produce a simple melody . But we usually call that simple , which is obvious to our reason , and that complex which we do not understand , as a millwright would call a cotton mill a simple machine , while to one unacquainted with its principles , a steam engine is a miracle of complications . The progress of society towards its complete development , and the increase of population , mark important changes in the relation of the capitalist and the laborer . No longer can the capitalist who has stood hitherto in the light of a patron to the laborer , advancing to him his capital through a kind of personal confidence , exercise that direct watchfulness which is essential to the safety of his investment . To apply a system of direct patronage in an advanced commercial community , would require a degree of intimate knowledge and of personal confidence between individual capitalists and laborers utterly unattainable . Under such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain idle , rather than incur the difficulties attending its investment . A further difficulty is perceived . With the increase of commerce has arisen competition begetting risk . The capitalist having but a small amount to loan and hazarding it all with the success of one , or at best a limited number of laborers , finds the risk too great for the return he can expect , and prefers hoarding to investing . There is a want of economy also discovered in this mode of applying capital . The borrower and the lender know not where to find each other , nor can that certainty of assistance , which is essential to the regularity of business , be depended on . Out of this doubtful state of things , it happens that much capital lies continually unemployed , particularly when it is possessed in small amounts , in the hands of many individuals . To obviate these difficulties , a number of individuals , each having a certain , perhaps small amount of capital , associate themselves together and form a common fund . Skillful and experienced persons are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the combined capital that which neither of the associated individuals could do so well with respect to his individual proportion . We have thus attained the idea of the joint stock bank , an institution created in the effort of capital , to apply itself to labor . This is indeed the simplest idea of a bank ; but a bank , nevertheless ; exhibiting in the simplicity of its mech* nisin , the principles of its construction , wherein we may derive certain and valuable knowledge of what a bank is , thus leading to the conclusion of what a bank should do . Individual or private banking has found admirers , placing it in point of utility before joint stock banking ; but although they have professed to look from a democratic point of view , they have unreflectingly fallen into a great error . An individual banker starting in such a way as to attain success , begins necessarily with an overgrown capital , which grows exorbitantly by the influence which wealth and the control of a banking institution confer . Until the mass of capital distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associative companies , the wealth of the individual banker enjoys a monopoly of the benefits derived from the active employment of capital , and receives a rate of interest enhanced beyond its comparative value , by the absence of competition . Europe exhibits many instances where individual bankers have attained a degree of wealth utterly disproportional to what a natural increase of capital by the ordinary and healthy modes of application would yield , and suggesting that such facilities of monopoly ought not to exist in the hands of individuals unchecked by competition . Our own country exhibits few such instances , owing chiefly to the extent to which joint stock banking is encouraged with us . Individual bankin* , tends necessarily to accumulation and monopoly-while joint stock banking tends to distribution , and fosters competition . Taking a step further in the refinement of the relations of commerce , we encounter a class of persons who assume an intermediate position between the capitalist and the laborers . This class is composed of what has been styled exchangers , including merchants , brokers , carriers and others that might be named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its origin from a period far in advance of the conception of any definite idea of banking , but in the development of credit from its rude beginning to its later perfection , it may not be inappropriate to assign to this class the position we have assigned it . The merchant standing in the closest intimacy of relation on the one hand to the laborer , and on the other hand to the capitalist , is the natural channel through which capital flows to invigorate labor . Apparently he seems to monopolize in himself , the advantages derived from banking accommodation ; but in reality he transmits them , either immediately or mediately to the laborer . And this again , is accomplished through credit . The manufacturer , who in one sense represents labor , is enabled through the merchant to receive the proceeds of his labor , in the form of advances , months before his manufactured wares find a consumer . To the bank , which has communicated to the merchant in part his ability to make such advances , the manufacturer owes the supply of means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmer , by the aid of capital flowin* toward him through the bank , and the merchant , he is sustained out of his own labor , while as yet the products of his industry are but seeking a market . In this manner may the operation of credit be traced through every branch and department of industry , conveying capital to fructify labor . Corresponding to a certain degree to the division indicated by the classification of the persons engaged in commerce into capitalists exchano*es and labors ; there are three classes of individuals whose relations to each other indicate the character of the credit system . They are firstly capitalists , or those who employ their capital in making loans to others ; secondly , those who have capital employed by themselves in commercial operations , corresponding with this class of exchangers ; and lastly , laborers who are dependant upon the former classes for the means rendering their labor productive . Let A. represent the capitalist ; B. the merchant standing in the second class , and C. the laborer . We will assume that B. possessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. stands in need to employ his labor . B. is willing to place his property at the disposal of C. but has demanded a guaranty , which is furnished by A. But B. possessing capital and not standing in need of A 's ready money , is content to take from A. his promise to pay the equivalent for the purchase by C. , at a future specified time . This transaction constitutes a loan of credit , and derives the reasonableness and utility of such loans from the natural wants of mankind standing in such relations . This simple formula illustrates many of the transactions of business , and can be applied in the analysis of the relations of the parties to such transactions . We have thus as the purpose of the credit system , the facilitation of exchanges of property between producers and exchangers , by setting apart a portion of the capital of the country , to guaranty the credit upon which such exchanges are made . To a limited extent , loans of credit are created by issues of bank paper , but the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of a representative of specie rather than of credit . In either aspect such issues are legitimate . The invention of a circulation , making use of paper notes as the representative of capital , or in ordinary though less strict language , of specie , belongs to the later history of banking . The inconvenience of removing material property of any kind , from place to place , even when it is in the concentrated form of the precious metals , suggests to the common reason of mankind , the expedient of representing such property by some known symbol , the possession of which shall be the evidence of the ownership of that which it represents . Such is the relation that a bank note sustains to the capital of the bank issuing it . Economists have difTh*red widely in their notions of the character of specie ; but without reason , for specie is but a description of property selected for that purpose in consequence of its extreme value , with a fixed national standard of measurement , and made a lawful tender , in fulfilment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified property . Specie has a material and not representtative character . Its value is indeed enhanced by the privileges , which in this // respect it enjoys over other descriptions of property ; but in all respects it is subject to the same law of supply and demand that control the value of other descriptions of property . It is obviously the most fluctuating description of property , as the supply is not only controlled by natural causes , but by those artificial means by which it becomes impressed with the peculiar attributes of specie . In this respect a representative circulation has the advantage of representing the vast capital of the country , the fluctuations of which balance each other , giving some approach to an undeviating standard of value . The introduction of the bank note system worked a revolution in banking , in which the spirit of avarice prevailed over reason , and established a bad principle only partially extirpated at this time . One of the earliest facts developed in practical banking , by the introduction of a paper circulation , was , that for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie as compared with the aggregate amount of notes issued was required for their redemption as they were ordinarily returned for payment . This was a result necessarily attendin* the issue of a representative circulation ; for where notes are put in circulation , representing a specie capital , the capital must of necessity remain in the bank , until demanded in redemption of the notes . Thus the bank would constantly have unemployed on its hands an amount , the average of which would be equal to the amount of its notes , kept constantly in circulation . Still , in addition to this , as a place of deposit for specie , the bank commonly holds large amounts on deposit , for which no other use can be made than to employ it for the redemption of its notes , thus , reducing the amount of its capital required to be kept by it in the form of specie . The bank finding that practically it employed but a small amount of capital , as compared with the amount of business done by it , naturally came to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary superfluity , and being loose from the restraints of law , acted practically upon this conclusion . If it had the credit of possessing capital , it mattered not that its notes represen ted an empty falsehood , instead of real capital , their currency was all that was desired , and that was attained . Or if it actually possessed such unemployed capital , the temptation to speculate with it , soon placed it beyond the reach of bill holders . False as this principle was , it is not so remarkable that it was adopted by the banks , as that its falsity escaped the attention of statesmen and economists . The condition of the bank was deemed sound at a moment when its capital or property basis could afford the means of redeeming but a small proportion of its outstanding engagements . The deficiency was supposed to be supplied by the notes of private individuals , obtained by discount in exchange for its own notes or credit . A circulation to the extent of two and a half times the actual capital was permitted . The bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual capital to the business of the country ; but as a mere speculator , exchanging a credit bearing no interest , for one productive of interest . This advantage it can enjoy , solely for the reason that the name of bank carried with it a certain prestige denied to individual reputation . it followed that the bank was sound no longer than the individuals whose notes it held were in a solvent condition , while the occurrel4ce of financial embarrassment was sure to endanger , if not overwhelm the bank , rendering its widely scattered circulation a precarious , if not a worthless possession . We have endeavored to trace the development of the banking system , from those necessary laws that stamp a fixed relation on the society of mankind ; but here we encounter a system purely artificial . The principle of the system , if principle could arise out of a mere artificial order of things established at the suggestion of avarice , was that the credit of the bank being not absolutely dependent on the credit of a single individual , but of the aggregate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reliable character , and therefore an exchange of an uncertain credit , for one of better standing , was a good operation both for the banker and the borrower . The fruit of this system was such as could only spring from its principles . Where it prevails , it is not unusual to see banks suspend specie payments with an // worthless assets . A general distrust of banks ensued , democratic zeal was stimulated , not to detect and correct the erroneous principle which had crept into banking , but to destroy all bankin0 privileges . At this juncture , in the State of New York , Whig Lejslation detected the evil principle , and extirpated it effectually from banking in that state . The guaranty system seized upon the principle , that the bank should be a capitalist in reality , as well as in name , and demanded of it public assurances , and pledges , that this character was genuine , and not fictitiously assumed . The general features of the New York system were so fully presented in the article alluded to in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to present its details . Under this system , the bank is required to possess in an available form , means sufficient for the redemption of the whole circulation issued by it . This capital need not be in the form of specie , but mi*ht be invested in permanent interest producing securities , reserving however sufficient specie to meet the emergencies of business . As affording the most generally approved security , investment in public stocks and in mortga*es of real estate , was suggested as most fitting to render the surplus capital at once productive and safe . But as capital safely invested to-day , may be withdrawn and launched into speculation to-morrow , a still further point was to be attained by the system , and this was accomplished by requiring the bank to deposit the stock and mortgages representing its capital , in the hands of a responsible public officer . Nature exhibits in all her processess the profoundest economy in the use of means , setting an example to the reason of mankind . Starting from the rude and clumsy expedients of savage life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incrcasin* economy in the use of means . This is the result of a clear acquaintance with the laws of nature . In no direction has science as yet applied the exertions of mankind so as to attain the highest possible productiveness . On the contrary , we are yet in the infancy of mind , with much yet to ransack and learn before we understand all that this world of ours contains . We handle the machinery of the great laboratory , but poorly as yet , producing very little to reward a great outlay of exertion . As we approach maturity , we shall know more of economy , and produce greater results . As much as science has done in other quarters , it has thrown but little light upon the productive capacity of capital . A very natural , but Epicurean idea seems to prevail , that the productions of labor are intended solely for the present comfort and enjoyment of mankind , and have no prospective duty to perform for future generations . Capital belongs to posterity ; its economical use is all that is allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a persuasive instinct , man labors as lie supposes , for himself and his offspring , but nature turns his labors to a wider usefulness , raising up by them , myriads of intellectual , sentient beings . Such reflections are not useless , as they tend to dignif science which has for its aim the direction of human labor . If it seems surprising that capital may be in the exclusive possession and enjoyment of one , while another not possessing it , may derive an equal , or perhaps greater benefit from its existence , than he who possesses it , the surprise must be attributed to the small acquisitions which science has made in t*his department of knowledge . Such a state of facts is exhibited by a bank having a circulation based upon capital invested in interest paying securities . The interest derived directly from the invested capital , represents the profits derived from the immediate employment of that capital , while that which is derived to the bank and to individuals , by means of the circulation , represents the value of the same capital employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of employin* capital , one *y possession , the other by producing credit upon it . One who holds a promissory note of approved value , derives a benefit from its possession , no ways diminished by the fact that he whose note it is , is actually enjoying the profits of the farm , which is the only means possessed by him for the payinent of his note . The principle involved is us obvious as the fact is certain-credit looks to the future productiveness of capital-its profit is // wise detracts from the value of its present enjoyment . Nor is there any improvidence in this anticipation of a future profit , for we have already seen , that this expectation of a future profit , leads the capitalist to place his capital within the reach of the laborer ; thus fulfilling the ends of nature , in bringing capital and labor together , to co-operate in production . The New York system attentive to this principle of economic employment , permits that portion of banking capital which is not required to be held by the bank in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested , requiring only the representative of that capital in the form of public stocks or other securities , to be placed in the hands of a public officer , pledged for the redemption of the notes of the bank employing it . A class of credits spring out of mercantile transactions , so dependent for their validity upon similar credits , t*hat of themselves they form an insecure basis of commercial operations . So dependent are merchants upon one another , in consequence of the credits mutually subsisting among them , that all are concerned in the soundneas of each , and are more or less affected by the failure of any one . To prevent the formation of such credits , where interest and the anticipation of profit invite to extending them , is impossible , whether attempted by the aid of philosophy or law . No statute could be framed sufficiently stringent to restrain merchants from trusting , where they deem it their interest to trust . The impotency of such legislation is exhibited in the instance of the usury laws ; however wise or necessary such laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enforcement , and therefore useless . If then , in the latter case , where to many minds a moral sanction is superadded to the authority of the laws , they are found to be destitute of power , how hopelessly imbecile would be a law rendered repugnant to the moral instincts , by attempting the destruction of *credit . Far from submitting to such a law , those who violate it , would feel that they had done a commendable act , in trusting the credit of one whom it may have been their interest to serve , even at the hazard of incurring the censures of the law . Taking it as a fixed fact , that merchants will trust one another , not deduced from any reasoning on the subject , but observed as an invariable consequence of the principle of self-interest , it becomes a question of the gravest interest to public economists , how to prevent as far as possible , the unprudent and extravagant propagation of credits . The temptations that almost continually present themselves to the mercantile classes , inducing an enlargement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if unrestrained , to produce dangerous extensions of credit ; but peculiar combinations of circumstances frequently hold out the most extravagant promises of gain to be derived from the enlargement of business operations , and consequent expansion of credit , too powerful for resistance , though placing in imminent hazard the security of commercial transactions . Against such influences , the credit system-the aim of which , as we have seen , is to restrict abuses of the principle of credit-wields a powerful restrictive in banking capital . The constant tendency of banking is to withdraw from the market the uncertain credits of individuals for the most part based upon credits , and to replace them by a credit based upon the actual capital of the bank . Thus , while capital under wise restrictions struggles to become productive , it lends its strength to give firmness and confidence to the relations of commerce . On the other hand , the timidity of the capitalist , who looks only to a fair rate of interest , and a safe investment , acts as a counterpoise to the imprudent zeal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go beyond the limit of prudence . As banking capital possesses such an influence on commercial operations , as to hold them in check by the withdrawal of its facilities , so when that capital is a reality and not a shadow , that influence will always be found on the side of prudence . It is obvious , that these conclusions are not true of banking conducted upon fictitious capital , for there the credit of the bank is no more reliable than the credit of individuals even under the best of circumstances , and the replacing of the one by the other , is a matter of little commercial advantage , while as it respects a disposition to check speculation , the bank having but little at // the capitalist . A casual and superficial observer might detect a supposed departure from this principle in the New York system . By assuming the securities standing in the place of the actual property-capital , to represent merely a credit , it would appear that the credit loaned upon that capital , was but credit raised upon credit . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation of its principles , to subsist in part , in the fact , that the credit that it extends is based upon actual capital , instead of mere credit . It can not with any propriety be said , that he who loans to another upon the security of a pledge of property-relies upon the credit of the borrower , for he holds the property pledged , and is so far to be regarded its owner , that if that which was borrowed is not returned , the pledge is retained . So the faith of the public pledged in its stocks , on*ht to be regarded as a security superior to all individual credits , and standing on an equal footi% with the possession of any tangible property ; for as the security of property is dependent upon the maintainance of the public faith , so the pledge of that faith secures the highest cvideuce of a permanent possession . Resting on such a basis , no credit can be deemed insecure . Many evils have been attributed to banks , some of which are the result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already pointed out , while others are nowise chargeable to that cause . Among others , that of inducing speculation , has been with some , a principal ground of objection to the allowance of banking privileges . This charge has been urged with that undiscriminating zeal that involves both the good and evil in a system in accusations belongin* to the latter only . As banking has in many instances been conducted , the charge is not unmerited , but it is the abuse of the principle which has given occasion to the charge of fostering speculation . In one respect only , has legitimate banking an influence in promoting speculation , and that is by furnishing the means which may be employed towards speculative objects . If speculation made use of means which are not the common source of all commercial activities , but admitting only of employment for evil , it would be a ground of grave accusation , that any system should furnish such facilities . Capital may be regarded as the vital principle of commercial life , equally capable of a true or false direction ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made of it , is as absurd as to charge the principle of animal life with all the irregularities to which it ministers their active power . Speculation is the product of moral causes , and not the result of physical combinations . It springs from a desire for the acquisition of sudden wealth , and is attended by an excited state of mind ready to risk every present good , for the sake of some anticipated advantage . It is not uniformly observed to predominate at times when the use of capital is readily procured ; but often arises when the ordinary operations of trade are straitened for lack of means . This fact of itself , illustrates the absurdity of charging the origination of speculative feeling upon those causes which supply the material means of trading . Of all classes capitalists are least apt to be speculative , while they view such illicit operations with a degree of distrust sufficient to prevent them from entrusting their property with those that indulge in them . The bank as a capitalist is actuated by the same inipiilses to a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instrument of conservatism . One of many instances may be cited illustrating the practical truth of this idea . The shifting of the balance of trade in our favor in consequence of the large exportations of grain , * during the year 1847 , induced larger importations from abroad than is usual , and a consequent efflux of specie towards foreign markets . To check this tendency the banks restricted their discounts , taking g9od care that their funds should not fall into the hands of those who required specie for exportation . To a considerable extent the movement of the banks had the desired effect , and operated to repress foreign speculation . Without justifying the opposition to banks , which has to a greater or less extent prevailed in different sections of our country , and has in many instances erected itself into an open and bitter hostility , it would do injustice both to popular discrim // grounds for it have not existed . Banking has too often been conducted with utter disregard to the principle that requires the bank to possess the qualities of a capitalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evil been incurable , it is doubtful whether on the whole , the destruction of the entire system would not have led to less inconveniences , than the irre*tularities occasioned by it . But the experience of the State of New York places it beyond a doubt , that by the aid of restrictive legislation , the usefulness of the system may be preserved without diminishing the profits which invites to that mode of employing surplus capital . It has been seriously questioned whether the soundest condition of banking would not be produced by letting the banks loose from restrictive legislation , and leaving them to be regulated by the laws of competition , and of enlightened self-interest . The opinions that are held with respect to the purposes of legislation , form the great distinguishin* , feature of the two great parties of our country . On the one hand a theory prevails , that the only office of legislation is to preserve the balance of personal rights , to redress wro*s , and prevent the commission of crimes . On the other hand , a more liberal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a patron of virtue and industry . Having the promotion of the welfare of society as its object , and indeed as the foundation of its authority , no expedient ought to be deemed ille*itimate , which tends to produce that result . When the great power and influence of government are considered , it requires the strongest reasons to convince us of the propriety of denying to that authority , on any theory , the right to employ its energies for the encouragement and strengthening of industry . Such an opinion can only be justified by supposing that governments are not to be relied on as having sufficient sympathy with the pursuits of individuals . However true this may be of States , in which the sovereign authority is vested in an individual or body of men , whose pursuits have nothing in common with the pursuits of the body of the people , it is not justified by the experience of our own government . For whatever errors have been committed in legislation , the sympathy of our government has always been with the people . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in error , not even the blinding influence of party zeal , has prevented us from discovering and correcting the mistake . The state governments exhibit more instances of this character , than are to be found in the history of the federal legislation , from the fact that they embrace a wider range of objects , and have a more direct and immediate influence upon the interests of individuals . To ascertain then , where legislation may with propriety be applied , it is only necessary to consider whether the result of its application will be beneficial to the common interest . By this simple test we are to judge , whether banking should or should not be exempt from legislative restriction . Expericnce has abundantly shewn , that the law of competition is not sufficient to secure the best condition of banking . It may indeed be sufficient to render the merchant careful of his credit , and consequently restrain him from excesses ; but this is because the eye of a cautious capitalist is upon him , while with the bank no such motives operate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank , so as to restrain its operations , unless its affairs have become so involved that a premonition is lost upon it . Those operations which endanger the security of a bank , by directing its capital to improper uses , are of so secret a nature , that rarely is the condition of a failing bank accurately known , until it has become insolvent , if to meet this difficulty a provision of law is adopted , requiring the capital of the bank to be placed in such a position , that it may be commanded in the event of a failure , and that expedient is found to be attended with great public convenience* , who shall say that it is an improper or illegitimate exercise of legislative authority ? Beyond the regulation of the rate of interest on money , the law of competition has so small a restrictive power upon banks as to be unworthy of consideration . And yet the advocates of nonlegislation look to it , to correct all the evils to which banking gives rise , when it is conducted with disregard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fact , that hitherto it has become neces // sary to increase the restraints of law in order to protect the public , rather than to throw them off as useless habiliments . It can not with any propriety be said , that legislation has produced an artificial condition of banking , which can only be preserved by the constant addition of new provisions , for that science has matured itself under circumstances admitting its highest adaptation to the wants of mankind ; and the only object of legislative interposition is to circumscribe the illegitin*ate operations of banks , while banking is and should be left to the largest liberty consistent with public convenience . It is no less difficult to vindicate the propriety of conceding to the federal governmen.t , the right of adopting such a system of finance as will afford the greatest convenience to the nation . It ought to be a prominent consideration in the adoption of any governmental measure , whether by Congress or the State Legislatures , whether the interests of trade and labor are to be affected beneficially or injuriously by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibly charged with the care of those interests , as the state governments are within their spheres . Both exist to promote the same objects , and the difference between them is rather a difference of jurisdiction , than of nature or kind . To hold a contrary doctrine , would cast a suspicion upon the wisdom of our constitution . In adapting the advantages of the guaranty-system to the wants of the nation , as we have shown in the article already alluded to , no more is required of the general government than that it shall adopt a convenient mode of managing its own financial concerns , without making use of those disputed powers under which the creation of a national bank must take place . And the public advantages to be derived from such a course ought mainly to influence its adoption . In requiring this it is only asking of a popular government that its policy should originate in the interests of the people , and its measures be conformed to their wants , which was the true ideal of the framers of the constitution.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
