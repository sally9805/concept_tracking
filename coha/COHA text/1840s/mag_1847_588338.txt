txt Wira the coolness of intensity of hatred and mortification , I owned myself perfectly willing to accompany them immediately to Livingston 's office , which was in a building near by . There I related my story ; but alas ! the proofs of its truth were for ever out of my reach . Livingston , with affected nonchalance , heard me through . smiled at some of my bitterest speeches , and affected to look at me with pity , when my anger overpowered me . Then he spoke ; he drew quite a pathetic picture of our school-boy love , and , of course , his wish to see all my actions in a favorable light , until he could be blinded no more ; his grief at his discovery of my unworthiness ; and then he drew forth proof after proof of my rascality , and asked who should be believed ? the one who had never been known to perjure himself , or the one who was well proven a perjured man ? Then he told a plausible story , explaining his actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taunt he heaped upon me , with coolness and apparent sorrow , that it was but doing justice to himself to expose one he had so loved ; and thus openly to display a character he had so long shielded ; and confessed that nil which had prevented his debasing me before the world , was for the sake of the peace of my beautiful , queen-like wife . I demanded , what is generally called satisfaction ; but he coolly refused to fight with one he could // not consider a gentleman . At last he said to me , when his anger overcame his cool policy : " What dear brothers we shall be , when my son marries your daughter . " Mary , Mary , my daughter , now comes the part of my history which will madden me to tell you , and you to hear ; but be calm , for the vow I registered will not have to be cancelled ; you are safe-lay your head on my shoulder , dear child-so , there . In that dreadful quarrel there was no revenge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light with me , and he had it in his power to utterly disgrace me . But my anger was so fearful , that some revenge I must have had or I should have died . I took up pen and paper and wrote , in the bitterest terms , my hatred and defiance of him , and vowed that if my daughter should ever marry his son , I would kill her with my own hand . But , Mary , you are safe , as I said before ; the marriage was illegal-some trifling form was forgotten , which , however , saves me from my vow . Be calm , be calm-in God 's name be calm ; there is more yet for you to hear this night . Why I did not strangle Livingston , I do not know . Principle did not save me-my destiny , perhaps . By law , dear child , you can not be recognised as Edward 's wife . You are saved-perhaps for a wretched , perhaps for a happy life . That is as God wills . Day after day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only within the past few days I discovered that there was some trifling forgetfulness about the usual forms of marriage , and I have tried to be your murderer . Thank God , I am saved from that ! I have crept up , many a night , to your room , and laid my hand upon the door of your chamber , and strength has left me , for how could I strangle you in your sleep . Then I have tried to hate you , and have almost succeeded ; but more than once I have been kept from my purpose of drugging your cup , by some chance word or look that reminded me of your mother . How well , my child , you bear my story ! It is dark , indeed  --  and darkness seems to shroud your future  --  and will seem to settle still more heavily upon it when you hear all I have yet to say . But for you there is hope ; it may be far off but it must come to one so young . I doubt if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard life I must live to compass my purposes , will even court death to come to release you-then you can marry Edward . I honor and love him for your sake ; but mark me , Mary , if you should marry him before I die , I will not rest day nor night until I have fulfilled my vow . I pray and plead with you to spare me that sin . I know you will ; and in all the loneliness of these coming years , believe me , I will not rest day or night to bring comfort to you . We can talk more calmly upon this night 's revelations in future years . But I must tell the rest of these dreadful things ; and in the future , Mary , I will try and find palliations for my sin , so that you shall almost feel you could love me ; and if repentance and sorrow can aid me to seem lovable to you , then I shall ; for I am a heart-broken man . My ambition and selfishness are buried now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods , to do as much as I can to alleviate the trouble and ruin I shall soon bring upon hundreds , and that done , God grant that I may die , and then , child , perhaps the dim hope of the present , your future marriage with Edward , may be realized . " Soon after the last meeting with Livingston , he left the city for another , and year after year added honors and wealth to me . Intercourse with Edward was no longer a thorn in the flesh , I became very happy , and your mother was changing me into a gentle personage ; but she died , and with her for a time died all my energy , ambition and activity . But the reaction came , and I sprau* , from the desolation of my house and my heart to grasp the wildest dreams of ambition . To carry on my schemes , I borrowed from the vaults of the banking house of which ? was president , and succeeded in // replacing it in a few days without detection ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever might be the temptation , doing the same . Again and again was Ii tempted ; sometimes I resisted , sometimes fell . This has been my course for the last two or three years . At the time of Edward 's appeal , I was maddened by my struggles to replace some money I had taken . Since then the struggle has continued , and all things have so happened that inevitable discovery is my fate ; and in three days I shall be known to have taken at least half a million more than my property can repay . And now , Mary , this is my plan : In a few hours you must be ready to go to New-York , from there we sail to Europe in disguise , and I will place you in a convent in France . I shall yet repay all I owe and make you independent . My schemes are well matured . I have taken for capital yet more from the vaults , and in ten years 1 believe I shall accomplish all that I wish . In those ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only in my business operations , but to escape detection ; and the only cheer I can have , will be the satisfaction of seeing you not sink under these terrible afflictions , but with bravery and hope , steadily study and work . You are brave to-night , dear child . Only continue so , and the blessings of a wretched , penitent man will be yours . What is it you say , Mary ? you write to Edward ? Yes , poor child , but had it not better be only a few words ? Heaven keep you , Mary ! " and Mr. Biighton , yielding to his emotions , sobbed aloud , while Mary was calm and quiet , but it was the calmness and quietness of despair . She gently put her arm around his neck , kissed him , and then walked to the table , and with a steady hand opened the desk and wrote " Edward , dearest Edward-go to your father and ask a narrative of his acquaintance with my father . Read their written agreements and my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farewell to you . When you hear of my father 's disgrace , believe there are palliations for his crime ; and still , I pray you , let there be some portion of love in your heart for me , ever through life . Our marriage , by some slight neglect , is not strictly legal , and so , Edward , we are parted in life . I must go with my father ; and you , Heaven bless you , dear Edward ! may you be happy , and find for your wife one who can be a more obedient daughter than I have proved myself , and one who can render you happier than I might have done . But think of mepray for me . MARY . " For one moment she laid her head upon the desk and groaned aloud ; but then , with the strength of utter sorrow , that can not find hope or comfort , she left the table , moved to the door and said- " Father , will you seal and direct my note after you have read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? At nine o'clock , you say  --  and my trunks are packed . Well-Heaven help us ! " And she was gone . SKETCH THIRD . Five years rolled by , and Mr. Brighton had succeeded much beyond his wildest hopes ; and those five years had been spent by Mary as a boarder in a convent in southern France . with not the utter wretchedness of life one would imagine . There had been gleams of sunshine for her*-many times when her heart bounded with youth , and times of deep sorrow . She had borne hours of calm despair and times of listless apathy -- hours of rebellious thoughts-times of wild restlessness . But within the past few months the boon of tears had been denied her , and a settled depression of spirits , wordless , complaintless , had rested upon her ; and this he d alarmed Mr. Brighton , who watched hi* child on his occasional visits with terrible // anxiety . He now feared her mind would be wrecked in insanity . Mr. Brighton came to see her once in a few weeks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lady Abbess relative to her . The Abbess loved Mary deeply , as all did who were near her . She was one of those gifted ones who pass through the world , gaining love without the usual thorns that accompany that power of gathering love  --  the getting of envy and detraction . The sisters of the convent and the pupils loved her ; and when they saw her sad glance , and the quiet , hopeless expression on her face , they would lay a flower or gift beside her , or by some endearing caress tell her their love and sympathy . It was twilight  --  a summer twilight was almost over , and the full moon rose beautiful and bright , high in the heavens . For many an hour Mary had been lying on a couch in her parlor , in listless , sad reverie ; and now she had risen , and was st*nding by a window , which , like a door , opened upon the garden . Pushing back the muslin drapings of the niche , within which was the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening air blow upon her . The light of the moon served to show that time had given that face newer beauty ; it had deepened every line and shading of feature , and her face wore a more Madonna-like expression . Her form was somewhat thinner , but her glorious eye was not dimmed . As she stood there , the bell of the chapel at the end of the garden tolled the call to vespers , and presently , from the nunnery , glided over the great walk the white-robed nuns , with their torches in their hands , and Mary blessed them in her heart . With silence and slow step they passed on to the chapel , and soon from every window gleamed the lights of the service . She listened breathlessly for , and yet started involuntarily when , the well-known , deep , bass notes of the organ poured forth their rich sound . With volumes of harmony those notes rolled , swelled and were stilled , and again rose , until , gradually losing themselves in the high notes , they died as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentary ; a sweet , clear voice took up the strain , and another and another joined her 's ; the organ notes crept in , until , in one grand burst , it seemed , from the long , deep hush that followed , as if music had sung her strength away and gone to heaven , Then , after a time , the nuns came noiselessly over the walk . Again the great door of the nunnery swung to its place , and all was still . The religion of the scene and hour filled Mary 's heart , and she seemed to understand in all its glory the gift of being , and the connection of God and child . The hour of happy thought seemed not disturbed , only deepened , by the unexpected entrance of her father . In her joy at seeing him , and the fullness of her thought , she did not observe the unwonted paleness of his face , until he put his arm affectionately round her waist , and drawing her to the window , said : " Mary , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon an important mission . You must be prepared to hear news that will startle you , and dash to the ground many day-dreams . But Mary . love , God is love , and will comfort and gladden you with many years of happiness yet . I found , yesterday , upon a torn American newspaper , a notice of the death of a dear friend -- of Lieut . Edward Livingston ; here is the notice . " Mary took the scrap with calmness , and read : " Died , of consumption , Lieut . Edward Livingston , beloved by all who knew him . His loss is irreparable . His country has lost a brave officer , and " - . Here the paper was torn . XVithout a tear , but with a look of relief , she said : " Father , is that all ? I am so relieved ! Now , " she exclaimed . " I am at rest , for I can love and think of him as mine , without fear that he loves another and forgets me . Ah , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his having loved me , and still loving me , dashed to the ground by thinking that , possibly he is // looking back upon his love for me as upon a dream-  --  a tale that is toldasking if it were possible he ever loved me as passionately as his memory told him . The thought that he sees me , and will know , perhaps , my very thoughts , will nerve me -- will save me , father , from a dead life . The belief in his presence will be so exquisite -- so beautiful ! Earth is lovely to me now-life glorious  --  and death -- what can that be but dearer than all to me Exaltation of feeling will not rest nor take up its abode with us children of earth . In due time tears came to Mary -- storm and fever : and when life came back to her it did not seem always the glorious thing it was to her in the first hours of her bereavement , but a blank , objectless , aimless existence . How often in life must the loving heart clothe itself in sackloth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SItETCH FOTJRTH . Heard you ever of a heroine of a love-tale who was forty years old . Never , perhaps , in the stories of the day ; and yet we may read many when eternity tells us the stories of past time . When the histories of life shall be told in heaven , we shall see that all-startling incident does not belong , as the novelists would have us fain believe , to youth . We shall find , as age creeps upon us , that though the heart grows old many times in life , so that we could often say , Now I am even ninety : -I have passed through all the severe conflicts of life I can ; - nought can move me more-nought can carry me beyond a pleasant cheerfulness into great joy , so that again I feel young ; - yet , blessed be God , the heart can and does become young again , though the body be old ; we live many life-times in one life . Yes , Mary is forty years old , and married . Mrs. Leger she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of youth , however ; her hair is silvernot silver*d , but silver . Illness , care and sorrow have dimmed her glorious eye , arid changed her complexion to a yellow , sallow tint . She bears marks of age uncommon for her years-there are deep lines in her face , but her form is unbent ; her silver hair is very becoming and luxuriant , and is combed plainly down over her face but there is beauty of expression , the beauty of a lovely soul visible in the face , and with , of course , the addition of a carefully cuhivated mind arid a rare intellect , for these are great enrichers and beautifiers of soul , heart and face . Yes , she was still beautiful . It was evening , and her last evening in Paris before her return to England from a continental tour . She was at the house of a wealthy Marquis , who gave that evening a fdte in honor of his guests . Mr. Leger was a man honored and known in the literary , political , and benevolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary , had not lost any of her peculiar attractive powers , and the best , the most talented , as usual , sought her that evening . Mr. Leger seemed unusually silent . The day had been an exciting day , the last ty be spent for many mouths with his dear friend the Marquis ; and beside , he had heard that day that some great political measure he had advocated witl his pen and influence had been successful . So , a proud and a silent man was he ; silent from an intensity of feeling and happiness . With a sigh , however , he turned from the circle of his wife as he asked himself , " Why could she not have loved me as I love her , and so should not have to accept her mere friendship ? " Then the thought came to him , such a murmur was wrong ; he had entered into the marriage with no expectation of such love , and he should be satisfied with the earnest friendship of such an one ; and then , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much resembled her mother , loved him passionately , and again he moved on with a chastened // but praiseworthy pride . For it is by faith that only the noble and great can love ; - it requires heart , soul , and mind ; and there is but little of love in its holiness and strength in the world ; there are many approaches to it though , blessed be God . Mrs. Leger was alone , excepting one young admirer who had been expressing admiration in rather fulsome terms . " A truce to compliments , " she said ; " I dislike them , excepting in hours when one must see them gushing from true respect or love : but these maskings in the robes of love and respect come but lamely into common intercourse , and then I always feel as if a person who places another in an awkward position by flattery either thinks one very silly and vain , or is himself silly and vain , and to be admired himself will even give away some choice bit , when his hungry vanity longs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak plainly to you , but I am like a kind physician , " she said , looking into her companion 's face , " and love best when I wound . To be sure , you Englishmen might even adopt the sin of flattery as somewhat graceful drapery to your hauteur , and possibly I may perceive it as a sin in you more than else I might , were you not an Englishman . " The young man colored , but said he kissed the provoked hand that held the rod . " And now , " she continued , " we have been so long in France that we are really beginning to study the philosophy of catering to the mind and heart in the same fashion that we do to the palate ; and as we have both partaken for the last few moments of a sauce which requires an acquired taste to like , let us send away the unpalatable condiment , the gift and reception of advice , and have some sweet dish of music , or books , or jest . By the bye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he say to our proposed tour to the Hebrides ? " At this moment an acquaintance said to her , " Mrs. Leger , allow me to introduce a friend to you . " She raised her eyes , beautiful still , and saw before her-Edward Livingston who bowed as to a stranger . One glance told her he did not recognize her ; and the strength that comes so blessedly at trying moments came to her , and after a few passing common remarks , Edward and his friend moved away . Edward , whom she had mourned as dead , and thought of as her guardian angel , was living , and had seen her , spoken to her , and had not known her ! How eagerly she longed to ask had he forgotten her-did he love her still-was he married ? but her tongue was chained , her brain giddy , her cheek pale , and glad was she to take the arm of Mr. Leger , and pleading the heat of the room as a cause for her partial faintness , seek the piazza for fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence she stood , not heeding the glory of the evening ; her heart keenly suffering , and longing for the wings of the dove , or that a voice from heaven might direct her how to act , when her husband broke the silence : " Mary , dear , I love to see you so much impressed and delighted with a scene like this ; impressed even to silence , you are capable of such deep enjoyment and sorrow , that 1 would cast all things beautiful in your path . I imagine all who love must feel somewhat as I do , and yet I see those whom I know love deeply , love selfishly-hut my love is not selfish , I believe . When I first sought you , Mary , and you talked of your love for another , whose very name I knew not , I could have called him froth his grave , had such been my power , to make you happy , so brieved was I to know you a mourner ; and I pressed you again and again to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you were so alone , sad , fatherless , and friendless , excepting the friendship of my dying mother . I saw your position in its sadness , and knowing what a great heart yours was , sand felt its restlessness would be comforted by a friendship for a kind husband and love for your children ; and although the beauty of an earnest love has never been your gift to me , II have been happy and blessed in your friendship . " // These kind words but increased her wretchedness tenfold . Had they been said but an hour before , she could have told him that her second love was almost as deep as the first ; but the old spell was on her again Edward had been seen , and her heart , so strangely stirred , could not utter what she longed to say to comfort the noble being beside her , for ' it would be now untrue . Yes , Edward , the same and yet how different , . she still loved Time , which steals away from woman 's beauty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes her chief beauties , . - softness of complexion , and lustre of her eye* Edward , with his host , interrupted the broken reply of Mrs. Leger , and a second introduction took place : " Colonel Livingston , Mrs. Leger . " Again she bowed , and she saw that still he did not recognize her . Mr. Leger felt the hand laid upon his arm tighten its grasp , but he scarcely heeded it ; and as she continued silent , the gentlemen both began and upheld the conversation , and again , with beating heart and almost maddened brain , Mary listened to Livingston 's eloquent words and thoughts . Presently Grace , her little daughter , came to her mother , , sleepy and wearied with the night 's excitement . The mother in her weakness could scarcely put her arm about her , but she did so , and whispered , " In a moment , love , I will go with you to your room . " Edward looked at the child , and his interest seemed in a few minutes changed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child to an intense interest , and coming to her side be put his hand upon her head and said , " Look up , my child . " The little girl* surprised , shook back her curls , and looked up . " My God ! " was the exclamation that burst from his lips , and Grace , escaping from his hand , he leaned against the balustrade , and covering his face in his hands , he wept . As soon as he recovered from the emotion that overpowered him , and saw that they were surprised , even to forget the usual apparent indifibrence of politeness , . said , " My exclamation , my tears , are caused by the wonderful resemblance existing between the child and one whom I have long mourned , and shall ever mourn. ** Motionless , breathless , as if turned to stone , Mrs. Leger listened to all that passed , and after a few words of sympathy from her companion , heard the conversation again gracefully fallen into , though scarcely by Edward . The last words she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he will visit us when we have our winter household in Derbyshire ; he will be a valuable acquisition to our six weeks ' party . " When the hours of sleep came over the household , Mrs. Leger thought of the past , present , the dread future ; and , asking help from on high , arranged her plans relative to Livingston , and well did she keep them . When he came to their hospitable country-house in England , she treated him courteously but distantly , and strove not to think of him , not to watch him . It seemed impossible , she thought , that her identity with his lost Mary would ever be traced . She went to the convent under an assumed name , and her real name had not been known in Europe . She had told Mr. Leger that her name was an assumed one , but he did ' not wish to know her real one , or the name of the husband of her youth . He had known and loved her as Mary Walton , and as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the addition of Leger to it ; and as to the other name , if he ever heard a name like it , he said it would sadden him to think the love given him must be the love only of friendship . During her stay at the convent her father had died , without a near relative there , - her uncle and aunt dead ,  --  Edward , as she believed , dead ,  --  what did // she care to return to America ? She loved the Abbess and sisters , and the quiet , industrious life she had led for so many years ; she would stay with them all her life . But Mrs. Leger came to the south of France for her health ,  --  chose the convent for her winter 's residence , learned to love Mary , and be loved by her ,  --  took her to England , and was happy in being able at last to call her daughter before she died . Mrs. Leger reasoned well , and was right in her course of action . Mr. Leger 's sufferings would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , that if it could be preserved it must be , and Edwards most poignant grief must have . passed . He mourned for his youthful bride-not the present Mary ; - he could not recognize his Mary in the Mary Leger ; as for herself , she could suffer , alone and in silence . He visited them in England , as I said before , and he reverted but once in her hearing to his sad past life , when he said that his history had been too sorrowful almost to think upon ; but she knew how he must love the memory of his loved and lost by the affection he showed for Grace , and by the constant watching every movement of her 's , and the eloquent tear in his eye sometimes . She was 50 little with him , that but one unpleasant contretemps took place : one morning a lady said , as Edward , Mary , and herself were standing together , watching the gentlemen assemble in the court for a hunt , " Why , Mrs. Leger , here am I with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in league together for treason and strategy , as your place of birth would lead us loyalists to believe ? Did you know Mrs. Leger in America , Colonel Livingston ? " " Mrs. Leger an American ? Why , I did not know that . Strange that I should not ; what was your name there , Mrs. Leger ? " Her cheek grew deadly pale as she said , " You do not remember of ever meeting with one Mary Walton , do you ? " He looked at her somewhat bewildered , as if a suspicion crossed him that that face had been seen before by him , but apparently became satisfied that he had not , said , " Mary Walton , no ; but it seems to fne , had I ever met you , Madame , I should have remembered you . " Then , after some conversation about America , Mrs. Leger made some excuse to leave them , and hurrying into her room , as often she had done before , in bitterness of woe , locked the door , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comfort . When Edward left them and England for his home , she felt even more sadly than she had prepared herself for-more alone . She thought she had bade him farewell in life . But Providence had ordered it otherwise . He came again to Europe with consumption plainly written on his cheek and in his eye . During the two or three years of his travelling in search of health , they met once or twice , and he was again their guest at gay evening or dinner parties . God had willed that his last hours should be spent at Mrs. Leger 's house . He had come to England to embark for home ,  --  to go h orne to die ; but he had not thought the evil hour as near as it was . He went to London to wait some few days for letters , and had accepted Mr. Leger 's earnest invitation to stay with him at his house , as there many luxuries and kindnesses awaited him that were not to be had at a hotel . The day after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his lot ; and day after day passed in the same torture , and it was evident he must die . He could not have been moved from the house had Mr. Leger even been willing to have had him , and at last the hour came for him to die-shall I tell of it ? And one day , before his death-hour , he spoke of Mary to Mary-shall I tell of it ? 1irs . Leger had been reading to him from the Bible . The pale sufferer lay in his bed while the soft summer air played among the white muslin // drapings of the bed , and as he lay there , his was a glorious face to look upon , lighted up as it seemed , almost , with some of the beauty heaven must soon give to so beatified and good a spirit . The physician and Mr. Leger had interrupted the reading , and had just left . Mrs Leger was seated on the bed , which was quite low , and her heart was awe-struck , for that question had been just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can live through the night ? " and the answer had been- " Before morning I hope to hear you are at peace-your sufferings over . " Mrs. Leger rested her head on her hand , and thought with fearful intenseness . She was roused from her earnest questionings into the mysteries of life and death , by the low , weak voice of the dying man . " So , death is really in the room , " he said , " and waiting by me , indeed , while the one great and dear purpose of my life has not been accomplished . I have referred , " he said , after a pause , " to my past life as having had much sadness in it . I will tell you all of my life 's history , how I lived and lost one dearer than life to me . I will tell you not in words , but through my journal . Read it when 1 am gone1 an d then you will see how madly and vainly I have sought my beautiful Mary ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having seen her-without knowing where she is-that makes death bitter indeed . If I could only know where she is , I could die content ; but still , patience , a few more hours and possibly I shall know all . " Said Mrs. Leger , earnestly- " Could you bear to know about her now , when she must have lost the charms of youth and beauty , and when , if she were by , you might not recognise her ? " " Ah ! " said he , " it seems to me I could never see Mary without knowing her ; some chance word or tone would bring all remembrance , and all love back to me . But , oh ! if I could only know that she does not suffer . " At that moment Mr. Leger returned , and that night they both watched with him . Contrary to all expectations , he lived through the night , and the next day the physicians , finding him still alive , thought that he might live a few days more , possibly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at last was well enough to leave his bed , and take his place of rest in a large easy chair . It was evening . The moon shone into the chamber , and the night lamp was shaded far off in the room . The nurse was dismissed for an hour or two , and Mrs. Leger took her past , though not the nurse 's place , for she sat upon a low seat at his feet . They had been silent for a few moments , and at last Edward said , " I have been thinking to-day , as I often have , how Mary must be changed , and I can not picture her as otherwise than beautiful and youn , , . " He drew from his bosom a small miniature , enclosed in a case of gold . Touching the spring , the lid flew open , and Mrs. Leger recognised herself in the loveliness of her youth . Mrs. Leger sighed . for she did not think it strange he did not see Mary Brighton in the Mrs. Leger with silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears , and an evident incapability of speaking , from emotion ; then rousing hersel , she rose , and bringing a guitar from its hiding place , sang a song , composed , oh ! years ago , and set to music by Edward . At first , he looked at her with involuntary surprise , although it was no new thing to hear her sing , but her singing now seemed so ill-timed , but the song touched his heart . " Strange I " he exclaimed , when she had finished , " it seems familiar , as if I had heard it ; but no matter , I ca n't recollect it . Sing again my dear Mrs. Leger . " Again she sang , but with faltering voice ; it was a song she often had heard him praise and love . It affected him so that he wept , and said , " Ah ! my life seems sad , indeed , when I hear that song . Mary used to sing it , and now death has come with my search for her all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign land-no , not alone , dear Mrs. Leger ; but let us not talk any more // 245 of my sad self ' , for you seem burdened and oppressed with my sorrow . Sing to me again . " She did not comply with his request ; but , after running over a few chords , played waltzes that she used to play in her youth . Presently , Edward 's hand was laid heavily upon her shoulder . She looked up . Earnestly , long , and inquiringly he gazed into her face . " Mary ? " he asked at length , " Edward , I am Mary , " she answered , and burying her face in her hands , she sobbed aloud . The sick man shed no tear , but with hands clasped and eyes upraised , he seemed to be communing with God . " Oh , my Father ! " he exclaimed , " how I thank thee that I have , at last , seen Mary , and bless thee that now 1 know her lot is cast in pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and want . Bless , oh ! God , the remainder of her life , and may we meet in heaven ! " After a few moments ' silence , he said , " Mary , Marylook up ! Mary , once loved , ever loved , now loved , I bless thee , dearest , dearest Mary ! We have both suffered , indeed-there are traces of suffering in thy face ; but thou art still dear to me , oh ! so dear . Ah ! I am rejoiced that this discovery was not made before by me ; but how sad must have been your recognition , though your old love had passed away-no , not passed away-that can never be , but chastened .
