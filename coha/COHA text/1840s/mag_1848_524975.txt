txt WE propose to consider this subject categorically , That is , we design to start from a fixed point in intellectual space , and produce ideas in an absolute right line to another point . The order of the category will be new , and by no means syllogistic , yet we hope to proceed by a natural gradation , and , if the reader will beindulgent , we will endeavor to make it pleasant to follow . It will be thought , perhaps , a very remote point from the one indicated by the title , to begin with an essay on MANNERS . But we rely on our ability to make it appear not so as we go on . MANNERS , then , are necessary to man because of his possessing a conscious soul . The brutes that lack discourse of reason are without them . They do not think what they do , nor do they seek to affect their kind otherwise than through the various blind instincts with which they are endowed . Even among those orders possessing the largest amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity , we discover only rude indications of manners . Among the great herds of apes who throng the wildernesses of*South Africa , travellers have not been able to observe any indications of an aristocracy based on other grounds than that of superiority in strength and ferocity . Neither can monkeys be taught manners , in any true sense of the word . True , we remember a monkey who used a large wooden eyeglass , and took off his cap on being presented with pennies , but it did not appear that he fully comprehended the purport of his actions , and the courtesy which is manifested under the dread of immediate personal chastisement is not of the right breed . The Caffrarian criimpanzees exhibited at the museum have had as good opportunities as any of their kind with whom we have been personally acquainted , yet beyond a childish way of showing displeasure by pouting out the lips , they appear quite destitute of manners .

Generally speaking , however , monkeys , and all the inferior brute creation , are an unmannerly order of existences . They are simply " earnest creatures . " Whatever they undertake to do they set about zealously , and without the least tegard to appearances . They belong to the physical force party . They have no presiding consciousness , no sense of position , no respect for character , no ideas of propriety , grace , or beauty . Man can only resemble them when he is , not insane merely , but in a state of extasy , acting from pure impulse . For it is impossible for a man , whether savage or civilized , to divest himself of his faculty of seeing himself as an object , and knowing that others can read his character in his looks and actions as well as in his words . That there are men who approach very nearly , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or obtuse as almost to lose this personal consciousness , is no argument against the general trath . These are exceptions . The mass of mankind have an ever-present sense of propriety and impropriety in the motions of their bodies and limbs . They control themselves in their attitudes with respect to the opinions of those around them , and their own notions of elegance . They know that qualities of character convey habits to the body , and they naturally wish to appear well to each other . Hence every nation has its code of manners , and as human nature is the same in all , so the general ideas of what manners express are much the same the world over . A dignified carriage is the same in Persia , in China , in civilized Europe , and on the westerr* prairie . The manly heart is conquered by revelations of tenderness given through graces not much varied by fashion in every quarter of the earth 1848. 283 // Custom does but reach the outer rind of manners .

The bearing of men towards each other in the daily contacts of life must have been in Greece and Rome very n*uch what it is in New-York , and not materially different even in the antediluvian period . Our bodies being of the same general mould , and the various passions and purposes of the soul being generally resemblant , it is not very wonderful that there should be a general consent in all the great families of mankind as to the elements of manners . The race have concluded , ( with but a single exception that we ever rcad of , ) that it is more becoming to carry about this forked body on its two legs than upon all fours . In no part of the globe would it be considered a token of respect for one to strike another in the face . Moreover , we all , or nearly all , wear clothes .

L* aside our clothing and the reservation imposed on us by manners , and in what should we differ from our cousins the apes ? There would be no other mode of settling disputes than to fall to , pell mdl , and fight it out . This would be an extension of the inalienable rights of freemen to which we may be confident the species will never attain , through all its phases of progression . Whatever the French madams may write , woman is still an intellectual creature , possessing the faculty of choice , and capable of deep affection .

Man also , as age comes upon him , and those that he loves and would make happy spring up around him , finds a necessity that he shou , ld intrench himself within the barrier of ceremonies . In fine , manners are the first fruit of our conscious reason . The first act of human intelligence , after the animal impulses , is to clothe the body ; and this clothing is the first evidence of the living soul . The existence of manners is the next . We can not utter ourselves , ** as it is called , except through these old modes . We may , it is true , strive to avoid reason , and resolutely talk nonsense , or assume strange eccentricities . Men constantly contrive to exhibit their folly in one way or another .

It is not so easy a matter for men to escape themselves , and make themselves believe that they are somebody else . Whatever we do , or say , or think , is under the superintendence of the ConsCious reason . When we " utter ourselves , " we know what we are uttering . When we allow ourselves to be intoxicated with passion or with wine , we know it before and after , and often at the time , though we will not then perchance admit it . The life of our souls is such that we see ourselves . We know all the while , to use a New England expression , " what we are about . " We are obliged to contain ourselves , *nd put on clothes and conform to manners . The infinity of our faculties is subject to the nobility of our reason . Tempests and whirlwinds pass over our being , to which we must not succumb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hearts ; were it not for the judgment , and the strong bonds of the manners it imposes upon us , the common experience of life should make savages of us at once , and set all the world to cutting each other 's throats . What is the use of living ? Is it for the hope of enjoyment ? The aged tell us that is but a dream . Experience teaches the same lesson . Each passing year brings on a heavier burden than its predecessor . Let 284 Sept. , // any one look forward with unbienched gaze into the probable future , and ask himself what he is likely to gain by cumbering the earth a few years longer . Care and sorrow increase with age , and most of the wisest who have declined far into the vale have been glad to lie down and rest . We all know the sors inevitabilis .

Is there any motive , when we look into the very truth of things , which should hold us here any longer ? Can we by argument convince ourselves that it is not better to be out of the world at once ? Suppose , then , we were to yield to what appears most reasonable , and truly " utter ourselves , " what other could we say than " Let us depart in peace ? " The united voice of mankind would testify that there is nothing in life worth living for . And the same voice would also bear witness that as far as appears to our reason , there is no life beyond the grave . But this is written for a Christian audience , and here is no place for a sermon . The point is this : we have seen that manners are the fruit of the consciou* reason . But they and the reason which controls them are not all of us . We are imperfect , in an imperfect world , and our religion teaches us *o bear up bravely to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in short , and it is noble as well as our duty to make the best of life till the king of terrors comes and takes us away . We must look upward . We must persevere in those ways which are best for ourselves , and kindest for those around us . We must remember in whose image we were created , and not hate our fellow-men . We must imitat.e the loftiness of our great poets , and never lay down the love of knowledge and beauty , and the heart 's gallantry . Age must not wither us , nor the petty cares of existence break our spirits . Or if we must consider life apart from the all-commanding precepts of our religion , there is a prou* satisfaction in bearing the banner of strength as a signal for others , and in saying , " We feel-we feel it all , but we will not yield ! " " The innocent brightness of a new-born day Is lovely yet ; The clouds that gather round the setting sun Do take a sober coloring from an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Considering it , not as a duty , but as a natural impulse of our nature , we do feel a satisfaction in giving others as much as possible of the fruit of our experience . Every one that is not a bad man wishes well to those around him . He desires to help in the work of progress , to instruct those who know less , to learn of those who know more , to make the world he lives in happier . He has compassion for suffering , and pity for ignorance . He wishes to smooth the asperities of the rough journey to himself and all with whom he is brought in contact . Now , the question is , in what way can we accomplish most to the purpose ? It must be recollected that every one , how benevolent soever he may be , must live the greater portion of his life for himself . He must attend to his business , and he has a right to domestic comforts .

Some remnant of their fears . Manners are catching . The Christian faith is , however , not inconsistent with literature .

To conquer conceit we have a right to assume dignity ; to assist timidity we may put on a feigned familiarity . We are at liberty to retain with all a personal reserve which ' shall permit us to be alone everywhere , which shall be , if possible , impervious to the most searching glance of man or woman . It is permitted us to take for granted the certainty of what we know , and to use our knowledge either through arguments , similes , or personal sway , not as uttering ourselves , but as working a machine , while standing aloof , in a secret , undisturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we npprehend , that the true answer is to he found to the question propounded in the previous paragraph . All grades and conditions of life are separated by manners . The rude have one species , the refined another . The best manners , those which are most graceful , while they permit , when it is needed , the completest personal reserve with the utmost delicacy towards others , are at once the offspring and the defence of refinement . Whea it is needed , we say , that is when our comfort or our benevolence demands it . But in general the endeavor to conform to certain manners has a reflex influence upon the character . What is at first assumed , is ? time becomes more real , and habit finally makes it almost second nature . Thus the consciousness of manner , which we can assume at will , is not ever-present with us , and hence this personal reserve , which we are at liberty to use in circumstances trying to the nerves , or for the purpose of improving others , is not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are as unconstrained with good manners as with bad ones ; the only difference is in the magnitude of our sphere . With the manners of* a clown we should feel uncomfortable ( supposing we had the wit to distinguish ) among gentlemen ; but with the manners of a gentleman we are not to be disconcerted by the presence of clowns . We can affect ease , and retire into ourselves . To recur now to the question , " what is the best mode of bettering others with the least inconvenience to oneself ? " We answer , not by teaching alone , not by argui*ent alone , or persuasion or authority , or any laborious agitation , but by the silent power of the imagination operating through our deportment . There are many young around us all agog with shallow philosophy ; we can not spare the time to explain everything to them ; they wo n't believe us if we attempt it . There are many old also quite ignorant and opinionated-many conceited who can argue forever-many stubborn , unpleasant , malicious , coxcombical : must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set down for an impertinent meddlesome fellow ? No . Yet we owe it to ourselves , no less than to our Maker , to do as much good as we can in our day and generation . And so wisely ordered is the system of the universe , that we can accomplish much through our simple behavior , and without interrupting seriously our own business or interfering greatly with our rational enjoyment-merely in the course of our daily walk and conversation-by means of our MANNERS . There are two sorts of manners , good manners and bad . Just as in the world among all classes there are two sorts of men-one including those who keep the world up ; the other those who bear it down . These sorts of men and manners exist under all conventionalities and in all forms and races . The roughest old sailor that ever sailed the sea may he a good man and may have good manners . That is , he may be an honest fellow , full of high resolution , hope , progress , and all that , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a certain healthful and sustaining influence upon his shipmates . He may be incapable of littleness and meanness , and his nervous system ( for it comes to that in the extremes of existence ) may be so firm that he shall impart life and vigor to those who are brought in contact therewith . On the other hand , a man may be nursed in the usages of the most refined society , and still be very bad-mannered-a perpetual irritation to his associates . This does not affect our doctrine of the necessity of manners and the lawfulness and advantage of good ones . Neither does it admit that manners , though in a sense dependent on character , can not be 286 Sept. , // considered and discussed separately . All good men are not good-mannered , nor all bad ones perceptibly ill-mannered . There are many benevolent persons who make themselves and every one else rather worse than better for being with them ; and there are also plenty who by the charm of manners deceive eyes as keen as Uriel 's , " The sharpest-sighted spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only lawful to use manners as a means of improvement , but we must do so , if we would not have the battle fought in our own country instead of the enemy s . Hence also it is not enough to know much and mean well , and then to set out to argue and vex and perplex the world under the notion of reforming it . Hence , in fine , there is a reason for putting on the best manners , and a reason why the disregard of manners is wrong . We have no right to condescend to equalize ourselves with our inferiors in endless wordconflicts , when , by maintaining towards them a benevolent and polite intangibility , we may encourage them to strive for a higher position . We have no right to degrade our rank in social life . A man who after long study and rough experience has gained a position where he ought to claim some respect , is not at the mercy of every talker ; it is his duty to keep himself where he knows he belongs . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitate the unrefined . True progress , ( to speak in abstract words ) gives birth to a deportment which attracts the inferior to the superior , to a dignity in the high which it is most beneficial in the low to emulate , to manners which elevate by the force of imitation . Suppose A. , for example , to be a gentleman of learning and good taste ; let B. be also a gentleman of a little learning and less taste , but very much disposed to evaporate in opinions . Their relative rank in the intellectual scale shall be expressed thus- A. B. If now A. descends to B. , places himself with him as an undisguised " self-utterer , " and endeavors to talk him up , he only lowers himself . Thus- A. B. For B. does not like to be taught when he thinks he knows ; he is only confirmed in error by the discovery how well he can use his battledore with A. Whereas if A. remains quietly in his original position , byand-by B. begins to admit that what used to seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point from which he viewed it . He lives on and finds out more and more that A. has been before him in many particulars , and gained some true ideas . Thus in process of time he gains in knowledge and refinement , till he stands where A. did when the progress commenced . ThusA . B. B. is now in his turn leading on C. And thus we obtain for a result a constant advancement ; whereas by the other course we fall into perpetual declension . That it is a difficult and often an unpleasant duty to preserve a high station , need not be remarked to those whom circumstances have compelled to mingle much with their inferiors in social rank . For persons of quick sensibility and genial temper , it is a very hard matter to sustain sufficient aloofness from all sorts of people with whom they are brought in contact for the good of either . Some , it is true , can " keep up their dignity , " as the saying has it , quite instinctively ; but the very ease with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hence is of little benefit to others , while it prevents them from profiting by the knowledge that others are improving through their example . These sort of people care very little , in fact , whether either are being bettered or made worse ; they think only of themselves , and love display or power . Such dignity as theirs belongs not to good manners ; it is not politeness , but the indulgence of selfish egotism . In the young it is the upstart propensity which it is part of the business of the truly well-mannered to check and eradicate . In the old it is pomposity , which it is not in every instance against good manners to ridicule. 1848. 287 // In presuming , however , that we are addressing sensible readers , we avoid the necessity of making over-nice distinctions . The " high station " and " aloofness " which superiors ought to maintain towards inferiors is not a stiff , haughty , or reserved demeanor , a painful rigidity of muscle , speech , or action . Such manners separate the parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of good feeling , hut of contempt . The true dignity is assumed csut of kindness and tempered with sincerity . It is of the kind which separates the orders of the angels in Heaven , " Where honor and due reverence none neglects . " It is a behavior put on and worn out of benevolence to others . Or , if we must have everything from selfish motives , to keep one 's nerves quiet . Every man acquires somewhat of this by the compulsion of experience . Among schoolboys it is not regarded too great familiarity to strike one another over the back , or make one 's wishes known by tweaks and pinches . Very soon , however , except in the most vulgar and promiscuous castes and among intimate companions , young men find it necessary to fence themselves about with ceremonies . Sudden blows and grips disturb the nerves , and wound the self-respect . Most people have , or ought to have , too good an opinion of themselves to permit their persons to be tr*ted with so much indignity . No/i me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only contact of man with man should be a brief pressure of hands , or touching of noses , such as is practised among the New Zealanders . Frenchmen may embrace one anotherpah ! One should as lief embrace a boa or a bear as the best friend he has in the world . We knew a man who made it a cause of instant reproof when another slapped him on the knee  --  and justly , too . Such familiarities are unbecoming in gentlemen ; not because they are against the code of etiquette , but because they do not comport with the refined individuality which gentlemen wish to preserve . Indeed we are not certain that there is not in such extreme freedoms , as we have instanced , a perceptible magnetic repulsion . At all events , they shock the nerves to that extent that they are inadmissible in refined intercourse . Some will say , " What foolery is this ! As if it made much difference how we behave towards each other among friends , so long as we are decently clad and disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such persons that we are writing . They will not be able to follow the thought in this piece , and will be ready to throw the Review aside and doubt whether they will subscribe another year to such a missnancy production . But there are some very influential individuals who have nerves as well as we . We allude to the American Fair . We mean not to be schoolmasterish or precise , but only to show , that in desiring us savages to have some regard for each other 's feelings and behave with courtesy to one another , our sisters and cousins are less unreasonable than they are aware of . In Cincinnati , perhaps , several years ago , we lived at a large boarding-house , where among other guests was a poor actor , whose name was-well-Matthews ; a mere walking gentleman on the boards , a " perfect stick , " in fact , somewhat advanced in years , but made up with care , and looking ordinarily a pale and somewhat careworn bachelor of thirty-five or forty . He was as poor as poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been more than ten dollars per week , and more frequently it was nothing at all . How he contrived to keep on good terms with the landlady was a mystery ; yet he did so , and so far as was known spent no man 's money but his own . In coats and hats he was obliged to economize , and one might behold the same individual on the stage in the evening whom he had seen on the side-walk in the morning . But in linen he allowed himself more latitude , and after his landlady 's , the next heaviest of his bills was probably that of his laundress . Poor Matthews ! And yet , without his presence Mrs. Feedum 's house would not have been fit to live in . For he sat at the foot of the table and carved the turkey , and was the medium through which everybody endeavored to amuse everybody else . He was esteemed by everybody , and everybody on arriving at the house was told that Mr. Matthews was a " gentleman , " which , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people he is ambitious and conceited ; in that of the ignorant he is extremely wise and independent ; for it is to the ignorant that he looks for support . He does not think of desiring the respect of the educated or the refined . Indeed , he hates all who are better instructed than himself . It does not suit him that any should know more than he . His first ,  --  notion seems to be that the world lay in ignorance till the era of his birth , and that he was sent here to teach it . Consequently he combines in himself all knowledge , and has reasons for all topics . If ever he disclaims to know the Whole , it is with some such remark as " We have not looked into this subject yet , but when we do , then there will be an end of it . " He thinks he has discovered a mode of reforming the moral Universe , and is more arrogant in arraigning the wisdom of the Creator than was the ancient king of Arragon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of defiance . Of course Job is a " friend of Humanitv . " He is the friend of whatever is Down . He overflows with benevolence for anything he can Patronize . He is eager for the admiration of the undiscerning , but cares not how much he exposes himself to the ridicule of the refined . He is never able to reach a satisfactory l6vel of humility . A plain man he-so modest ! One of the mass-nothing more . His style of writing , which is his manner *efore the public-we have watched it go down and down , in proportion as Job has grown Notorious and Meek . He writes now in the spirit of a persecuted saint , and in the phrases of the streets aud bar-rooms . He does not keep up good manners in his style , but appeals to the sympathies of the coarse . When we observe the low phrases that occur so frequently in that newspaper , and more particularly , mark the whining spirit which pervades it , we can not but regret that it goes every morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency must be to encourage littleness of thought and coarseness of speech . Its manners are vulgar , and such communications , the copy-book teaches us , are to be shunned . There are several other papers published now in Jeffersonville , neither of which ( of those that can claim to be re spectahle ) exercises so debasing an influence upon the public taste , and tends so directly against refinement , as the Oracle . Job Stew must be a man the very antipodes of our old friend Matthews . He is an artist in ill manners . By the first of these two examples we have intended to show how healthful may be the influence , under every disadvantage of position , of an elevated ideal of character and a firm persistence , in the manners and habits growing out of it ; by the second , how necessary it is that we should endeavor to keep up the distinctions of manners , when it is so common for the unrefined and unscrupulous to obtain a vulgar popularity by disregarding them . Next to the duty of procuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more specially upon men than that of preserving the character and bearing of gentlemen . It is taught by Christianity and by the nobler part of our *ature . We are not to yield too far to the importunity of sympathy , or the pride of ignorance . We have a right to enjoy the higher life of refinement , while we encourage others to do the same . We surely may be permitted to select our company , and to surround ourselves with what shall tend to promote our comfort and quiet . We may avoid those contacts that offend our sensitiveness and disturb the repose of our nervous system . It would be better for all mankind if we could control our passions and vicious propensities , and live in a millennial peace . Our reason as well as our religion says , " Be ye perfect . " The only true progress is the progress towards perfection . But now the inquiry arises , which way lies this perfection , and how shall we make towards it the surest and speediest advances ? for that we are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This brings us back at once to the question before propounded , viz. , " What is the best mode of bettering others with the least inconvenience to oneself ? " We apprehend that what has been snid of manners , with respect to individuals , is applicable by the most natural analogy to societies ; and that hence , in order to preserve a high state of refinement in a nation , the educated classes must seek to elevate and purify the uneducated , not by going 290 Sept. , // to their level and yielding too far to natural pity , but by preserving themselves in quietness , and influencing them by the force of example . For to refine a nation , there should be an elevated national feeling . A gentlemanly nation should be of a noble spirit , anxious to be j ast within itself and to its compeers , free in thought , speech , and action , not intemperate or quick to be offended , but severe towards crime . In barbarous states of society , men nningle each other 's bodies , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the injurer is left to the relatives of the injured ; the public takes no note of it . Here the only law is the permission to avenge . If in New Zealand a man eats his friend , his friend 's friends may eat him . Men there have enough to occupy their attention to prevent being devoured . In all countries where the rights of the person are not strictly watched over by society , there is more or less apprehension constantly present , to embitter life and put back the growth of the arts of peace . Few individuals in demi-savage states ever attain to the enjoyment of " an elegant leisure . " The majority are occupied in providing food , acquiring barbarism 's rude substitutes for civilized luxury , or waging war upon each other . " What is refinement ? " some Athenian may inquire . " For my part , " he may say , " give me the rude , healthful life of chivalry or the border wars . Or let me , since these are past , push away for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living cooped in by these iron bars of ceremony . " All this may be , without touching general truth . In fact , one 's very refinement , coupled with poverty and extreme sensitiveness , whereby he lacks the power to keep up manners , may lead him to prefer a life of adventure , with the sweet repose of solitude , to one of security , with the harassing annoyances of vulgarity . This is refinement existing with constitutional weakness , for which it is in no sense B answerable . The true refinement is simply the largest life . It is preserving as long as we can the youth of the soul , the vision and the dream . It is keeping up through experience those old poetic states which all go through at some time or other , though some appear to outgrow them in the cra dle . It is avoiding , as far as possible , the necessity of strictly curbing ourselves with reason . It is putting far away the evil day when the bright flush of youth must be supplanted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the true pioneers of refinement , are the strongest of all men . They see and feel more than others , and trail the clouds of glory further down the declivity of time . Oh , let not us , who are yet in the vaward of youth , believe that with them the cold judgment always kept uppermost-that the whole soul did not at some time move together in barmony . They , the high priests of Love and Beauty , keep alive upon the earth the worship of those care-charming divinities . With them , though time brings the inevitable knowledge of good and evil , there remain golden memories , and they enjoy a second youth in the sympathies of those who succeed them . There are old men who live upon the strength of the young , who are ever eager to lift the veil from before the face of innocence , and plant in hearts where confidence grows wild , the poisonous herb suspicion . These are they who carry into age nothing of life 's prime ; they presume that all must be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do wisely in teaching hypocrisy and deceit , and in making the young resemble themselves . Hoary impostors ! Some such every observer must have seen , who seemed kept alive on the verge of time by some presension of that fire which is to be their element hereafter . They linger here breathing death over life after the period when they might look for oblivion to shield them from our execrations . With such and the young there is no bond , no sympathy . Their ways only excite awe in the weak , and contempt in the discerning . They are by themselves . They are double-faced . They can pass from the performance of the most sacred duties in public , to private sensual indulgence . The manners of such are only to conceal deformities . But with the wise who retain the esteem of youth , there must also be concealments . They do not wish to tell everything too soon , but to impart strength to meet the evil day bravely . They exhort us to sobriety , continence , patient labor ; but they leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 291 // They do not command our respect ; we yield it unasked . We are glad to reciprocate with them the seemingly distant forms of friendship , and to be provoked by their example into high thoughts . Now these influences of man upon man , by which the good and wise may in some sort entail their spiritual wealth upon their offspring , and leave legacies thereof to their friends , can not be transmitted in an atmosphere that is chilled with horrors . In times of war and anarchy , the arts have little power , and the manners are under a rough discipline . The theatres were lately closed in Paris , and the galleries had few visitors . Existence there was , in the course of a few weeks , compressed into such narrow limits that all who could do so left the ill-fated city . If such a chaotic state of things continues , the nation must go backward in refinement , even from where they are now . There is too much anxiety there , too much necessity of consuming the whole time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there exist a hightoned social condition ? How can we have leisure to let the soul expatiate in noble or beautiful thoughts , when all is hubbub and chatter , and we are obliged to give our whole time to the dry business of legislation ?

They stand on the same footing with the duty of getting a living . That is the best mode of providing for ourselves by which we gain most with the least trouble ; and that is the best government which gives us most security and enjoyment with the least interruption of our leisure . But a government may interrupt our leisure not simply by insecurity , but by compelling us to waste our days and nights in perpetual discussion . A government that leaves us no time to ourselves is little better than one that takes no care of us . But in order to be little interrupt*d , we must not , nationally as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevation of at least a low stage of refinement . With all mankind it has been agreed , that when a man deliberately attempts to kill another or any of his friends , the other has the right to kill him to pre vent it , or if he has done it , to prevent his doing such a thing again . This offence and some others have ever been regarded as such unpardonable breaches of good manners as to place the persons committing them too low down in the scale for sympathy . They are considered crimes which nothing can justify or palliate , due allowance being made for the heat of passion , and that hence the only inquiry is as to the fact . Civilized society , which has assumed many individual duties , has taken the responsibility of ascertaining this fact , and then relieving itself of the offender . It is found best to deal with these great crimes in that summary and effectual manner , in order to preserve the public mind in a condition of healthful quietness necessary to refinement . There are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is enough that murder has a name . It is quite sufficient for our debasement to know that assassins walk the earth . The gentle damsel may not see without horror a poor drunkard reeling along the street ; but we confess to no effeminacy in desiring to be excused from shaking hands with a murderer . Let him have his trial : if proved innocent , well ; but if guilty , let us hear no more of him . Let us preserve our nerves in that condition where we can not permit commiseration for such a dreadful crime . To have sympathy with such agonies and extremes of passion as murderers go through , is to inoculate ourselves with bad blood . We may anatomize them as a study , but it should be a duty we owe to the dignity of virtue to resist all ruth for those who yield themselves to such atrocious wickedness . It is , as we have just observed , necessary to the social health , that it should be so . There are limits to human investigation . With our best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Heaven . That there may be murderers who will go away into life everlasting , it is not profitable to inquire . We only know that the world can not endure them , nor bear the presence of any who are cruel to those who are protected by all true men s love . We can not bear their presence , because Ike agitation of their guilt or innocence lends to keep society in a low slate of refinement . They are on a level to which 292 Sept. * // the pity of other men will not reach ; we only degrade the general tone of manners in going down to improve them . They are enemies to life , outcasts to the first law of nature , deniers of the privilege of breathing , spoilers of the organs of existence and continuance . The universal voice of humanity says , " Away with , them ! " More-ver , the same profound abhorrence of such wretches , which makes it necessary for the living to put them away , requires also that they should be deprived of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall express that they have placed themselves without the pale of humanity , and are to be treated as aliens to the race . This is necessary , because the crimes which they have committed are so unspeakably pernicious , it is proper that the whole force of the human character should be exerted to prevent their recurrence . The reason should condemn them , the fancy recoil from them , and the pride scorn them . All that can spring from the deepest determination to wipe out such stains from humanity , or express the universal strong disgust which they inspire , should be brought to bear against them . Mankind are bound to affect towards them the manners of loathing and horror . To affect , we say , for we are all aware that we are such weakly organized creatures , it is more owing to circumstances than to original difference in power of control that we do not ourselves fall away into crimes . One feeling , therefore , with which we regard our fellow-men who have rendered themselves dangerous to life , is that of compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them ; if they are of those that we have known , our tears flow fast for them . " The pity of it " almost persuades justice to break her sword . But to yield to these feelings is to yield to death . We must strive ( for it is best for the health both of our body and soul that we should do so ) to feel as if it were far beyond the limit of possibility That we ourselves could be tempted to become spoilers or destroyers . We should steel ourselves against pity as we should against grief for the dead ; both are natural impulses , but " that way madness lies ; let us shun that . " Or to take another sentence from the same speech of Lear " When the greater malady is fixed , The lesser is scarce felt . Thou'dst shun a bear . But of thy flight lai , toward the raging sea , Thou'dst meet the bear i ' the mouth . " If we familiarize our hearts to compassion for murderers , we learn to palliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves  --  to say nothing of the unquietness thereby forced upon us by the added sense of insecurity . Both these and every effect of encouraging this natural weakness tends directly against life-against simple naked life . And how much more against the refined life , the tranquil freedom , gladdened by homefelt delights , the pleasures of intercourse , contemplation , and the beautiful arts ! It is plain that the bear must be met " i ' the mouth . " We must overcome sympathy for what is directly against life . Hence the same considerations which have been urged as showing the necessity of keeping up the distinctions of manners in social intercourse apply here with the strongest force . It has been shown that the best mode of bettering others with the least inconvenience to ourselves requires that we should keep in our station , and elevate them by example . But when we come to killing , the series ends . We can not better killers , because it is too great an inconvenience to have them about us . In other words , the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve ifs elevation , and not communicate with Death . It is enough to tolerate maiming and wounding on the same level with life , that is , the common orb ; but to manifest towards murder any other feeling than is implied by putting the committer of it out of the way in some ignominious mode , is yielding too far in those who would keep alive to those who would make dead ; it is an extension of levelling which amounts to social suicide . But there are always in every society plenty who from ignorance , self-confidence , or other infirmities , are constantly , with no consciousness of a bad purpose , lowering the standard of refinement . Indeed , with our best endeavors we all come far short of what we can fancy of true greatness . The world wears upon our nerves , and breaks us continually down , so that the great poets , artists , and scholars have much ado to keep us above the low forms of sensual enjoyment . And it is upon 1848. 29* // these extreme limits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much boldness and firmness that all who are of sound mind may see it , that the general downward tendencies most universally fasten . That men should be sent to prison for stealing moves the sympathies of but a small class ; the crime is so common that the majority have often suffered from it , and the treatment due to it ( the manners of honesty towards dishonesty ) seems none too severe . But when a man is hung like a dog for a crime which touches not one family out of thousands , the sympathies of a larger number prompt them to - exclaim at once against the severity of the punishment . They do not consider the nature of the crime , the measure of its guilt , or the consequences it involves . There are not a few who hold the blessing of life so cheaply , that they are willing to go down and cast pearls before assassins and ravishers . They would have creatures men shudder to think of kept among us to breathe this air of summer , and walk upright beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each of whom was omniscient and capable of restoring the dead to life . For the extension by society of these privileges to such criminals involves the assumption of no less powers . But we are considei-ing the subject only in a single point of view . After what we have above remarked respecting the necessity o* affecting towards crimes which touch life , manners which express the most extreme aversion and horror of which the mind can conceive , we must not here rehearse and argue against the . common views of pitiers of the hanged or to be hanged , since if the considerations we have urged do not sufficiently instruct them upon the point , it were better that we should leave them to other teachers . We need but remark how very much temptation there is to yield to the impulse of pity when the punishment is so severe ; and then it will be quite enough fot ? us to propose a means of lessening this temptation so far as regards the compassion excited by the fancied pain of strangulation . The office of Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Heaven forbid that we should write a line tending to render it a whit more desirable . Still , it has its de grees , and if any one 's relatives or friends were sentenced to be hanged , he might be excused for preferring to have the criminal suffer under the hands of an experienced artist , rather than undergo unnecessary torture from those of a bungler . So far sympathy might lawfully extend . Suppose , gentle reader , our political opponents were to suffer ( as some of them appear to deserve , ) ( and plainly it would be better for the country that they should ) - it would be well when t were done it were done quickly ; and to that end we might cheerfully , in the delay which would be necessary for their repentance , subscribe and import an operator from Tyburn . Still , it would not be well to have the punishment of death inflicted with too much apparent kindness , or with any the less ignominious accompaniments than those which surround it already . The object should be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despicable . But must it be made more painful than is absolutely necessary ? If so , at what limit must the infliction of pain cease ? The answer will be , at just that which is required to render the death fearful and shameful . But is not the apprehension - sufficiently terrible , coming in the midst of life , and surrounded with all that is revolting ? That this is the received opinion in the present state of manners need not be argued . It is conceded to irrepressible pity that the greatest criminals should be hanged as kindly as possible . But we have often thought what a horrible moment must intervene between the cutting of the rope , which the criminal can not but hear , and the dislocation of his cervical vertebrae . The time is long enough for him to say in words- " I hear the axe ; I am going ! " - of pure mental torture . Those who know how much suffering can be compressed into such a brief instant , may be pardoned for wishing both to save him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners to argue against the death penalty , of one suggestion by which they operate on the nerves of others . If there can be any mode devised which shall spare the death-sentenced this moment , the bare imagining of which makes the seated heart knock at the ribs Against the use of Nature , " 294 Sept. , // and which shall also leave the execution all its infamy , then certainly ( or at least so far as concerns the considerations derived from manners ) it ought to be immediately applied in practice . Either so , or we should hang them up in rough old fashion , steeling our nerves against pity with the insensibility which characterized the time when gibbeted skeletons shook their chains on every common and lonely highway in merry England . But though that was an age of much health and strong sense , it was not a time of general refinement , either in mind or manners . Or at least , it would hardly be thought a change for the better , were society now to relapse into what it was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period considerably later . That we have grown more sensitive in some respects does not prove that the age is degenerate or effeminate . In a word , with all respect for the simple vigor of the olden time , one may now cease to venerate all their usages , and consider what they would have done , situated as we are . Our ancestors abolished torture , and , finally , all those barbarous modes of punishment , such as drawing and quartering , and the like ; why should not we , now that science has found a means of alleviating extreme physical suffering , follow their example by allowing the benefit of it to the miserable wretches whom we simply wish to cast contemptuously out of exist-cnce* If we have a right to hang a man at noon-day on the 15th of September , then it follows that we have a right to give him CHLOROFORM at noon-day , and hano him a immediately afterwards , while under its operation . The time that his soul is in abeyance , neither dead nor alive , is so inconsiderable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that score , therefore , there can be no objection . By this means we avoid for him , not only the pain of the actual killin* but the agonizing instant of certain apprehension . The sponge is applied to his nostrils , and all that he is aware of is , , that he sinks calmly ( perforce ) into a sleep , out of which he is to awaken on the other shore of the river of death ; in " The undiscovered country , from whose bourne No traveller returns ; "  --  a journey which some of the very spectatorsof his exit may envy him the privilege of making so soon . All that is left of him is a senseless carcass , which it is fittest should be used for the advancement of a science whose object it is to save life and mitigate pain . It seems that this could be accomplished with all the manifestations of abhorrence which it is necessary for the health and refinement of society to maintain towards the most heinous crimts . All might be the same as now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere drawn up to the beam . As for the actual pain of death , the present mode is little more awful , save in the horrid instant preceding it , which is not physical but mental torture . The prevailing opinion among the medical profession is , that the pain of dying is mere loss of consciousness , which those who faint easily have often experienced . A gentle loss of consciousness against a sudden one is all the difference between an easy and a violent death . The pain of hanging , or probably the worst tortures , is nothing to what is undergone in fevers . But no one who has witnessed death in its sudden and awful forms can help feeling that there is a reason in nature for the petition in the Liturgy , to be delivered " from sudden death ; " and it seems a shame to deprive a fellow-being of life , however necessary it may be to do so , and howsoever just his doom , by a mode which we instinctively desire to be delivered from , when we have another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassion for the worst of men than for a dog ; and any of our readers who reciprocates the attachment of one of those affectionate creatures , if he should be obliged to destroy him , would hardly deny poor Tray a few sniffs of the magical ether . If he would , he ought not to have a dog of any kind ; and a man unworthy the esteem of such large-hearted creatures as Maida or Bevis , never ought to have his fire-side graced by the presence of a Charlotte or an Alice . Moreover , the necessity of preserving social health , which demands the penalty of death for sinners against life , demands also that the penalty be inflicted with no avoidable torture , either bodily or mental , The infliction of any such torture is unkind . 1848. 295 // On the Use of Chloroform in Hanging . Sept. , qwq THERE are two great conceptions , very . generally altogether overlooked , which it is all important to hold in full view , in our efforts to understand and interpret the mighty problem of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it culminates and becomes complete only in the form of morality or spirit , has its root always in the sphere of nature , and can never disengage itself entirely from its power ; in the second place , while it reveals itself perpetually through single individuals , it is nevertheless throughout an organic process , which necessarily includes the universal race , as a living whole , from its origin to its end . Nature , of course , can never he truly and strictly the mother of mind . The theory of an actual inward development of man 's life , out of the life of the world below him , as presented , for instance , in the little work entitled " Yestioes of Creation , " is entitled to no sort of attention or respect . The plant can , by no possibility , creep upwards into the region of sensation ; and just as little may we conceive of a transition , on the part of the mere animal , over into the world of self-conscious intelligence and will . The sundering gulf is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the other . But we must not so understand this , as to lose sight at the same time of the mysterious life-union which holds notwithstanding between nature and mind . The world , in its lower view , is not simply the outward theatre or stage on which man is called to act his part , as a candi*-date for heaven . In the midst of all its different forms of existence , it is pervaded throughout with the power of a single life , which comes ultimately to its . full sense and force only in the human person . This should be plain to the most common observation . Nature is consti*ucted , or we should say , rather exists , on the plan of a vast pyramid ; which starts in the mass of inorganic matter and rises steadily through successive stages of organization , first vegetable and then animal , till at length it gains in man the summit and crown , towards which it has been evidently reaching and tending from the start . So , in the first chapter of Genesis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , and all conducted to its magnificent conclusion , finally , only towards the close of the sixth day , in that oracle of infinite majesty and love : " Let us make man in our image , after our likeness ; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every moving thing that moveth upon the earth . " Man is the centre of nature , without which it could not be in any of its parts the living constitution which it is in fact ; for the parts in this case subsist not by themselves , or for themselves simply , but in virtue only of their organic comprehension in the whole . Nature , of course , then rests in man as her own universal sense and end , and can never be disjoined from his life . The union is not outward simply , but inward and vital . Man carries in himself the full mystery of the material world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . He is , indeed , in another view , far more than nature . Reason and freedom , as they meet together in the idea of personality , belong to a wholly different order of existence ; in virtue of which , he towers high above the whole surrounding world , as the immediate representative and vicegerent of God in its midst ; made in the image and after the likeness of his glorious Maker , as we are told , and for this reason clothed with supremacy over the entire inferior creation . But still , in all this dignity , his native affinity with this creation is not in the least impaired or broken . Nature clings to him still , as the noblest fruit of her own womb , in whose mysterious presence is fulfilled the last prophetic sense of her whole previous life , while at the same time this is made to pass away in something quite beyond itself . His personality , with all its world-trans 1848. 367 // cending , heaven-climbing powers , remains rooted to the earth , conditioned at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reflecting in clear image the outward life which has become etherealized in its constitution . The process of nature is thus rising upwards perpetually into the process of morality , by wkiich in the end the problem of the world is to become complete in the history of man . The first is the necessary basis and support of the second , as truly as the stock is made to carry the flower in which it passes away . Man is the effiorescence of nature , the full bursting forth of her inmost sense and endeavor , into the form of intelligence and will ; and his whole thinking and working consequently can he sound and solid , only as they are in fact borne and carried by a growth that springs immediately from her womb . There is no opposition then , as is sometimes dreamed , between the natural and the moral . They are , indeed , widely different , hut not in such a way as to contradict each other . On the contrary , they can never be rightly sundered or disjoined . Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must ascend into the sphere of morality ; and morality , on the other hand , can have no truth or substance , except as it is found to embody in itself the life of nature , thus emancipated into a higher form . Daughters of heaven as they all are , there is still not a single virtue which is not in this respect , at the same time , truly and fully earth-born ; as much so , we may say , as its own sweet image , the natural flower , be it modest daisy or stately dahlia , that quietly blooms at its side . A morality which affects to he purely of the skies , can never be other than sickly and sentimental . The more of nature our virtues enshrine , the more vigorous will they be found to be and worthy of respect . This is one universal law in the constitution of our human life . An*ther presents itself , as already stated , in the conception of an organic process , in virtue of which the problem of every individual life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that includes humanity as a whole . Morality , by its very nature , is something social . It does not simply require the relations which society creates , as an outward field for its action , but stands also only in the sense of these relations as a part of its own being . The idea of man , which is of course originally one and single , in order that it may become actual , must resolve itself into an innumerable multitude of individual lives , whose perfection subsequently can be found again in no other form than that of their general union in a free way . Provision is made for such union in the natural constitution of humanity , bound together as it is by a common origin , and upheld by perpetual evolution from itself in the way of history . But mere nature here is not sufficient to secure all that is required . Humanity comes to its full sense only in the sphere of intelligence and freedom ; and its proper wholeness , therefore , is something to be reached only by the activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent , the relations in which it is required to move . This again supposes a process , growing forth continually from the law of natural evolution and growth just noticed , by which the individual life , in finding itself under its higher form of self-consciousness , may be still engaged to seek its true place in the integration of life as a whole , flowing into this by the spontaneous force of love , and resting in it as the proper and necessary perfection of its own being . The unity of the race can be fully accomplished thus , only through the free action of the living elements into which it is resolved for this purpose . The process of the union is moral , and in no sense physical , except as conditioned by a natural constitution , which adumbrates and supports the spiritual structure that springs from its presence . It is possible , in such case , of course , that the freedom of the individual subject may be abused , and the law of love denied which he is bound by his nature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own separate and single life , through selfishness and sin , as to wrong perpetually the claims of the general life in which this should become complete . But in all this he wrongs , at the same time , the inmost sense and meaning also of his own individual being . Whether he choose to make account of it or not , he is formed for morality , that is , for free inward union with his race , through the social relations in which 368 Oct. , // he stands ; and his life can come to no right development within itself , but must suffer rather perpetual violence in its nature , if it be not allowed to unfold itself in this its only normal and legitimate form . Morality , including , as it does , the conception of personality or the self-conscious and self-active force of reason and will , is something general and universal by bits very nature . It implies throughout the idea of fellowshin and union , the organic marriage of reciprocally necessary and mutually supplemental parts , working into each other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this universal , omnipotent and irreversible law , the life of every man stands , from the beginning , in virtue of its spiritual or moral constitution . He can never be true to himself at a single point ; he can never exercise a single moral function , a single act of intelligence or will , in a truly free way , without going beyond his own person , and mingling , with conscious coalescence , in the sea of life with which he is surrounded . By one of the greatest discoveries in modern science , placing the name of Schlciermacher in the sphere of ethics on the same high level with that of Kepler in the sphere of physics , the general moral function , as it may be styled , in man , is found to resolve itself , by a process of analysis which we have no time here to follow , into four cardinal forms of actio* , two lying on the side of the understan dino- and two on the side of the will . Each of these can hold properly only under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he may be at all complete in himself , is forced to enter into fellowship with his race . Thus arise four great spheres of moral union , in Vhe proper constitution of the world 's life . The first is exhibited to us predominantly in the idea of art ; the second , in the idea of science ; the third , in the idea of sociabiliti , ' , ( *eselligkeit , ) corresponding very much with the conception of play , in its widest and most dignified sense ; the fourth and last , in the idea of business . These four orders of life are not to be regarded , indeed , as standing wholly out of each other in the way of external distinction ; the case requires , on the contrary , that they should grow into one another with inward reciprocal embrace , and it is only their complete concretion in this way at la*t , as the power of a single life , that can bring the moral process to its rightful conclusion . Still they are , for the most part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of each other in fact ; and each has a nature also of its own , which it must always be important to understand and cultivate under such separate view . They are the four grand departffients of humanity , each an organism of universal power within itself , in whose organic conjunction alone we have revealed to us the full idea of morality , as the proper life of man . Not as co-ordinate in any sense with these , but as above them all , and as constituting indeed the only form in which they can become complete , stands the idea of Religion , as fully actualized in the glorious union of the One holy Catholic Clturch . In one aspect we may style such a moral whole the State . But , in a perfect state of society , this idea itself- must become merged in the broader and deeper idea of the Church , in which alone we reach the final and adequate expression for our universal human life . Religion of course then stands in no opposition to any of the great divisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this would imply an original contrariety between it and the actual constitution of the world , which the nature of the case must be held to exclude . On the contrary , it must have power finally to lift them all into its own sphere . Art , science , social and civil life , must all be capable of being sanctified by its transforming presence . It belongs to the very conception of Christianity and the Church thus , that they should take full possession of the world at last , not extensively alone in its outward population , but intensively also in the entire range of its inward life and it is only in proportion as we find their actual form commensurate with the idea of such a catholicity , that this can be said to have reached , in any given stadium of their history , its true significance and design . Underneath this whole magnificent superstructure , on the other side , appears the primitive , fundamental form of society , in the constitution of the Family . As the four-fold organism of morality terminates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start here from an organization , that may be regarded as the root of its whole pro 1848. 369 // cess , rising into view immediately from the mysterious life of nature itself . The domestic constitution stands in no way parallel simply with the four forms of society that make up the union of humanity as a whole it includes them all rather in its single nature , in the way of beginning and germ . It is the rich well-spring , out of which flows the river of Eden , that is parted from thence in* four heads , and carried forward with fruitful irrigation over the fair garden of life , till all its streams become one again in the deep bosom of the sea . All society rests on distinction and difference . So the primary form of fellowship now mentioned , lying as it does at the ground of our universal life , is at once provided for and secured , by a radical disruption of the entire race into two great sections or halves , in the form of sex . Of all distiactions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the most significant and profound , as entering before all others into its universal constitution , and forming the basis on the ground of which only all other relations beloaging to it become possible and real . It comes into view accordingly in the first mention of man 's creation ; where we are told that he was made in the image and likeness of God , and at the same time under the two-fold character of male and female , as the necessary form of his perfection . His nature became complete , only when woman was taken from his side , and he was permitted to hail her bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh , in the new consciousness to which he first woke by her presence . Thus radical and original in the constitution of our nature , the sexual difference must necessarily pervade , not simply a part of its being , but the whole . The life of man is indeed always a complex fact , made up of widely different forms and spheres of existence ; but it is always nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undivided unity within itself , bound together and ruled throughout by the presenc* of a common principle or law . The life of the body is ever in strict union with the life of the soul ; and this , on the other hand , stands wedded again to that continually , as its own proper self under an outward material form . No less intimate and necessary , in the next place , is the connection that holds between the individual natural constitution , thus inward and outward , and the proper personality of the subject to whom it belongs . It lies in the very conception of personality , it is true , being as it is the life of the spirit in the form of intelligence and will , that it should not be ruled blindly by the force of mere nature , as comprehended in the individual organization . It is a principle and fountain of action for itself , and is required to act back upon the natural life with such independent force , as may serve to mould and fashion this continually more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and independent action , however free it may be in its own nature , can never escape from the particular organization in which it has its basis , and which it is called to fill with its presence . In other words , the inmost life of man , his personal spirit , though absolutely universal in its own character , is made to individualize itself by union with the inferior part of his nature , while at the same time it seeks to lift this into its own sphere . Reason and will accordingly are not the same thing exactly in all men . Personality is conditioned and complexioned , all the world over , by the individual physical nature , somatic and psychic , out of which , and by means of which , it comes to its historical development . It is not possible then , of course , that it should not participate in the force of a distinction so broad and deep as that which is involved in the idea of sex . It results necessarily from the organic unity of every single life as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world into the two grand sections of male and female , should extend to the most spiritual part of our nature as well as to that which is simply corporeaL There is a sex of the mind or soul , just as there is a sex of the body ; an inward difference of structure in the one case , including the whole economy of the spirit , fancy and feeling , thought and volition , as broadly marked and strikingly significant , to say the least , as any outward difference of structure which may show itself in the other . It is altogether preposterous to think of resolving this difference into the influence of education or mere social position ; as though no thing more were needed to convert men into women , or women into men , 370 Oct. , // so far as character and spirit are concerned , than simply to make them change places for a time in the order of society , confining the male sex to the employments of the nursery and kitchen , and throwing open to the female sex the active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we may all easily see , is original and constitutional , and in this view co-extensive in full with tLe entire range of our common life . It shows itself in the character even of the infant , as soon as it begins to discover any signs of character whatever . The tastes and tendencies of the boyish nature are peculiar to it as such , from the first hour of its activity in the nursery , cleaily distinguishing it from the nature of the girl . The distinction reigns throughout all the sports of childhood , and accompanies the entire subsequent development of the spirit , onward and upward to mature age . It prevails in full force over the whole broad range of middle life , imparting to it its highest interest and value in a moral view . Finally , it ceases not in the decay of bodily vigor and beauty , induced by old age itself , but reaches forward still , with a radiant light that grows only more mellow as it is less tinged with the coloring of sense , far down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal tract of our mortal existence , from the mystery of the womb to the still more impenetrable and solemn mystery of the grave . Nor can the distinction possibly terminate *ere . It has been made a question indeed , whether the difference of sex extends to the other world ; and it is characteristic of the Hegelian way of thinking in particular , that it allows but little room for any such supposition , having a tendency always to merge the individual in the general , and to make men mere passing exemplifications of humanity . But this view overthrows in the end the doctrine of a future state altogether ; since without the distinctions of individual nature , a something continued over from the present life , there can be no sense of personal*dentity , no true resurrection , or other-world consciousness , in any form . It lies in the very conception of our being as we have here described it , that its individual distinctions should reach throughout the whole man in a permanent and enduring way . Personality can not be evolved at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to have wrought into it from first to last the same particularity , as a necessary part of its own constitution . It is one of the great merits of Schleicrmacher again , to have perceived and asserted , with proper force , the claims of the individual over against the authority of the universal and absolute , as a permanent element in the constitution of man . The question before us then , according to this view , is already answered . The multiplication of the race will not extend , it is true , over into the other world , and with this must come to an end also the present significance of the sexual relation as concerned in that object ; our whole present physical state indeed being but the transient process by which our being is destined to emerge hereafter into a higher order of existence . In that higher state , we are told , they shall neither marry nor be given in marriage , but resemble in this respect the angels . in heaven . The family constitution , in its strict sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of revelation , belongs only to the pieseiit ordci of things , and will not be continued in the complete kingdom of God . But we may not suppose , that the vast and mighty distinction in our nature , out of which this radical constitution now springs. , will come to an end in the same way . Entering as it does into the life of the entile person , it can not be overthrown by the simple elevation of our mortal individuality into the undying sphere of the spirit . On the contrary , it may he expected rather to appear now under its most purely ethical , and for that reason its highest also and richest form : In Christ Jesus , there is neither male nor female , as there is also neither Jew nor Greek ; not however by the full obliteration of all such differences , hut only through their free harmonious comprehension in a form of consciousness , that is decpcr than their opposition , and able thus to reconcile them in an organic way . It is on the background of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in the clearest delineation which their nature admits . There will be races and nationalities , and temperaments , stiongly marked in heaven , no doubt , as we find them here in course of sanctification upon the earth . And so there will be , not in the flesh , but 1848. 371 // in the spirit , the difference of sex there too . Humanity , made forever complete in the new creation , will comprise in itself still , as the deep ground tone of its universal organic harmony , the two great forms of existence in which it was comprehended at the beginning , when God created man , we are told , male and female , after his own image . In this view , it involves no extravagance to extend the idea of sex even to the angels themselves , although they neither marry nor are given in marriage . We are now prepared to notice more particularly , though of course still only in the most general way , the constitutional character of the two sexes iii a comparative view . The case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the simply physical side of our nature , in the first place , and then at its moral or spiritual side in which only the first comes finally to its full human significance and force . So intimately interwoven however are these two spheres of existence , that no full view can he had of one apart from the other , and it is only in their union at last that we are enabled to complete properly the comparison we have in hand . The phqsicol difference of the sexes is not limited by any means , in the first place , to any particular organs and functions of our simply corporeal structure , hut extends to the body as a whole . This is in no sense a mechanical composition merely of various parts , outwardly fitted together , but a living IV hole pervaded throughout with the presence of a common principle and constitution . It is not possible , accordingly , that a peculiarity so broad and deep as that of sex should as somethino ' appear b adventitious and accidental only , in some particular parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must impress itself , more or less clearly , upon the whole . This we find , accordingly , to he the case in fact . Both anatomically and physiologically considered , the whole body is made to participate in the sexuat character . Man and woman are so completely different in their whole organization that , as it has been remarked , no single part of the one could he properly substituted for the corresponding part of the other . Bones and muscles , the turn of the limbs , general height and bulk , the conformation of the head and breast , the show of the skin , the expression of the face , the tom*e of the voice , the bearing and carriage of the person , all are comprehended in the same reigning universal distinction . So also in the case of the several great systems of which life is composed ; the action of the liver , lungs and brain is subjected to corresponding modification . In man , the arterial and cerebral systems prevail ; in woman , the venous and ganghionic ; creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second a similar preponderance of sensibility ; conditioning thus throughout their different capabilities and tendencies , and indicating with sure necessity the different spheres in which they are appointed to move . In the next place , with the purely corporeal or somatic difference now stated , corresponds also the inward or psychical region of what must still be denominated our physical nature . This includes the whole natural consciousness , the product directly of our animal organization as such , which the true spirit within us is required to misc into its own native sphere of freedom , that it may become the yesture , subsequently , of its own life . Such consciousness , from the start , is not the same thing in man that it is found to be in ivoman . Sensation and perception , feeling and affection , appetite and tendency , inclination and desire , are all modified by the power of sex . The whole inward and outward nature , harmonionsly constructed in each case within itself , is comprehended in the same distinction , and carried always in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ivhile woman is more delicately tender and passive . Thought predominates in man ; in woman , taste and feeling . All goes to indicate that man is formed to exercise authority and protection , and to wrestle both physically and spiritually with the surrounding world ; while ivoman is led by her whole nature , rather , to cultivate a spirit of submission and dependence , and finds her proper sphere in the retirement of the house and family . We are in this way , however , conducted over to a still higher apprehension of the difference under consideration . It is only as nature passes upwards , as its constitution here requires it to do , into the sphere of the spirit , that the full sense and force of the distinction 372 Oct. , // thus sublimated by the ethical process is brought finally into full view . In this character the difference is no longer natural , simply , but in the fullest sense moral . Personality unites in itself the presence of a spiritual universal life , which is strictly and truly the fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , and a material organization hs the necessary medium and basis of its revelation . In this revelation , the spirit , while it must remain always the centre of the whole person , with the power to assert its own proper primacy , is notwithstanding capable of being acted upon and influenced in very various measures by the power of nature , as brought to bear upon it through the organism of the body . In proportion , at the same time , to the independence it may be urged and enabled to assert in its own sphere , will be the strength and force of the personality thus brought into view . Now it results from the whole peculiarity of her organization , as already described , and so of course lies also in the proper purpose and destiny of her sex , that woman should possess less of this independence than man . Her life springs more immediately and directly from nature , even under its true ethical form . There is a specific difference , in this view , between the personality of the sexes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in a lower sphere . It resolves itself , ultimatel*r , we may say , into this , that the universa I side of our common humanity prevails in man , and its individual side in woman . Self-consciousness in man runs readily into the general form of thought , disposing him for comprehensive observation , speculation and science : in woman , it takes more the character of feeling , which is always something single , closely coupled with fancy and art ; her thoughts are her own inward states and impressions mainly , and the product immediately of the outward occasions from which theygrow . So again self-activity in man takes *aturally the broad character of will , carrying him forth into the open world , involving him in business and conflict ow the arena of public life ; while with woman it is exercised more in the form of impulse and desire , falls more fully within the flow of nature as embodied in her own particular organization , and for this very reason at the same time participates more largely in the character of passive necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled . The personality of man is more vigorous and concentrated , and , if we may use the expression , more thoroughly and completely personal , than the personality of woman ; showing him clearly thus to be the centre and bearer properly of the human nature as a whole . This implies no inferiority on the part of woman ; she is just as complete and noble in her own sphere as man can possibly be in his ; and this sphere is just as necessary as the other also to the true perfection of human life . It lies , however , in the nature of the case , that this life should be , not a dualism , but an inward unity ; and that the distinction , therefore , in which it starts ; reaching as it does into the personal consciousness itself , should be so ordered , nevertheless , as to return in upon itself again to a common personal ground . The relation of the sexes , then , requires that their two-fold constitution , dividing as it does the proper wholeness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality from a common basis , on one side or the other . rihe general nature , accordingly , is made to centre in man ; and woman , taken in symbolic vision from his side , while she forms the . necessary coinplement of his being , comes to her full spiritual development , and gains her true native freedom and independence , only by seeking in him the central support which she lacks in herself , and bringing her whole consciousness thus into profound union with his life , as the inmost and deepest ground of her own . With such natural and personal difference , the sexes are designated from the start to different spheres of life , and have widely different missions to fulfil in the social system . Neither the duties of the man , on the one hand , nor his virtues and perfections on the other , are the same in general that belong to woman ; and so also the vices which most dishonor the one are not always of parallel turpitude for the other . Man 's vocation is to go forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightful lord and master , to make his understanding and will felt on the general course of life . The forest-felling axe , the soil-subduing plough , the mason 's hammer and the joiner 's saw , 1848. 373 // the wand of judgment , the sceptre of authorit* and the sword of war , belong propcil ) to his hand , and to his alone .

She is not indeed shut out from society , in a wider view .

The popular platform , the rostrum , the pulpit , are interdicted to her nature , no less than the l ) attle-fleld and the crowded exchange . All public primacy is unsuitable to her sex nor is it easy to see , certainly , how the " monstrous regimen of women , " as denounced by the old Scottish Elijah in his memorable " Blast , " should not be as fair an obj*et of iiidignation and scorn , when seated on the throne , as it is felt to be in all inferior stations. * Christianity here is * " Who would not judge that body to be a monster , " says Knox , " where there was no head eminent above the rest , but that the eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the belly , and the ears in the feet ? No less is the body of that commonwealth , where a woman beareth empire ; for either doth it lack a lawful head , as in very deed it doth , or else an idol is exalted instead of the true head .

I confess a realm may , in despite of God-he of hi* own wise judgment so givin0 them over unto a reprobatemind-exalt tip a woman to that monstriferous the properties and perfect offices of a lawful head ; for the same God that denied power to the hand to speak , to the belly to hear , and to the feet to always deep , and at the same time true to natui-e .

" So again : " Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection . I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence . For Adam was first formed , then Eve . And Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived , was in the transgression . " The order of society , springing as it does from the sexual relation first of all , imperiously requires that the opposition in which it holds should be sacredly regarded and preserved , throughout the whole economy of life . All tl.at serves to neutralize it , or to thrust it out of sight , should be reprobated as an agency unfriendly to the best interests of the human race . Civilization and culture , morality and religion , while they call for the free intercourse of the sexes , as polar sides of one and the same social constitution , call no less clearly at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertains to inward character and outward life .

But if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her : for her hair is given her for a coyering . " All confusion of the sexes , all removal of the lines and landmarks that show the true and proper boundary between them , is a crime n ( rainst *ocie tv of the most sen-a ous order .

This opposition and distinction , however , as we have already seen , are intended only to make room for the more perfect union of the two interests thus flung asunder . It is because they are different in this way , and in proportion also as the difference is understood and respected , that the se*s are capable of entering into the intimate union , which lies at the ground of our whole human life . Physically , psychologically , and morally , man shows himself to be at all points what woman is not . The one is the opposite of the other . But for this very reason , the relation is one also of reciprocal want and supply . Neither section of the race is complete in its own nature , while the defect which exists on each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of the other . Humanity is the unity of the two sexes ; which , as such , accordingly can never rest in one apart from the other , hut must seek continually the full conjunction of both , as original , necessary component sides of its proper constitution . In the nature of the case , it can never be satisfied with such conjunction , except under the most inward and spiritual form as the power , ultimately , of a single individual life . The sexes are made complete only in and through each other ; and this necessarily by such a union only as extends to their whole constitution , physi*al and spiritual , embracing thus the entire inward life full as much as that which is exhibited outwardly in the sphere of flesh and blood . Each is needed to fill out and complete the personality or moral nature of the other , no less than its material organization . The qualities of man 's spirit require to be softened and refined by communion with the milder nature of woman ; as she on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , on which to lean as the stable prop of her own . The personality of man is enriched and beautified through voman , on the side of nature ; the personality of woman is consolidated and perfected through man , on the side of the idea . In this view , of course , the union which the case ( lemands , can not overthrow , but must serve rather to establish in full force , the order we have already found to hold between the two sexes in their personal constitution . It is emphatically the fact of this order , involving as it does a certain primacy on the one side and a corresponding subordination on the other , that makes it possible for the union to take that vital , fundamental form that is here required . Two strictly co-ordinate personalities could not be expected to flow thus into the power of a single life . It is because woman has her true and proper centre at last in man , and not in herself , that it is possible for the sexes to become not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . her consciousness thus poised upon the personality of man , is brought to such harmony , and freedom , and active force within itself , as it could never be advanced to in any other way . All this implies no sort of dishonor or degradation . It is simply the necessary form of our general human life itself , whose perfection demands this distinction of sexes as something which , to be real at all , must hold in such proportional relation and no other . It is precisely the strength and glory of woman , to be thus dependently joined to the personality of man , as the vine is carried upwards by clinging to a trunk more vigorous and rough than its own , which it seives at the same time gracefully to ennoble and adorn . Marriage is , indeed , in this view , more significant and necessary , we may say , for woman , than it can he held to be for man . It is the appointed and regular process of her full emancipation from the power of sense and nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual independence . She needs it to make her own personality , whether as intelligence or will , sufficiently central and deep , to sustain itself as it should against the force of the surrounding world . It is by the mighty energy of love in this form that she comes at last fully to herself , and is enabled to bring into clear revelation the true wealth of her nature . In a deep sense thus we may apply to the case that mystic word of the apostle " She shall be saved ( 84 rsxvoXovio* ) b* child-hearing . " Connected as it is immediately with the thought of her moral weakness , as exemplified in the fall , ( 1 Tim . ii . 14 , 15 , ) it seems to refer not obscurely to the like mystic word of the curse pronounced against her , Gen. iii . 16 , in consequence of that catastrophe . The 1848. 375 // relation which is made the fountain of her deepest sorrows , under the iron reign of sin , becomes itself the well-spring of her salvation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " revealed in Jesus Christ . So profoundly true again is that other declaration " The head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is the man ; " or as we have it in another place : " The husband is the head of the wife , even as Christ is the head of the church . " ( 1 Cor. xi . 3 ; Eph. v. 23 . ) So intimately close is the union for which the sexual distinction opens the way , and in which alone it comes finally to its true meaning . Oa this union , the primitive and most fundamental form of human fellowship , depends not simply the perpetuation of the race , but the entire problem besides of its social and moral history . It is by means of it , in the first place , that the generic or universal life of man is brought to assert its proper authority over against the life of the individual singly and separately considered . The individual is forced to feel that he is no complete whole in himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution only by passing beyond his single person , and seeking its necessary complement in another ; that in one word , to be a true and full man at all , he must enter into communion with his race , and make himself tributary , in a free way , to the high ends for which he has been placed in the world . This subordination of the single life to the general , is of such vast consequence to the entire plan and structure of the moral world , that it must be secured by an invincible guaranty in the constitution of the world itself . It is curious and instructive to see accordingly , how the law of society , lying as it does at the foundation of all ethics , is here made to take root , as it were , " in the lowest parts of the earth ; " illustrating , on a grand scale , the proposition affirmed in the beginning of this article , that all moralitv has its basis in nature , and js to be regarded as genuine , only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this lower life , bursting upwards into the ethereal region of the spirit . The bond by which the sexes are thus drawn together is lodged , in the first instance , deep in the physical constitution of those who are under its power . In this form , it is the sexual appetite or instinct , a purely natural tendency , which has for its object the preservation of the race , as the instinct of hunger is designed to secure the preservation of the single individual . It is the power of the general nature over its own constituent factors or parts , by which these are urged to seek , each in the other , the full sense of their proper bearing , and thus to constitute , in the way of reciprocal appropriation , a living union that may fairly represent both . But nature here , as elsewhere , is icquired to lose itself always in the power of a higher life , in which its action shall no longer be hlind and unfree , hut the product of the spirit itself in its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole person , the union for which it calls can never be complete , except as it is made to embrace this in its full totality , under a strictly central and universal form . It must be a union of mind and will , a process of mutual apprehension , and reciprocal personal appropriation , in the farthest depths of the soul . In no other form can it he truly normal , and answerable to the high purposes it is designed to serve . The sexual tendency , ethicised iii this way , and sublimated into the sphere of personality , becomes lore . This is always in its very nature something moral and spiritual , springing from the will , and having regard to the inmost person . Still , in the case before us , it is in the fullest sense also sexual . It rests throughout on the distinction of sex , and regards the spirit only as beheld and appi-ehendeci under such modification . Hence the legit* imate power of beauty , as constituting on the side of either sex to the eye of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in its sexual form . All true beauty , of course , in this view , falls back upon the spirit , while at the same time its proper revelation is to be sought in the outward person . A sexual interest that includes no regard to beauty must necessarily be immoral , as falling short of that high spiritual region , in which only love finds its suitable home . The merely animal nature , in such case , is suffered to prevail over the human . It belongs to love , not to overthrow absolutely indeed the power of mere sense , but still so to 376 Oct. , // cover it at every point with its own superior presence , that it shall not be permitted to come into separate view . Love , as now described , includes in itself always a regard to the sexual character as such ; and so far , there is truth and force in the observation of Sterne , that no man ever loves any one woman as he should , who has not at the same time a love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one side of the subject . Love , to be complete , must be also strictly and distinctly individual , determined towards its object as a single person to the exclusion of all others . The single plant is only a specimen of its kind , the particular animal a copy of the tribe to which it belongs . But itis not thus in the human sphere . The individual man is vastly more than a passing exemplification simply of the generic life that flows through his person . He comprehends in himself an independent specific nature , that can be properly represented by no other . His individuality is always at the same time personal , and as such something universal and constant ; as on the other hand his personality is always individual , taking its special complexion from the living material nature out of which it springs . Every such individual personality is a world within itself , existing under gi*'en relations to other worlds of corresponding nature around it . No two of these are exactly alike , and all by these differences fall short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is constituted only by the society and union of the individual personalities into which it falls , joined together morally , not with indiscriminate conjunction , but according to specihc reciprocal correspondence , in the way of inward want and supply . The general law of moral association then being such , it must extend of course in full power to the primary and fundamental union which we have now under consideration . It lies in the very conception of love , as already explained , that it should concentrate itself upon the spirit , as revealed under a sexual form ; but to do this fully , it must be carried by inward elective affinity towards its object as a particular person . It is not simply the general attraction of sex , that can satisfy itsTdem ands ; it requires besides that this attraction shall lodge itself in the presence YOL . II . NO . IV . NEW SERIES . 25 of a specific personal life , which is felt to be such as the necessary complement of its own nature . Under no other form can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not every woman that is adapted , physically or spiritually , to be a help-meet for every man ; but as the sexes are formed for each other in a general way , so each individual of either sex may be said to be formed for some corresponding individual of the other ; and it is of the highest consequence , of course , for themselves and for the race also , that they should be able to find and know each other in the confused wilderness of the world 's life . We may go so far as to say , perhaps , that in a perfectly normal state of the world , this pairing and matching of individual natures would be so complete as to exclude , in every case , all possibility of different choice . Each would be for each , by absolute singularity of mutual suitableness and want , in such a way as to shut out the whole world besides . Of course , our actual life , disordered as it is by sin , can not be expected or required to conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should include at least an approximation towards it ; and it must be regarded as defective , in proportion precisely as it is found to fall short of such high measure . In a state of barbarism , but small account comparatively is made of individual personality , in the commerce of the sexes ; which however is simply itself an expression of the barbarous life to which it belongs , showing it to border close on the merely animal existence below it , in which , as there is no personality , so there is no room also for the idea of love in any form . The savage takes hi swife very much as a specimen simply of her sex , just as he selects his dog , in the same view , to accompany him in the chase . It is remarkable , too , that in such low stage of moral development , the individual nature itself stands out to view , for the most part , only under dim and indistinct lines . It is the sense of personality in the end , that advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing it with clearly marked distinction under its own form , and challenging towards it in this way the attention and respect it is entitled : to receive . We are furnished here a*cord-* 1848. 377 // ingly with an unerring standard of civilization and social culture , which in the case before us especially is always of plain and easy application . The sexual union , representing thus the general relation of the sexes to each other on the one hand , and involving the elective personal affinity of individual natures on the other , mediated throughout by the sacred power of love , comes to its proper expression in the idea of ? narriage ; whose nature , at the same time , is defined and explained by the whole analysis through which we have now passed . This is simply the true and normal form of that commerce and communion , in which the distinction of sex comes at last to its full sense , as the necessary completion of humanity , and the primitive basis of all history and society . The attributes that belong of right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also of marriage ; which is not therefore something joined to our nature , as it were , from abroad , and in the way of outward order or device , whether human or divine ; but should he considered rather as part of our nature itself , a simple fact in its organic constitution , without whose presence it must cease to exist altogether . Marriage of course , then , is the process of reciprocal appropriation , by which the sexes , according to their original destination , become one , and so complete themselves each , in the power of a single persoi*al life . In the nature of the case , this double appropriation is required to extend to the entire being of the parties concerned in the transaction ; for the sexual difference is such , as we have already seen , that each side of the relation requires the opposite , not in part only , but in full , to make itself complete . This implies , at the same time , a corresponding act of selfabandonment on each side , in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriation in return . Each yields itself up to be the pro*erty of the other , in the very act of embracing this again as its own property . So as regards the merely natural and outward life . The parties are made " one flesh . " This is*of right , however , only in virtue of the inward spiritual embrace , by which the personality of each is brought to rest in That of the other , by the deep mysterious power which belongs to love . The case , in its own nature , admits of no compromise or reserve . Marriage calls solemnly for the gift of the whole being , on the altar of love , and can never be fully satisfied with any sacrifice that is less full and entire . In proportion as the relation comes short of such inward , central community of soul and life , it must be regarded as an imperfect approximation only to its own true idea . There is a difference indeed in the form of this mutual self-surrendry on the part of the two sexes , corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the united person constituted by marriage is required to centre ultimately in man , it follows that the union calls for the largest measure of such free sacrifice on the side of woman . For this , also , she is happily disposed by her whole constitution . Love is emphatically the element of her life . She needs the opportunity of going fully out of herself in this way , in order that she may do full justice to her own nature . There is nothing in life , accordingly , more deep , and beautiful , and full of moral power , than the devotion of woman 's love . It goes beyond all that is possible , under the same form , on the side of the other sex . The perfection of marriage , so far as she is concerned , turns on the measure in which she is prepared to make herself over , in body , mind , and outward estate , without limit or reserve , to him whom she has chosen to be her head . The husband is not required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way . He may not resign the sense of his more central and universal character , by which precisely he is qualified to become the personal bearer of the united life involved in the marriage bond . All this , however , gives him no right to exercise his independence in a selfish way . It lays him under obligation only to make himself over , in this character , to the possession of his wife , answering thus , with full unbounded fidelity and truth , the full unbounded measure of her confidence and truth . " So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies ; he that loveth his wife , loveth himself . " The idea of marriage , as now presented , clearly excludes , not only all promiscuous concubinage , but also all polygamy and 378 Oct. , // divorce . In its very nature , it is the full and enduring union of one man with one Woman , according to the law of sexual difference and correspondence . Many outward reasons may he urged against the irregularities now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last is just this , that they contradict thc true concep- , . tion of the sexual union itself . This can never take place normally , except in the way of mutual self-surrendry and whole appropriation of each other , on the part of those who are its subjects , that is , in the way of marriage . Polygamy necessarily violates this law ; and the same is true also of divorce , which is tolerated hy Christianity accordingly only where the marriage hond has been already nullified in fact by the crime of adultery . We can not bring the whole subject to a conclusion better , perhaps , than by making use of it to expose , in  --  a direct way , as has been done in some measure indirectly already , the entire theory of what is sometimes styled the emancipuhon of woman , as held with various modifications , by our modern Fourierites and Socialists of every description . Of all forms of agrarianism this is to be counted , as it is in some respects the most plausible , so also the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be more impudently untrue , than that which asserts the general liberty and equality of the hum*n race in the sense of this disorganizing school . The freedom and independence of all , not only outwardly but inwardly also , is conditioned always by the position assigned to them of God in the social organism to which they belong . All are free only as comprehended in given social relations , and in the measure of their correspondence as parts with the idea of the whole . The proper unity of life , as an organic system , involves of necessity the conception not simply of manifold distinction , hut of relative dependence also and subordination . Of this we hate a broad , perpetual exemplification , in the constitution of the sexes . The school which we have now in view , affects td vindicate what it calls the rights of woman against the authority of the stronger sex , as though this had taken advantage of its accidental physical superiority in this view , to assert a primacy and lordship here , which is in full violation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage , it is said , turns his wife into a slave , the instrument of his own pleasure and convenience ; and it is only a higher order of the same barbarism , by which , in the reigning structure of our present civilization , the whole sex is shorn of its political and public rights , and forced to devote itself to the service of man in the nursery and kitchen . We need in this respect , we are told , a reconstruction of society , in such a way that , among other abuses , this Mohammedan prejudice also may be fully abolished , admitting woman thus to a free participation in all public counsels and transactions , so far as she may show ability for the purpose ; and placing her on full level with the opposite sex both at home and abroad . So runs the theory . It has the universal custom of the world against it , and also what would seem to be the most explicit testimony of the Bible . But of this we speak not at present . We meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so term it , of our human nature itself , drawn forth with overwhelming evidence from the everlasting mountains of its original constitution . The theory in question is just as unphilosophical as it is unbiblical and contrary to all history . It violates morality and nature alike . It is by no accident , or violent wrong merely , that woman is made to occupy a secondary rank in the economy of human society . Her outward weakness makes it necessary , to some extent ; but this itself is only the index of a still deeper necessity for it , in her spiritual constitution . All the purposes of her being , all the conditions of her welfare and peace , all the laws of her interior organization , require this subordination to the other sex , and urge her towards it as the only possible way in which her personality can be made complete . This relation of dependence needs to be well fortified indeed against abuse ; as it may run easily otherwise into vast tyranny and wrong ; but still it remains forever indispensable in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character constitutes emphatically her spiritual salvation . It is not in her physical nature merely that she is formed to lean on man as her necessary prop and stay . He is the ultimate centre also of 1848. 379 // her personality , through which alone she can stand in right organic communication with the general world , and so attain to true and solid freedom in her own position . No agrarian radicalism can ever change the moral order of humanity here , for we may say of it precisely as the Psalmist does of the constitution of the plan*ts : " Forever , 0 Lord , thy word is settled in heaven ! " The emancipation of these heavenly bodies from their appointed orbits , were just as rational an object of reforming zeal as the attempt to set woman free from her natural subordination to the beadship of man . All such freedom is something monstrous in its very nature ; and the wrong which it involves can never fail to avenge itself with terrible moral retribution on all concerned in it , wherever it may be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if she can be tempted thus to forsake her own character and sphere . She must unsex herself , more or less , in the very step ; and by doing so , she is necessarily shorn , to the same extent , of all her native dignity and strength . The more thoroughly masculine she may prove herself to be in this way , the more fully and certainly will it be at the cost of all true respect , whether public or private . The process of such unnatural self-dereliction exerts unavoidably , at the same time , a demoralizing influence on her own spirit . She becomes in reality coarse , and the fine gold of her nature is turned into what must be counted at best but common brass . Society , too , is made to suffer necessarily , by the perversion . It requires a certain amount of moral fanaticism , in the first place , to endure at all any such aberration of the sex from its proper sphere , and the thing itself can never fail subsequently to aggravate the evil out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exercised in this form , is not at all to refine the face of life , but to render it vulgar and harsh . Such an " emancipation , " made general iu any community , would involve the overthrow ultimately of all taste and refinement , the downfall of all morality ai'id civilization . It deserves to be well considered , that this doctrine of the full co-ordination of the sexes in the social system , strikes necessarily at last at the sanctity of the marriage relation . It is the subordination of the female nature to that of man precisely which makes room for that peculiar union of the two , in which the true idea of marriage consists . The possibility of such an inward personal oneness as it requires in the case of husband and wife , turns not simply on their difference of sex , but on the order also in which this relati on is found actually to hold . The common personality which is thus created , must have a real centre on which to rest ; and the correspondence between the sexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one side only , and not to the other . The help which each needs here in the other , is not at all , in this respect , of parallel character . The whole nature of woman urges her towards man , as the necessary centre of her own being ; her personality is so constituted , that it can be perfected only by falling over upon the deeper and broader consciousness of man , as its ultimate support . The personality of man , on the contrary , is constitutionally formed to take this central position , and is made complete by woman , not as the basis of his being , but as the necessary integration simply of its proper compass and volume . So related , the two are suited to flow together in the power of one and the same life , and may be expected to do so , where the proper conditions are present , by the mysterious union of marriage ; which , in such view , is no outward temporary contract of merely civil nature , no simply moral partnership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a mystical , sacramental band rather , that reaches into the inmost sanctuary of life , and is thus of indissoluble force by its very nature . All this , however , is made to assume a different aspect , as soon as we lose sight of the oider which holds in the original interior economy of the sexes , and , under the pretence of restoring woman to her inborn rights , admit such a view of her nature as sets it in full parallel with the opposite nature of man . There is no reom then for the idea of marriage , as the organic comprehension of two lives in the power of a single personal root . It is impossible to withstand the fatal error , by which it is resolved icto the conception of a simply outward compact between independent parties for mutual convenience and profit . Then of course its inviolable 380 Oct. , // sanctity is gone , and no good reason can whether it be avowed or not , to run into be assigned why it should not become as that worst form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any which the marriage tie itself is proclaimed other kind . So it is , that all Socialism , a mere social abuse . In its " pretended having no sense of the true nature of the regard for the dignity and freedom of wosexual union as the basis of all morality man , it robs her of the entire glory of her and society under a settled and necessary sex , and takes away the last bulwark of form , shows a tendency always in fact , her independence and strength.
