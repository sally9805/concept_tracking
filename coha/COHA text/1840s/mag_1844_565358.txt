txt WE shall discuss , on the present occasion , but one point of this important subject . We shall inquire into the ground upon which the government has negotiated for the incorporation of Texas with this nation . That ground is the real one . The government has been under the control of Southern statesmen , who have foreseen and have plainly declared that the agricultural and commercial interests of the Southern states will he injured by the annexation . We may be certain , therefore , that the consideration which has outweighed these foreseen evils , is not only the paramount consideration , but is one , in their estimation , of great importance . The interest which the government has sought to promote at such an expense , is the one which is to bring Texas into the Union . We do not ask , then , what ground might be taken , nor what ground individuals have taken , but the ground which the government has taken upon this subject . Nor shall we discuss the less important considerations , but the one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we catch at mere rumors to settle this point . We ask the attention of our readers to the grave state papers which have become a portion of the history of the country . What , then , is that interest , which the government has set forth in its state papers as the great and leading one to be promoted by the annexation ? We answer , Slaverq . Slavery , in some of its manifold relations , meets us in almost every paragraph of these documents . But we desire a nearer view . What is the particular interest of slavery which is to be advanced ,  --  what the particular aspect which the government has looked at in this transaction ? What is the precise object which it has had in view in this movement in behalf of * Public Documents . slavery ? The public documents furnish a reply . It is not , then , to increase the value of slave plantations . It seems to be taken for granted , that it will seriously depreciate it . To show the extent of this anticipated depreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that so far from having any pecuniary interest in the annexation , his friends have calculated that he will lose fifty thousand dollars by it in the diminution of the value of his estates . It is not , then , to open a new market for the productions of the slave region . Texas , on the contrary , might supply the world with cotton and sugar , and her annexation will raise up , as Mr. Upshur says , ( letter of Sept. * 1843 , to Mr. Murphy , ) " a powerful competitor . " If it benefit in a pecuniary respect any part of the country , it is that part only which excites the constant vigilance of Southern politicians for its opposition to slavery . It is nor , then , to extend and stimulate the slave-trade of the United States . For , though that may and undoubtedly will be the effect , still that is not the object for which the government has been preparing the way for annexation . Nor is it to facilitate the success of the principles of free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that subject , it will be , as the government argues , to bring a country under the Tariff laws , which , as an independent nation , with free trade , would tlestroy the Tariff . Thus , it will uphold the very system which is regarded as so hostile to slaveholding interests . It is none of these . On the contrary , the slave interest will be injured in these important respects ,  --  respects so important , that for a single one of them , it has been ready to destroy the integrity of the Union . If , then , annexation diminishes the value of slave plantations ; if it brings a powerful competitor into the market for all the // productions of the southern regions ; if the stimulation of ' the slave-trade is a motive it scorns to use ; if it is a harrier to prevent the overthrow of the tarim ; if it thusi njuresso many Southern interests , what is the grand interest of slavery , which the government has undertaken , with such warm affection and energy , to foster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , the government runs the fearful risk of war , and the still more fearful one of alienating from itself the attachment of a large portion of its citizens ? What is that object which slavery has in view , when she is so ready to sacrifice her other interests ? XVhat is the overwhelming necessity , which has compelled the government to force the subject upon the attention of a foreign nation , which hates slavery , there to be looked at with new abhorrence , and to be commented upon with renewed indignation by the wisest statesmen , the profoundest scholars , the most learned and pious clergy , the lights of the world , who , disagreeing upon many things , are all harmonious here , and above all , to be talked over by a whole people , who have a deep , everliving feeling towards slavery , and that feeling , hatred against it ? What , we say , is that overwhelming necessity which has compelled the government to thrust this dangerous and excitable subject upon the arena of politics at home , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand inflamed orators , and to be borne by every newspaper that issues from the press , to every inhabitant of the land ? What , we ask again , is that overwhelming necessity which has compelled the government to introduce this solemn and awful subject into the house of God and the meeting of prayer , to be judged by the principles of the Bible , and to be carried in petitions for its abolition to the throne of the Almighty ? It is the necessity of preventing a few thousand slaves in Texas from being made free . it is to provide with wicked forethought against the possibility of that region filling up with freemen . There , is a country embracing one hundred and sixty thousand square miles ,  --  we refer only to Texas proper ,  --  big enough to make five states as large as South Carolina , all adapted to the growth of Southern products , and all of ' the greatest fertility . There , possibly ,  - -  a bare possibility , however , hardly more than the delusion of hope ,  --  may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a climate and upon soils heretofore consecrated to slave labor . But the vision of a republic upon our southwestern border , untarnished by slavery , fills our government with horror and alarm . To prevent the possibility of such a glo. - rious sight , as we must call it , all the resources of diplomatic skill and the whole influence of the government are put in requisition . Rather than have slavery abolished in Texas , every other slave interest is to be damaged , and slavery itself to be searched with indignant scrutiny by the civilized and Christian world . As a nation , we have endured the burden of slavery upon our conscience , because we have regarded it as a calamity fastened upon us before we became an independent people . We have always supposed that our government has viewed it as a mighty evil , to be endured only because it could not be thrown off . We have always so claimed it among ourselves and before the world . But what are we now doing ? At the prospect of another republic , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when light , before it has grown so mighty as to overpower every other interest , the government hastens , with alarmed speed , to bind it upon her forever . The free states have always sympathized with southern statesmen when they have groaned under this evil , and professed their willingness to get rid of it , if it could be done ; but now we find these very statesmen , having the control of government in their own hands , when they fear a neighboring republic will overthrow // 455 it , using all the power of this great Country to make the curse of slavery there perpetual . But , our object is to show the ground upon which the government has acted , not to comment upon it , if we can help it . We come then to the documents . The earliest statepaper , and the one which opens the whole subjeQt , is a letter from Mr. Upshur to Mr. Murphy , dated Aug. 8 , 1S43 . We quote the first paragraph . DEPARTMENT OF STATE , Washington , Aug. 8 , 1843 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland , then in London , contains the following passage " I learn , from a source entitled to the fullest confidence , that there is now here a Mr. Andrews , deputed by the abolitionists of Texas to negotiate with the British government . That he has seen Lord Aberdeen , and submitted his project for the abolition of slavery in Texas , which is , that there shall be organized a company in England , who shall advance a sum sufficient to pay for the slaves now in Texas , and receive in pay* Texas lands ; that the sum thus advanced shall be paid over as an indemnity for the abolition of slavery and I am authorized by the Texan minister to say to you , that Lord Aberdeen has agreed that the British government will guarantee the payment of the interest on this loan , upon condition that the Texan government will abolish slavery . " We pause here a moment . What ought to have been the feelings of an American statesman , acting for enlightened freemen , and in the genuine spirit of American liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , which is our shame and may be our ruin , might be eradicated from that young republic before it was fastened forever upon its vitals ? What but gratitude to God , that in His unexpected providence He was arresting at the outset this mighty evil ? And , if a proper regard for the interests of his own country should lead him to examine with care the re lations which the government ofGreat Britain might sustain towards it , what more could be required of him than to see that England got no other advantage than what must result from the good-will felt towards her for her humanity ? But what were the feelings ? Terror and alarm . Says Mr. Upshur , " A movement of this sort can not be contemplated by us in silence . Such an attempt upon any neighboring country would necessarily be viewed by this government with very deep concern . " Why not , rather , with earnest hope for the success of this new experiment in humanity ? Great Britain has paid hundreds of thousands of pounds to Spain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abolishing the slavetrade ; and universal humanity has applauded the generous deed , and the whole church has thanked God for the example of Christian benevolence on so broad a scale . But England has found by experience that the slave-trade can only be abolished by the abolition of slavery itself . If now she is willing to look with approbation upon a loan made by her citizens to Texas to pay the masters for consenting to emancipation , ought not this government , as most assuredly all other governments would do , to rejoice in this new instance of humanity in the conduct of nations ? If there was to be any rivalry , ought it not to have been in contributing to so desirable a result ' ? If there were to be any feats of diplomacy , ought they not to have been directed rather to the abolition of slavery by the promise of annexation ? To have accomplished that , would confer immortal honor on a statesman , and its record , be the proudest page in our country 's history . But , Mr. Upshun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , " - the Secretary can not even use the proper expression , for an act of intended kindness is not usually called an attempt on any one- " would necessarily be viewed by this government with very deep concern ; but // 456 Texas . when it is made upon a nation whose territories join the slavehold ing states of our Union , it awakens a still more solemn interest . It can not be permitted to succeed without the most strenuous efforts on our part to arrest a calamity so serious to every part of our country . " The government of this nation , speaking for the whole people , as it should do in its intercourse with foreign nations , pronounces the abolition of slavery in Texas a calamity to every part of our country . Texas , therefore , is to be annexed to this country to prevent a serious calamity to evecy part of it . And that calamity is , that Texas may do what the wisest and purest philanthropists of the age labored so long to achieve , and what , now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christian world as an everlasting monument to the humanity of the nineteenth century . That calamity is , that Texas may do what the free states of this Union , as soon as our own independence was established , hastened to do , as their duty and honor , arid what there are no sacrifices , we are persuaded , they would not now make , to aid the other stales in doing . That calamity is , that Texas may do what in the extermination of slavery from the world , is looked forward to by the whole church of Christ , as the great triumph of Christianity . That calamity is , that 1'exas may abolish slavery . We might perhaps prove that it would be no calairiity at all . We might perhaps say wi h truth , there are some parts of the country which would not feel it to he a calamity . But that is not to our present purpose . Our government has declared in its own state papers , that the abolition of slavery in Texas must be met by the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest this serious calamity to every part of our coun try , have been made . The result is , the treaty of anmnexation . Annexation , therefore , is placed by our governrnent entirely on the ground that the abolition of slavery in Texas may he prevented by joining it to our own country , where it is supposed slavery will be perpetual . Our government has done not a little for the perpetuation of slavery . Feeble as slavery was at the time when its interests were incorporated into the federal constitution and ready to perish , as was hoped by a large portion of the country , under the influence of the sentiments of liberty inspired by the discussion of human rights and the triumph of the Revolution , it has notwithstanding strengthened with our strength and grown with our growth . It has partaken of the impulse which the energy of freemen has given to every thing else . The government , too , has done much to broaden its foundations and to enlarge its superstructure . But all this has been to niaintam what was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise , an enterprise to excite the abhorrence of the world . It is no less than to establish slavery anew in a country virtually free . We repeat it , that the t*overnment has attempted to establish slavery in a country virtually free . For it annexes Texas to prevent its becoming a free country . It acts upon the supposition that it will become so , unless joined to our slavery-protecting Union . Mr. Upshur gives it as his opin. ion so late as the 16th of last Jaiiuary , ( letter to Mr. Murphy , Jan. 16 , 1844 , ) " that if Tex 's should riot be attached to the United States , she can riot maintain that institution ten years and probably not half that time . " Thus our citizens first introduced slaves into Texas in violation of the laws of Mexico , an ( l , now that again it is likely to become a free country , our government steps in , and fixes slavery upon its soil for ever . This is a new measure . We may not be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curse upon others ? We may feel our efforts paralyzed in the alleviation of the evil in our own country , by the great- // 457 ness of ' the difficulty , but shall we plunge another country int.o these difficulties ? Have we not reproach enough to bear already , and shall we take away the defense we have , that we did not establish slavery in this country , by establishing it ourselves in another ? We thus see that our government has adopted a principle of action on this subject . Its tears of abolition in Texas may have been unfounded or otherwise . The opinion of the Secretary just quoted may be extravagant . That is not the point . The government supposed slavery might be abolished there ; it acted or the supposition that it would be , and laid clown a principle of action applicable in all such cases . It declares that slavery shall not be abolished in Texas . But it may be said , that the government has not objected to the abolition of slavery in Texas , but to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say , rather than let Great Britain be the instrument in abolishing slavery in Texas , we will interfere and make it perpetual . But it may be said that it is not against her being the mere instrument , but because she will gain an influence adverse to our interests ; but have we no way of preventing this but by fastening slavery upon Texas ? But it uiay be said even that is not the reason , but it is because she will get a position there by which she may exert an influence for the promotion of the abolition of slavery in this country . Very well . That only makes the case worse . For according to this , Texas is to be annexed to this country , not only to prevent the abolitionism of slavery there , but to counteract the remote probability of an influence tending to to its abolition among ourselves . And this is the ground which the government actually takes . Texas is to be annexed to the Union to prevent the abolition of slavery . But we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the African race . It does not seek to perpetuate slavery for the mere gratification of inflicting suffering . It has objects of interest in doing it . These are two , as set forth in the public documents ; it would prevent the abolition of slavery in Texas , first , because its abolition would be the first step in the abolition of slavery on the American continent and islands ; and seconcl4i , because , if it should not have that effect , a free republic on our southwestern border would be fatal to the peace and tranquillity of the slaveholding States . We proceed to the proof . We still quote from Mr. Ijpshur 's letter to Mr. Murphy : Ifsuch an attempt wereconfinedtottie abolitionists of Texas , ' it would scarcely merit grave consideration . Tbeir numbers , it is believed , are very small ; and tbe state of public opinion is by no means favorable to the success of their enterprise . But if it be a fact that it has engaged the attention of Lord Aberdeen , and that he has pledged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possesses an importance which demands our serious attention . it can not be supposed that England means to limit her designs to the emancipation of a few tbousand slaves . Sbe would have ulterior objects far more important to her and far more interesting to us . We might probably consider this as part of a generat plati by which England would seek to abolish domestic slavery throughout tbe entire continent and islands of America , in order to find or create new markets for the products of her home industry , and at tbe same time to destroy all competition with the industry of her colonies , in the great staples of sugar and cotton , her colonies of the East and West Indies are unable to compete with the slave labor of the United States , Texas and Braxil . Experience has shown that those articles can not be produced to any considerable extent on the continent of America by the labor of white men ; and of course , if slavery can he abolished on that continent , the great rivals of her colonial industry will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should seek elsewhere in vain , of many of her most important measures . No other adequate motive can be found for her determined and persevering course in regard to domestic slaverv in other countries . This view of the case should never be lost sight of in forming // our opinions of ' the object and probable tendency of all her movements upon this point . " This paragraph contains two points , acliarge againstGreat Britain ofagenera ! plan to abolish slavery throughout the entire continent and islands of America , and an explanation of the motives for this vast project . The disclosure on the part of the government of the general policy of England against slavery , will not strike our readers as any novelty . We will , therefore , waive this part of the subject for the present , the more especially because Mr. Upshur has in another letter furnished the proof of the existence of this plot to abolish that institution . We acknowledge that every instance of extraordinary benevolence in the conduct of nations , demands the serious attention of the governments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England in respect to the slave trade and slavery as the most extraordinary instance of an apparently disinterested and humane policy the world has ever beheld , and most persons , we presume to say , have found it very difficult to account for it on the ground of the " usual course of policy among great nations . " Our government , it is manifest , has been not a little perplexed by the question . It is impossible , " says Mr. Upshur , ( letter to Mr. Everett , Sept. 28 , 1843 , ) " to suppose that England is actuated in this matter by a mere feeling of philanthrophy . We are forced to believe she is acting upon motives more in the usual course of policy among great nations , yet equally worthy of her as a wise and po*veiful country . " The paragraph above quoted explains the policy of England towards slavery " according to the usual course of policy amon. * great nations . " It is this . Free labor in her colonies in the East and West Indies can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , Texas and Brazil . Wherefore , England has formed the comprehensive design of turning all the productive slave labor of this continent into unproductive free labor . To state *t in other words , England has freed 800,000 slaves in the West indies and a large number in the East Indies . But she finds that she has thereby diminished the productiveness of her colonies , and she can no longer compete with the great rivals of her colonial industry , the United States , Texas and Brazil . But instead of retracing her steps and reducing all these freemen to slavery a gain , she seeks the same end in a round about way by converting the two millions and a half of slaves in this country , and the unnumbered thousands of South America , from industrious bondsmen into idle fleemen . " No other adequate motive can be found for her determined and persevering course in regard to domestic slavery in other countries . " And " this is equally wart/my of her as a wise and powerjnl country , " as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not within our design to argue against this explanation , but we will take the liberty to draw from it a single inference . For , however absurd it is-so absurd as only to be equalled by the explanation of some French writer , that England abolished slavery in her colonies only bebecause free labor was more productive than slave labor  --  the making of such an explanation shows either that our government can not comprehend and feel the claims of justice and humanity in the abolition of slavery , or that , comprehending and feeling them , it holds that they are outweighed by the claims of dollars and cents . It is not strange , in this view , that our government shotild seek to prevent the first step being taken in this gigantic scheme of abolition , that is , of converting millions of industrious slave laborers into unproductive drones for the purpose of diminishing the productive industry of the world . The only way it can devise of doing this is to annex Texas to this country . // But as the abolition of slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed for a long time , by abolition on the other parts of the continent , the government has been forced to examine its immediate effects upon our slave system ; and these it finds to he so disastrous as to make it sound policy to annex Texas and perpetu* ate slavery there . To show this we quote again from Mr. Upshur 's letter to Mr. Murphy : " But there is another view of this subject still more important to us , and scarcely less Important to Texas herself ' . The establish nient , in the very midst of our slaveholding States , of an independent government , forbidding the existence of slavery , and hy a people horn , for the most part , among us , reared up in our habits , and speaking our language , could not fail to produce the most unhappy effects upon both parties . If Texas were in that c ( indition , her territory would afford a ready refuge for the fugitive slaves of Louisiana and Arkansas , and would hold out to them an encouragement to run away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counteract . ' * The Secretary then proceeds to trace out the conseqtiences of this . The argument is , that the existence of Texas as a free state , having abolished slavery , would be a lure to our slaves to leave their bondage and to become freemen . This self-emancipation would produce a state of things which would lead either to a war on the part of the government , o rtoa dissolution of the Union in the attempt of the slave States to avenge themselves . We reply , that the emancipation of slaves in Texas xvould either make them good laborers and useful citizens , and therefore place them in a better situation than in slavery , or it would not do it . If it should not do it-if freedom should increase insanity and idiocy among them to the fearful degree asserted by Mr. Senator Walker and the present honorable Secretary of State , or if it should diminish the products of industry as asserted by Mr. Upshur , so that Texas could not compete with us  --  or if the free negro is the idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government of Texas would be as ready to prevent the immigration of slaves as the slaveholders themselves . But if freedom should be a blessing to them-if they should under the free government of Texas prove what has always been claimed , that negro freemen can cultivate a southern soil and become good and useful citizens , then we say that to go to war to prevent these slaves from enjoying this blessing would be an abomination in the sight of heaven and earth ; and to join Texas to our country on the ground of preventing such a result would be only an aggravation of the enormous wickedness . But we will not examine this part of the correspondence further . The Secretary ends as he began . " Few calamities could befall this country more to be deplored than the establishment of a predominant British influence and the abolition of domestic slavery in Texas . " We will only say , that the improbability of a predominant British influence and the absurdity of the supposition that Texas would abolish slavery , do not affect the principle of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposition had been a reality , it would have advanced the same . And that principle is to prevent the abolition of slavery in any neighboring country , and in the present case by annexing it to our own . It may be that the plan of annexation was not matured as early as the 8th of August , when the letter was written . But the subject of annexation had been too much agitated not to be present to the mind of the writer , and , besides , the same arruments were employed after the plan was settled . This letter was forwarded to Galveston , where it produced a " whirlwind of emotion , " as he says , " in the bosom " of W. S. Murphy , Esq. , our Secretary of Legation . We are not particularly acquainted with Texan whirlwinds . We suppose they are // very much like other whirlwinds , overthrowing , uprooting and devastating . The present one seems to have spent its fury pretty nearly in the place of its origin and not to have done much damage even there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legation with sufficient strength to attend to his duties . He reports that one Andrews had set on foot in London the plan to abolish slavery in Texas . But we may infer there was no great prospect of its success , for it is added , that on his return to fexas , the citizens drove him l ) y force from the state , denying him the privilege of return . " But no sooner does the government escape from one danger than it falls into another . The danger now is , the negotiations between Mexico and Texas , through the mediation of Great Britain ; for , " the surrender of sovereignty by Texas to Mexico at once liberates all the slaves in Texas . " " Can the United States longer doubt what to do ? " Of course not , join on Texas and perpetuate her slavery . " Pardon me I am warm on this subject . " But his warmth does not consume his cunning . He advises the Secretary of State " to say nothing of abolition " - nothing " which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mr. Murphy may be dismissed . We will now turn our attention to the correspondence with Mr. Everett in London . The most important part of it consists in two communications forwarded at the same time , the one a public despatch and the other a more confidential letter . Our present purpose it will be remembered , is not so much to argue against the ground taken by the government , as to show what it is . We will prove , then , that in the great question of the peaceable abolition of slavery , which is now before the nations of the earth , our government has placed this nation on the side of perpetual slavery . We have seen thus far that it has striven to prevent the abolition of slavery in Texas , as hostile to the peace of the slaveholding States , and as the first step in the universal emanx*ipation of the slaves of the western hemisphere . We shall find in this correspondence the government , more especially defining its position , as the antagonist power to England in her efforts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most distinguished for wisdom , active benevolence and freedom of any in Europe , is at the head of the moral movement of nations against slavery ; the United States , as the most powerful nation on this continent and the most interested in slavery , is placed by the government , as the leading power to resist this movement . We will now proceed to the proof . The correspondence is dated Sept. 28 , 1843 . The public despatch sets out with an attempt to show " that there are many and strong reasons for believing that the abolition of domestic *lavery throughout the continent and islands of America , is a leading object in the present policy of England . " It has generally been regarded as a great feat of reasoning to prove by argument what every body admits to be true . The Secretary has shown himself skillful its these achievements . Lord Brougham 's remarks in the House of Lords on the 18th of August , on the subject of Texas and Texan slavery , says Mr. Upshur , " have attracted the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that Texas was a country of the greatest capabilities-that she had a population not exceeding 100,000 , free and slaves , white an ( J colored , but that he was grieved to learn that not less than one-fourth of the whole population or 25,000 , were in a state of slavery-that she could obtain her slaves only from the American market-that he was " irresistibly anxious for the abolition of slavery in Texas , because , if it were abolished , not only would that country be cultivated by free and white labor , but it would put a stop to the habit of breeding // 461 slaves for the Texan market , * the consequence would be , that they would solve this great question in the history of ' the United States , for it must ultimately end in the abolition of slavery in America . lie , therefore , looked forward most anxiously to the abolition of slavery in Texas , as he was convinced that it would tiltimately end in the abolition of slavery throughout the whole of America . lie knew that the Texans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery , if Mexico could be induced to recognize their independence . 1f therefore , by our good offices , we could get the Mexican government to acknowledge the independence of Texas , he would suggest a hope that it might terminate in the abolition of slavery in Texas , and ultimately the whole of the southern States of A merica . " The object of Lord B. was to inquire of Lord Aberdeen into the state of the negotiations on that point . Lord A berdeen in reply stated that there was great difficulty in persuading Mexico to acknowledge the independenee of Texas , that an armistice had been established between the two powers , and he hoped that this would lead to the absolute acknowledgement of the independence of Texas by Mexico . " The armistice * The object of Lord B. is to destroy the trado of slave-breeding in the upper northerti States , and thus to overthrow slavery in them . Several of our statesmen at the north have looked at the same subject but from a differet , t point of view . Lord B. proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but our statestoen to stimulate the market and titus exhaust the supply ! ( See resolutions introduced into the Connecticut legislattire . ) It is astonishing that any one can put forth such an argument . Can we wish for a more active slave market to drain off slaves from the tipper slave states than what has existed for so long a time in Alattama , Mississippi and Louisiana ? And what is the result ? While there has been a reduction in Maryland and Delaware since 1790 , of about 30000 , from 111,953 to 92,372-in Virginia there has been an inn'eese of over 150,000 , from 293,000 to 448,957. was an important step to obtain ; and he hardly need say that every effort on the part of her Majesty 's government would lead to that result which was contemplated by his noble friend . " Lord Brougham expressed his satisfaction . But here 's the rub-with what did he express his satisfaction ? Did " the result , " Lord Aberdeen spoke of* refer to the abolition in Texas , or did he anticipate the breaking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slavery here  --  and was this what Lord Brougham was satisfied with ? We will not pursue the Secretary through the subleties of argumentation , but will only state his conclusion . " It does no violence to the rules of fair construction to understand his language as an avowal of designs , which , whether so intended or not , threaten very serious consequences to the United States . " The Secretary adds , " The President would be very reluctant to believe " - Mr . Tyler , it is notorious is slow in believing some things- " that any design unfriendly to this country , or aiming at the institutions* of any of the states of our Union , enters into the policy of England . lie can not , however , look with indifference t*Oti such declarations as these , made by her leading statesmen , and with the full authority of her government . He attaches the more importance to these declarations , because they are perfectly consistent with in form ation received from other sources , all tendng to the conclusion that the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not limited to Texas alone . " But the Secretary does not appear quite satisfied with the accuracy of his own conclusion . fle therefore tells Mr. EverettThe object of this government is to discover whether it is or is not the design * Institutions . Why the plural ? I-las the President ever charged her with aiming at more than one institution ? Was it worthy of the President tu have recourse to this petty sophistry , the " Fallacia . /flccidentis of the Logicians ? // 462 Texas . of England to procure the abolition of ' negro slavery in Texas ; whether it is or is not contemplated in her policy to destroy or affect that in4itution as it exists in some of the states of our Union ; what measures she has pursued and is pursuing for the accomplishment of those objects , or either of them . I can not , of ' course , point out to you the channels through which this information may be best acquired . It is probable that much may he learned hy free communication with the Texan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States have a common interest in the questions involved , there is every reason why their governments should understand each other . Much information may doubtless be obtained from private individuals and from the published pr3ceedings of abolition societies . " It is to be regretted that the Secretary could not have pointed out the best channels of information , for discovering the policy of ' Great Britain on the subject of slavery . We have some reason to suspect that Mr. Everett has missed them ; at any rate , we are just where we were before the scrutiny commenced . But as if to anticipate the failure of the private sources , the Secretary , after directing our minister to interrogate individuals , closet himself ' with the Texan embassador , and wade through the sea of anti-slavery documents in search of ' " confirmations strong as proof of ' Holy Writ , " orders him to forsake the " secondary channels , " and go to the fountain head , Lord Aberdeen himself ' . There are many extraordinary things in these documents , but we give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to italicixe a few expressions , but found we should be obliged to mark the whole , and gave it up . We do not now know whether to regard it as a rich specimen of ' honest simplicity , or a mock-heroic prelude to our entrance as a nation upon the field of combat in defense of slavery . We incline to think our government was honestly frightened , and thought Great Britain had some designs against the well being of slavery . But whether it be the one or the other , it is as easy to see the position of our government , as if it had come out boldly and said , We are opposed to the policy of England , by argument to persuade the slaveholding nations to abolish slavery ; and we are determined to use the same means , the nioral influence of ' otr government , to persuade them not to abolish slavery , and , to prevent even the possibility of ' it in the case of Texas , will join it on to ourselves . We may he as fretful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' God is most manifeslly making the abolition of slavery throughout the Christian world , the grand question of this age . It is the next , or one of the next great steps which the world is to take in civilixationthe abolition of slavery and the elevation of the negro race . The question has already passed from the control of individuals and societies and parties , to influence the action of nations . God in his wise providence has brought the nations of the world to the choice , of ' acting for the abolition of slavery or against it ; and our government has chosen to support the cause of slavery . We have entered the field of argument and infltieiice . England undertakes to persuade Mexico to acknowledge the independence of ' Vexas , with the design of ' procuring the abolition of slavery there . We enter the field of ' negotiation against her , and defeat her designs by a treaty to join Texas to ourselves . England tries to persuade Texas it would be best for her to abolish slavery ; we argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful means for the abolition of slavery . We make our proclamation for the perpetuity of slavery . Now , this is fair on both sides . We have a right , as Mr. Upshtir contends , to counteract her influence both in Mexico and rrexas Our government has a right to use all its influence to arrest in its first beginnings any movement towards the abolition of slavery . We do riot deny that ; what we say is , that our government has actually exercised this right-she has actually taken tier position in favor of perpetual slavery // 463 on this continent-she has chosen her place of defense in this great moral attack of the age upon slavery . We are called upon , therefore , to annex Texas to our country , not as so much territory , but to prevent the abobtion of slavery in it  --  and not merely to prevent it there , but to prevent it every where else  --  to take our stand at the head of the host , if we do not rather constitute the whole body , and do moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had entered the field of argument in favor of slavery . Accordingly , along with the public despatch , Mr. Upshur sends an argument in the form of a semi.oflicial letter to Mr. Everett , upon the evils which must result from the abolition of slavery in Texas , and , as a result of that , in the United States . We will give the substance of it . He endeavors to show , first , that the negroes would be obliged to flee from the present slave states into the free , because their present owners could not be expected to endure their presence as freemen ; that these exiles would become either paupers or laborers ,  --  if paupers , they would be a great burden to the free states ,  --  if laborers , they would excite the ill will of the white laborers , or if they were permitted a fair share of labor , it would degrade labor as unworthy of the white man , and it is not the policy of these states or of England thus to degrade labor . Besides , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lead to discord and angry contests destructive of the tranquillity and prosperity of the country . Their condition , therefore , would be sufflciently hard if they should migrate to the free states . But it is still worse to remain at home ; for " the only alternative would be the extermination of the race . " Whence , says Mr. Upshur , " So far then as the slaves themselves are concerned , their condition would be infinitely worse than it now is , while their influence as freemen upon our manners and social condition would not fail to be in the highest degree unfavorable . " He then proceeds to other evils . The second is , that all the liberated blacks being withdrawn or exterminated , the whole productive industry of the south would be destroyed-fields untilled-houses decayed -- -lands worthless -- -creditors unpaid-credit gone . This concl usion is so dreadful , we can not but suspect there is some mistake in the premises . Perhaps a wise legislation might contrive some method of keeping the liberated blacks as hired laborers . But we are not arguing that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government  --  and we see if it proves any thing , it proves the perpetuity of slavery . The third evil is this . As the southern states would not be able to raise cotton , three-fourths of the exports would be cut off . This contraction of the exports would curtail three.fourths of the imports . The diminution of the imports would to that extent diminish the revenue . This state of the revenue would make direct taxation necessary . But , direct taxes could not be very well adjusted , and besides the people would not be rich enough to pay them . Hence , the destruction of government . These are alarming conclusions , and perhaps they could not be avoided *f the original supposition is correct-if all the blacks must leave or be exterminated , and no other laborers should take their place . We are not now upon that question ; it is enough that our government procLims the perpetuity of slavery as necessary to our existence . The fourth evil is , as there would be no cotton grown , our manufactures would su$r , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all similar improvements . Such are the evils of the abolition of slavery in the United States  --  and such , in part , the first exploit of our government on the field of argument in the cause of slavery . But this is not the whole of it . The Secretary proceeds to consider what would be the effects upon the United States of abolition in Texas . He pursues the same train of thought as in his letter to Mr. Murphy , which we have already examined . Free- // 464 Texas . dom there would harass slavery here by draining off all the slaves  --  and that would lead to war . Besides , England having persuaded Texas to abolish slavery , would demand and obtain privileges for introducing her manufactures at a lower duty than our own , and thus not only drive ours from that market , but through the Texan frontier would flood our whole southwestern region with her goods , to the destruction of ' our tariff . Besides all this , with slavery abolished in the United States and Texas , it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destroying angel , going about to increase her power by deeds of benevolence , would get that island . Thus our government argues in its support of slavery , that its abolition would be a curse to the blacks , and therefore we will have Texas to prevent the first step in it  --  and a curse to ourselves , and therefore we will enjoy the blessing fotever . In addition , we charge the British government with foreseeing all these evils , and laboring to bring about the abolition of slavery just to produce them , in order to promote her own commercial and manufacturing interests . " It is impossible to suppose that England is actuated in this matter by a mere feeling of philanthropy . " We have thus examined the despatches which were forwarded to Texas and England , on the reception of the secret information from the gentleman of Maryland . That information was , that a plan had been formed in London and favored by the British government , to abolish slavery in Texas . We have seen that the secret was communicated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not a word is said of it in the despatch or confldenti*l letter to Mr. Everett , but his attention is called to the remarks of Lord Brougharn and Lord Aberdeen in the House of Lords . There were perhaps reasons of state . Possibly Lord Brougham and Lord Aberdeen were suspected of being in the plot . i*Te have seen what disastrous effects were produced on Mr. Murphy by the communication from our government . The correspondence with England does not appear to have raised those aerial commotions in London which had been experienced in Galveston . Whether Mr. Everett made any use of the argument in defense of the perpetuity of slavery furnished by our government , we are not informed . Indeed , we are in doubt whether it was intended for the edification of our minister or of the British government . But Mr. E. proceeds immediately to obtain from Lord Aberdeen the categorical answers asked by our government to the questions it had proposed- " W bether it is or is not the design of England , " &amp;c . Mr. Everett maintains his gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally grave . Mr. Everett asks for the most precise information . Lovd Aberdeen is equally ready to grant it , and uses some of our own nicely culled phrases on this " delicate " subject . President Van Buren , in his letter on annexation , remarks that in its intercourse with the Spanish government , our government had always made allowance for a certain pomposity of phrase on her part . It has occurred to us several times that Lord Aberdeen has accommodated himself in the same way to a certain delicacy of phraseology which we have adopted in speaking of slavery . But we give his reply . " Lord Aberdeen said he was blad I had mentioned this subject , for it was one on which he intended himself to make some observations . His attention had been called to some sug*estions in the Amencan papers in favor of the annexation of Texas to the Union , by way of counteracting the designs imputed to England ; and he would say , that if this measure were undertaken on any such arounds , it would be wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had treated *. nd would continue to treat her as an independent power . That England had 1on* been pledged to encourage the abolition of the slave trade nd of slavery , as far as her influence extended , and in every proper way , but had no wish to interfere in the internal concerns of foreign governments . She gave her advice where she thought it // would be acceptable , in favor of the abolition of slavery , but nothing more . In reference to Texas , the suggesfion that England had made or intended to make the abolition of slavery the condition of any treaty arrangement with her , was wholly without foundation . " No language can be plainer . An explanation would only confuse the clearness of our conceptions . Our government has found that the information of the gentleman of Maryland amounted to nothing but what every body knew before , and that England stood in no other relation to Mexico and Texas , or to slavery , than what she had for a long time in a*ntained . Our government is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of England stand on the question of the universal abolition of slavery . It is on the side of emancipation , with the fi*cd determination to use all the inlicence of its advice and persuasion to this end , and nothing but such influence . Our government as deliberate*y takes its position on the side of the perpetuity of slavery . It determines to meet England on the field of argument . Accordingly , Mr. Upshur in his next letter to Mr. Murphy , which must have been written after hearing from Mr. Everett , ( his despatches being dated Nov. 3d and 16th , and this Jan. 16th , 1844 , ) dwells at length and with much eloquence upon the absolute necessity of annexation to the interests , and possibly the safety of both countries . " He also sends him his argument against the abolition of slavery in Texas , which he had before sent to England . The object is , to guard against the influence of England in Texas , and among other things he says " But this is not all . If Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly be taken to fill her territory with emigrants from Europe . Extensive arreogements for this are already made , and they will be carried into effect as soon as the decision of Texas shall be known . These emigrants will brin* with the European feelings and European opinions . Einigr ation from the United States will cease ; at all events , the people of the southern states will not run the hazsrd of subjecting their slave property to the control of a population who re anxious to abolish slavery . Texas will soon cease to be an Ai erican state . Her population , her politics , and her manners , will stamp her as European . This fact alone will destroy the sympathy which now exists between that country and this . " But the first measure of the new emigrants , as soon as they shall have suflicient strength , will be to destroythatgreat domestic institution upon which so touch of the prosperity of our southern country depends . To this England will stimulate them , and she will also furnish the means of accomplishing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Everett . I will only add , that if Texas should not be attached to the United States , she can not maintain that institution ten years , and probably not half that time . Here it is . Texas must be joined to us because , left to berselg she can . not maintain slavery ten years . He then depicts in a strain of powerful writing , the horrors which would result from that occurrence . It is to be observed that this was written after all pretense of any special design on the part of Englatid to abolish slavery in Texas was abandoned . Our government had nothing to fear from England but her moral influence as a government hostile to the existence of slavery . But she still continues to urge , and in this letter with earnest entreaty , the annexation on the ground of preventing the influence of Great Britain from abolishing slavery there . Our government , therefore , brings its influence into the field against the influence of Great Britain on the question of the perpetuation of slavery. * * As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that his l ) art of the correspondence is extremely well writ ten , and , if we admit the correctness of his optotoos respectin* slavery , well r*asoned . He has undoubtedhy seen the real danger which threatens the slave systemthe moral influence of the civihixed and Christian world actively directed against it  --  and has labored to arrest it . lie has failed only because no power can resist that influence . Alas , how much talent , how much honorable fame has been sacrificed on the altar of slavery l // But we will make this still plainer . Lord Aberdeen , to prevent the possibility of mistake as to the views of the British government in relation to slavery , sends a despatch to Mr. Packenham for our government , which , for accuracy of expression and precision of statement , can not be surpassed . We have determined to present it to our readers and we ask for it an attentive perusal . " FOREIGN OFFIcE , Dec. 26 , 1843 . " Sir - As much agitation appears to have prevailed of late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to entertain with regard to the Republic of Texas , Her Majesty 's government deem it expedient to take measures for stopping at once the misrepresentations which have been circulated , and the errors into which the government of the United States seems to have fallen on the subject of the policy of Great Britaiii with respect to Texas . That policy is clear and simple , and may be stated in a few words . " Great Britain has recognized the independence of Texas , and , having done so , she is desirous of seein* that independeiice finally and formally established , and *onerally recognized , especially by Alexsco . But this desire does not arise from any motive of ambition or of self-interest , at least , which attaches to the erieral extension of our commercial dealings with other countries . " We are convinced that the recognition of Texas by Mexico must conduce to the benefit of both these countries , and , as we take an interest in the well being of both , and in their steady advance in power and wealth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico to ackeowledge Texas as independent . Bet in thus acting we have no occult design , either &amp;th reference to any peculiar interest which we might seek to establish in Mexico or in Texas , or even with reference to the slavery which now exists , and which we desire to see abolished in Texas . " *Vith regard to the latter point , it must be and is well known both to the United States and to the whole world , that Great Britain desires , and is constantly exerting bersolf to procure. the general abolition of slavery throughout the world . But the means which she has adopted , and will continue to adopt , for this humane and virtuous purpose , are open and undisguised . She will do nothing secretly or underhand . She desires that her motives may he generally understood , and her acts seen by all . " With regard to Texas , we avow Texas . July , that we wish to see slavery abolished there , as elsewhere , and we should rejoice if the recognition of that coun try by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of Texas to abolish slavery eventually , and under proper conditions , throughout the Republic . But although we earnestly desire and feel it to he our duty to promote such a consummation , we shall not interfere unduly , or with an improper assurnption of authority , with either party , in order to ensure the adoption of such a course . We shall counsel , but we shall not seek to compel , or unduly control , either party . So far as Great Britain is concerned , provided other states act with equal forbearance , those governo cuts will be fully at liberty to make their own unfettered arrangements with each other , both in regard to the abolition of slavery and to all other points . " Great Britain , moreover , does not desire to establish in Texas , whether partially dependent on Mexico or entirely independent , ( which latter alternative we consider in every respect preferable ) any dominant influence . She only desires to share her influence equally with all other nations . Her objects are purely commercial , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly or indirectly , in a political sense , on the United States through Texas . " The British government , as the United States well know , have never sought in any way to stir up disaffection or excitement of any kind in the slaveholding States of the American Union . Much as we should wish to see those States placed on the firm and solid footing which we conscientiously believe is to lie attained by general freedom alone , we have never in our treatment of them made any dif* ference between the slavelioldin* and free States of the Union . All arc , in our eyes , entitled , as component members of the Union , to equal political respect , fitvor , and forbearance , on our part . To that wise and just policy we shall continue to adhere ; and the governments of the elavehmolding States may be assured that , although we shall nut desist from those open and honest efforts which we have constantly made for procuring the abolition of slavery throughout the world , we shall neither openly nor secretly resort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or thereby to affect the prosperity of the Amencan Union . " You will communicate this dispatch to the United States Secretary of State , and if lie should desire it , you will leave a copy of it with him . I am , &amp;c. , ABERDEEN . Right Hon. RIcnAan PACKENHAM , &amp;c. " // If our government still continues to place the annexation on the ground of counteracting the designs of Great Britain to abolish slavery in Texas , it is to counteract " the desires - " the counsels " of Great Britain and nothing more . There is no secret plot-there is no management with Mexico to get her to acknowledge the independence of Texas on the condition of abolishing slaverythere is nothing but desires , advice , persuasion , argument . Our government is under no necessity to place the annexation on the ground of slavery at all . Texas is a fine country and the people wish to live under our government , and that might he a sufficient ground , if we should accede to it . But it does not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of Great Britain . Great Britain " desires and is constantly exerting herself to procure the general abolition of slavery throughout the world . " Our government desires the perpetual existence of slavery and is exerting itself to annex Texas to this country to accomplish it . Great Britain wishes to see slavery abolished in Texas . Our government wishes to see it perpetuated there . Great Britain counsels Texas to do away with slavery ; we urge her to keep it . Great Britain brings her mighty moral power to bear in all proper and peaceful ways against slavery . Our government uses the irresistible energy of this people to maintain it . Mr. Calhoun in reply to Lord Aberdeen , says , that the President " regards with deep concern the avowal , for the first time made to this government , that Great Britain desires and is constantly exerting herself to procure the general abolition of slavery throughout the world . ' " But there is not a philanthropist out of the regions of slavery , that does not rejoice at it . All civilized governments but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoices at it . And , we believe , that the Sovereign of the Universe , who holds the nations in the hollow of his hands , looks down upon it from his throne of justice , and mercy and love , with approbation . We quote another paragraph : " It is with still deeper concern the President regards the avowal of Lord Aberdeen , of the desire of Great Britain to see slavery abolished in Texas ; and , as he infers , is endeavoring , through her diplomacy , to accomplish it , hy making the aholition of slavery one of the conditions on which Mexico should acknowledge her independence . It has confirmed his previous ilopressions as to the policy of Great Britain in reference to Texas , and made it his duty to examine with much care and solicitude what would he its effects on the prosperity and safety of the United States , should she succeed in her endeavors . " The result of that careful examination was , that Texas might yield to the counsels of Great Britaiti , and abolish slavery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain the most efficient means of affecting in the neighboring States of this Union what she avows to be her desire to do in all countries where slavery exists . " That is to say , Great Britain might thereby be better able to argue the question of slavery with the neighboring States and persuade them by her advice to abolish slavery . For counsel , advice and argument , is all she avows a desire to use . And how does the government answer the arguments and persuasions of England ' ? We dare not use our own language lest we should not be believed . We quote atTain : " To hazard consequences which would be so dangerous to the prosperity and safety of the Union , that is , the danger of slavehoiders beia* persuaded h ? , the odvice and arguments of Great Britei to abolish slavery , without resorting to the most effective measures to prevent them , would be , on the part of the Federal Government , an abandonment of the most solemn obligation imposed by the guarantee which the States , iii adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever might endanger their safety , whether from without or within . Acting in obedience to this obligation , on which our federal system of // government rests , the President directs roe to inform you that a treaty has been concluded between the United States and Texas , for the annexation of the latter to the former as a part of its territory . " Thus , not only has the government adopted it as a measure of policy , to counteract the influence of England against slavery , but it regards it as a constitutional obligation . We are bound by the Constitution to annex Texas and every other neighboring country , where there is any danger that the arguments of England may avail to the overthrow of slavery . This , by their allegiance to the Constitution the people owe to the slaveholding States ; and there will be nullification , we suppose , if it is not done , and the dissolution of the Union from those who say that the government has nothing to do with slavery-nothing to do with it but to make it perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? We know not that our readers will agree with us , but we think Mr. Calhoun has even exceeded himself . He was not satisfied to counteract the " counsels " of Great Britain by the treaty , but he must meet argument with argument . And such an an argument ! According to which emancipation has not only made negroes deaf , dumb , blind , insane , idiotic and vicious , but it has m de four insane negroes in a town of Maine out of one , and in some towns several out of none at all ! and converted the one hundred and thirty-three lunatics and idiots supported at the public expense in the State Hospital at Worcester , into so many colored ones But we must come to a close . We think we have shown beyond room for cavil that our government in the documents of this transaction , has placed this nation in the front rank of the supporters of perpetual slavery-that it has pledged us to maintain the cause of servitude against the whole civilized and Christian world , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to this country , not as so much territory , but to anticipate and to provide against the danger that Texas might yield to the counsel of Great Britain and abolish slavery . It may be thought that the rejection of the treaty is a rejection of the principles upon which it was negotiated ; and that the question now before the people is to be placed on different grounds . We can not so regard it . The matter of fact is , that the government was under the control of southern statesmen , who , in these documents , doubtless expre *s the wishes , and sentiments , and principles of the great body of the southern people . These are just the same now as they were before the treaty was rejected , and if Texas comes into the Union , it will be brought in by that portion of the people who hold them . We go farther . ILhe slaveholding States are fully determined that slavery shall be perpetuated forever-if they are fixed upon this point that they and their descendants through all generations must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Calhoun , and Mr. MeDuffie , and other leading statesmen of the *cuth , have adopted the only policy adapted to secure that end . The abolition of slavery is , as we have before said , the great moral question of the age . It is the grand question in civilization which is now before the world . It has , therefore , concentrated upon itself , more talents , more piety , and hope , and benevolence , more energy and zeal than , taking the world through , all other questions , and it is yearly becoming more arid more engrossii*g . It would be idle for southern statesmen to blind their eyes to the fact , that the excitement amoPg the people against slavery is not the stidden ebullition of enthusiasm , but the permanent feeling of wise and sober minded men -- that the mo *ement against it is not the movement of a * See Jarvis on Insanity among the colored population . Am . Jour . Med . Science , January , 1844 , Philadelphia . // few , soon to stop , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of diminishing , conscientious hostility to slavery is becoming fixed deeper and deeper in the hearts of Christians throughout the church-that the current of the literature of the world is setting stronger and stronger against it , and that the governments of the earth have been found to take their stand against it . They are not blind to this fact , and they know where the danger lies . They know that the danger is not that slavery will he overthrown by violence-not that it will be abolished by legislative enactments in Congress-not that it will be undermined by foreign intrigue , but it is , that the consciences of slaveholders themselves may he reached and conquered ; it is , that they themselves can not always resist the earne*t appeals of the Christian church and the convictions of the best portions of mankind formed after long deliberation , of the wrongfulness of slavery , and the public opinion of the world , manifested in literature , and in s9oial and public life . Hence , with broad forecast the leading statesmen and scholars of the south have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common sentiment that slavery is a real blessing , or at any rate can never he abolished ; and , when of late the opportunity was most unexpectedly placed within their reach , they eagerly seized upon it to bring the example and the whole authority of this ; . ation on the side of the perpetuity of slavery , in order to meet and counteract the influence of other natio1is and the public opinion of the world . This is what Texas is wanted for . Mr. Tyler may be influencod by a ridiculous ambition ; others may l ) ave still less worthy motives , but the really great statesmen of the south have taken a far wider view . They desire Texas for no personal motives-they do not desire it as so much territory-they desire it , to destroy the possibility of abolishing slavery there-they desire it , above all , because they want the example and authority of the government on the side of perpetual slavery , it was no hasty and inconsiderate declaration of Mr. Calhoun , that the people of the United States are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with slavery for its overthrow , but to do for it what each State as an independent sovereignty would have done for its safety against damage from wilkout or within . 1-Je would have the broad shield of the Constitution and of the nation cast around the system of slavery as a perpetual institution against the public opinion of the world . The question , then , is not changed by the rejection of the treaty . The ground exists now as before , and the same men are engaged in it . Indeed , we are not sure but that the rejection will be an advantage to them . For , having with wonderful skill and sagacity joined the question of the perpetuity of slavery with the ascendency of democratic principles , if they succeed , they will have committed not merely the government but the nation to the cause of perpetual slavery . This question , and this particular aspect of it , has been forced upon the country . The subject which both the great parties have agreed in keeping apart from the contests of politics , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , that the true question is , not whether Texas shall be united to us in spite of its slavery , but whether it shall be united to us on purpose to perpetuate slavery there and everywhere else .

In fact it would seem that if any great ecclesiastical strife , like that of the Presbyterians , or the Friends , is to agitate the community , or any moral or political question , like that of Abolition , or Naturalization , is to excite rancorous discussions and lead to violence and bloodshed , the city of " brotherly love " is chosen as the scene of action , as a burlesque upon the name .

Who has not heard of the railroad riots , in which the track of the Philadelphia and Trenton railroad was torn up by the inhabitants of the Kensington district , ( through some misunderstanding with the company , ) and the men employed to re-lay it were driven from their work with clubs and stones and even with fire arms ?

It is difficult for one not familiar with the manner in which Philadelphia is districted , to understand how a mob can so easily gain the ascendency there ; and much gratuitous reproach is heaped upon the authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies beyond their control . Philadelphia lies between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers , a few miles above their junction . These rivers , two miles apart , constitute its eastern and western boundaries . The streets parallel with the river , ( i. e. running north and south , ) are regularly numbered from each river to a street near the centre of the city called Broad street . These streets are intersected at right angles by others running east and west from river to river . That which is commonly called Philadelphia extends in its greatest length about four miles from north to south ; but the city proper extends only one mile in that direction . Adjacent to the city , and separated from it and from each // 471 other only by imaginary lines , are nicipal authorities and regulations . several districts , most of which are This division will be made more inincorporated and have their own mu . telligible by the following plan : The city proper covers only the space lying between Vine and South streets , and the two rivers ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.

Adjacent to this district is that of Spring Garden , ( S. G. ) extending from Vine to Poplar streets , and from Sixth street to the Schuylkill . The importance of this district and its entire independence , may be inferred from the fact that permission has been granted to its inhabitants by the legislature of the State , to construct a new dam across the Schuylkill and supply them . selves with water , because the city councils have refused to furnish it to them at the same rate at which it is furnished to the residents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( K. ) and Penn Township , ( P.

The Mayor of the city , therefore , had no authority whatever to suppress them . He becomes a private citizen of Philadelphia County the moment he crosses Vine street . Nor could the Mayor of the Northern Liberties exert his official power to quell the disturbance , for that power is limited by Poplar street . The Sheriff of the County , whose authority extends alike over the city and districts , and the Aldermen of Kensington , were alone empowered to disperse the mob .

A worthy justice of the peace in the Massachusetts colony , stopping one night at a tavern in Rhode Island , was so much annoyed by the frolics of some drunken sailors in the house , that he went in among them and commanded the King 's peace . Finding himself ridiculed and insulted , he was about to enforce the law , when " mine host " took him aside and told him that * Something of this sort exists in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in New Orleans . New Orleans is divided into three municipalities ; but there is a natural ground for such a division in the distinctive characteristics and languages of different classes of its citizens . There are no natural boundaries to separate one part of Philadelphia from another ; to the eye it is all one city ; its inhabitants have the same interests and pursuits , they are one body and ought to have one head . The representative of their interests in the State legislature or in Congress , ought not to be the representative of a ward or district , but of one great community , all whose representatives feel the pulsations of one heart . however much of a dignitary he might be in Massachusetts , he was nothing but a cotnmon subject in Rhode Island . Returning home with his head somewhat addled by this new discovery , he was called upon soon after to perform the marriage ceremony . Determined now to keep within his own jurisdiction , he pronounced the couple to be man and wife as long as they should remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves if ever they should remove beyond it . We imagine that public officers in Philadelphia must often sympathise with the colonial justice in his perplexity . Yet this arrangement has heenso long in existence that it is likely to be permanent . it opens too many avenues to office in the several districts to be voluntarily relinquished by them . We think , however , that experience has shown the necessity of a more consolidated government . Most of the disgraceful conflicts among the firemen of Philadelphia are chargeable upon a few rival fire companies in the districts , and not upon those of the city proper , though they have sometimes chosen the city as their battle ground . They generally come into collision in some quarter where the police force is not strong enough to overpower them , or if in danger of being apprehended in one section they take refuge in another . A disturber of the peace has only to run beyond a certain street to put himself out of the reach of his pursuers ; for though the constable or watchman beyond his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest an offender and detain him till the arrival of the proper officer , yet the process becomes in this way too inconvenient and complicated to be always attempted . Even the canine race seem to be aware of this distinction ; and the hunted victim of city " dog laws " will make his way , as if by instinct , to some district in which his rights are more // respected ; though his escape brings down a fearful retaliation upon the head of the first luckless mastiff that enters the city limits . The recent riots , as we have said , began in Kensington , though they afterwards extended to the city proper . Concerning their origin , there can be but one opinion , especially since the grand jury , to whom the whole matter was referred , have made their presentment after an elab*trate and impartial investigation . We have taken much pains to collect those Philadelphia newspapers which are the organs of all parties and of none ; we have carefully compared the statements made on all sides , both during the exciting scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection ; we have availed ourselves of the testimony of eye witnesses of the doings of the mob , and are prepared , we trust , to make a candid and accurate statement of the whole case . The boldness and the degree of success with which Bishop Hughes and his coadjutors urged the expulsion of the Bible from the public schools in New York , encouraged the Roman Catholics of Philadelphia to make a similar attempt in that city . This led at first to a concession on the l ) art of the Controllers of the Schools , to the effect that Roman Catholic children should not be required to be present during the reading of the Scriptures , or should be allowed to read the version of their own church . But this arrangement did not put the question at rest . It was still agitated in various public assemblies , and , as in New York , was carried to the polls . A Native American ' party was organized , which , though in its infancy , carried several wards of the city and county in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eject the Bible from the public schools , proved abortive even in Kensington , where the Roman Catholics exhibited their greatest strength . Their bishop perceiving that the agitation of the subject was premature , attempted to allay popular excitement by publishing the following card : To the Controllers of the Public Schools for the City and County of Philadelphia : GENTLEMEN - In the month of November , 1842 , I had the honor to address you in regard to Catholics frequenting the public schools , whose consciences were aggrieved by being compelled to read the Protestant version of the Bible , and to join in religious exercises . Your board was pleased to adopt some resolutions directed to remedy their grievances , for which the Catholic community , as well as myself ; feel justly grateful . I have , however , been assured that these resolutions have not been put in execution by several of the teachers , who have continued to require the reading of the Protestant version by Catholic children , who have otherwise interfered with their religious convictions . I venture then to respectfully request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resolutions be respected hy the teachers and directors to alt the schools ; at the same time I think proper to state , that I do not object to the use of the Bible , provided Catholic children be allowed to use their own version . I have thought this statement necessary at the present crisis , to remove all misconception . The Catholic community , whose sentiments I express , desire only that the conscientious convictions of the children and their parents be respected . Confiding in the justice of your board , I have the honor to be , Gentlemen , your obedient servant FRANCIS PATRICK , Bishop of Philadelphia . Philadelphia , March 12 , 1844 . The discussion of the school question , ' however , as it is familiarly termed , was every where leading to the discussion of the more absorbing question respecting the naturalization of foreigners . The wonderful success of the Native American party in New York , which came like a thunderbolt on the political world , inspired the infant party in Philadelphia with fresh confidence in their cause . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the 15th of April , to rejoice over the result of the New York city election . The writer happened to be there at the time , and found the new party fast growing in popular // 474 The Philadelphia Riots . favor . Frequent meetings were held during the month of April in various parts of the city and districts , for the purpose of unfolding the principles and increasing the strength of this party . At length it was resolved to hold such a meeting in Kensington . The third ward of this district is a strong quarter of the Irish c*tliolic population , though they do not constitute hy any means a majority of the whole district . Kensington has long been infamous as the scene or the source of those outrages which have disgraced the county of Philadelphia . The assembling of the Native American party in such a district , has been condemned by some as a measure designed to exasperate the Irish . But there is no proof of such a design . Although the Irish are numerous in the vicinity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole occupants of the district nor a majority of its inhabitants . And what if they were ? Is any thing more common than for a political party to hold its meetings in the very heart of a district known to be opposed to it ? And is not such a fact one of the finest exernplifications of the spirit of our institutions ? Why should the Native American party avoid a district inhabited by Irishmen as if it was infected with the plague ? Do Irishmen confine their repeal meetings , which are suspected by many of having some sinister political design , and which are far from commending themselves even to many who most earnestly desire the independence of Ireland ,  --  are they particular to confine these meetings to such districts or neighborhoods as are known to sanction them ? It is true that a meeting convened for a lawful object may be convened at such a time and in such circumstances as to lead to a breach of the peace , and thus become itself an unlawful assembly . Judge Parsons in his charge to the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting in front of a Catholic church when the congregation were assembled for worship according to their belief , and indulge in a denunciation of Catholicism , they would be guilty of a riot , although the discussion at another time and place would be innocent . The occasion they embrace under such circumstances , interferes with the rights of others , and their acts are calculated to lead to a breach of the peace . ' * We admit that such a step might be a mere provocation , and therefore unjustifiable . Yet the principle involved in the illustration would have made Paul a rioter at Athens , Lystra and Philippi . But the Native American party , in the case before us , offered no such gratuitous insult to the Irish Catholics . They assembled neither in front of their churches nor of their dwellings , but upon a vacant lot adjoining one of the public schools ; they assembled peacefully , for the purpose of expounding their principles and of encouraging each other to sustain them . They were exercising one of the most common rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to native born citizens ,  --  a right which they could not have supposed would be seriously questioned , and which , if questioned , they were hound to maintain . Yet in the exercise of this simple right they were molested , and even violently assailed . We can not find terms too strong to denounce such an outrage . The grand jury felt justly that it demanded severe animadversion from them . They say in view of it " The disturbance of public meetings for political , moral or social purposes , as well as those of a religious character , can not be too severely condemned . The right of all mankind to worship God according in the dictates of their own consciences , and that of peaceably assembling for the expression of their opinions upon public affairs , is of the highest importance and should be fully proiccied . It is a fact worthy of particular notice , that the most destructive riots at various periods for // some years past , have originated in an unjust and grossly unreasonable disposition to suppress these rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our liberties . " But let us look at particulars . The meeting referred to was held according to notice on a vacant lot at the corner of Second and Master sts. , on the afternoon of Friday , May 3 , 1844 . This meeting , as far as we can ascertain , was conducted with as much order and decorum as is usual in political meetings held in the open air . But it was soon interrupted by an assault from a large concourse of Irish men and women , rushing simultaneously toward the platform , which they speedily demolished , compel. ling the officers of the meeting , and in fact the whole body of native Americans , who were comparatively few , to flee under a shower of missiles , accompanied with shouts , oaths , hisses and groans . It is asserted that the assault was preconcerted by the Irish , and that they had openly threatened it This is altogether probable , but we have no means of ascertaining that such was the fact . That the assault was made by the Irish , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of the Native American party in their neighborhood , is admitted by the Roman Catholics themselves . One of their leading organs makes the following state-ment : " The third ward , Kensington , where the disturbances commenced , is a strong Irish quarter of the city . Knowing this , the Natives ' called a meeting there on Friday , the 3d inst . As might be expected , and as the originators of ' the meeting no doubt desired , there was a great excitereent among the Irish population , and before the close of the proceeding , there was a trifling col ! ision , and it was said the platform was broken . " This outrage upon a peaceable assembly of American citizens of course produced much excitement , not only among the Native American party , but among all native Americans throughout the city and County . The excitement was increased , as is usual at such times , by the inflammatory tone of the newspapers , which , in commenting on the occurrence , expatiated largely upon the peculiar grossness of the outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens . Accordingly , on the Monday following , i. e. , the 6th of May , the Native American party assembled in the same place in great numbers , for the avowed purpose of testing their right to meet even in the midst of the Irish without molestation . A principle was now at stake , which they could not sacrifice without a struggle . There is no evidence that they carried weapons with them to the place of concourse ; they were without arms when they needed them . The meeting was organized , as before , upon an open lot adjoining the public school-house . The American flag was raised over the platform , and welcomed by three hearty cheers . The proceedings of the former meeting were read , and two or three addi-esses delivered , without interruption . A sudden shower then dispersed the multitude , most of whom took refuge in the market-house in an adjoining street . Here the meeting was re-organized ; but scarcely had a speaker taken the stand , when a commotion occurred , from some unknown cause , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few individuals , who were probably disconnected with the party . In this melee , clubs and stones were used , and a pistol was fired , at the report of which , the majority of the assembly dispersed precipitately. * * The position of this market-house is represented in the plan . It is said that the disturbance in the market-house originated between a Protestant Irishman and a Catholic ; and that the Protestant Irish , or Orangemen , were active participators in the riots . This is altogether probable , as there have heretofore been violent collisions between the Protestant and Catholic irishmen of Philadelphia . // But the Irish from the neighboring houses now rushed out to join in the fray . Many of them had firearms , which they discharged upon the assembly , wounding several of the Native Americans , some of them mortally , and driving the whole party from the ground . The fugitives soon rallied , however , around the remnants of their flag , which the Irish had torn in shreds , and after a severe contest of an hour 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , many of which they assailed with stones and other missiles , demolishing the doors , windows and furniture . At this juncture ( about 7 P. M. ) the sheriff appeared on the ground , and order was in some degree restored . Later in the evening the rioting was renewed , by an attempt to destroy a Roman Catholic seminary in the vicinity , but the crowd was dispersed by a volley of musketry from the Irish . Phe well-loaded guns made fearful havoc ; among others , an unoffending by-stander was instantly killed . The utmost confusion prevailed in the district through the night , though all demonstrations of violence ceased at 152 o'clock . During the night , and early the next day , several of the most conspicuous rioters , especially those irishmen who were seen with fire-arms , were arrested and put under heavy bonds , or committed in default of The editor of the Daity Sun , having been accused of stirring up the passions of the mob on this occasion , has published the following vindication : " As great stress has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editor of this paper at the meeting in Kensington , we have concluded , at the earnest entreaty of many of our friends , to publish it entire ; and we feel assured that no individual can read it without acknowledging its truth . Our speech was as follows : Fellow citizens ,  --  We have reached an important crisis ! ' We had proceeded thus far , and no farther , when the firing commenced " The sheriff had been requested to be present at this meeting witb a force sufficient to protect it , and had refused . bail . A reward of $1000 was offered by the Native Americans for the detection of the murderers . On the next day , Tuesday , at 3 P. M. , an immense meeting of Native Americans was held in Independence Square , in the city proper , a mile and a half from the scene of the outrages . Though the convoking of so large an assembly in the state of excitement which then pervaded the city and county may have been imprudent , the object of the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right of American citizens to assemble for the peaceable discussion of their common interests , condemning the recent outrageous interference with such a lawful assembly , and yet deprecating in the strongest terms any attempt to retaliate upon the aggressors . Addresses were made of a peaceable character , exhorting the assembly to forbearance and to a due respect for the laws ; but the bare thought of the events of the preceding day , and especially the attempt of one of the speakers to picture their horrors , stimulated the passions of the multitude beyond the control of ' reason . Accordingly , at the close of the meeting , a large proportion of those assembled , instead of dispersing quietly to their homes , resolved , in spite of the remonstrances of several prominent members of the party , to go in procession to Kensington . They marched through the streets bearing aloft the tattered flag , and , by the side of it , a banner , with the inscription , in black letters , I'nis is THE FLAG WHIcH WAS TItAMPLED UNDER FOOT BY THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American citizens more than the sight of their dishonored flag . A few who were in the procession , anticipating a renewal of the conflicts of the preceding day , had provided themselves with pistols and other weapons ; but the majority // were unarmed . On reaching the battle-ground , ( for such it may well be termed , ) an attempt was made to organize a meeting ; but before this could be done , a shot was fired from a house opposite the market , and a young man in the assembly was instantly killed . This served as a signal for continued volleys from most of the surrounding buildings ; for the Irish , having laid in stores of ammunition , were resolved to fight under cover of brick walls , without venturing again into the open street . This wholesale murder of their companions , without the least provocation , raised the excitement of the Native Americans to the highest pitch . They were exposed to the cowardly , assassin-like fire of the Irish , with no means of defense . Several hastened from the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty or fifty presented themselves in front of the market , thus armed . They fought with desperation for nearly an hour , till their ranks were thinned , by the maiming or death of several of their number . But how unequal was the contest ! The Irish were firing upon a compact company fully exposed in the street below them ; the Americans were firing at individuals who were skulking behind chimneys and window-frames , or shooting through loop-holes in the walls of their houses . At length the Native Americans succeeded in setting fire to one of the buildings from which shot had poured forth upon them . The flames spread with great rapidity . In a short time between twenty and thirty dwellings were on fire , together with the market-house , which took fire by accident . The design was to burn those houses only from which guns had been fired by the Irish ; but probably the innocent suffered with the guilty in the conflagration . Between 8 and 9 o'clock , a detachment of military arrived upon the ground , under the command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision during these trying sccnes . Field-pieces , loaded with grape and canister , were planted so as to sweep two of the most turbulent streets , and the mob were at once intimidated . The General , however , had not yet been ordered by the sheriff to use the dernier resort . Under the protection of the military , the firemen , who had hitherto been restrained by the mob , succeeded in extinguishing the flames ; but it was not till midnight that the flue was wholly subdued , and the mob dispersed . The Roman Catholic churches , and the dwellings of the Catholic Irish in the vicinity , were guarded by the military during the night , and no further disturbance occurred . Thus ended the second scene in this bloody drama . Probably some of the Irish were consumed in their dwellings ; others were shot down in attempting to escape . Families were driven from their flaming houses , they knew not whither , exposed to the insults of a mob , whose fury bad already made them mourners for a husband , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans felt that they had done enough . Revenge herself stood appalled and sickened at her own dreadful work . Here the doings of the Native Americans as a party ended . They utterly disclaim any participation in the events that followed . They had resisted outrage at the expense of life , and made themselves possessors of the ground from which the Irish had thrice attempted lo drive them . But the spirit of the mob had been let loose , and its thirst for destruction was not yet appeased . Accordingly quite early on the following day a gang of lawless desperadoes , ( such as are found in every community , ) ripe for tumult and plunder , renewed the attacks of the preceding evening . They searched the houses of the Irish ; and wherever arms were found secreted , as was frequently the case , they either // demolished the building or set it on fire . The Irish offered little resist . ance ; completely overawed , they fled in terror to save themselves and families . Signals were hung out from many houses indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American party . The church of St. Michael with the priest 's residence adjoining it , and the Seminary called the nunnery , which had been attacked on Monday evefling , both in the vicinity of the first outbreak , were fired in open day , and entirely consumed . A detachrnent ofmilitia were upon the ground , but either were not sufficiently alert to arrest the movements of the mob , or had no power to restrain them . Not having yet received orders to fire upon the rioters , they felt their own weakness , and were exposed to the contempt of a few worthless men and boys by whom all this mischief was perpetrated under their eyes . One while the mob cheered them , perhaps in derision ; again , as some of the soldiers testify , they threw dung into their faces and challenged them to fire ; in one instance they boldly faced them in the street and opposed their progress . Late in the afternoon of this day the mob began to move towards the city proper . Anticipating this the Mayor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare themselves to patrol the streets , to resist all invasions of property , and to preserve the public peace . " It was soon apparent that the fury of the mob would be first directed against St. Augustine 's church , situated in Fourth below Vine street , just within the city limits. * This building was particularly exposed to an assault . It stood upon Fourth street directly opposite one of the smaller streets ( New-st. ) which intersects it at right angles . There was a large space , therefore , Its locality is marked by a cross in the plan . for a mob to occupy in front of the building ; on the northern side of it was a grave yard ; in the rear was another small street , ( Crown , running parallel with Fourth , ) facing which were the priest 's house and the schoolhouse connected with the *. hurch . The building was , therefore , exposed on three sides , and required a very large force to protect it . The Mayor made several ineffectual attempts to disperse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bayonets and ball cartridges . He was himself injured by a stone thrown by some one in the crowd ; and the police officers were driven from their station . I'wo or three boys were then lifted over the railing in front of the church , who broke the windows , applied a match to the drape . ry , cut open the gas pipes , and in a moment the building was in flames . The firemen were prevented from making any effort to extinguish it , and it was consumed to the bare walls. * We have been assured by an eye witness , and have seen the same statement repeatedly made , that fifty resolute men could have prevented this outrage and dispersed the mob . The great majority of those assembled were drawn together by mere curiosity ; only a small proportion participated in the riot . The other Catholic churches were guarded through the night . Every one now felt that a crisis had come demanding the most energetic efforts for the suppression of the spirit of disorder . Accordingly on the following morning , ThursThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St Augustine 's was the same which was formerly in the statehouse steeple , and which announced the Dectaration of Independence is untrue . Thai bell is still preserved in the steeple of the statehouse , and rin*out its merry peals every 4th of July . It has upon it in raised letters the following words from Lev . *xv 10- " Proclaim liberty thiottahout all the land , to all the inhabitants thereof . ' 478 July , // 479 day , an immense number of citizens both of the city and county assembled in Independence Square to devise measures for the restoration of the public peace . They recommended a general organization of the citizens as a patrol , and resolved to sustain the constituted authorities in the most vigorous measures to restore order . Then , and not till then , did the Sheriff and Mayor , after a dallying correspondence with the Attorney General respecting their right to employ force of arms , issue the following procla-ination " PROCLAMATION - The Sheriff and Mayor under the authority of the laws , and the recommendations of ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town meeting assembled , DECLARE and PROCLAIM , that all persons whomsoever , are forhidden to be or appear in any streets or places in the city or county , which are or may be in the occupation of the city authorities , or of the militia , for the preservation of the lives and property of the citizens . And the officers of the militia are hereby authorized to declare what streets and places are are thus occupied , and to empli ) y such FORCE OF ARMS as may he necessary to compel obedience to this order . Fire engines and hose carriages are required not to enter such streets or places , without the permission of the civil or military authorities . MORTON McMICIJAEL , Sheriff , J. M. SCOTT , Mayor of Philadelphia . May 9th. 1*44 . ' This proclamation had the desired effect . A mob , assembled in front of the principal Cathedral in the city , was instantly dispersed by the announcement of Gen. Cadwallader that he would comply with the letter of the proclamation . On the afternoon of the same day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander in chief , attended by severaL military companies from different parts of the State . The Gi. rard bank was made the head quarters of the military , the city put under martial law , and all persons not employed in the preservation of order , required to be in their houses by 9 o'clock , P. M. Twenty thou Vol . II . 61 sand dollars were put at the disposal of the committee of police , and one thousand dollars offered for the apprehension of the incendiaries who had set fire to the church . Several arrests were made of persons concerned in the riots . A renewal of violence was apprehended on the Sabbath , but the Romish Bishop suspended public worship in all the churches under his care , notwithstanding the assurance of Major General Patterson , that he had sufficient force at command to protect all religious denominations in their rights . Order was soon restored throughout the county . In a few days the Native American party held a meeting in Kensington without molestation . We have now presented an outline of the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible for us to attain to , and with as much candor as we can exercise . We submit a few reflections upon this narrative . We have seen that the Irish Catholics were the aggressors . Defeated in their scheme for excluding the Bible from the public schools , ( whether justly or not we do not here say , ) and alarmed by the organization and success of a party opposed to the early naturalization of foreigners , they resolved to accomplish by brute force as Irishmen and as Roman Catholics , that which they could not accomplish peacefully as American citizens . They assaulted their fellow citizens while in the peaceful exercise of one of their most important rights ; they assailed them on a second and a third occaston with murderous weapons , without the least provocation . They and they alone are responsible for the beginning of these outrages . And they exhibited in a most fatal light that spirit of intolerance which has ever characterized their religion , and the cherishing of which is enjoined as a sacred duty upon all who profess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these painful scenes , let us not forget for a moment to whom the origin of them is to be ascribed . The Grand Jury charge it directly upon the Catholics . " The jury have been instructed by the court to inquire into the origin and cause which led to the recent gross violation of law , and to present the first and last aggressors , if possible . Upon this branch of inquiry , and from all the facts which came under their notice , they have come to the h ) llOwin* conclusions " First. - That the origin of these riots may be attributed to the very imperfect manner in which the laws have been executed by the constituted authorities of the city and county of Philadelphia for several years past , and more especially in the district of Kensington , crime having met with little rebuke and scarcely a. y punishment . Emboldened by this impunity the abandoned and vicious have been encouraged to hold the law in contempt . Second-To the efforts of a portion of the community to exclude the Bible from our public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some measure gave rise to the formation of a new party , which called and held public meetiugs in the district of Kensington , in the peaceful exercise of the sacred rights ileges guarautied to every a and privcitizen by the constitution and laws of our State and country . These meetings were rudely disturbed and fired upon by a band of lawless irresponsible men , some of whom had resided in our country only for a short period . This outrage , causing the death of a number of our unoffending citizens , led to imniediate retaliation , and was followed up by subsequent acts of aggression in violation and open defiance of all law . ' It can not have escaped the notice of the reader that the Sheriff of the county was grossly remiss in his duty . We have seen that when he was requested to protect a lawful assembly which had been threatened with violence , he refused . This neglect of duty is formally laid to to his charge by responsible men . We have seen , also , that he did not appear upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he did not even then use any prompt and vigorous measures to suppress t . We have seen still further , that he took no pains to acquaint himself with his duty , but remained in willful ignorance of it , tilL an indignant community demanded that his authority should be exerted to the utmost for the restoration of peace , and compelled him to adopt a course which was at once effectual , and which , if adopted at the first , would have saved a vast amount of blood and treasure . We would not hastily credit rumors prejudicial to the character of a public officer , but there is reason to believe that the Sheriff sympathized too deeply with one of the parties to act independently . His name , Morton McMichael , bespeaks an Irish origin , though we believe that he was born in this country . His family are said to be Protestants , but he is said to hold a pexv in a Roman Catholic church . His conduct demands the most careful scrutiny . We would not affirm that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of that step , if called for , would be highly salutary . The necessity of impeachment is distinctly avowed by the Grand Jury . " The jury were also instructed to enquire whether the officers in the city and county , entrusted with the execution of the law , have faithfully performed their duties during the recent riots . In pursuance of the duty thus devolved , mucla testimony has been taken , and upon an attentive consideration of the evidence introduced before them , the jury are compelled to the conclusion , that if the police magistrates of the district of Kensington , and the Sheriff of the city and county of* Philadelphia , had been more ener*etic and efficient , many lives might have been spared and much valuable property saved from destruction . It aiay be that these officers will be able hereafter to show that they have done all that it was possible for them under the circumstances , to perform ; butjudgin* as the jury necessarily must , from the ex-parte proof before them , they are of opinion that the conduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investiaation by the appropriate tribunals of the country . ' Such were the proximate causes of these alarming and protracted scenes of violence . But there were other causes , which though more remote , were hardly less efficient in // producing the result . Some of them deserve a passing notice . We have already seen that the manner in which Philadelphia is districted , affords great facilities for those who are disposed to trample on the laws to do so with impunity . But this is not a sufficient explanation of the frequency with which the spirit of the mob there develops itself . The population of Philadelphia is heterogeneous . So indeed is that of Ncw York . But New York was originally settled by a homogeneous populatiori , and the heterogeneous elements which are now brought together there , are consolidated under one efficient government . Philadelphia , and in fact the state of Pennsylvania , though planted by a particular religious sect , was early occupied by mixed and incongruous races , who were subjected to no centralizing , harmonizing influences . To this day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are recognized as such by the legislature of the state in the appropriations which are made by that body to publish its transactions in the German as *ve1l as the English language . The state has never been Americanized . In Philadelphia too , the northern and southern elements of our national system are brought into contact ; and as is apt to be the case , the high toned moral sentiment of the north there yields to the laxer discipline of the south , and degenerates into a like casuistry of lawlessncss . XVith such elements of discord it is not surprising that Philadelphia should be the very seat of anarchy . Moreover , the predominating influence in the early constitution of society there was not the influence of law . We all know that the Quakers are opposed to coercive measures in the administration of t*oveminent . They would rule men by moral suasion , and by the principles of honesty , love and peace inherent in human nature . But their scheme , however pleasing in theory , is not framed with reference to the known depravity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their principles has weakened the arm of law and given license to iniquity . They are now aiming as a body to lessen the restraints upon human passions by the abolition of capital punishment ; and would probably be more horror-stricken at the thought of a murderer 's suffering the just penalty of his crime , than at the sight of their fellow citizens butchered in the streets in open day . The impunity with which rioters have hitherto escaped in Philadelphia , undoubtedly emboldened many to perpetrate the recent ourages . For some cause , perhaps for several causes , justice has been very imperfectly administered in Philadelphia for many years past . Whether the evil is to be ascribed to the proverbial ingenuity of Philadelphia lawyers , to the imperfection of the laws themselves , to the low state of public sentiment in regard to law , or to the inefficiency and faithlessness of the officers of law ,  --  whether it is owing to any combination of these causes , we do not take it upon us to determine . But there is a lamentable defect somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his deserts . The grand jury allude to this corrupted state of things in the following words : " In the course of their investigations , the jury have noticed the names of many persons connected with the late riots , who had been implicated in similar scones in the days ofa laic sheriff ; and it is a question difficult to answer on satisfactory grounds , how these men have contrived so long in sei at defiance ocr courts of justice , xv hose strong arm should he safUy relied on promptly in rehuke and plush crimes which have disgraced us as a civilized community . " A prominent reason why crime has such impunity in Philadelphia , is the facility with which convicted criminals obtain pardon from the Governor of the state . Never has the pardoning power , which is vested // in the executive to meet extreme cases in the administration of justice , been so grossly abused as in Pennsylvania for the last few years . Old offenders , criminals sentenced to the penitentiary for a long term of years or for life , thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let loose upon the community , and may be seen at the poils at every election , guarding the interest of that distincruished friend of the " largest liberty , " David R. Porter . Never has the gubernatorial chair been more deeply disgraced in any state , than in Pennsylvania under his administration . We know not whether he has ever read the scriptures ; but we should think that he made the unjust steward his model , and that in the bestowment of favor upon the inmates of the penitentiary , he has been bespeaking favor for himself whenever he should receive his dues . In some instances his pardon of a criminal has even anticipated the sentence of the court . It may be that his " Excellency " is one of those bigh.minded philanthropists who regard all legal penalties as an insult to human nature ; hut it is sometimes true that " a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind . " To call upon Governor Porter to quell a riot in which the ringleaders were perhaps the very men whom he had let loose from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after their conviction , appears to us some- , what farcical . We rejoice , and we presume that the friends of order and good government every where will rejoice , that the constitutional limit of his administration is just at hand . Will not the people of Pennsylvania be careful hereafter to select rulers who have at least some slight pretensions to respectability and moral principle ? But after all , the radical defect in the administration of law in Philadelphia is in the people themselves . Had not public sentiment sanctioned deeds of violence in that communi ty again and again , they would not have become so frequent . Public officers are seldom found in advance of public opinion . But if there was a strong public sentiment against every species of outrage , no officer would flinch from his duty . The burning of Pennsylvania HaIl might have been prevented by fifty resolute men ; but while thousands stood ready to applaud the deed , the police officers did not venture to interfere . Even for some time after that event , no editor could comment upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury of the mob . The public sentiment of Philadelphia sanctioned the burning of an edifice consecrated to the cause of human freedom . Behold the just retribution ! The mob once let loose suffers no restraint . The torch which fired an odious abolition ball , may fire a church or a private dwelling . What a lesson has been taught the people of Philadelphia on the folly and guilt of conniving at crime ! Let them learn that their only security against the repetition of such appalling scenes , is in pre . serving the sanctity of the law . We may talk of suppressing a riot by the force of arms , ( and doubtless the recent riots micrht have been quelled by an early demonstration of military power ; ) - we may commend the decision of Napoleon in pouring grape shot into the heart of a mob , and imagine that the like decision would repress the most turbulent of our own populace ; but we must not forget that our soldiers are not the hirelings of a military despot ,  --  that they have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on men as " food for powder . " They are our fellow citizens , sympathizing with us in every great popular movement ; - they can not easily be induced to fire upon a mixed assembly at the risk of shooting down their own friends and neighbors . Our reliance for the support of law , must be up . // 483 on the strength of law in the hearts of the people . They must be taught to love the law  --  to reverence it as the bulwark of freedom  --  to stand in dread of anarchy as their most deadly foe . This , and this only , can make ours a strong government . And this has made it strong . Even the bloody events of the three days ' in Philadelphia have proved its strength . For when anarchy has triumphed over the law and its ministers , and is rioting in the ruin it has made , the people rising in their own sovereignty , and frowning on the foul usurper , drive him from the midst of them , and set the law agaia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength of law ; and the strength of law is not in standing armies , but in the hearts of the people . Our limits will not suffer us to enter at length upon the principles and policy of the Native American party , the organization and movements of which were an occasional cause of the Philadelphia riots . That the flagrant abuses in the municipal go . vernment of New York , warranted the strong rebuke which was given to both of the great political parties at the late election , we fully believe . The votes of Roman Catholics will not soon be courted again by the promise of political power . But , while we rejoice in the temporary benefits of the new organization , we are not prepared to appi-ove of it as a permanent political party . Its tendency will be to organize in one compact and hostile body , the emigrants who are yearly thronging to our shores , nnd'who might otherwise he swallowed up in the mass of our native population , and become identified with them in interests and pursuits . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refugees from civil and ecclesiastical oppression in the old world , forever strangers to the spirit of our institutions . An Irishman can not even blunder himself into a natiz*e American ; and if shut out from fellowship with our native-born citizens , he will never become an American at all . Romanism will become a political organization in the midst of us , and the Jesuit will appear as the advocate of equal rights . The true method of dealing with Roman Catholic Irishmen , ( for it is against this class particularly that the Native American party is organized , ) is little understood in our country . It deserves to be studied attentively by every patriot and Christian . The subject was discussed so much at len6th in our last number , that we simply refer to it hcre to say , that the only hope of success in our attempts to make theta American and Protestant in their feelings , is in treating them kindly . They are dependent upon Protestants in this country for employment . Let them see that Protestants have human hearts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church establishment which robbed them and ground them to the dust in the old world . Give them time to become enlightened . Give them time to understand our institutions . Let them breathe the air of freedom and of love , and their hearts will swell and burst the chains of spiritual despotism . Their children , if not themselves , will be thorough Americans ; they can not be long the staunch adherents of Romanism on our soilunless ice make them such . One of the fundamental principles of the Native American party , that this is a Protestant country , is altogether wrong . This is a Christian country , for our national government recomizes , in various ways , the institutions of Christianity , and our laws are based upon its principles . But it is not a Protestant country . Though the great majority of ita inhabitants are Protestants , Protestantisni is not recognized in any form as the established religion of the land . // In making these remarks , we would not be understood to object to any wholesome changes which may be proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the events which we have contemplated are a warning to Roman Catholics . Led by their Priests and Bishops , they have attempted to make the civil government subservient to their hierarchy , to carry their schemes by stratagem at the polls , and when defeated there , to gain their ends by force . They have aroused the indignation of the American people . They have kindled a fire which , if they fan it again , may utterly consume them . All the proclamations and manifestoes of their Bishops to allay excitement can not save them . These only exhibit more strikingly the danger of suffering them to g in the ascendancy . For , if the word of a Bishop can stay the fury of a mob , the same word can arouse it . The Roman Catholic system is now seen to be utterly repugnant to our civil institutions . Let it not , then , obtrude itself upon public notice . In modest and quiet retirement , let it conform itself , if it can , to the genius of a free country . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let Pope and Prelate remember the three days in Philadelphia , and beware !
