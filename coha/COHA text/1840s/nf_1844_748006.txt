txt What is labor ? It is any man 's or woman 's efforts to live and prosper , whether of body or of mind , or of both ; whether in agriculture , or commerce , or manufactures , or mechanics , or in either of the numerous branches of these great and comprehensive pursuits ; whether in the useful or fine arts , in digging ditches or digging out the sciences ; whether in a professional career , or in making books ; in teaching , or in study ; in legislation , or in government ; in making pins , or casting cannon ; in the use of hands or of feet , of fingers or of toes , of muscles or of brains ; in search of knowledge , or in its application ; in inventions , or their uses ; in making canals , or building ships ; erecting railroads , or constructing locomotives ; in burning lime or brick , in quarrying or in masonry ; in wielding a sledge-hammer , or making watches ; in grinding knives , or selling brick-dus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whales ; in any one of the thousand occupations , of the city or the country , on the land or on the sea ; and so on , and so on , to the end of that infinite diversity of human pursuits , by which men and women toil for a livelihood , and to get on in the world . In a free country each one chooses his own vocation , and it is not easy to say , whether mind work or muscular effort is hardest . 2 . What is capital ? Money is usually called capital . But it is not exclusively so , unless it is intended to comprehend everything that will fetch money ; or everything that is worth money . In this sense labor is capital . Labor , certainly , is the foundation and cause of wealth . All the world would be poor , and come to nothing without it . Whatever any man has , which others want , and which , being wanted , will fetch money , whether it be a capacity for labor , or any species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , to know how rich he is , or how much capital be has , he has only to inquire what he can do and what he has that will fetch money . 3 . The capital of labor . He who is able to work , and who can find employment with fair pay , is rich to begin with , and may become rich in the usual sense of the term . A power to labor , where labor is in demand , is the best , most independent , and most productive of all capital . Money at interest , or in stocks , usually produces , in this country , an income averaging perhaps six per cent . Some get more , some less , and some none at all . They are liable to go backward , and lose principal itself . But labor , with economy , can hardly ever be worth less than fifty per cent . That is , a laborer can live satisfactorily , and lay up , as vested capital , half of his wages . In some kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be more than that . Economy and skill in the management of his earnings , may also be made productive of wealth , in addition to the profits of his labor . Some laborers , by a careful use of past earnings , soon get to realize a hundred per cent , on their capital , including labor ; and then they are growing rich , wealthy . Industrious labor of any kind , in a country like ours , with economy , and being applied where labor is in demand for wages , is a sure foundation of wealth . Man does not have to labor to acquire the power . It is a capital with which he is endowed by creation , an independent faculty , and more productive than any other . 4 . Skill in labor , and in the management of its avails , is capital . Man has not only bones , sinews , muscles , and other powers of bodily labor , but he has mind to direct it , to improve in it , to make it more available , to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve even its uses . Labor turns bodily power to account , and skill multiplies the profits of labor , so that when a man gets a-going in the world , he goes fast . Riches flow in , and wealth accumulates . A man 's power of labor is limited ; but his skill is unlimited . Skill is often a thousand times more productive than what is commonly called labor . But , it is to be remembered , that , skill itself is the fruit of the labor of mind , or is the employment of mind , as muscular effort is labor of the body . But skill is capital . It is equally applicable to agriculture , as to manufactures ; to the mechanic , or the useful , or fine arts . It is applicable to trade and commerce , to every pursuit and occupation of life . 5 . Enterprise is capital . It might seem quite unnecessary to say , in view of what enterprise has accomplished in and for this country , from the beginning of our history , that enterprise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth from the long repose of a continent , and erected thereupon a vast national estate . No other species of capital has contributed so largely to this stupendous result . As the collective power of national enterprise is composed of individual enterprise , we find accordingly the same character in isolated conditions , chequering the whole surface of society with great achievements effected by single persons . There was capital enough in the soul of Washington , to humble the greatest nation , and to make another , with /z/ means that would have been laughed to scorn as a subject of prophecy . In all our history , and in the various walks of life , are to be found like miracles of enterprise , originating in the profound and inexhaustible wealth , and carried forward to consummation , by the invisible power of man 's moral attributes . 6 . Moneyed capital . Money is most coveted , because it is most convenient ; and its convenience arises from the fact , that it will procure , in exchange , everything which a man wants , or desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the least worthy of respect or affection , as compared with labor , and skill in the application of labor and its avails . When money is put to use , it is said to be active ; but it has no natural , inherent productive power . Hoarded money , while in that state , is no better than rusty old iron in a farmer 's garret . And when put to use , the income is not the natural product of a natural agent , or natural effect of a natural cause , but a mere commercial result , which is limited and small as compared with the products and avails of labor , and that little is contingent on good management and good security . The principal itself is subject to the same contingency . Nevertheless , moneyed capital may be an important instrument in the hands of the owner , and is usually an effective power , within certain limits . It will always supply wants , and gratify desires , so long as it lasts . But as productive capital , put to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase of itself , it bears no proportion to the productive power of human labor and skill . The fact , that they who employ money , can afford to pay interest for it , and often double , sometimes quadruple the principal sum annually , by the use of it , is proof of this point . 7 . Vested capital . By vested capital is commonly understood money put to use for what is called interest or income . The most common forms of vested capital , are bonds , mortgages , negotiable notes , silent partnerships in business firms , stocks in banks , insurances offices , turnpike and railroads , canals , fishing companies , great commercial enterprises , steamboats and steamships , navigation companies , manufactories , state and government securities , and any undertaking that is beyond the ordinary means of individuals , and which requires the combined and aggregate capital of numerous persons having money to put to use . The capital of corporate companies or bodies , formed for these objects , is usually divided into small shares , which , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thence called stocks . 8 . Corporations . The object of corporations is to combine the surplus or spare capital of numerous individuals , for enterprises which are usually beyond the reach of single persons . Properly organized by the statute of incorporation , by a division of the capital into small shares , and securing to men of small means equal chances , they are well adapted to a democratic 6tate of society , by bringing down the powers of government , distributing them among the people , and vesting them in the hands of all persons who can raise twenty , or fifty , or a hundred dollars , according to the price of shares . Few and large corporations , monopolizing power in their own specific spheres , are objects of popular jealousy , and justly so . But the multiplication of them , with moderate capital and powers , divided into small shares , spreads them out over the surface of society , and whatever powers they have , be it more or less , is so much resigned by the government , and vested immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disposed to be owners of stock . It is a wider and more democratic distribution of power . The responsibility of the managers , is to the stockholders for the use of the capital , and to the government , and through the government , to the great body of the people , for the use of their powers . That is the best , most democratic , and most beneficent system of corporations , which enables and encourages laborers and men of small means , widows and orphans , and the more dependent and helpless portions of the community , to become interested in them , by the investment and application of their funds , which they themselves could not employ to advantage . For example - .  --  Two men , in partnership , were joint-owners of mills of great value in the state of Maine , and one of them died , leaving a widow and several children . The widow and children , of course , could not manage such a business ; but by an act of incorporation from the state , the widow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the joint-interest went on as before . It will be seen , that cases are constantly occurring in society , which require the aid of such privileges . All helpless persons , who have capital enough to support them , but who are unable to manage it , naturally resort to such helps provided by the state , in parental care , and by considerations of humanity , as well as for the general welfare . 9 . Laborers may be stockholders and corporators in corporate companies . The town of Lowell , in Massachusetts , which has risen from nothing in twenty years , to a population of more than twenty thousand , has between eleven and twelve millions of dollars /z/ vested in her manufactories , employs upwards of nine thousand laborers , male and female , pays for their work annually $1,800,000 , about fifty per cent , of which , on the average , or $900,000 , they can save , or lay by , after paying their board and necessary expenses . Their savings support a Savings bank in the place , where deposits are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid up a satisfactory sum , go home with means to settle down for life , while others vest their savings in the manufactories , and become stockholders and corporators  --  managers of their own stock , and presiding over themselves as laborers , gradually accumulating their interest in the .  --  e companies . In one manufactory alone , $100,000 of stock is owned by those who work in the factories for wages ; in another $GO , 000 ; and so on . Factory girls , and women who live by their needles , are often stockholders in these and other institutions . It will be observed , that in all these cases , the capital of labor creates the moneyed capital thus or otherwise vested , and that in the case of a laborer at Lowell , who receives in wages $200 a year  --  that is the average  --  and lays up one hundred dollars , the profits of labor are ten to one of the income of moneyed capital at five per cent . In other words , tiie profits of labor in these cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that being $200. 10 . The effect of corporations on the general welfare . 1 . Manufactories . In our tract on the Tariff , No . III. , we took occasion to adduce the case of theGlenham woollen factory of Fishkill , N. Y. , with a capital of $140,000 , which , as proved , actually employs other capital of the country , chiefly agricultural , but yet embracing a variety of other kinds , in all to the amount of $1,432,000 . From this aggregate of other capital , thus employed , it will easily be seen , what a great variety of other occupations find a profitable employment by this investment of $140,000 . Among the items specified , we notice 66,000 sheep , 22,000 acres of pasture land to feed them , 2,600 acres of farm land to supply the wants of the families belonging to the factory , and $8,000 annually used up in the small articles of teazles , firewood , coal , provender , &c.; All the laborers and their families belonging to this factory , are , of course , supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the owners of the 66,000 sheep , are also supported by it , to the extent of their investments thus employed . It will be seen that the individuals and families connected with the capital of $1,432,000 employed by this factory , are neither few in numbers , nor small in the aggregate of their various interests . All of them derive their support from this source , and it is satisfactory , else they would look to another quarter . Let us carry out the rule furnished by these facts , to another and more comprehensive stage . The entire capital vested in all the manufactories of the United States at this time , is estimated at $300,000,000 , ( three hundred millions of dollars ) . If we suppose that this aggregate , thus vested , employs an amount of other capital of the country , corresponding with the case of the factory at Fishkill , as above stated , then the whole amount of the other capital employed , and profitably employe ! , by the manufactories of the Union , would be $3,068,571,428 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doubtless an unexpected , it is even an astonishing result . It may be , that other manufactories , different in kind , do not employ an equal proportion of other capital ; there are doubtless some which do not ; but some , for au ? ht we know , may employ a greater proportion , enough even to swell the aggregate . The vastness of the amount , at the lowest possible estimate , is sufficient to show the importance of these corporations to the various occupations and interests of the country . There is no occupation , however humble , no man , however poor , that is not materially affected and essentially benefited by them . The wool growing interests of the country , which are chiefly connected with our manufactories , and sustained by them , are estimated at two hundred millions of dollars , and the fanners of the country receive annually from the manufactories , for all their various supplies , an aggregate of sixty six millions of dollars , which is nearly nine times as much as the avails of all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parts of the world . Massachusetts , a great manufacturing state , alone consumes annually more than forty millions of dollars of the products of other states , which is nearly a moiety of all our exports to foreign countries . 2 . Collateral evidence . The assessed value of property of all kinds in the state of Massachusetts , as reported by her legislature in 1841 , is three hundred millions of dollars . As it is known that official assessments of this kind are very much less than common estimates , often fifty per cent. , on an average , in Massachusetts probably twenty five per cent. , it may , perhaps , be fairly assumed that the aggregate value of the property of that commonwealth , is not less than /o ; w hundred millions of dollars , about one fourth of which , or one hundred millions , lies in Boston and its immediate vicinity . The capital vested in the manufactories of that state , is about fifty millioni of dollars . We have endeavored from the best sources of information to ascertain , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wealth of Massachusetts by the manufactories , and the result is , that it can hardly be less than one hundred millions of dollars . It has been stated as high as one hundred and- fifty millions . That the first of these statements is not too high , may be presumed from the fact , that the assessed value of all the /z/ property of the state of Maine , - with a little less than two thirds of the population of Massachusetts , but three times as much territory , is only seventy millions of dollars , resulting apparently from the fact that she has few manufactories. # Sir Robert Peel , in his speech at the agricultural meeting at Tamworth , England , in 1843 , said :  --  " Therefore , gentlemen , in this favored locality , we have no excuse for being behind-hand in the race of agricultural prosperity . Another advantage we possess is , that we live in Hie neighborhood of a great manufacturing district , and you all know of what importance Birmingham and the great iron district in its neighborhood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for yuur agricultural produce , and you have lmd ample experience that with the decay or increase of the prosperity of that district there are corresponding sympathies on the part of the agriculturists . Thus you have not only a country formed by nature , hut possessing the advantage of a great manufacturing district in its immediate neighborhood , and creating a market for its produce . " Every one will see , that this species of evidence is to the same effect , and of the same value , in all parts of the world . 3 . Canals , railroads , The construction of works of these kinds , disburses over the country the entire amount of their cost , be it more or less , giving employment to laborers , manufacturers , mechanics , artisans , and various classes , who do the work , supply materials , and aid in accomplishing the end . We have not the means for an exact statement of the cost of these works , already completed or begun in the country ; but the aggregate must be very large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of this has been realized by laborers of various classes employed to do the work and supply materials . And it is to be understood , that if all these works were good for nothing when done , the money which they cost has all passed into the hands of those who made them . But in most cases they answer their design , and contribute permanently to the employment and profits ef labor , and to the activity , facility , and profits of the business of the country , on an immense scale . They also enhance the value of the property of the country to a great extent . A gentleman owning a very large estate in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania , though not bordering on her public works , told us he would be glad to be taxed at any moment for his fair proportion of the whole amount of the state debt , and that such a tax would be but a fraction of the increase of the value of his property on account of these works . If this be true , as doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public debt , by the erection of these works , is yet richer on account of them . The only embarrassment is , how to liquidate the debt most satisfactorily to the people of the commonwealth . All the erections of this kind , whether made by states or by corporate companies , are greatly beneficial to the wide community , in the disbursement and realization of their costs , in the permanent use to which they are applied , in the increase of the general value of property , in the additional and profitable employment which they give to labor , and in promoting the facilities and activity of business . All classes , more especially the poorer classes , feel and reap the benefit . Individual capital could not accomplish these great works . It is only by states , or by the combined capital of numerous individuals , in the form of corporations , that such enterprises can be achieved . These remarks are equally applicable to all other enterprises on a large scale , which can only be accomplished by associated capital . They are beneficial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way , and by the operation of the same causes . 4 . Banks . For want of space , we are forced to refer to our Tract on the Currency , No . II. , or to presuppose an acquaintance with it , for a proper appreciation of the few remarks made here . It is a settled fact , that the business of this country can not be carried on without a paper medium , and the only question is , whether it shall be supplied by private and irresponsible persons , shop-keepers , and the like ; or by corporations created and regulated by the government , and responsible to it ? Experience has decided , that the evils of the former plan can not be endured , and bank corporations are the result of the necessity of the public . Their powers are specified , their modes of business regulated by law , and they are held accountable to the authorities which gave them being . They have a reasonable amount of the confidence of the public , and the reasons why that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Currency , which are , briefly , the effects of the mal-treatment of government , in a war against its own offspring . Can a child do well , with a father striking heavy blows on its head ? A good system of banking supplies a sound , convenient , and indispensable circulating medium for the demands of business . It is physically impossible , that the vast trade of this vast country , should be carried on with an exclusive metallic currency . The people will use the paper of private and irresponsible persons , with all its evils , if they can not have that of responsible and law-governed institutions . Besides the general soundness of a bank-paper medium , they are usually able , by the conditions on which they are chartered , to supply an adequate currency . But not the least of the benefits of a good banking system , is its effect in suppressing exorbitant usury . By far the greater portion of the sacrifices of property in this country , as the consequence of the revulsion of general credit through which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exacted by private money-holders , when the /z/ banks could not loan , and all commercial agents were in trouble . Much of the farming interest and other property of the country , has changed owners in this way , by the foreclosing of mortgages , and the original proprietors , who were well off before , have been ruined by merciless usurers . But in the operation of a sound banking system , exorbitant usury is always kept down , because it is forced to moderation , to a specified limit , by law . ( See Tract on the Currency . ) 5 . Insurance companies , etc . The benefits of these and similar institutions , are too well known to require defence . They absorb a large amount of capital , which is thus put to profitable use , at the same time that it secures the private property of individuals on an immense scale , at a premium which all can afford , if they can not afford to lose it . A ship insured , is lost , but the owners and shippers do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner receives cash for the value ; a valuable life insured , is lost , but the surviving relatives get an equivalent for the services of which they are deprived ; and in this way the most afflicting strokes of Providence are greatly relieved of their severity . Men bear one another 's burdens from motives of interest , where charity would be cold and unproductive . It is a beneficent result of civilization . 6 . Corporations secure activity to moneyed capital . It is best for all , that money should be in constant use . While lying still , it is dead to all the world , and good for nothing . But they who have money , will not trust it to second and third persons , without security . The rights and powers of corporate bodies , are indispensable to evoke hoarded wealth from its hiding places , and bring it into use for the benefit of society . 7 . Money vested in corporate institutions , is put under the control of general society , through the government . This is a prime consideration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government is virtually trustee of all funds vested in corporate institutions , prescribes the objects to which they shall be applied , and the manner of using them , employs the corporations as its agents , and holds them accountable . The government is supposed to be partial to the public , and will always endeavor to serve and promote the interests of the public . To have the moneyed power of the country under such control , can not but be regarded as better than to have it in the hands of private and exorbitant usurers , or shavers. 8 . There are many important objects indispensable to the interests of the country , which can not be accomplished , except by the power of associated capital . The objects of the various institutions we have had under review , will sufficiently show this . If they must be done , they can only be done in this way . And what and where would the country ' have been without them ? Half-way back to barbarism. 11 . The controlling power of labor , industry , and enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial capital and productive power of these capacities of man . We have seen that they are many times more productive than moneyed capital . It remains to show , that , in this country , they command and control the latter . Money and property , we know , amon ? us , are constantly changing hands . A man has only to work on , and wait patiently , and with industry and enterprise , he is sure to get both . The wheel of American fortune is perpetually and steadily turning , and those at bottom to-day , will be moving up to-morrow , and will ere long be at the top . The rich man of this year , may be poor the next , and the wealthy family of this generation , is likely to dissipate its fortune in the next . Scarcely ever does it remain in the same line to the third generation . And where is it , when no longer found with the same owners ? It is in a thousand or ten thousand hands . Where the laws of primogeniture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where everything is put under the control of labor , industry , and enterprise , there is a substantial equality . All property , among us , tends to the hands of those who work and wait for it . They are as sure to get it , as the sun is to rise and set . Where now is the vast estate of Stephen Girard , of Philadelphia ? The two millions left in charge of that city , is chiefly in the hands of the lime-burners , brick-makers , quarry-men , stone-cutters , masons , carpenters , carters , architects , artisans , manufacturers , mechanics , lumber merchants , trades of many kinds , and agents of great variety , whose labors , services , and materials were put in requisition for the erection of Girard College without the city , and Girard Square within it . And the immense estate of John Jacob Astor , of New York , where will that be in the next generation ? A considerable fraction of it has already gone into the Astor House and other edifices in that city ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and furnished the materials . Every expensive house and establishment that a rich man sets up , scatters the entire cost over the wide community , putting that amount of money and property into other and many hands . Money never stays , except with the miser , and all the wealth of the wealthiest , for the time being , is for the most part in use by somebody , benefitting the poor , and helping those who are not so well off , to rise in the world . It is impossible to keep money and property out of the hands of those who work for it , who are industrious and enterprising . They earn it , and they get it . And the productive and absorbing power of fnigal and industrious labor is so much greater than that of moneyed capital , that the latter stands no /z/ chance in the competition . It must yield , and give up , and it always does . The relative position of the capital of labor and moneyed capital , is , not that the latter commands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moneyed capital employs labor , because its owner has need of the service ; and the seccnd step of the relation is , that the parties have changed daces . Labor , industry , and enterprise , in this country , are all absorbing . They lay their lands upon everything . Their compensation is a fair one , as between the parties . The industrious and frngal toil of the last generation , possesses most of the wealth of this . So will it be with this generation , and so with the next . It is the natural order , and necessary result of American society . Labor is the master here ; it 13 the great capitalist ; the embryo millionaire ; and he who can stand up , in the bloom and vigor of ripening manhood , pure in heart , and determined to prosper , though he has not a penny in the world , may look abroad , and behold " a large estate within his reach . Within his own skin , and deep down in his own soul , lies the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . All wealth lies in abeyance to these physical and moral energies , and comes into hand at their summons . 12 . The lazy character of moneyed capital . We speak of the general character of its owners , and with them , it is not only lazy , but often improvident . Its proposal and its terms are , use me and give me my dividend . When men get beyond the necessity of labor , they never like to return to it . They seek repose , enjoyment , and exemption from the rude occupations of life . It is seldom , if ever , that they realize the satisfaction they hoped for . But they have become lazy , and by their lazy position they fall into the power of the active mind of the country . They who work are going ahead , while these fall back on their resources , can command nothing but their dividends , and are fit only to make their wills in favor of heirs , who anticipating the future , are waiting only for the good luck that death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the estate that falls into their possession . At best , the investments of moneyed capitalists , are only valuable as they are in demand for use by the active , laborious , and industrious portion of the community , who , of the two parties , always derive the greatest benefit from them , and in the end are likely to have the whole . Labor is all powerful , and destined to supplant opulent indolence , by gaining possession of the means of its luxurious ease . Guard their wealth however they may , " riches take to themselves wings and fly away . " There is no law of inheritance in American society , that can secure wealth in the same family line , while it is always open to the acquisition of industrious labor . The gifts of fortune are always tendered to those who toD for them , and snatched from those who riot in affluence . Already we behold no inconsiderable fraction of the large investments of the Lowell manufactories in the hands of those who began there by spinning and weaving , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed the mutations of society for half a generation , or even a less time than that , does not see the same operation going on everywhere ? 13 . The mutual dependence between laborers and moneyed capitalists . The rich man can not eat his money ; nor clothe himself with bank notes , or gold leaf , 01 silver plate ; nor shelter himself from the inclemencies of the seasons by these materials ; nor make of them any of the comforts of life . If he chooses to live at ease , for all necessaries , and for all means of enjoyment , he is entirely dependent on those who produce them . For all these he must give his meney in exchange , which enables those who minister to his convenience and comfort , to better their condition , and rise in the world . In these very acts of exchange , they are gradually exchanging positions in society . Nor can the wealthy get a return for their investments , or an income from their estates , if there be nobody to use the former , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relative position for the time being , though it is possible , and not unlikely , that their children will stand in directly the opposite position of their parents , in relation to each other . , The laborer wants the reward of his toil , first for necessaries not in his line ; next , to add to his comforts ; and thirdly , to increase his stock in trade , or augment his estate . But how could he get this reward , if nobody had it to give in exchange for his services ? On the other hand , the consideration paid would be of no value or use to its owners , except as it is in demand by those who carry on the active business of society , and minister to its wants . 14 . Which of these parties is more benefited by the other ? It is true , that the moneyed capitalist wants his dividend ; but the profits of labor , united with moneyed capital , well applied , are many times greater than the proceeds of money as an investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all wealth , and with money , as tools in hand , multiplies the principal in manifold quantities . The laborer , working on his own estate , gathers the rich harvest into his own barns , and gives the moneyed capitalist a small fraction for the use of his sickle  --  for moneyed capital , in the hands of labor , is only an instrument . Or if he works on the estate of the moneyed capitalist for wages , as at Lowell , he soon gets enough to retire in a condition to satisfy his ambition , or becomes part owner of the /z/ estate , gradually gaining on the original proprietor , with the prospect of supplanting him . Such is the advantage of labor , united with skill and enterprise , over the mere instrument which it employs . 15 . Labor the original and fundamental poioer of society . The recognition of the true position of labor , in relation to moneyed capital , is of no inconsiderable political importance . We mean its position in the actual state and practical operation of American society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stands under a despotism , or in the monarchical and aristocratic countries of Europe . It is our own politics , and our own political powers , with which we have to do . In this country , labor , since our independence was acquired , always has been and still is , not only an original and fundamental , but a controlling power in society , and in the state . We are characteristically and distinctively a nation of workers . There are some who do not work ; but most people do . Work is the fashion , and the proudest distinction in American society . Nobody looks with respect on those who live in idleness , or who riot in luxurious ease . To have no business , is a kind of living death . A man is lost , who does not work . Moneyed capital , with us , is a mere tool in the hand of labor , and is good for nothing , except as labor will bid for it . The millionaire would be scarcely better off than the owner of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to his physical wants  --  if he could not call the laborer into his service ; whereas the laborer is much more independent , and can better do without the rich man , than the rich man can do without him . This independence , this high ground of labor , is perfectly well understood in this country , by all parties . As the great majority are workers , and all workers sympathize with each other , the ground they occupy is not only an elevated social position , but a controlling political power . Just show the working power of the country what laws , and what policy of government , will be best for it , and the ballot box will soon demand those measures . Who will say that this demand can be successfully resisted ? Who , regarding the well being of the country , would desire it ? 16 . The true and best interest of moneyed capital . It is to give labor a fair reward , and to make it profitable . But as this can not be forced , as between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to do it can not be separated from the action of government . All workers , therefore , as well as moneyed capitalists  --  all laborers are deeply concerned in supporting a public policy , which will put labor in good demand , and thus enable it to command a good price . This depends entirely upon the proceeds of moneyed investments . While these are good , labor will be in demand , and the price of it , or its wages , will be proportionately high . Moneyed investments are sure to pay well , if it can be afforded ; and the more they can afford , the better for them . But generally , this ability to give good wages , depends very much , sometimes entirely , on the policy of government , in the privileges it confers on such investments , and the chances it gives to them . If the government wars against them , instead of extending to them its fostering care , if it endeavors to cripple and break them down , instead of protecting and sustaining them , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering his investments insecure and unproductive ; but it injures the working classes of the community much more . The rich can hide themselves in a storm of government hostility , though they may be losers ; but the poor perish , or are in great distress , for want of employment . Our remark above on the comparative independence of labor , applies to an ordinary state of things , and not to a crisis of this description . 17 . A false notion . It has been a prevalent and fatal doctrine in this country , with a certain class of statesmen , that it is always a safe policy and a duty in the government , to fight against moneyed capitalists , in whatever place or shape they lift up their heads , whether in banks , or in manufactories , or in any and all other forms and enterprises requiring associated capital . In this , it is not considered , that the employment and thriving of the people depend on the profitable investment of the moneyed capital of the country ; nor that the wages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depend on the profits accruing from the use of the moneyed capital which labor employs . Moneyed capital is regarded by this policy as a master , not as a servant and instrument ; as a hostile power , not as a friendly auxiliary ; as having in itself a faculty of independence , not as deriving all its value from labor ; and as aiming to acquire a supremacy over society . But a little reflection , in view of what has been said , one would think , ought to show , that the condition of moneyed capital , in this country , is passive in the hand of labor , and not active to rule over it , and that it is not possible to change this relation of dependence in the former on the latter . Moneyed capital , in itself , is an inert power , and derives all its vitality from the touch of labor . For government , therefore , to open the way , by its policy , for the profitable use of money , is the same as to provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that policy which /z/ destroys the profit of money , destroys the profit of labor . Let government strike at the rich , and the blow falls on the heads of the poor . 18 . Tlie effect of allowing foreign labor to compete with home labor , on the same level . Estimating the value of moneyed capital in any country by the average price , or interest , paid for its use , American moneyed capital would fall at once to about two thirds of its present value , and the price of home labor would sink to about one third  --  or jointly the depression would be fifty per cent .  --  and the value of all other property would sink in like proportion . For it is manifest , that , with no tariff to protect us , the price of American labor must fall to the average price of European labor . They who work for the same market , must work for the same wages . Besides this , we should , to a very great e : i at , be driven from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the condition of a dependent and tributary colony . See our Tract on the Tariff , No . III. , for a farther elucidation of this point. 19 . A comparative view of the position of labor in America and Europe . We have told in the outset what we mean by labor . It is they who work  --  real workers , no matter in what , or with what , or for what end , if it be lawful and honorable work , to supply the wants of civilized man , or the increasing wants of advancing civilization . The more wants , the more work , and so much the better for all , where each chooses his own calling , and finds employment . But the position of labor in this country is , in a variety of important particulars , a new one in human society . 1 . It is free  --  with the exception of African slave labor . This species of freedom , which is a most important attainment in the progress of society , implies a practicable alternative to working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Europe , for the most part , there is no such alternative , and the laborer is compelled to work at a price in which he has no voice , or he must starve ; and for the reason that he has no voice in fixing his wages , they are too scanty for comfort , much more for bettering his condition , and often too scanty for subsistence . European wages are next to a state of starvation . At best , it is a state of slavery , without hope . But in this country , labor occupies a high social and political position . It is never compelled to work for wages fixed by emplo - ers , because there is always open to it the alternative of working on its own hook . American labor , therefore , does not accept a price imposed , but coimnands its own price . At least , it is always an independent party in the compact . It is made freely , and can be as freely dissolved , without incurring the doom of starvation or distressing want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , that none but workers are held in respect  --  and work is held in the highest respect . No power , in this country , can enforce respect for the man who has nothing io do , and who does nothing . Just in proportion as a rich man retires from society , to wrap himself up in selfishness , does he lose his influence , and the idle , lazy poor mar , gets little pity in his poverty . Our fathers brought with them both the necessity and spirit i ! ' work , and made it respectable . It has been transmitted as the highest recommendation , and the most honorable character . 3 . The political position of labor here is all-powerful , and so long as it is so , it can not but be respectable . Asa nation of workers , we demand from Government a security for the interests and rights of labor , and one of those rights is , that free American labor shall not be put on the same level with the forced labor of other countries , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this country to understand correctly what the true interests and rights of labor are , and they are sure to have them secured at the ballot-box . No earthly power can hinder it . What more elevated or more commanding position , can labor possibly occupy ? The free American laborer is the most powerful , and may well be the proudest of men . 20 . The dignity of labor . " The mandate of God to his creature man is , Work ! " " The Genius of work is the Conqueror , the supreme Lawgiver , the born King over affluent idleness . " " The Leaders of Industry are the Captains of the world . If there be no nobleness in them , there will never be an aristocracy more . " This is higher-toned phrase than we are addicted to employ , as they who read us well know . Nevertheless , as there is such a vast body of comprehensive truth in it , we have borrowed it for the sake of brevity . It plants labor where God intended it should stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Creation is visible in her works . Behold the constitution of man , contemplate the character of his mind , and judge , if he was not made for work , if idleness is not a disease , a fatal malady . Creation itself is called the work of God . " In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , " which , though announced as part of the doom of the first transgression , is , by the remedial scheme of man 's redemption , con-verted into a blessing and a dignity . Earth is a work-field , and heaven a rest . It is as bad , as vicious , not to work here , since God has so appointed , as to violate any other /z/ precept of Divine authority . The example of God in the work of Creation , and the example of Christ in the work of Redemption , aside from the force of command , impart the highest possible sanction and the highest possible dignity to those labors of man which have become necessary in this life . Human labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall stand at the head of human affairs . " The Leaders of Industry are the Captains of the world . " Such was the design  --  such is the tendency . They who work , will govern . We know it has not always been so , and that was a vicious state of society when and wherever it was not so . We know that labor has not , in all history , received due homage . But this fact does not affect , nor impair the validity of its claims . 21 . The physical and moral health fulness of labor . Doubtless , in the best possible state of human society , labor should be neither a toil , nor a task , but the healthful action of all the faculties , bodily and mental . Labor , in most parts of the world , has been so unequally divided , that parts of the race have been excessively burdened , while others have suffered equally lor want of a proper share . The pauper or forced labor of Europe is an example of the first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second . The whole Eastern world is full of scenes of this kind . But wherever labor is rising , or has risen to its true position in political society , we observe both the physical and moral healthfulness which it diffuses all around . It is good for man and woman to work , and neither can find the greatest comfort and happiness attainable in the human state , without employment . Nor is it possible , without diligence in some industrial pursuit , to have the best state of health in body and mind . The results of Providence , reveal and announce his designs , viz. , that idleness is the curse of the human state , and diligent occupation , in a lawful and useful calling , the consummation of its blessedness. 22 . The content of labor . When society shall have made labor what God designed it should be , it will present a happy scene of contentment . Specimens are frequently found , in actual life , to illustrate this desirable state of things . Who has not seen them ? And who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer , happy in his own domain ; and listen to the housewife , joyously exulting in song , in the midst of her children , or soothing her infant to repose with a hymn of early love . The wasjon boy 's whistle , the woodman 's laugh , the boatman 's glee , the sailor 's jolly face , and all the forms of labor 's rest on the past , satisfaction in the present , and hope in the future , are so many various symptoms of labors content . What industrial calling has not its quiet aspects by day , and its refreshing sleep at night ? 23 . A new Era of labor . It is impossible not to observe , that labor has taken up a new position on this continent , in our state of society , and that a new Era in its social and political importance , is opened on the world . If no interruption should take place in its progress , it will be the true Millenium of labor . During the long nightmare of despotic rule over the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy tread , and the toiling millions were unable to rise . But here labor has sprung to its feet , lifted up its hands on high , clapped them with joyous exultation , and learnt a new song of freedom  --  The reward of labor . It has risen , at one bound , to influence ana authority . There has never before been such a scene in the history of civilization . And the most remarkable and most auspicious feature of it is , that it occupies a wide theatre  --  a vast domain of political power . Erect , in the image of God , imitating and obeying God , as a diligent worker , man here has taken possession of his primitive estate , so long alienated , and cultivates it as his own , himself the heir of his own created wealth ; and not only the heir , but the sovereign disposer thereof . We know not what may grow put of this new form , this apparently auspicious development of human society ; but it has much contingent promise ot perpetuity , enlargement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped for . 24 . The contingency . A protective Tariff is the sole palladium of American labor . Without that defence , it is as sure to fall back prostrate on the level of European , Egyptian , and Asiatic labor , from which it has been lifted up , as the sun will rise in the East and set in the West . If American labor , having the power in its hand , will not protect itself , the fault of parting with its rights , will lie at its own door . The struggle has been a great one , and it will yet be long protracted . Either the rights of American labor must give way , or the despotic rule of the old world must vield to the claims of freedom . It is impossible that both should stand . And so long as both are in conflict , we shall not fail to realise a sturdy hostility from tottering and crumbling thrones , gathering fresh vigor from despair , assisted by their agents in our bosom , who are paid by their gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Senate Document , No. 340 , 2d Session , 27th Congress , we learn , that the internal commerce , or domestic trade of the United States , is two thousand millions of dollars annually . Having made this quotation , as it stands in a public document , we would add , that in our opinion , this estimate is one fifth or five hundred millions less than the facts would warrant . The Honorable Senator , the author of the above cited document , once stated to us a few facts , from which he deduced the conclusion , that the annual amount of exchanges required to carry on this domestic trade , could not be less than four hundred millions of dollars . Add to this all the money required to be used in paying for the labor employed in producing these fruits of the earth , and these materials , goods , and merchandise ; add all required to pay for their transit from one point to another and in the retail distribution of them , and it will be seen , that it not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could furnish , but great activity of the same . It will also be seen , as our annual exports do not usually exceed one hundred millions , that our domestic trade is about twenty to one of our foreign trade , and that on the former , therefore , is our chief reliance for the reward of American labor and industry . The work of production , and the carrying on of this trade , must of course form innumerable commercial relations between the producers and the consumers , between the employers and the employed , between the laborers and the moneyed capitalits . Nearly the entire subsistence , and nearly all the growing wealth of the people of this country , spring from the employment of this capital , and from the action of the labor and industry sustained by it . 26 . Deductions from the foregoing facts and reasonings. 1 . Though money is usually understood to be designated by the term capital , in the commercial world , it appears , that labor , together with those moral qualities which enter into it , constitutes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important and more productive . 2 . That the capital of labor is more influential and more commanding , socially and politically . 3 . That the relation of labor to moneyed capital , is that of the agent to the instrument , of the hand to the tool . 4 . And therefore , that the position of the capital of labor is more dignified , and worthy of more respect . 5 . That the interests of labor are best promoted by the activity of moneyed capital . 6 . That the interests of labor require the existence of corporate bodies , so far as may be necessary to set on foot and accomplish commercial and other useful works and enterprises , which are beyond the capacity of individual capital and unassociated effort . 7 . That since banks and other corporations give security to and invite the investment of moneyed capital , it is the only mode by which that species of capital can be brought into effective use for the benefit of the public . 8 . That the multiplication of corporations , on right principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of government among the people . 9 . That the tendency of labor is to wealth , and that of wealth to want . 10 . That the political power of labor in American society , is dominant , and only requires correct information , as to its best interests , to secure them , in the administration of public affairs . 11 . That the vitality of moneyed power lies fn the arm of labor . 12 . That , in the relation of moneyed capital to labor , labor has the best chances . 13 . That a correct view of this relation , in its practical effects , is of great political importance . 14 . That a great and disastrous political heresy , in regard to this relation , has for a long time pervaded and controlled the counsels of our government . 15 . That the rich can hide from a storm raised by government against them , while all its merciless peltings fall upon the poor . 16 . That the true policy is always to encourage the investment of moneyed capital , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home market is the most productive source of national wealth . IS . That labor in this country occupies an eminently high social and political position , as compared with labor in all other parts of the world . 19 . That labor is honored of God , and therefore worthy of universal respect . 20 . That it is most healthful to body and soul . 21 . That it is most fruitful of contentment. 22 . That with American society , commenced a new era of labor in the history of the world . 23 . That the advancement and consummation of this era , is contingent on a protective tariff . 24 . That our home trade is twenty times as great as our foreign trade . 25 . That every American laborer can stand up proudly , and say , I am the American capitalist , which is not a metaphor , but literal truth . 27 . A picture . We will suppose , that the government , in making war on the moneyed capital of the countrv , and on the various institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has succeeded in suppressing them ; that it has broken down all the banks , dissolved all moneyed corporations , stopped all public works and public improvements , and will neither do these things itself , nor allow others to do them . There is no less money in the country , than there was before , other things being equal ; but it is chiefly out of sight , and little of it in use . The thousands , tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of laborers , /z/ whose families depend on their daily wages for daily bread , solicit employment , but there is nobody to hire them ; at least , not more than one in many of them can get anything to do . The soil of the country yields bountifully to the labors of the husbandman , but there is no market for its products ; the buz and din of our manufactories have ceased , and they who worked in them have disappeared ; the mechanic finds little encouragement for the use of his art ; commerce drops her wings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our canals are falling in like a neglected ditch ; our railways rust , and there is no motive to repair the damages of time ; our cities are noiseless , and the grass grows in the streets ; and the whole country has fallen into a deep sleep , a perpetual sabbath of repose . But there is poverty , hunger , nakedness , and universal misery . The wheels of government go heavily along , for lack of wherewithal to grease them . We admit that such a state of things is not very Likely to come to pass ; for the people , in 1840 , proved , that they are capable of foreseeing the evil , and of preventing it . But we respectfully submit , that some such consequences must necessarily come to pass , from a full and complete operation of such a destructive system . Nay , we have had some foretaste of it already , as all the people of this country are witnesses , in the partial operation of such measures . The effect has been , to stop the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose instrumentality alone it can be had , to answer the demands of this great and enterprising country . For an eighth ol a century , we had been rapidly marching toward the consummation of such a destiny , and it is yet to be decided , probably in 1844 , whether we shall get in that path again . 23 . A great Fact . Till within a few years , the prosperity of this country and its increasing wealth , have been unexampled in the history of nations . Small as our population was , comparatively , and comparatively poor , the debt incurred by the war of Independence , was shouldered by the nation , and between that period and the second war with Great Britain , it was nearly liquidated . This second struggle brought upon us another burden , but this too , was all paid oft in about twenty years , and in 1836 we had a surplus revenue of thirty six millions to distribute among the states . This is a great and comprehensive fact , to which we desire to call very special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labored under some disadvantages , from various causes , probably from none more , than from the want of a proper adjustment and uniform action of our tariff system . Nevertheless , we struggled through them all , and they proved insufficient materially to mar our prosperity , or put in check our increasing wealth . 29 . Another great Fact . It is certainly very remarkable , in view of the previous history of our national finances , which hud improved so steadily , and at last swelled to such a scale of income , that , on a sudden , this current of our public affairs should be reversed ; that , in a time of peace , the Government could not get money enough to defray its own expenses , without borrowing ; that it was compelled to withhold the fourth instalment of the public funds voted to the States in 1836 ; and lint the expenditures and appropriations of the Government , from the 4th of March , 1837 , to the 4th of March , 1841 ( only four years ) , should have been some. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tars in excess of the revenues of the same time ! ( See our Tract , No. 1 , The Test , pp. 10 and 13 . ) And it would seem , that the nation has been plunged in a slough of this kind , from which it is very difficult to get out . The causes , which have produced such an amazing reverse in our national fortunes , must have been prodigiously potent . The momentum of a half century of a nation 's rapidly increasing prosperity , rising like the sun , and swelling like a mighty river , as it descends into the sea , required no common cause to check , derange , prostrate , destroy it . There is no accounting for this great fact , except by misgovernment , and that , too , on a stupendous scale . It takes a long time to build up a nation ; but destruction is a quick work . In our state of society , a good Government makes a prosperous people . It is impossible , that this country should not be growing great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as the various occupations of life are suitably encouraged and protected , each in its fair proportion . But the Government had so legislated away the prosperity of the people , and reduced them to such straits and such distress , that the sources of revenue were cut off and dried up . The public expenditures were also unnecessarily great and prodigal , and altogether unprecedented . ( See our Tract , No. 1 , pp. 9 and 10 . ) The people can not supply the wants of the Government , unless the Government gives them a chance . On the other hand , they are sure to make an overflowing treasury , while in a state of prosperity , and under a suitable system of revenue laws . But the success of the Government , in its war on our moneyed institutions and other great enterprises , in which moneyed capital was invested , broke down the currency , which was the means of public wealth , by being the means of private prosperity . The entire credit system of the country , under which we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful , was also assailed by the Government , and bent and broke under the weight of its powerful hand , and by its repeated blows . Was it strange , under such a destructive policy , that the people , the Government , the whole nation were impoverished ? The Government had struck the people such heavy blows , so long continued , that the misfortunes of the people fell back on the Government with a weight , under which it reeled , as the people had reeled before , and unfortunately fallen . The Government had ruined a nation 's prosperity , and as a consequence bankrupted an overflowing treasury . ( See our Tract on the Currency , No . II . p. 16 , for the aggregate of losses to the country by that Destructive Dynasty. ) 30. the Chief Cause . It is undoubtedly true , that the causes , more properly , perhaps , the instruments , have been several , and the system of injury complicated , by which the country has been so fearfully run down . But the great aim of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to set tabor to war against moneyed capital , by legislation and Government ; and the mode of this warfare was an endeavor to cripple and break down those institutions and enterprises , in which the moneyed capital of the country was chiefly vested . 31 . The destructive and fatal effects of this warfare . Unless it were proposed to rob moneyed capitalists , and divide the spoils directly , any attempt to cripple them by legislation and Government , with the design of better securing the rights the laboring classes , must necessarily cripple and destroy the latter . " Whatever war the Government may wage against capitalists , short of robbing , it is always in their power to withdraw their funds from those uses which have heretofore , in our experience , so well served the convenience of the public and the wants of labor , and turn them into investments , which will only serve themselves . In some respects , and to no small extent , they would be able to serve themselves much better than before , as by exorbitant usury , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , which must necessarily result from such an administration of public affairs . The rich can protect themselves , but the poor can not , when the Government forces all classes to change their modes of business and of living . If the great law of mutual dependence in society be overlooked or violated , in the policy and measures of Government , and an attempt be made to injure and cripple moneyed capitalists , for the benefit of laborers , the most fatal consequences must unavoidably ensue . Facts of this kind have already been alluded to , in cases of exorbitant usury . If the rich can do without the poor , by turning their capital into other investments , than those which give to the latter employment , food , raiment , and a comfortable home , with chances of rising in the world , and of becoming rich in their turn , the poor can not do without the rich , who , in these ways , minister to their necessities , and seciu-e to them the means of bettering their condition . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a war upon the poor , of the worst kind , and of the most disastrous effects . It is a war upon the most vita interests of society , and upon the relations of mankind in the social state , which , if carried out , the entire social fabric must bend and break . 32 . A plain statement . Nothing but an extraordinary infatuation could have shut the eyes of the people to the fact , that moneyed capital employed in the country , is for the interests of labor ; that its uses afford chances of improvement to those who have little , and give bread , clothing , and a home to the poor ; that rich men seek to invest their funds where they can be employed by labor ; that the modes of investment are naturally determined by the habits and wants of the commercial , agricultural , manufacturing , mechanical , and other laboring classes of the community ; that what these want will be most productive to capitalists , because most beneficial to labor ; that capital in large amounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must necessarily be vested with corporate rights , to be secure for all concerned , and most effective for general good ; that moneyed capitalists would never put their funds in other hands without such protection ; that banks are necessary to furnish a circulating medium , convenient in form , and adequate for the trade and business of the country ; that all these institutions had their origin in the wants and necessities of the people ; that in putting down and destroying them , by legislation and Government , the people only put down and destroy themselves ; and that the greater the income of capital vested in these various forms , as a permanent state of things , so much greater the evidence of general prosperity . But the revolution introduced in the financial policy of the Government , and forced on tfc.3 commercial habits of the people , from 1830 to 1840 , broke up all these established relations of the different parts of the community toward each other , and left all in a mass of confusion and ruin , to be reorganized and set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ivay it worked . It is true , that this work of destruction was not thoroughly carried out , for there was not time for it , before the people , with ruin staring them full in the face , began to feel their danger , by the pressure of present calamity , and showed symptoms of a desire to avoid it . Nevertheless , these old institutions of the country were shaken by the onset ; some of them fell down and were entirely broken up ; confidence in them was impaired ; capitalists knew not where they could safely vest their funds for the uses of the community , and consequently withheld , or withdrew them , or vested them in forms not liable to such attack ; the natural connexion between moneyed capitalists and the laboring classes , was dissolved ; while the rich were trying to protect themselves from the eifects of The war waged upon them , in the uses of the functions of Government , the poor were plunged in want and distress ; the financial habits of the Government and the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipitated into new modes of action , leading to new , and as could not be avoided , to painful and calamitous results , public and private ; the credit and enterprises of the States , were prostrated with the credit and enterprises of the people ; the sources of public revenue were exhausted ; and Repudiation followed , with its indelible stain on our national character . We need not recite more particularly the ordeal of financial embarrassment and commercial distress , through which this country has so recently passed , by means of this vindictive , insane , and fatal policy . 34 . This war unnatural . It is certainly unnatural for labor to do that , which deprives it of tools to work with , cuts off its chances , and involves it in distress . For by breaking down moneyed capital , it breaks down itself . It is moneyed capital which makes business grow and thrive , gives employment to labor , and opens to it avenues to success in life . In the state of American society , and in a prosperous condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reach of every honest , industrious , and enterprising man . The moneyed capitalist has no political superiority or advantage over the laborer , and no right in the republic , which is not secured to both . It is , therefore , the laborer 's interest , that the wealth of the rich should be so invested as to impart the greatest activity to trade , and the greatest effectiveness to useful enterprise ; and in nothing is this end so surely accomplished , as by those moneyed and other corporations , which are organized for this sole purpose . If this capital were to lie dead , the loss to the country would be immense , and that loss would of course be divided among all classes of people , and participated in by the Government . It is as much the duty of the Government , to endow moneyed capital with the faculties of the greatest activity and effectiveness , as it is the interest of its possessors to consent that it should be so used , and of labor to employ it . What supreme folly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moneyed capital ! It thereby wars against its own life and means of success . The blow aimed at the moneyed capitalist , strikes over on the head of the laborer , and is sure to hurt the lattei more than the former . 35 . The capacities of our Country . Well and rightly governed , it is capable , not only of astonishing the world , but of astonishing itself . If things do not go on well , it must be owing solely to the perversion of our institutions from their design . There is no sufficient apology , that our general prosperity should ever be interrupted . It is impossible that it should be , except by a violation or misapplication of the trusts reposed in our public functionaries . By a suitable protection of the interests of American labor and industry , from a self-sacrificing rivalship with a foreign , oppressed , and degraded pauperism , which is in no wise mitigated , but only aggravated and rendered more hopeless by the favor done to their oppressors ; by a proper encouragement of the voluntary enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the rich and inexhaustible treasures of creation comprehended in our jurisdiction , are capable of producing amazing results . That almost astonishing height of prosperity , to which we had attained , under all the disadvantages of a defective tariff system , before the advent of the late Destructive Dynasty , is conclusive and impressive evidence of what this nation is capable of , under a wise and faithful administration of our public affairs . We had been put in a train , by which we were enabled to discharge with ease the entire and heavy debt incurred by the last war with Great Britain , and to overwhelm the public treasuiy with surplus funds ; the public domain in the west was in such demand , that the sales of one year amounted to twenty-four millions of dollars , and although there were special reasons for this fact , which could not be expected to operate in perpetuity , to an equal extent , nevertheless , in a prosperous state of things , there would be a steady increase in those sales , which , under an equitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property they are , would relieve the burdens of the indebted States , and give the others a chance for such enterprises as might best promote their interests . /z/ Providence has assigned us a rich , productive , and glorious heritage , and established among us and over us a new , regenerate , and admirable system of Government . It has been abused , indeed ; but it is good . All we want is good and faithful men at the head of it . The wealth of the country is inexhaustible , and the enterprise of the people is unsubdued , notwithstanding all our late misfortunes . Give them a good Government , and they can not help going ahead* and outstripping every nation on the globe . 36 . TJie chances of life in this Country . Ours is a country , where men start from an humble origin , and from small beginnings rise gradually in the world , as the reward of merit and industry , and where they can attain to the most elevated positions , or acquire a large amount of wealth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive privileges of birth , no entailment of estates , no civil or political disqualifications , stand in their path ; but one has as good a chance as another , according to his talents , prudence , and personal exertions . This is a country of self-made men , than which nothing better could be said of any state of society . 37 . The mutual dependence bclicecn the Government and the People . Nothing is more instructive to this point , than the chapter of our own history . Except as the Government , by its policy , shall enable the people to prosper , in a free country like ours , where tyrannical exactions can not be enforced , the Government itself can not prosper , but its finances will be embarrassed as soon as its own measures shall have brought embarrassment and distress on the people . A crippled and disheartened population , who have no money , either to pay taxes or buy luxuries , can not send money into the public treasury . While they are poor , the Government will be poor . 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if what we have said is correct , the relation between the labor of the country and its moneyed capital , we must look back with astonishment at the policy of the Federal Administration , from 1829 to 1841 , when the cry rung through the land , and never ceased  --  Down with the banks ! Down with manufactories ! Down with corporations ! Down with capitalists . ' It is a history that one can hardly believe in ! While memory lasts , and fathers are capable of telling the story to their children ; while true Americans are endowed with concern for the welfare of the country , and have virtue enough to stand up for its interests ; and while history may be relied upon to discharge its impartial functions , it will not fail to stand stereotyped in the minds of the American people , to be rehearsed to the listening and succeeding generation , and recorded in the annals of this nation , that , for the period above named , we had a re-lapse and coZ-lapse in our national welfare , never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemisphere , ascended to its meridian , and marched to the western hills , leaving an ominous tail behind ; that the people were persuaded for a time , that it was the true sun , and were hard to be convinced of its eccentric and ill boding character ; that it brought famine , pestilence , and death ; that demagogueism was the rage of its season , innoculating the poor with a mania against the rich , and the laborer with jealousy against the moneyed capitalist ; that the love of One Man Power , was the chief malady that afflicted the nation , and its ascendency the most remarkable occurrence of the time ; that the long-established , simple , and democratic habits of the people , social and political , were superseded by the dictation of a Chief , and by the aristocratic assumptions of his menials ; that new , unheard-of , and destructive doctrines were promulged for the government of the country ; that a well-ordered system of currency was broken up and destroyed ; that the viseful relations between capitalists and the laboring classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to bring great distress on the industrious and working population ; that States and large corporations were first enticed to enlist in great enterprises , and then forced to suspend them , and to stop payment , by sudden changes in the policy and measures of the Government ; that our credit at home was prostrated , and abroad became the by-word and scorn of nations ; that the shameless doctrine of the Repudiation of debts , was for the first time avowed and sanctioned by legislative authority ; that the superstructure and very foundations of society were shaken in the general convulsion ; in short , that times , modes , customs , morals , and manners underwent a complete revolution , so that the republic that was , could hardly be recognised in the new state of things . It was because the relation of labor to moneyed capital , was entirely mistaken and misrepresented , and a war of Government made upon the latter , as if it was the natural enemy of the former . /z/ 39 . The Future . The dawn of a brighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-snffering and much-abused nation . The last ( 27th ) Congress , notwithstanding the treason and all its attendant difficulties , gave us a Tariff , which has put us in a position to start for the recovery of a long lost national prosperity . This great boon of Whig policy has operated like a charm on every branch of the business and trade of the country , has brought back the specie , the absence of which had undermined our currency , and the people are beginning to open their eyes to the true character of that Destructive Dynasty through which we have passed . They see what ruin it brought upon us , and begin to understand the causes  --  especially do they see , that the war of Government on the long-established monetary system of the country and its great commercial and financial agencies , was a war on its labor and industry . This great discovery will lead to important results . The prophecies of the faithful , uttered in dark days , being now interpreted by their fulfilment , the prophets themselves will be honored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not foretold as the necessary consequence of that destructive policy ? What of good was predicted , in the beneficent operation of a Tarifl like that of 1842 , which the brief experiment does not begin to shower upon us I Who are they that foretold these things ? Who is CHIEF among them ? The sad and gloomy days of our political misfortunes , it is to be hoped , are drawing to a close . The steady counsels of HENRY CLAY , once and for a long time spurned , are now beginning to be appreciated . The eyes and hopes of the nation are turned and turning to that bright Star of the West , and the suffrages of a great people are waiting to honor him . It is yet indeed a contingent future , into whose vista we gaze with an interest so profound and intense , and with- hopes not unmixed with concern , because it is contingent . Nevertheless , there are certain and numerous facts , rising thick and fast , out of the past and the present , the grateful import ol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they are coming ; and in 1844 , as in 1840 , their power is likely to be felt . Now , as then , they understand what is to be done , to make miscreants tremble , and drive traitors for ever from power and influence . Enough of mischief , surely , has been achieved ; let us try fob the good . 40 . Revolutions never go backivard . Under our form of Government , other revolution than that of opinion , is impossible . Can anybody doubt there was a great revolution of this kind in 1S40 ? And where is that feeling ? Have the people changed their minds ? They would not act , till the time of rescue should come , and the silly crew at the head of affairs , took the people 's disgust as a compliment to their treason ! The banished horde also took courage . But the sleeping fires have only been made hotter , by that respect for order which sealed them up , and for a time repressed them . The internal pressure tends upward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast its broad light on the dark upper sky , and thence to astonish those below . A free nation , once convinced of its wrongs , must be avenged , and wo to them who have done the wrong ! Backward ? or forward ? is the question for this nation to answer , and it will be answered . They have chosen a LEADER , and the cry is  --  " - ONWARD ! 41 . The means . Much of precious time , and of useful appliances , has been lost , irrecoverably . There is a partial remedy , however , in a more diligent application of time and means yet on hand . Will not they who can speak , make themselves heard ; they who can write , take the pen ; they who can work , begin to stir ; and they who have money , give it freely , at the call of the country ? Where is the virtue of ' 76 ? The Destructive Dynasty has done us infinitely worse things , than the British Crown ever did . Shall a confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly  --  put r ? = asleep on our arms ? Jfter the battle , let us hope for the repose , which , in manly conflict , shall have been purchased .
