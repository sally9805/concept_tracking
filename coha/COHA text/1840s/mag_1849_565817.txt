txt THE author who attempts the composition of what may properly be called a biography , undertakes a task which is at once difficult in its execution and momentous in its consequences . rpo write anything that shall be in the fullest sense a life of a human being , may safely be pronounced not only difficult , but impossible . The heart out of which are the issues of life , none can know , and yet without knowing it , who can describe or fully understand the life ? Yet let a description be given , though imperfect , unreal , founded on ignorance and assumption in many respects , and it will determine what other lives shall be , none can tell how many , none can tell how long . The humblest piousfraud memoir found on the shelves of the Sabbath school library , may fix the character of one who is eventually to fix the character and condition of millions . So then we have , on the one hand , an impossibility of perfectly accomplishing what there is no want of heedless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty of infinite good or evil resulting from the execution , imperfect as it may be . It would seem that two such facts wonid infuse a salutary degree of caution and hesitancy , into the minds of those who are undertaking to xv rite biography . It would seem that such writers , if reason and conscience fulfill their office in their behalf , would be impelled to subject mere feeling and passion to the most rigid self-control while carrying forward their work . It must require no common degree , either of self-assurance or of indifference to the actual consequences that must result from a false , though fascinating delineation of a single human life , for a writer to cmploy biography only as a convenient form in which to embody the trifling conceits of a fanciful mind , or to display prettinesses of speech or of sentiment , which can find their only approp*ate p*ace in suc'h productions as *o not pretend to aea'l cVirect*ly with the awful realities of human life and duty . It is not to be denied that fiction may safely be allowed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , when properly restricted , may exert a salutary influence conducing to the intelligence , refinement and happiness of individuals and of society . But in order that it may be entitled to so much consideration , it should appear without disguise , under its own appropriate name ; and that which is fiction in its origin , must be truth in its conformity to nature . The fiction which claims to be true // to nature and is not , is only fitted to make its readers as false to themselves and their duty , as it is to its own pretensions . But much more pernicious in its entire influence must be that , which claims to be truth itself , and to be fitted for instruction in the highest walks of duty , while in reality , it is not even true to nature as fiction . How much is it to be deplored then , that such is found on faithful examination , to be the precise character of many a biography which assumes the sacred name of Christian , and claims to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instruction in righteousness . " And must the observing reader be censured as skeptical or cold hearted if , when having determinedly toiled through some hundreds of pages of a newly issued volume , desirous of learning something of the inner and the outer life of a faithful servant of God , and having found little else than omissions of what he most wished to learn , and elaborate prominence given to that which is unimportant as it is unreal , he throws it from him with mingled contempt and indignation . Authors , whose ever prevailing passion is to draw pictures which shall be beautiful rather than real , and to exhibit characteristics that shall be striking rather than faithful , are the last that should attempt biography . They should have more reverence for God ' * work in man , than to approach and cast the bespangled tissue of their pet conceits and elaborately woven scenes , upon the human form divine . Whatever name they prefix to their descriptions , they only describe themselves . The only picture of theirs which can be trusted for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds . They have far less anxiety to give a faithful exhibition of a real character , than that the exhibition itself , shall be such as to secure admiration . Whenever a selection is to be made from incidents too numerous to be introduced into the narrative or one is to be chosen from several different versions that have been made of the same , the reader may invariably be sure of having that which best displays the author 's favorite style of composition . So that it is the character of the writer rather than that of the subject of the biography , which appears most conspicuous in the narrative . Thus the leading question to be decided in choosing to read or not to read theiorthcoming volume , is , not what character is described but who furnishes the description . It were to be most devotitly wished that writers who are possessed with such a passion to make themselves seen and applauded in all they do , would let biography , at least religious biography , alone . If they would display their skill in scene painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the scenes and the characters , as well as the embroidery with which they would adorn them . And thus , while they gratify their ambition to delight , they will be less exposed to the temptation to deceive . // 401 It would require a very extraordinary degree of indulgence towards the sex and the profession , both of the author and the subject of the biography before us , not to feel that these general observations upon that kind of writing , are susceptible , in part at least , of a specific application to this single production . But where not a few have erred in the same particulars , it would have the appearance of injustice , and a sinister motive might possibly be suspected , if one alone and that a woman , were made to bear the censure deserved by many . It may perhaps better secure the object of criticism , and it will certainly be more agreeable to ourselves , in this case , to imitate the conduct of legislative bodies and magistrates , who sometimes , instead of punishing any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine who has been most active , declare an amnesty , accompanying its proclamation with an admonitory protest against the repetition of such offenses . While then the sex and the self-devotion , and the romance of our missionary biographer of a sister missionary , are neither forgotten nor kept especially in mind , we would , in the name of truth , reason and piety together , solemnly remonstrate against the continued repetition of the defects and positive errors which have rendered so large a proportion of the religious biography hitherto written , in a great ( degree untrustworthy as narrative , unsafe as exhibiting models for the formation of character , and unsound as showing the principles which should control the beginning and the mature development of the Christian life . And in order that this protest may not seem to have been recorded merely in the spirit of professional reviewing , or without sufficient occasion , we shall state more specifically several characteristics which all readers have a right to demand in a professedly Christian biography , and which it must have , if its delineations of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples are to be held up for imitation . And when a very little reflection and comparison is found sufficient to show any one how utterly the multitudes of books in this department of literature fail of reaching a safe and reasonable standard , then it will appear boxy much occasion there is for the strictures presented in the following Qbservations . A Christian biography should describe a real character . None but those who are fresh from the reading of such a book as the one before us , can fully appreciate the necessity of insisting gravely upon so obvious an injunction as this . Why is it that the devotit yet credulous reader of Christian memoirs , so invariably gets the impression , that there are now no such disciples of the Redeemer as those whose course of life he has been tracing under the direction of the biographer 's pen ? Is it because the excellent of the earth are always in the past , never in the living // 402 Ch , : istian Biography . and world of the present in which we live ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , so superior that none of the thousands of readers may hope to see its like ? Such a thing is not possible unless the gospel is actually dying out of the world . Equally impossible is it that such multitudes of readers should agree in mistaking the true meaning of the works in question . The impression which the voluntary , unprejudiced reading of them produces upon most minds , is the fairest test of the real meaning and tendency of the books themselves . If then , there is no evidence but that good men are as common now as they ever were , here in our own land as any where else ; none but that some of them are met in the daily walks of life by each reader of religious biography , who yet does not recognize among his acquaintances anything approaching the character which he finds described in the books , then the conclusion is inevitable that the character set forth in the books is unreal . It is to be recognized by no one in real life , because it never had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He may indeed have shared in the delusion with which he imposes on his readers , actually believing that the subject of his memoir was so distinct from the rest of mankind , that a true picture of his course of life and motives of action , would exhibit a character unlike *iny other that ever existed . But he who estimates human nature upon so narrow a basis , is not fit to write biography . All experience and observation go to show that individuals of the most opposite tastes , opinions and habits , the more thoroughly they come to understand each other , will find the more particulars in which they think and feel alike . " As in water face answereth to face , so the heart of man to man . " Arid if the heart , out of which are the issues of life , then the life viewed apart from the hue and shaping derived from accidental circumstances , must answer to the life . The more truly and minutely the character , the modes of thought , the principles of action , peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected narrative , the more numerous will be the points of similarity that can be traced between the history of his heart and that of our own , and of the hearts of those whom ive are meeting every day . And biographers are not , as many seem to suppose , faithful to their work , in proportion as they make the subject of their narrative appear unlike any other individual that lives or ever has lived . On the other hand , the more the Christian reader finds , in such books , which seems to him to lie without or above the limited circle of his own experience , and which seems wonderful and inexplicable , when judged according to his own plain practical notions of human life and duty , the more reason he has to distrust their veracity , and to guard himself against adopting their false and fanciful view of Christian character and experience instead of // his own more correct and intelligible one . Our life , though pressing us onward continually toward the most awful and inevitable issues , is yet , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair , and it is very much the same to us all . And he who describes it most truly as the experieuce of a single individual , will describe it most truly , as experienced by all . But not so seem to think many of our biographers . They are ever striving after scenes and crises , extraordinary provideuces and ineffable experiences . And the inevitable impression made upon the mind of the unsuspecting Christian reader is , that these , whose lives are thus commemorated , were all extraordinary personages , and were placed in extraordinary circumstances . And the deplorable evil consequent upon the fact that the great mass of readers receive such an impression from the perusal of these books is , that they are led to think that in order to do good or even to be good , themselves , in their Master 's service on earth , they must also have these extraordinary circumstances surrounding bern , these unspeakable emotions swelling in their hearts . And in this false impression , as to the real lives of the most faithfril , there lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing Christians , in the ordinary *valks of life , to a right understanding and appreciation of their own importance an ! 1 capacities for effecting good . The false coloring given to Christian conduct and experience in these books , which furnish more examples and probably exert more influence than all others , leads their readers constantly to be governed by the feeling that they are surrounded by no such circumstances , they can recognize in themselves no such experience and therefore they must first be placed in some extraordinary position , or must have some peculiar inward intimation of their duty and the means of performing it , before they can hope to accomplish anything in their Master 's service . Thus they lose sight of the great fact that the Christian life , in all its essential and effective characteristics , is the same every where and to all ; and that to do so great good as that angels shall rejoice over its accomplishment , and memorials of it shall be kept in heaven for eternity , no one need go beyond the boundaries of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or supernatural impulses , than the simple , intelligent and unalterable determination to obey God 's will . And when biographers , laying aside their striving after effect , imitating the simple and truthful style of the evangelists , are willing to describe the lives of deceased saints as they were , all their readers must have this only true and salutary conclusion pressed honie upon their hearts . This principle , if duly regarded , would indeed take away from many a biographer much which lends the chief interest and fascination to his work . But what has he to do more than to de // scribe things as they are ? If he can not make truth , in her own simple and common attire , both attractive and instructive , let hint beware how he calls to his aid the pictures of fancy or the exaggerations of enthusiasm , to clothe her with unseemly and deceptive ornament . The artist who exhibits more of his own ideal of nature than of nature herself , in his delineations , could afford us little satisfaction , however beautiful the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a friend , or a landscape of the home of our youth . It is the truth , the reality , even as it appears to common , uninstructed observation , that we then demand , and not merely a beautiful picture , through the superadded coloring of which , the most familiar friend can scarcely recognize the known countenance or the actual scene . It may also occur to some , that so rigid an adherence to what is definitely known , in writing biography , would diminish to an alarming degree , the bulk of many that are already written , and would wholly take away the occasion of writing others still more numerous . That is precisely what is to be desired . We do not so much need more biographies as we do more truth in those that are written . And if the writer who is intending such a work finds that he must depend upon his own invention for a great part of the materials , he may be sure that he had better either not write it at all , or so entitle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified where it belongs , among works of the imagination . The religious biography should so describe characters that it shall be best recognized by them that know it best in real life . It would not be difficult to name at a breath , some half dozen widely circulated and most influential works of this description , in which this most essential requisite is by no means attained . The consequence is , the books are least trusted and respected by those who know the subjects of the memoirs best . And other readers still , who have once followed with eager admiration the course of life traced out by the enthusiastic biographer , happen not uuifrequently afterward to meet with some one who knew the individual as he lived , and they are ready to regard it as one of their happiest days , because they hope to have all their previous impressions confirmed by the testimony of a living witness , *and to learn more of the life of one whose memorial they have loved , and whose example they have striven to imitate . But how are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint , only describe him to have been " as one of us . " How much is their faith in all biography shaken , when they learn from personal acquaintances of the departed , incidents utterly inconsistent with the whole spirit and tenor of the written memoir . How are they astonished to learn that the surviving neighbors of the model Christian , his townsmen or his associates in the same p ' *-suits , who could have seen his superiority above the petty colhis // ions of personal interest , if he had it , can all relate instances of conduct , or describe confirmed habits , no hint of which has been given in the published biography , and which , as soon as known , must necessarily change the whole previously formed estimate of the much admired character . Such things are occurring contin iially . And the natural result is , that one who has read admiringly many biographies in early life , arid afterward has the opportunity to visit the places where the deceased lived , and where their acquaintances still live , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must entertain towards the books themselves little less than a positive aversion . And it will riot be through any safeguard furnished by the false biographer , if his reader , in losing faith in the fidelity of narratives purporting to give impartial exhibitions of the Christian life as led by individuals , do not also lose his confidence in the reality of the Christian life itself . A natural consequence of these partial and essentially false delineations of Christian character is , that we hear many intelligent persons say , " I have done reading biographies . They are so invariably false , that the pleasure of looking at a fair picture , will but poorly compensate for the subsequent vexation of finding , on independent inquiry , that it had very little foundation in truth . " And it must be admitted that there is some reason for their saying so . The memoir of the eloquent preacher and the ardent Christian , would make it seem that his life was all one unabated glow of love to God and man . how much it tends to impair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professions , that they afterwards learn , in some incidental way , from those who met the subject of the memoir in daily life , that he was cold and repulsive to his brethren ; that the ardor of his devotion and the spirituality of his conversation and his written reflections , had much to do with an extraordinary nervous excitability , and that the mind , which seemed to rise and soar with an an gel 's wing to the comprehension of things eternal and invisible , found its favorite arid constantly demanded stimulus , in tIie reading of extravagant and romantic fictions . rrhe character of another is set forth , by the not less eloquent biographer , as if The book had been all penned under the impression derived from some one impassioned appeal of the preacher himself weeping over the madness and the contemplated ruin of abandoned souls , or expatiating on the riches of redeeming love , over the emblems of the broken body and the shed blood . How it jars upon the feelings of the reader , who has any sensibility , to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household , which should be a holier place than any public sanctuary , the countenance of that servant of God habitually exhibited looks of fretfulness and displeasure ; that his voice publicly so eloquent in inculcating the // graces of meekness and gentleness and love , could yet , in the retirement of his own home , give utterance to tones and words of impatience and complaint , that were as daggers to the heart that never ceased from its anxiety to provide for his slightest gratification . rphe missionary wife dies in a foreign land . A bereaved and indulgent m*urner , with weeping eye and sorrowing heart , gathers up the correspondence , selects from the journal , tasks conjointly memory and invention , to find incidents in the early life of the deceased , and these , with a proportionate amount of eulogy and " practical observation , " fnrnish forth the volume of memoirs for which the appetite of a Christian public has been stimulated in advance . And then , when it falls into the hands of those who knew her in early life and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sabbath school and the sanctuary , and they find her represented to have been an extraordinary person in all these relations , one whose piety and Christian activity were worthy of all imitation , and yet they can not remember any thing from their acquaintance with her which showed her to be , in any noticeable particulars , superior , if indeed equal , to hundreds of other unknown , unpretending Christian women , faithful in their households and in their hearts , if not in heathen lands women who , when associated with the deceased missionary in the same circumstances , quite as constantly exhibited all Christian graces in their conduct as she , and yet whose memoirs will never be written when they are dead-when many readers see such representations and make such comparisons , one of two consequences will inevitably be the result . Either their own confidence in the truth of all religious biography will be shaken ; and when they are questioned as to their acquaintance with the deceased , by those who have read the memoir , but never saw the subject of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner as to produce the same effect upon the minds of those other readers also ; and thus , so far as they are concerned , the book will tend , not only to impair the confidence of Christian readers in memoirs as such , but to make others suspect that there is no reality in religion itself . Or , when personal respect or the biographer forbids the acquaintances of the deceased to distrust the delineation given in the memoir , a different yet equally undesirable , result will spring from the overdrawn representation , so unlike the sober and practical estimate formed of the character by those who saw its growth and development in real life . They will be ready to say to themselves and others- " This then is the life of one of the excellent of the earth . Here we have a model character , by equalling which we ourselves shall be associated with those of whom the world is not worthy . Here we are given to understand by the aid of a living example , Vhat is // meant when we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as scarcely an intimation is afforded in the volume that this one fell short of that high standard . But we have been personal witnesses to the development of this character , and to the kind of outward action to which it prompted . And , really , if that was all that is meant by the highest style of Christian excellence , fullness of consecration to the Redeemer , we can not be so far short of it ourselves as we feared . If to equal this one in the devotion of the whole soul to the one great object of the Christian 's life , be all that is required , in order that , when we are dead , we may be justly eulogized to the highest degree , and commemorated in the hearts of thousands of believers for ages to come , it is not so much of an affair after all . We never aspired to the formation of a character that should deserve more commendation than is conferred upon this one , and we certainly can not see ourselves and many others very far behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we may safely spare ourselves some of our intended exertions . Religion does not re ( juire so much effort and self-denial as we thought it did . " Such must be the impression produced upon many minds , by reading such biographies as have been described , and of which not a few are in extensive circulation . And if the authors of this class of works would not have them fruitful in such results , they must take care and not so write , that their readers , in order to trust them , must know nothing of the character described , excepting what the books contain . The biographer , in estimating character and motives , should be careful to give the reader facts sufficient to sustain his own impressions and conclusions . It is of very little importance toward instructing and improving the world , that a writer has an impression that his deceased friend possessed very great talents , unless those talents had been exhibited in effective action , or that he was a very devout Christian , unless his piety had displayed itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and partial estimates of friends , that the disinterested world will recognize the embodiment of a living example . If there are no significant facts to be recorded , there is no biography to be written . Let friends cherish the memory of the departed*affectionately and gratefully , if they have reason to do so . But unless they can record something more than their own disappointed anticipations , let them not write a book . It is of little consequence to others what they think of their lamented friend unless they can show the disinterested reader facts and proofs to make him think so too . We wish to know , not what fond relatives and accinaintances hoped he would be , but what he was . It is in consequence of the violation of this principle , that we have so many volumes of biography , which give us little else // than the random thoughts and impressions of the writer . There is nothing told , because there was nothing to tell . Endeavor to learn from such a book what its subject did , how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and , on such an inquiry , we find very little reliable information . Yet there may be no want of reiterated and declamatory assertion on the part of the writer . The departed friend is held up as an example , perhaps of humility  --  and what is the proof that he possessed it ? Not any one course of conduct , not any one act , the meaning of which all could understand . The biographer only says he was humble , as he introduces and comments upon , a quotation from his friend 's conversation or correspondence or journal , in which he speaks disparagingly of himself . And who that ever ventured to write a diary of his own experience , or to talk much of it , did not speak disparagingly of himself ? He is commended , perhaps , for his activity in the cause of truth and benevolence . We ask what he actually effected in it  --  and we get no answer , uI ) less it be , that the ways of Providence are mysterious , permitting some to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to toil in vain . He may be held up as a pattern of self-denial , and yet the instances in which he deprived himself of personal comforts and enjoyments for the sake of others , are not given . And if proofs of these and similar representations are not given , it is fair to presume that they could not be . And if they could not be , then certainly the biography should not have been written . For when we are endeavoring to learn something of the life of one whom we have never seen , we want not the impressions or conclusions of his friend . If we can be told what he did , that is of far more consequence than any thing that his biographer may say that he could do . Facts , when properly arranged and clearly stated , are the best reasons , as well as the most impressive teachers . And when the intending writer of history or biography , feels obliged to apologize to the reader in the onset for the want of incident in his narrative , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be , a sermon or an essay , and then his readers will not need his apology . We have already , for half a century , been having something too much of the philosophy of history , to the neglect as well as in defiance of the facts of history . And it would be still worse if the present course were to go on , till we have the philosophy of biography also . A philosophy of life in general , appareled in a tissue of mystically woven abstractions , with here and there a luminous shred of intelligibility running through them , may amuse or suggest , if it does not instruct . Its misty film of generalization may serve to induce the belief that there is profundity beneath . But he who writes biography as if he were attempting the philosophy of an individual life , must necessarily subject his fancied abstrac // tions so often to the test of reality , as to show how very flat , stale , and unprofitable , is all his stilted speculation , compared with simple fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his general conclusions with caution , under many limitations , if not in many cases with hesitancy or positive distrust . He must constantly deal with character , with motives , the real nature of which he can not by any means fully ascertain . And hence we have said without qualification , that to write any thing , which shall be , in the fullest sense , a life of a human being , is impossible . What individual ever lived , with character enough to tempt any one to write his biography , who , while living , would have admitted that any other person , however familiarly acquainted with him , knew him as he was in his inmost soul , or understood his complicated motives , and his prevailing habits of mind . And if no such human being while living , ever found a person , friendly or hostile , interested or disinterested , able so to describe his character and motives , that he could even recognize the likeness ; then how is it , that a biographer , without having seen the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correcting a wrong judgment , may yet speak with the utmost assurance of the feelings , motives , principles of action of the deceased , and may make an estimate of his life and character which the world must receive as correct and complete ? Let any reader , whose eye falls upon this page , pause and consider for a moment whether there is any person living who can so describe him as he is , irrespective of dates , names , places ; so describe him , in his disposition , motives and habits of thought , that he would be able even imperfectly to recognize himself in the description . If the reader will do so , he will readily see how much of the fine spun analysis of character found in biographies , must be referred to the imagination of the writers . And yet difficult as the task must be , to analyze and trace out motives correctly in any case , even with the actors before us face to face , the world does not want for biographers who will attempt it , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is amazing that those who undertake such a task , are not constrained to qualify their broad assertions in describing character and assigning motives , when they remember that most of them must be made in the face of many probabilities to the contrary , , and that few of them can be sustained by any thing like definite proof . It is amazing , with what selfcomplacency , and profusion , they can deal out their eulogetic epithets , when a just and intelligent and unqualified application of one of them , would require such a knowledge of another mind as it is not possible for any one to possess . " For what man knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? " // Not that we would maintain in this indirect manner , that the biographer must absolutely know every thing about which he writes or expresses an opinion . But in estimating the character and motives of any one , especially of one dead , let him use , at least as much caution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing judgment upon himself . Let him suppose himself reading his memoir aloud , in the hearing of the one whose life is commemorated , and then blot out every line of eulogy or censure , assumption or conjecture , which would put him to the blush , if subjected to such an ordeal . Let him make less use of positive and vehement assertion , either for censure or commendation . He would do well , often to have in mind , the conclusion adopted by the stern old Puritan preacher , near the close of a long life ,  --  " Good men are not as good , and bad men are not as bad , as they are represented . " Less effort to make men either angels or devils , would make biographers more trustworthy and instructive to religious biography of the day , might be extended to a much greater length . But our limits only allow us to insist , that these strictures shall be understood to have been made , not merely in the fault-finding spirit of the professional censor , but rather in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety of the day , both in its inxvard experience and outward manifestation , must be governed very much by the religious biography which is in circulation . And if the exhibitions of character and of principle , found in works of this class , are materially wrong in many respects , it is of as much consequence to attempt to check the multiplication of such errors , and to guard readers against those already issued beyond recall , as it can be , to attempt to make the great body of those who stand for the exemplification and diffusion of the gospel , devout yet intelligent in their piety , earnest yet judicious in their efforts , and rigid yet unostentatious in their self-denial for the cause of the Divine Master.
