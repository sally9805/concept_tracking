txt THE Scandinavian peninsula , including the countries of Sweden and Norway , is for several reasons one of the most deeply interesting portions of the world . To the geologist it presents a specimen , on the laEgest scale , of what the hidden inner forces of the earth can gradually accomplish . Once , it would appear , the sea covered a large part of Sweden , Finland , and northern Russia , and the mountains which divide Sweden from Norway formed a lofty island . But however this may be , it seems from indications on both sides of the peninsula , that the land is rising , being slowly upheaved by a subterranean force that grows less as you go north ; shells of the same kinds with those now found in the sea , occur in beds sixty feet above the water in Norway ; and the depth of the gulf of Bothnia has long been known to be decreasing , owing probably to the rise of the bottom . Nor is this region less interesting , especially on the western coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Residence in Nor . way . 1837 . ( Second edition . ) Laing 's Tour in Sweden , in 1838,1839 .

When you have found your way to the coast , you discover it to be of solid primitive rock , but every where penetrated by fords or friths , some of which run many miles up into the country . These fords are said to be deeper towards the interior than where they touch the ocean , and could have been formed by no stream at their heads , for in most cases there is not back country enough to furnish the water which would be required to form the various branches and coves of the fords that pierce at different angles into the rock . The fiord of Drontheim is above one hundred miles long , and from three to twelve broad , while one of its branches runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high land which divides the peninsula . Of the smaller coves Mr. Laing thus speaks . " The hills of primary rock in some places run out into promontories , which dip into the fiord . To scramble up and down these is not work for an alderman ; when one does , however , get over the keel of such a ridge , he sees a quiet beautiful scene below . The little landlocked // bay is so shut in with rocks and woods , that it resembles a small mountain lake . The entrance is hid by trees ; and the mark of high water on the white beach at the head of the cove is the only indication that it belongs to the ocean . There is generally room at its head for one fishing farmer , with his house at the foot of the rocks , a green spot for his cows and goats , and his little skiff at anchor before his door ; where the lucky fellow , without ever knoxving what a seastorm is , or going out of sight of his own chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beneath the shadow of the rocky forest that surrounds him . " Having passed one of these flords , or traced its branches up to their heads , you reach a stream running usually through a deep and often very romantic valley , and dependent for its water on the snows and lakes of the Fielde . This word , of the same origin and meaning with our fell , denotes a high rocky tableland , which under various names pursues a course nearly parallel with the western coast , and from which mountains arise even to the height of over seven thousand feet . On the east of the Fielde is to be found the longest and most populous of the valleys of Norway , called Guldebrandsdal , lying upon the Myosen Lake , and its principal tributary , as well as upon the stream by which it is united with the river Glommen . On the west side of the Fielde , the streams and valleys are generally short , owing to the nearness of the ridge to the ocean . Along these valleys , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Norway , engaged in trade and fishery , or earning their subsistence from a rocky soil , under a climate less severe indeed than that of the same parallel in Sweden , but still one which tempers the long and tedious winter with only three or four months of warmer weather . The soil is favorable for grass , bear ( a kind of grain like barley , ) and potatoes ; but grain is not raised in sufficient quantities to supply the wants of the inhabitants . But the history and present condition of the people of Norway , are the strongest claim which this country has upon our interest . In some respects , it is true , they are eclipsed by the other nations of the same stock . They can show in modern times no Gustavus Vasa , the deliverer of his country from foreign oppression and the papal yoke ; no Gustavus Adoiphus , who was raised up to preserve the Protestant powers of central Europe from extinction ; they have no naturalists to tell of like those of Sweden ; no poets , sculptors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Iceland , the distant colony of Norway , in a frozen sea , has a far richer literature than the mother country , and has preserved the language and the heathen traditions of the olden time , which were changed or obliterated on the continent . But few histories are more remarkable than that of Norway , during its heroic age , in the tenth and eleventh centuries . That this wintry land should have sent forth the boldest of adventurers in every direction , some to people Iceland , and plant in it institutions of an admirable kind ; others to possess half England , the islands of Scotland , and even parts of Ireland ; others still to conquer the northwest of France , to penetrate into th Mediterranean , and obtain the ascendency in the two Sicilies , while others formed the guard of the emperors of Constantinople ; that these long known historical facts should have occurred , is certainly far more surprising than that captains from Norway and Iceland reached the shores of this western world , and possibly left their record upon Dighton Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading facts in the history of Norway , with a view to make more intelligible its political state at the present time  --  a point of great interest , to which we shall devote the main part of this article . Norway , from being under the government of Denmark , one of the most despotic countries of Europe , became in 1815 , and has continued since , to be the freest monarchy in the world . How did this come about ? Is the social condition of the nation such , that this , freedom can be used aright and can prove a blessing ? What are the leading provisions of the constitution of 1815 ; how does it work in hands unused to legislation ; and are the historical circumstances under which the liberty of this people grew up such as to insure it health and vigor ? ' These are questions , so interesting in themselves , so especially interesting to us , that they may well delay us for a while ; nor ought we to feel much abatement of our interest , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not twelve millions , but only twelve hundred thousand . In the annals of our own country , some of the smaller states have a history to which we turn with far more interest than to the larger ; and in the same way some of the minor nations of Europe , such as the Norse , Scotch , and Swiss , stand for most that attracts the philosophical student of history above the greatest . It is institutions , civil , social , and political , and the means by which they arose , , that ought to claim our attention far sooner than battles , and lines of kings , and confederations , to keep the balance of power in Europe . Nay , it is institutions that in the end prevail , make feeble nations mighty and influential in the world 's history , gain silent battles over oppressive neighbors , keep liberty alive amid fear , and make one man in some places have more of power and of manliness in him than a hundred men in others . It is unnecessary here to trace the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of the Euxine , or further east , to their migration into Germany and Scandinavia , and their separation into three states under the government of divinely descended kings . They are supposed to have passed into the peninsula before the Christian era . We will leap over the interval between their earliest history and the tenth century , and first stop at the reign of Harold haarfagr , ( or fair-haired , ) a man who had much to do in shaping the future history of Norway . Soon after he ascended the throne , a contest began with the petty kings , or chiefs , who had left the sovereign little more than nominal power . This contest had important results , both for other countries and for Norway itself . The defeated chiefs , unwilling to live longer at home with their power abridged , sought new abodes abroad ; and thus Normandy and Iceland received their Norwegian inhabitants . The annihilation of their power united the nation under one head , and prevented , as it seems probable , the feudal system from striking deep roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , held their lands of no superior ; the old custom of transmitting estates to all the heirs was not superseded by a law or custom of primogeniture ; no greedy nobility encroached upon the rights of the peasants ; and the assembly of the people seems to have been as efficient in legislation , and in electing the monarch , as that of the nobles . Until this time nothing was known of Christianity , except here and there by some pirate who had seen its forms in the lands he had ravaged , or had learned something of it from his captives . In the reign of Harold 's second son , Hakon the // Good , who had been brought up at the Anglo-Saxon court , the first serious attempts were made to introduce the Christian faith . But the people showed their free spirit in the violent opposition which they made to the religious innovations . At an assembly in 956 , a peasant named Asbiorn ( Osborn , ) arose and said , " that they had chosen Hakon to be their king on condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that if the king tried to suppress their ancient faith , they would have another in his place . " Hakon yielded to the popular feeling , and even went so far as to eat horse-flesh , which , as a habit of the worshipers of Wodin , was an abomination to the Christians . His dissimulation saved him perhaps from some insurrections of the heathen party ; but he lived with a wounded conscience , and at his death wished to be buried without Christian rites , in token that he had lived as a heathen , and ought to be treated as one . From this time Christianity , by slow degrees , prevailed over the old superstition . Yet in 1030 , King Olaf the Saint , as he is called , having attempted to spread it by violent and wrongful means , found his chieftains in consequence deserting him to follow the standard of Canute the Great , who had invaded the country . He fled for refuge to foreign parts , and on his return with an army to regain his kingdom , was met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of the country having been cemented before the political influence of Christianity , such as it then was , began to be felt , that potent cause had little to do in modifying them or altering their strength . Norway was too poor a country for the worst effects of the unhealthy spiritual despotism of the middle ages to be produced there . The king had to be consecrated by the bishop of Drontheim , and for a time there was danger that the ecclesiastical power would control that of the civil ruler ; but there was nothing with which it could ally itself , and so grow to the height which it elsewhere reached ; for the nobility were too weak to strengthen it by their aid , and the mass of the people too independent not to side with the king against priestly domination . From the eleventh century , until the union of Denmark and Norway at the end of the fourteenth , the general aspect of Norwegian history is one of deep confusion , of invasion , revolt , and only momentary repose . The student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denmark , and of insurrections by pretenders to the crown , except that the nation would have been far happier had an unalterable rule of succession been earlier fixed , instead of resorting to the hazardous method of election . Toward the end of the thirteenth century , Magnus VI . derived his name of lagabceter , or law-mender , from his revision of the ancient laws and customs ; and it is this code which now forms the groundwork of Norwegian jurisprudence . The union with Denmark continued for more than four centuries , during which period Norway has no independent history . Although Denmark became a despotism , the union did not involve the introduction of despotic principles into Norway . The Danish kings , Christian IV , in 1604 , and Christian V , in 1687 , gave out new codes for their Norwegian subjects ; but the old principles , and particularly the trial by jury , were undisturbed . This code , says Mr. Laing , " comprised in one pocket volume , is to be found in every peasant 's house in Norway . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single paragraph of a few lines . The professional lawyer only can be acquainted with the numerous modifications and additions to this body of // law , by subsequent enactments , or with the application of the law to special cases ; but generally , no man in Norway can be ignorant of the laws affecting his property , or of his legal rights or duties . " This is a great deal to say of any nation on earth ; and if the half of it is true of half the citizens , we should estimate highly their intelligence and knowledge . Denmark , having thus conferred on Norway the great blessing of leaving its antefeudal institutions alone , might long have retained it in willing union , have fed poor Danish nobles with its offices , and have sent into it the higher refinement and arts of Copenhagen , but for the unfortunate and faithful alliance which this northern court formed with Bonaparte . After the destruction of one fleet by the English in 1799 , and the seizure of another in 1807 , without declaration of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any warm affection for the liberators of Europe , whom they must have regarded much in the light of pirates . But a third wrong was to be added . In order to induce Sweden and its crown-prince , late a French marshal under Bonaparte , to join the anti-gallican alliance , so large a bribe as the whole of Norway was held out to them . Sweden accordingly aided in procuring the downfall of Bonaparte , while Denmark very honorably and naturally sided with him until the battle of Leipzig had decided his fate , and her own territory was attacked by superior enemies . At the peace of Kid , ( January 14 , 1814 , ) the Danish king renounced the possession of Norway , and the Swedish king assured to that country the full possession of its rights and immunities . But no one had asked the consent of Norway , a weak but independent state , to this arrangement ; and the people felt as if it was time for their voice to be heard . By the re nunciation of the Danish king , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath or stipulation could longer confirm ties that had been broken without their agency . They accordingly chose Christian Frederic , heir to the Danish crown , and then governor of Norway , as their sovereign , formed the constitution which still subsists , and prepared to maintain their position against Sweden and the rest of the allied powers . But their king deserted them , giving up prerogatives which he could not maintain ; and in this dilemma they consented to the union with Sweden , on condition that Norway should be a distinct kingdom , and its constitution be preserved . The king of Sweden took the oath to support the constitution ; it has the guaranty of the allied powers ; and thus it may be said to have a double legitimacy , for on the one hand it was made by the representatives of the nation , the legitimate fountain of power , and on the other it has all that derived and sacred legitimacy which the holy alliance could give it . It is like , in this respect , to a minister who should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either should be invalid , he might by the other trace back to the true source of clerical authority . This constitution , it is said , was framed in a hurry ; but it ought to be taken into account that its framers , who were the most intelligent men of Norway , had all the models of later times before them , and in a part of their work naturally adopted the old institutions of the country for their guide . They began , therefore , almost where the constitution-mongers of France and Spain left off . Accordingly , if the constitution might in some respects be improved , on the whole it must commend itself to the friend of freedom ; it carries with it the attachment of the people , and bids fair to last until foreign violence shall destroy it . // The legislative assembly , called the Storthing , ( great thing or diet , ) must consist of between seventyfive and one hundred members , and is chosen by natives who have been owners or life-renters of taxable land for five years , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate to the value of one hundred and fifty dollars . The voters being registered and arranged in districts , assemble every third year to choose an intermediate body of electors , to whom the choice of representatives is confided . It would take up too much room to give the particular regulations touching the choice of these bodies . Suffice it to say that the system is so adjusted , that the towns shall have more than their share of representatives ; the ratio of those whom they elect , to those chosen by the country , being as one to two . It is a part of the plan also , that the election-districts shall return more or fewer representatives ; and thus provision is wisely made for the growth and decay of different portions of the country . The storthing meets , as a matter of course , every third year in February , and continues in session three months . If the king sees fit to call an extraordinary meeting , they convene every second or third year , but not otherwise ; and the acts passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assembling of the next regularly chosen storthing . In the ordinary meetings , every member can propose what business he pleases ; at the extraordinary , the king alone has the right of the initiative . The king can also dissolve the storthing , but not until after it has been three months in session . The storthing of 1836 was constituted , according to Mr. Laing , as follows : twenty-two were in civil , sixteen in clerical , three in military offices ; four were lawyers , fourteen merchants , and thirty-seven landowners , in all ninety-six ; and of these forty-five had sat in previous legislatures . When assembled , and afier the choice of a president , which choice is repeated every week , the storthing divides itself into two branches , one quarter of its number being chosen to form , in a certain sense , a separate house . In fact , by this method , a somewhat clumsy legislature of three houses is formed ; for all motions are made and discussed in the entire storthing , and being then brought into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives , are by them scat to the Lagthing , or upper house , consisting of one quarter . To this latter branch is entrusted the duty of deciding , in conjunction with the highest court of law , when the lower house impeaches ministers of state . The storthing is charged with being actuated by a narrow and parsimonious spirit , and also with extreme slowness in managing their business . The first of these chnrges may be , to a certain extent , true , and is believed by our countryman , Mr. Baird , who is disposed to take a very favorable view of Norway and its institutions . But it is so much more useful a fault , than to vote away thousands of dollars for the benefit of a king 's children , or his mistresses , as is done elsewhere , and withal so very much like the immemorial practice in our good state of Connecticut , that we can not find it in our hearts to blame the members for keeping tight hold of the public purse . And if , as will appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improvement under the storthing , if the nation has gone faster forwards , in all that constitutes national prosperity , than its neighbors of the same stock ; then we may rationally conclude that it has the art of governing itself well , and needs none of that help which Swedish noblemen would no doubt be glad to give it . " Most of the judicious Norwe // gians are convinced , " says Mr. Muford , " that this storthing is too democratic in its construction , and that the machine , however well it may work in quiet times , will prove insufficient in the hour of need . " He then proceeds to say that the triennial assembling of the storthing is found inconvenient ; - which is very likely to be true , but it is an inconvenience easily remedied by the king , and by no means essential to the system ; - that the exclusion of members of the council of state , of public functionaries , and of persons salaried by the court , disqualifies for the legislative halls some of the best citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures , such as the equal division of property among children , and the abolition of hereditary distinctions , must sap the foundations of a limited monarchy . But if the order of nobility was nearly extinct in Norway , before the present constitution was formed , and if landed estates from time immemorial have not been confined to the oldest son , the legislature has only carried forward the measures which nature and history pointed out as wise and best . How unwise would it have been to prop up a decayed and nearly ruined nobility , which four centuries under Danish superintendence could not build up ; or to fight against old customs , and introduce entails and a right of primogeniture , which the nation in all its history , could never make to flourish upon its soil . As for the exclusion of official persons , even Mr. Laing , who is very much of a radical , is willing to think that the court might have some organ in the storthing , who could represent its views , if not vote . But the nation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous of executive interference , emanating as it does from Sweden , where different institutions prevail ; and to delay making concessions and alterations in the charter of its liberties , until that charter has acquired " the bone and gristle of manhood . " As for the Norwegian constitution being able to resist foreign force , we may safely trust it to the affections of the people . If it is regarded with pride and attachment , as it seems to be , nothing could tahe its place , with an equal chance of permanence . The most remarkable provisions of the Norwegian charter , in regard to the chief magistrate , are the restriction of his power over subordinate executive officers , and his qualified veto . Of the first , Mr. Laing , in his work on Sweden , published in 1839 , speaks as follows : " In Norway the public funetion* ry , from the lowest clerk to the highest dignitary , has his defined rights connecting him with the legislative , as much as his duties with the executive branch of the state ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court of law ; he can not even be removed from one locality to another , against his will ; his salary can not be diminished , and he has a legal claim to its augmentation , if his duties are increased ; he can not be passed over , at the pleasure of the executive , in his just turn for advancement . All vacancies in every department under government , must be advertised in the gazette , and all candidates must send in their claims to fill the vacancy , with the certificates of their len* , th of service , abilities , characters . All the grounds of claim are examined and judged of by the heads of the department , to which the vacant office belongs , and they recommend the candidates they find best entitled . But this recommendation is not left to the unchecked will and pleasure of the heads of the departments ; they must keep a regular protocol of the claims and certificates laid before them , and of their reasons for giving the preference to the candidate they recommend . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a committee au // dits , as it were , all appointments , checks even in the lowest offices , any injustice , favoritism , or nepotism , and makes its report to the storthing , which in case of any flagrantly unjust or corrupt appointment , would impeach the heads of the department before the rigsret court , a branch of the state , independent of the executive . The publicity also of all these protocols , makes public opinion a powerful check upon undue patronage , or private influence . " By this provision , the channels of executive influence are nearly dried up ; the king has no tools who fear being displaced , and who have the strongest selfish motives to propagate the doctrines of the court relative to public measures through the country . It may admit of doubt , whether the inferior functionaries should hold their offices during good behavior , or only for a term of years , with the privilege of reappointment ; but we envy the Norwegians , for being rid of that boundless profligacy with which the president 's power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be through all the changes of party , for the lowest ends-is flooding our country . The power of impeachment too is not likely to remain idle in Norway , if misdemeanors are brought to light ; for it is not likely that under the constitution , as it is , there can ever be a strong court party . There will be nothing then to shield a guilty officer from the indignant opinion of the country ; no prevailing party in the legislature , to take his crimes upon their shoulders , and sustain him against right and justice . The other principal restriction of the king 's power is , that he is invested with only a suspensive veto upon the decisions of the legislatLP'e . It has already been said that the storthing assembles triennially , on a certain day , and continues to sit a certain time , according to law , without any agency of the king in the matter . If he approves of the proceedings , they become valid ; if not , they are called up again at the next regular storthing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storthing passes the law again , it becomes valid , of course , whether the king gives or withholds his consent . Thus the executive veto consists in delaying legislative action , until the nation has time to look about it . Six years is certainly long enough for the reason of one man and his counselors , to retard the reason of a people , in its plans for the general good . This is , in reality , a greater degree of direct power over legislation , than is enjoyed in practice by the English sovereign ; for although the monarch in that country has a final and absolute veto on every act or bill carried through both houses of parliament , this right has gone into almost entire desuetude . The reason of this seems to be , in part , the responsibility of the ministers , who do all the wrong committed in the partnership between themselves and the king ; and in part , the fact that there have been other means of preventing unacceptable measures from becoming laws of the land . Were a minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings of parliament , it would undoubtedly prevent them from voting the supplies , and would procure his impeachment ; hut he has no need to do this , while safer ways lie before him ; he can on the one hand offer such motives to individual members , as those which Sir IRobert Walpole is charged with applying , to maintain his ascendency during his long ministry ; or he can dissolve the parliament , and try the virtue of a new election . But if unsuccessful here , he and his measures must give way to those of the opposition . On the whole , at present , the power of the monarch to obstruct the legislature in its course , // consists in little more than postponement , and trying the opinion of the country at the polls . In our own country , the views of the members of the federal convenlion upon this subject , were , as might be supposed , much divided at first . Hamilton* wished to give the executive an absolute negative on the laws . There was no danger , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised . The king of Great Britain had not exerted this power since the revolution . " Dr. Franklin , on the other hand , dreaded this check of the executive upon the legislature . His reasons were drawn from the experience of Penn . sylvania , when the proprietary governors had used such a power in the most scandalous manner . " The nw*ative of was conthe governor stantly used , to extort money . No good law whatever , could be passed , without a private bargain with him . An increase of his salary , or some donation , was always made a condition ; till at last it became the regular practice to have orders in his favor , on the treasury , presented , along with the bills to he signed , so that he might actually receive the former , before he should sign the latter . When the Indians were scalping the western people , and notice of it arrived , the concurrence of the governor , in the means of self-defense , could not be got , till it was agreed that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin , Roger Sherman agreed , expressing the opinion now so often heard , that no one man ought to stop the will of the whole . " No * See Madison Papers , II , 784 , seq . See Franklin 's flistoryofPennsylvania , Works , Vol . III , especially p. 371 . It is obvious that Franklin 's objections to the veto , are valid only in the case of such a miserable system as that of Pennsylvania , under the proprietary government , where , to use his own expression , ( n. s. p. 187 , ) every governor had two masters , one who gave him his commission , and another who gave him his pay . one man could be found , so far above all the rest in wisdom . He thought we ought to avail ourselves of his wisdom , in revising the laws , but not permit him to overrule the decided and cool opinions of the legislature . " Mr. Madison expressed the opinion , which finally prevailed , that " if a proper proportion of each branch should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would answer the same purpose as an absolute negative . It would rarely , if ever , happen that the executive , constituted as ours is proposed to be , would have firmness enough to resist the legislature , unless backed by a certain part of the body itself . " And to cite the opinion of but one member more , Mr. Butler , ( of South Carolina , ) said , " he had been in favor of a single executive magistrate , but could he have entertained an idea that a complete negative on the laws was to be given him , he would have acted very differently . It had been observed that in all countries the executive power is in a constant course of increase . " The convention afterwards , with unanimity , decided upon two thirds as the number in each house , necessary to overrule the dissent of the president . This number was , however , altered into three fourths , but was again and finally preferred . The reasons for the double change of opinion , may be gathered from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " When three fourths was agreed to , the president was to be elected by the legislature , and for seven years . He is now to be elected by the people , and for four years . The object of the revisionary power is twofold ; first , to defend the executive rights ; secondly , to prevent popular or factious injustice . It was an important principle in this and in the state constitutions , to check legislative injustice // and encroachments . The experience of the states had demonstrated that their checks are insufficient . XVe must compare the danger from the weakness of two thirds , with the danger from the strength of three fourths . He thought , on the whole , the former was greater . " A statesman might certainly waver on so nice a point as that of requiring one twelfth , more or less , of the legislature to carry a measure , against the will of the chief magistrate . Two thirds prevailed at this time against three fourths , by a small majority , and in opposition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the reasons for the veto as it stands , very briefly and clearly as follows . " The primary inducement to conferring the power in question upon the executive , is to enable him to defend himself ; the secondary is to increase the chances in favor of the community , against the passing of bad laws , through haste , inadvertence , or design . " This latter reason is a good one , and sufficient to vindicate some kind of executive negative against disappointed and angry partisans . But it may be doubted whether the fears entertained by the convention , that the legislative would crush the executive branch , have not been proved false , by experience . The president 's power has , indirectly at least , much advanced in more ways than one . And if the legislature , as such , irrespective of the parties of the moment , were at war with the executive , no doubt the difference between a majority and two thirds , in carrying measures against the president , would be but a feeble bulwark for his defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of the veto introduced into the charter of Norway , although the framers of our constitution seem not to have * No. 73. taken it into consideration , has not some advantages over the form which we have adopted . If the provision were such , that the president 's negative suspended a measure until the next congress , that is , until the sense of the country , after one or two years of postponement , should be taken by means of new elections ; and if then the majority of congress could pass such a measure , even without the chief magistrate 's sanction , we think all specious objections against the vetopower would be removed : the issue between the president and the legislature , would be settled by the country ; while hasty legislation on the part , it may be , of a minority in the country , represented accidentally by a majority in congress , would be prevented . The veto is not to be regarded so much a l ) *OP of executive authority , as it is a protection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norway , the constitution was yet green , when a difference of opinion on a very important point , arose between the storthiug and the king , which led to the first exercise of the suspensive veto . We have already said that an order of nobility was a feeble and sickly plant on this free soil . " The remains of this class , " says Mr. Laing , " were of foreign , and almost all of very recent origin , and with few exceptions , had no property to maintain a dignified station in society . Owing to the law of the division of the land among the children , large estates entailed upon the possessor of the family title , could not exist ; and a body of titled and privileged persons , could only subsist as place-men or pensioners . " It was not strange , then , nor in reality an innovation , if the storthing wished to remove an Unnational institution  --  a withering excrescence in their system . This was first attempted in 1815 , and again after two vetoes , in 1818 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobility became the law of the land . But before the final passage of the law , every means was used to induce the storthing to abandon it . The king repaired in person to Christiania , the capital , and six thousand troops were marched near the city , as if in preparation for the worst of measures* At this time the Russian minister at Stockholm , and our own charge there , appeared unexpectedly at Christiania , and the steps of the government in overawing the storthing , were retraced . An impression prevailed , that these two envoys had interfered in behalf of the constitutional liberties of Norway , and prevented any desperate measures on the part of the king and his foolish Sxvedish counselors . There were in 1841 , according to Mr. Milford , only three barons left in Norway , and these so far from having respect shown to them for their rank , are exposed to ridicule from the feebleness and unpopularity of their order . Mr. Baird speaks of another measure of great importance , which after two vetoes was to be acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a determination , " says he , " on the part of the storthing , or parliament or Norway , to give to the people more religious liberty . A law has been passed twice in that body , we are informed , to take away from the government the appointment of pastors and assistants , and give it to the churches , parishes . Twice has this law been passed , and twice has it been vetoed by the king . Should it pass at the next meeting of the storthing , of which there is every prospect , it will become a law of the land . This will be a great point gained . But this is not all . A bill has been twice passed in the storthing-we believe it forms a supplement of the bill of which we have just spoken-which allows the holding of meetings in private houses , or elsewhere , for religious services , without the permission or intervention of any civil authority . " The opposition of the storthing to the king 's will is far from being factious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they have made up their minds for any course , they are no more easily deterred than their fathers were from pouring upon the coasts of England and France , or ploughing the stormy sea toward Iceland . An instance of their setness occurred in 1837 , which is worthy of mention . The regular storthing of the preceding year had been dissolved in the midst of unfinished business , and the jealousy of members was roused lest some violence might be offered to the constitution . It became necessary to call an extraordinary meeting the next year , in order to proceed with the interrupted public business , and the members returned , as might be supposed , somewhat irritated against the government . The only notice they took of the dissolution was , that they resumed every branch of business under the same committees , exactly where it had been broken off the year before ; and that they unanimously impeached the minister of state for Norwegian affairs at Stockholm , for not protesting against the dissolution , as had been done by the two other councilors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This officer was tried and fined as guilty of neglect of duty , rather to warn the executive of what might be done at another time , than for the sake of punishment or resentment. * It is a happy circumstance for Norway , that the king is such as he is . He has risen from the ranks of the untitled people , and was ac * Laing 's Sweden , p. 339 , scq. * At the time of the union of Sweden and Norway , it was stipulatod that no troops of either country should approach within three miles Swedish , of the place where the storthing should assemble . // customed , in Mr. Laing 's homely phrase , to draw on his own hoots and breeches in his youth without the help of a servant . He had no higher or older title on any ground to royalty than they to their liberties ; and belonged to no line of kings , which having parted in troublous times with their prerogatives , would always wish and hope to recover them . He was not so connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the Norwegians would associate his name or history with the country of their aversion more than with their own . His vast possessions render it unnecessary for him to be forever petitioning the storthing for great sums of money on his own account or his children 's . His personal character is good , and the people are said to love him . Whatever opposition he has offered to the measures of the legislature is imputed to his Swedish advisers , or to unavoidable ignorance of the state of the country . He may look on Norway as a possible refuge for his family ; for the time may come , as Mr. Laing suggests , when the Swedish nobility , who have made and unmade a number of kings , may see fit to restore the house of Vasa to the throne of that kingdom . We have room for only a few words upon the judicial system of Norway . This system does not appear to have changed in its leading features since the Northmen became known to history . An early law-book , composed in Iceland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the colonization of that island , testifies to the mature state of law and justice among this people at so early a period . Norway has enjoyed for many centuries the institution of trial hy jury ; and some persons , as Mr. Laing , are disposed to refer the origin of juries in England to this source . There is , however , reason to believe that it had a broader founda tion in the antefeudal customs of all the rreutonic and Scandinavian tribes. * The union with Denmark produced some improvements , but no important changes in the system ; and the new constitution thus found ancient judicial institutions to which the people were used , and which favored civil liberty , in full vigor . The lowest court is of Danish creation , and is called the court of mutual agreement . In every parish an arbitrator , who must not be a man of the law , is triennially elected , and holds his court , assisted by a clerk , once a month . Here every lawsuit must begin , and no lawyer is allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an agreement , the proceedings are carried up to the next court to be sanctioned , revised if necessary , and registered . If no agreement is effected , either party may appeal ; but in case the judge approves the arbitrator 's award , the appellant must pay the expenses of both parties in the suit . At this first , or arbitrator 's court , the parties must have their wits about them , for a record or statement of the case is there made up , according to their opposite accounts , for the higher court ; and no new matter or evidence , if Mr. Laing is rightly informed , can be introduced at any future stage of the proceedings . Mr. Laing praises this method of keeping lawyers away from the commencement of a quarrel , but we can not share the admiration which he expresses . The result must be either that a crafty subtle man , opposed to a simple-hearted one , will , by his superior ingenuity , give that aspect to the case which it must have ever afterwards ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the privy counselors of both parties . Much is said of the power of lawyers to cloud the // truth and wrest evidence ; but there are no such differences in ability between the members of this profession as there may be between the parties in a litigation . The intervention then of lawyers puts the parties on the whole more nearly on a level , and hence is better for the cause of justice than if they were their own advocates . The lowest court of law , properly speaking , is the sorensk river 's , or sworn scribe 's court . This officer is appointed , but can not be displaced , by the government ; and must be an educated lawyer . The country is divided into sixty-four districts , to each of which such a judge is given , and he is required to hold his court in every parish of his district at least once a quarter . The attributes of this judge answer in part to those of our justices of the peace , in part to those of judges of probate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like justices of the peace ; in others , he acts in conjunction with a jury of eight men , annually appointed by the amtmann , or head-officer of the province , from the tax-payers of the parishes , who must be taken in the order in which they stand on the lists . This standing jury and the sorensk river , when the case has been heard , vote together , and a majority of voices determines the result . The court of appeal from the sorensk river 's , is that of the province , of which there are four for the whole kingdom , each presided over by three judges and their assessors . In all criminal trials the proceedings of the court below must be examined and approved by this court before they can be carried into effect. * And still above this court is that of liojeste ret , or highest right , composed of seven judges , and sitting at the capital . rihis court , besides having the final decision in all cases carried up to it by appeal , acts in conjunction with the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A very singular principle of Norwegian jurisprudence , is that by which the judges are made responsible for their decisions , and are even liable to pay damages for giving wrong ones . If a case is carried up by appeal to a higher court , the judge of the lower , together with two of the jury , if the court was that of the sorensk river , is obliged to defend the decision ; and if it is reversed , the want of judgment on the part of the inferior judge is made answerable for the damage sustained by the party against whom he decided . Nay , if a judge dies while such an appeal is pending , his heirs may be liable for the injury he has done . And if his decisions have been reversed three times , even on account of his want of good judgment , he is displaced . I'his principle , which appears to have come down from very old times , is by no means a dead one in the Norwegian code . Mr. Laing highly approves of it , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private person is entitled to compensation for his trouble and loss of time in carrying the case tip , those who appointed a man with a weak judgment to be a judge , ought rather to be responsible than such a man himself . In a country like Norway , where the relations of society that can be involved in dispute are usually simple , such a principle may not be very injurious ; but it would be highly oppressive in a country like ours , where cases often arise of so complicated a nature , that the strongest minds disagree concerning them . The trial to which this constitution and the capacity of the Nor * The highest punishment in Norway is imprisonment in chains for life ; the punishment of death having been aholished , while this country was united with Denmark , in the Danish dominions ahout half a century ago . // wegians to govern themselves has been put , has had a very gratifying result . Though they are removed from the highways of European intelligence ; though numbers of them live in lonely valleys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman , who comes to fish and be bitten by the musquitoes ; yet they appear to be far in advance of their neighbors in the art of government , however inferior to them in education . In 1814 , when Denmark and Norway were disunited , the national debt was equitably divided between the two countries . Since that time Norway has been gradually extinguishing her debt , until in 1837 only about three millions of dollars were due ; while the debt of Denmark has swollen to one hundred and twentyseven millions of rix dollars Danish . In consequence of this , all direct taxes on land have been removed , the indirect being found sufficient to cover the expenses of government . Education has received the attention of the storthing . The present system has grown up under the new constitution , and being thorough as well as compulsory , promises to extend a sound education through the remotest valleys of this interesting country. * " With their minute economy , " says Mr. Laing , " they have accomplished much in twenty-one years , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have provided liberally for some things which we would not expect to find proposed or favored in a parliament so constituted ; a steam-vessel for instance to ply between Drontheim and 11ammersfest , which will be the first appearance of steam-power within the arctic circle ; a grant for enabling students and men of science to travel for improvement in foreign countries ; a grant for establishing schools * It is described by Mr. Baird , Vol . II , p. 56. of design for mechanics , and for gradually forming a collection of works of art connected with that object ; grants to the university , its library and museum ; a grant for a seminary for forming schoolmasters-these objects liberally provided for , considering the means of the country , show no unenlightened spirit ; no inaptitude at least in the storthing to adopt the enlightened views of its most cultivated members . " rphe bank of Norway is another fruit of the storthing 's legislation . Its capital was raised by a tax on landed property in 1816 , and the proprietors of estates hold shares according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bank lends on land up to two thirds of its value , according to a valuation made in 18l* . The borrower pays four per cent . per annum , and five per cent . yearly of the principal until the debt is extinguished . And to mention but one measure more , the storthing last year , as we are informed , paved the way for stopping distillation through the country , being alarmed no doubt by the results of the free use of finkel , or potato spirits , upon the people . rfo this gratifying measure they were led , in all probability , by the light which our useful countryman Mr. Baird has been the means of diffusing in the northern parts of Europe , on the subject of intemperance . It would be in order now to inquire into the social , moral , and religious condition of Norway , and into the causes which have made them what they are . The state of society on the whole would open before us in no very unfavorable light , even if we should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his unqualified praise of this country . Yet we should find dark shades in the picture arising from the formality and insufficiency of the religious establishment , from the habits of the people in regard // to strong drink and other demoralizing causes . The influence in favor of sound morals , would seem to arise to a considerable degree from the old institutions of the country , and from the simplicity of manners which small estates , a climate uncongenial with self-gratification , and general equality of condition , have occasioned . But we must dismiss these interesting topics for want of room , and hasten to a conclusion . And we wish to give it as our closing remark , that Norway is fortunate indeed in having its free institutions rise naturally out of its history-in growing ripe for freedom - instead of being lifted high on a sudden flood of liberty , for which there was no preparation , and of which there could be no assured continuance . Just as our liberties were substantially as old as the landing at Plymouth , and the declaration of independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right season ; just so , it would seem , the Norwegians have been trained for freedom , and therefore excite a rational hope that they will neither sink below the proper level of freemen , nor fail of attaining those high social and moral ends to which freedom is the door . A nation numbering more than forty thousand land-owners , when the population was not a million , and accustoming its citizens to interpret the laws and consider the relations of life in the office of jurymen ,  --  such a nation has opened a school where men can hardly fail of learning to govern themselves . Happy the nation where the foundations of liberty are laid deep in the past ; where its soil has been gathering for ages ; where men to be free need not forget or be ashamed of their ancestors , and do not grow up with a servile look upon their faces , as though they remembered having been slaves . May Norway be blessed of heaven with the spread of spiritual religion , sound learning , and pure morals ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fixed and brightening-in the sky of Europe.
