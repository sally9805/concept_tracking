txt THESE documents are connected with a subject of great public importan*e . Disgrace has fallen upon the people of this country in the eyes of the civilized world , and it becomes us to inquire how far we deserve it , how far it is unmerited , by what means we can justly relieve ourselves from it , and // what are to be the consequences of our continuing in the wrong . We believe that some injustice has been done by public opinion , and some needless alarm felt by those most directly interested , either through ignorance of the facts , or because they have been considered only in a hurried and imperfect manner . We have no doubt , also , that evil principles have been disseminated , and false ideas of duty and policy presented to the people , in connexion with this interesting subject , and that these can be effectually exposed only by discussion . We propose , therefore , to state the facts , as we suppose they really exist , and to examine some of the principles connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the States of this Union were in debt only for about * 13,000,000 . During the next seven years , the greater part of the present debt was contracted ; and the State governments laid the foundation for the residue , by authorizing loans , and commencing public works upon which the money was to be expended . These seven years formed one of the most extraordinary financial periods - perhaps the most extraordinary one - the world has ever seen , and nowhere were its character and effects so fully exhibited as in this country . It may not , therefore , prove uninteresting to trace rapidly the causes which led to this remarkable state of things in the United States . Great injustice has been done to the American people by leaving out of view the general state of financial affairs at the time when their debts were contracted , and when some of the States failed to pay the interest which was due . The peace of 1815 found Europe , and , to some extent , this country also , exhausted by the wars which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population had been kept down by the drain upon it for the armies production was diminished , and commerce had but a feeble life . The habits and pursuits of the people had so long been formed to a state of war , that time was requisite to allow the * general peace of the world to produce its effects . This change , however , soon began to be accomplished , and the world was not slow in obtaining the benefit of the new condition of things . Reverses more or less severe occasionally came , especially that most serious one in England , in 1825 and 1826 , which was felt in this country also . But , on the whole , // the affairs of all commercial and manufacturing countries were in a hopeful state . Wealth was increasing ; population was greatly multiplied ; production was enlarged still faster than population ; and the general condition of man in most civilized countries was constantly improving . We felt some checks during the period between 1815 and 1829 , but they were beneficial rather than injurious , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm state , and to make men industrious and economical , without seriously impairing their resources . When General Jackson became President , in 1829 , there was a general and well grounded belief , that the financial affairs of the country were prosperous , and that we were in a condition to go forward with accelerated speed . In 1834 , the last instalment of our public debt was paid . No more money went out of the country through this channel . This was an event of great importance to the country , and certainly its importance was not inadequately estimated either at home or abroad . Here , the party newspapers made the most of it with the people , in order to obtain credit for the preceding administrations which had planned it , and for the existing administration by which it had been accomplished . Abroad , it was considered very striking from its novelty ; for we were the first , and are still the only , nation in modern times , which has ever wholly freed itself from debt . This fact tended to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g1*at confidence in their resources , and to incite them to large undertakings . During this period , our manufactures increased much ; and a beneficial change was taking place in an important branch of commerce . Instead of sending little or nothing but specie beyond the Cape of Good Hope , wherewith to purchase agricultural and manufactured products , our own manufactures began not only tosupply our own wants to a great extent , but to be carried elsewhere . A new course of trade was thus opened , a good market being provided for the products of our own labor , and the money was kept at home which was formerly sent abroad to buy those of other nations . At the same time , another important change was taking place in trade . Under the old system , large amounts of specie were carried to China , to the East Indies , and to // South America , for the purchase of cargoes . Much of this same specie , sooner or later , found its way to London , or to places where it was under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It thus performed long and hazardous voyages , at great expense , and wholly without necessity . The transportation of money in this form , to some extent , is necessary . The laws of trade require it to he carried from one country to another to settle balances of account ; and it must go from a place where it is less , to one where it is more valuable . But to carry it to the East Indies , and pay it to a merchant there who the next week sends it to London , creates an expense of freight , interest , and insurance , without necessity . This is so plain in principle , as to have given rise , long ago , to the practice and laws of hills of exchange ; but it was reserved for the period of which we are now speaking to give the fullest effect to this practice in this country , by establishing , in our principal commercial cities , agents of merchants and bankers resident in London , with authority to grant letters of credit to a merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a letter , the master , or supercargo , or some merchant at the port of destination , is authorized to draw bills of exchange on the merchant or banker in London for jr specified amount , and with these bills , or their proceeds , when sold in the market of the place , the cargo is purchased . The borrowing merchant , on his part , agrees to place funds in London wherewith to meet the*iils at maturity . It is obvious , that this arrangement , besides saving large risks and expenses , must set free a great amount of capital . If employed only in safe and legitimate transactions , it would release for a considerable period all the capital necessary for them . But its effects did not stop here . At a period when confidence was rising and profits seemed certain , this new arrangement began to be resorted to as a new mode of obtaining means with which to trade ; while , at the same time , the general confidence and the apparent prosperity made it very easy to obtain bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our whole commerce felt the stimulating effects of this new cause . While this change was taking effect , the war between the government of the United States and the Bank of the United States was carried on ; the public deposits were removed // from that bank to State banks ; and in anticipation of the time when the charter of that institution would expire , local banks were chartered all over the country . In seven years , from 1830 to 1837 , the nominal capital of these banks was increased from one hundred and ten millions of dollars to two hundred and twenty-five millions . Paper money multiplied still faster . This increase had a necessary effect on prices . The ease with which money was obtained , and the apparent profit from its use , led to the multiplication of engagements of all kinds and to every form of speculation , to an amount , which , if it could be correctly ascertained , would , even now , fill us with astonishment . If we add , that , while these causes were in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural effects , some of the States began to receive and expend the great sums of money they had obtained upon loan , and that our own country , in its agriculture and other important resources , had been making a real and great progress , while other countries , and especially England , were in a similar state of excitement , and were constantly reacting on us , - if we add all these circumstances together , we shall have little cause to wonder , that the American people were brought into that most extraordinary condition in which their public debts were contracted . Former times may have exhibited as great madness , hut it reached fewer persons . At no other period did the wild spirit of adventure become epidemic over so many countries , till it seemed to affect the whole world . At this time , commerce and manufactures had largely increased . Wealth had been both accumulated and diffused to an extent before unknown . Wonderful improvements in the means of communication , across wide seas and through great continents , had brought all civilized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sentiment and opinion . A long and unbroken peace , in whose sunshine population had increased , and production been stimulated , and private enterprise suffered to act freely , incited men to large undertakings . Some , who in former times would have found occupation , suited to their daring tempers , in the field , embarked their recklessness in commerce ; others , whose rashness , under ordinary circumstances , would have been soon checked by disaster , or prevented from showing itself by want of means , found that their energy and love of // Jan. adventure had made them leaders ; and others still , whose fears would have been roused hy danger , lost all hesitation in the general confidence . Men acted as if a short and secure road to wealth had been discovered , on which all might travel , and he who went the fastest would he the first to reach the desired end . The result was such a morbid tendency to excess in all financial affairs , as had never before been witnessed . In those countries where the currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enormously increased . Partly in consequence of this increase , and partly on account of the sanguine hopes of men , prices continued to rise . All uses of capital seemed to be followed by certain and large returns , and men were therefore eager to borrow . All pursuits appeared to be safe and prosperous , and therefore those who had money were desirous to lend it . So much security was felt , that little security was asked ; and to obtain money , nothing more was necessary than to show the lender , that it was to be employed in some magnificent scheme , which stood well with the large expectations of the time , and was in season with the glorious summer of men 's hopes . At this same period , and partly in consequence of this extraordinary state of things , there arose in this country a vehement desire to construct great public works , chiefly such as facilitate and promote internal commuuication. * We do not mean to say , that the desire was then new . The people of this country are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time , the great value of such works , and the extraordinary natural opportunities for them presented by this continent . They have not much taste for cathedrals and palaces , but " the useful magnificence of roads and bridges * excites their admiration . They knew well enough , that a canal or a railroad , piercing a great tract of country , was of immense importance to them . They quite comprehended its objects , and did not underestimate * It would seem , that contracting public debts for such objects was a new thing , for M. Say lays it down , as one of his principles , that , " There is this grand distinction between an individual borrower and a borrowing government , that , in general , the former borrows capital for the purpose of its beneficial employment , the latter for the purpose of barren consumption and expenditure . Nations never borrow but wit.h a view to consume outright . " // its effects ; and when their hopes had been raised , and their judgment somewhat disordered by the fever in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great objects not only within reach , but almost thrust into their hands , it is not strange that they seized upon them with incautious eagerness , and expended them with a prodigality somewhat in proportion to the ease with which they were obtained . We repeat , therefore , that great injustice must be done to the people of this country , if the general state of men 's minds and of financial affairs is left out of view in considering the subject of their indebtedness . They have been rash , but it was at a time when rashness was epidemic . They have been improvident , but it was when prudence was generally considered little better than narrow-minded timidity . Their fault may have been very great , hut it was very general , and it was a fault of which the creditor largely partook with the debtor. if it was rash and improvident in them to borrow , it was rash and improvident in others to lend ; for , in these cases , the lenders had almost as good means of knowing the grounds of credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose resources and means of payment are necessarily made public , so that all may know them . rube works on which the money was to be expended were public works ; their character and purposes were known ; and when the loan was obtained for a specific and declared object , which it often was , the reasonableness and the probable results of the undertaking were open to the judgment of all intelligent men . In our opinion , it was the duty of the lender to exercise his judgment on these points . It is reasonable to expect , that creditors will not only be vigilant , but suspicious ; for those qualities naturally grow out of the relation of debtor and creditor when it is formed , and they spring up whenever an attempt is made to form it . The fears of creditors , and of those who are asked to become creditors , not seldom lead to untrue judgments and harsh constructions , which are not to be blamed , because they contribute to the general safety . But when we find rashness where we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place of a careful examination into means and plans , we can not doubt , that the general infatuation must thereby be increased , and that they who have departed so widely from the qualities which usually belong to their position have done much to produce the mischief . // Let us not be misconstrued into saying one word that tends to affect the legal and moral obligation of any contract made under these circumstances . What we have said does not touch that obligation . The parties were competent to make contracts . The borrowers were free States , whose public acts were done by the responsible agents and immediate representatives of the whole people . Of course , it is not intended to intimate , that such a degree of infatuation might exist as would relieve one of the parties from the obligation of its contracts . This would be to stultify a sovereign State ; a process which would certainly be entirely new in the history of public law , and one to which , it is presumed , no State would very willingly submit . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts . They are applicable , not to the will to pay , but to the ability to pay . They tend to excuse insolvency , not fraud . They present some reasons why a people , who admit their indebtedness , may , at the same time , without dishonor , admit their inability to make payment . It is often dangerous to run too close a parallel between public and private duties . The rules for the conduct of States and of individuals are not identical , though it is not always easy to see just where they differ . But in this matter , we can perceive no distinction between the case of an upright and well-meaning man , who can not pay his debts , and a State which is in the like predicament . The mere fact of insolvency furnishes no ground for inferring bad faith , or even bad judgment . The circumstances under which the debts were contracted , and especially the inducements which led to them , must be taken into the account , before any decision unfavorable to the debtor can justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State has been led astray partly by the insane confidence of its creditors , those creditors must bear some of the blame which always attaches to unsuccessful rashness . There is another fact , which it is important to keep in view . The real prosperity of the States at the time when these debts were contracted , especially when seen under the bright sunshine which then rested upon all things , was a cause , and , to a great extent , a just cause , of confidence . Their progress in every thing which makes a people great , and powerful , and rich , had been unexampled . Look at their population ; in thirty years , it had increased from seven // millions to seventeen millions . This increase took place , not in a country already overstocked , and where the means of employment and subsistence are constantly sought after by those who are too numerous to be supplied ; but in a country wide enough to afford ample room ; fertile to produce the means of subsistence ; full of all natural resources to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freest scope for the energies of the people . Let it be borne in mind , also , that this people came from that Northern stock , which has always been so full of vigor ; that they have a hereditary right to energy of character ; and that , in this New World , they have been so stimulated by the opportunities and wants of their country as to be incapable of idleness , - finding no satisfaction but in exertion , and no rest , so to speak , but in continual labor . The results have corresponded to the causes . The domestic produce of the country exported in 1824 was of the value of $ 50,000,000 ; in 1830 , it was $ 107,000,000 . The post-office received and expended , in 1837 , about $ 4,000,000 ; and in 1830 , only $ 2,000,000 ; it carried the mail , in 1836 , over 32,000,000 of miles of postroads , though in 1830 , it carried them over only 14,500,000 miles ; and in 1800 , the distance was only about 3,000,000 of miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capital had been invested in them . They had been extended , till they were capable of supplying nearly all our own wants , and many of those of foreign nations . In some articles , they had reached a point where they were above foreign competition ; in others , they were fast approaching it . Regarded at first as hostile to commerce , on account of the restrictions which were partly designed to encourage them , they were now beginning to pay the debt which they had owed to foreign trade , by furnishing some of its safest exports . But these things , important as they are , give only a faint idea of what our people had accomplished . The stories of the old poets concerning heroes , who built cities by the shore of the sea , and , by their own mighty energies and the direct assistance of divine power , created states , that were secured by laws , supplied by industry , and adorned with the arts of life , do not sound incredible or strange in our ears . // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of wilderness that seemed illimitable divided into cultivated farms ; solitary inland seas made glad with the presence of an active and prosperous commerce ; great rivers , whose waters formerly reflected only the shadows of the forest , running by the luxurious abodes of civilized men , and bearing the varied products of labor ; cities , which are already worthy of the name , filled with an industrious and intelligent population , springing up in the solitary places ; nay , great states , whose people are reckoned by millions , brought into existence and established during this short period . What wonder , then , that such a people should have felt confidence in their resources ? They knew their means had been sufficient to accomplish things which the rest of the world looked upon as impossible . They knew , that the tide of prosperity had been rising so fast , that it had borne every thing along with it . Is it strange , that they should have been led astray by hope , and brought into the midst of difficulty by want of caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2L et us not sit down under the imputation , that no more wisdom was to be expected from a government of the people . We deny that more wisdom was to be expected of any government in similar circumstances . Such mistakes are not new . Other governments have done such things before , and with far less excuse . We do not , however , acquit some of the States of all blame for contracting such great debts . They acted incautiously , and bitterly have they repented of it . But we do maintain , that , when the circumstances under which the debts were contracted , and the objects for which the supplies were thus obtained , are fairly examined , those governments will not be found exposed to the severe censure which they have incurred . Being human , they were imperfect . Success is the sole test with common minds . They who are wiser will look at the causes of failure , and see whether these are such as ought reasonably to have been foreseen . It is easy for observers to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1835 and 1836 could not long continue . A few sagacious men , so placed as to be able to survey the whole field , of commerce5 saw this at the time ; though we doubt if any one understood , or even conjectured , how extensive the malady was . Even these // few began at last to doubt , whether they , or all the rest of mankind , were mad . The bubble was so strong , and lasted so well , that it seemed almost impossible that it should be a bubble . But at last , the fixed laws of trade began to produce their long deferred , but necessary , effects . Contracts of all kinds had multiplied to such an extent , that a great deal of money was wanted to fulfil them . Prices were so high , that much more money was needed to effect the transfer of property than in the ordinary state of the market . In the midst of the greatest apparent prosperity , there was a great demand for money . The supply had increased enormously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost , but they could not keep up to the demand . Money became scarcer and dearer . There was now a choice among borrowers , and a discrimination between those whose credit rested on something , and those whose credit had no solid support . It was difficult for any one to get money . Many could not get it at all , and failures began to take place . The process went on , and confidence fell lower , and failures were multiplied daily . It may here be remarked , that , if the Bank of England had curtailed its issues early in 1836 , a check would have been felt , which would probably have gradmdly reduced our headlong speed , and prevented the great calamity of a failure of all our banks . The managers of that bank certainly had the means of knowing , that prices , both in England and the United States , and especially in the latter country , were inflated most unnaturally ; that fictitious credit to an immense amount had been created , and was constantly increasing that speculative engagements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain of specie from Great Britain . Notwithstanding all this , the bank continued to extend its engagements until August , 1836 , when , finding its specie slipping rapidly away , it began to fear for its own safety . Still its course was rather vacillating for several months , until it finally gave a decisive blow , by stopping the credit and cutting off the facilities of several of the American bankinghouses in London . These banking-houses were , therefore , obliged to call on our merchants for immediate payment , and our merchants required specie from the banks wherewith to make payments . At that moment , no ordinary supply of specie could have prevented a suspension of payment by // the banks . The immediate issue of more than a million sterling of bonds of the Bank of the United States of Pennsylvania , designed to serve as remittances , had no perceptible effect . There was very little real exchange to meet the great and pressing want . Exchange based on credit bad ceased to exist ; nothing remained but to send specie , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were needed , without causing all the banks sooner or later to fail . But it should be remembered , that this suspension took place , not in a state of exhaustion , but after years of unexampled gains , and after the country had made real and great advances in all its permanent sources of wealth . rrhe fearful rate at which we had been moving rendered some check inevitable ; but we had been all the time moving onward , and mainly in the right direction . The check was sudden and violent . It stopped us short , and we stood still . For some months , all the energies of the country were employed in - liquidating and paying debts . It is speaking within bounds , to say , that , within a few months , engagements amounting to many hundreds of millions were paid off . Imports almost ceased , our crops went to market , specie flowed in , and , at the end of the year 1837 , our foreign commercial debt was nearly paid . The country was then in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the United States Bank of Pennsylvania , and some other great institutions , were not ready . During the years of high prices , they had lent their capital on paper which rested only on the exaggerated and unreal values of that period ; and an immediate return to specie payments would have shown , that their capital had been very seriously impaired . The United States Bank of Pennsylvania , therefore , at first opposed the resumption of specie payments ; and subsequently , when compelled to come into the arrangement , it seems to have adopted the bold measure of attempting to bring back the unnatural state of things which had existed before May , 1837 ; hoping , that , by means of high prices and unlimited credit , it might be able gradually to withdraw itself from its dangerous position . It entered largely into the purchase of State stocks , speculations in cotton , and other transactions . It was impossible , in the nature of things , that this scheme // should succeed ; but it had some effect . Many began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they were already overcome ; that the disease was cured , and the patient restored to a sound state and ready for action . Our foreign commercial debt had been paid with so much promptness , that European capitalists formed a very high opinion both of our resources and our honor , and they took the stocks of the States as freely as if they had been gold and silver . But the day of calamity was again at hand . The Bank of England again found itself in a critical condition . Money became scarce , beyond all precedent , in England ; prices fell ; stocks were unsalable ; the Bank of the United States of Pennsylvania again stopped payment , and its example was followed by every bank south of Philadelphia . Men 's eyes were at last opened . They saw , that the country had not recovered from the effects of the years of speculation , and that the attempts to return to a false position had but increased their difficulties . A panic succeeded . All prop* erty seemed for a time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former distempered state of affairs , and this depression was the only method by which a sound condition of things could be produced . But it was a severe operation . In some of the new States , it was difficult even for the wealthy to obtain money for the daily uses of life . We have heard of farmers , owning large and well stocked farms , who could hardly get money enough to pay the postage on a letter . They had scarcely any currency , and most of that which they had was bad . In the commercial States , matters were but little better . Failures were almost innumerable . Trade had fallen off , and , when prosecuted , was hazardous . A deep gloom settled upon men 's minds . Governments felt it as much as individuals . Their ordinary resources were diminished . Thi means of obtaining extraordinary supplies were lessened in proportion to the general distress . The physical means of making payment of their debts were wanting in some States , for there was no money to be had . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and afraid to act in any way , lest they should run into new mistakes . In was in such a posture of affairs , that some of the States , to which we shall more particularly refer , // refused , and others omitted , to provide for the interest which had become payable on their debts . The first of these cases which we shall notice is that of Pennsylvania . On the first of August , 1842 , the interest on its funded debt became due and was not paid . It having been foreseen , that there would be no money in the treasury with which to meet the dividend , amounting to eight hundred and seventy-one thousand dollars , an act was passed by the legislature , directing the treasurer to borrow the sum necessary for its payment , and , in the event of his being unable to obtain it on the terms proposed , authorizing the issue of certificates , to the persons entitled to dividends of interest , for the sums due to them , payable in August , 1843 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law was subsequently passed , authorizing the issue of certificates in payment of the two succeeding dividends , bearing interest at the rate of six per cent . per annum , and redeemable in August , 1846 . These certificates , with the interest which has accrued upon them , are yet unpaid . The whole amount of the funded debt of this State on the first of January , 1843 , was $ 37,937,788*24 , payable at different periods , and in different sums , the last of which will fall due in the year 1870. * The internal improvements , for the construction of which the great bulk of the debt is due , consist of seven hundred and ninety-three miles of rail-ways and canals which are completed , and one hundred and forty miles of canals in progress and nearly completed in January last . The principal work , or rather chain of works , is that be- * This debt was contracted for the following purposes : For canals and rail-ways , - - $ 30,533,62915 To pay interest on the public debt , - 4,410,13503 For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , State roads , &amp;e. , - - 930,00000 Union Canal , 200,000.00 Eastern Penitentiary , 120,000-00 Franklin Rail-road , 100,00000 Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal , . 50,000 , Ot ) Insane Asylum , 22,33506 37,937,788-24 To this may now he added the amount of certificates authorized to be issued in payment of the last two semi-annual dividends of interest , amounting to Making a total of - 1,787,45489 $ 39,725,243-13 // tween Philadelphia and Pittsburg , extending nearly the whole length of the State , a distance of three hundred and ninetyfive miles , and connecting the Atlantic with the Ohio River and the great Western waters . These are the objects on which far the greatest part of the money borrowed by the State has been expended . It is manifest , that such works must be highly important and useful to Pennsylvania , independently of the revenues which they may yield . From various causes , which our limits do not permit us to notice , these revenues have thus far disappointed the expectations of the people . But the Governor presented to the legislature , in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works during the year then just elapsed , and facts may be cited which go far to prove , that the profit which the State will hereafter derive from them must be very great . Pennsylvania contains 1,724,000 free people , inhabiting a territory of 47,000 square miles . The soil is generally fertile , and , being under good cultivation , the amount of its agricultural products is very great . Their annual value was estimated in 1842 to be $ 126,620,617 . The manufactures during the same period , including iron , were estimated at upwards of $ 64,000,000 . The coal mined in the State during the same time was worth about $9,000,000 . It appears , then , that the annual products of the State amount to the enormous value of $ 200,000,000 . The annual charge upon the State for the interest upon its debts is , in round numbers , $ 2,000,000 . Suppose the public works were to yield no revenue at all , and the whole of this charge were to fall on the people in a direct tax ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A capitation tax of one dollar a head would nearly pay it . Of course , no burden of debt can be pronounced heavy or light except by comparing it with the resources and means of the debtor , and such a comparison will show , that Pennsylvania is not heavily burdened . Her vast and easily wrought mines of the best kinds of coal , lying side by side with inexhaustible treasuries of the richest iron ore , her abundant supply of water-power , her fertile soil , temperate climate , and industrious and frugal population , are resources so immense , that even her great debt appears but a light incumbrance . There can not be the smallest doubt , that she is able , without the least embarrassment , to fulfil all // her engagements . It is a lamentable fact , that she has not done so ; but there has been a concurrence of causes to pro .. duce this result , most of which have no connexion with the honesty of her people . We deny , that any man has the right to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been committed , and we are sorry to add , that there has been some remissness of conduct . There has , also , been clearly shown a disposition to do right . The measures taken by the legislature to raise the necessary revenue , under the peculiar circumstances of the times , have proved insufficient ; but they were adopted for that purpose , and were such as not fairly to be open to the charge of being mere pretences . Besides raising more than $ 300,000 for the support of the schools , the ordinary expenses of the government are fully provided for by taxes of some years ' standing . in addition to these , which are indirect taxes , the legislature voted a direct tax of one mill upon every dollar of taxable property in the State , and by a law passed in 1842 , which was designed to go into effect in 1843 , this tax was doubled . The produce of the first-mentioned tax of one mill was about half a million of dollars , and if another half million were raised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , the sum , together with the revenue actually realized from the public works , would pay about nine tenths of the interest on the funded debt . But there was some ambiguity in the law , and in some counties advantage was taken of the doubt thus created to avoid payment of the tax . This is one of the embarrassments in the details of a law which often occur in practice ; but it will undoubtedly be remedied by further legislation . The State has also had a large unfunded debt , due chiefly to contractors on the public works ; and to the payment of this sum the revenues of the State have been applied . We understand , that this unfunded debt is now paid , and that , for the future , the revenues from direct taxation and the public works will be applicable to the payment of the interest on the State stock . We have already said , that they will be sufficient to pay about nine tenths of it , and , if the income from the public works should not increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrears of interest since August , 1842 , and for the remaining tenth part of the interest hereafter to accrue . Those who know Pennsylvania entertain no great doubt respecting her future // course ; and the moment the State shows a determination to pay punctually , there will not he the smallest difficulty in obtaining , by a permanent loan , the means of paying the arrears of interest . Maryland is another delinquent State , which has failed , during the last two years , to make payment of the interest on her public debt . The bonds of this State which have been issued amount to a little more than $ 15,000,000 , but of these about $ 3,175,000 , issued to the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-road , have not been negotiated , and should they be negotiated , the interest on them will be paid by the company . Of the residue , nearly $ 1,300,000 are the property of the State , having been purchased by the income of the sinking hind . These bonds are subject to different rates of interest , the greater part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after deducting what goes to the sinking fund , amounting to something less than $ 600,000 a year . The whole of this debt , with the exception of $ 215,947 , was contracted for purposes of internal improvement , partly by subscriptions to stock in canal and rail-road companies , on account of the State , and partly by grants , in the form of loans , to such coInpanies , they being bound to pay the interest on the bonds , and ultimately to repay the principal , - the works of the said companies being mortgaged for the security of the respective debts . In making these large advances , and entering into these engagements , the legislature of the State relied upon the income of the works to meet the interest of the debt . In this expectation they have been disappointed . The Baltimore and Ohio Rail-road alone has made an adequate return for the expenditure . The sum of $ 1,022,000 , invested in the stocks of this rail-road , earns an income of seven per cent . per annum . The sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baltimore and Susquehannah Rail-road , has made some small return , and there is a prospect , that the income from this source will slightly increase . On $1 , 000,000 , loaned to the Susquehannah Tide-water Canal , no return has yet been received ; but it is confidently anticipated , that this canal will shortly be able to pay the interest on the loan , amounting to $ 55,000 per annum . The largest investments have been made in the stocks and bonds of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal company . This canal being yet unfinished , and requiring a further // sum of a million and a half or two millions of dollars to complete it , no income is expected from it , until the means shall be found to raise that sum , and extend the canal to the coal-mines near Cumberland . Some smaller advances , which have been made to other companies , are not expected to make any return . The annual income , therefore , which can be , for the present , anticipated from the public works , is Jimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amounting to about $ 450,000 , must , therefore , be met by taxation . A direct tax , sufficient for this object , was voted by the legislature ; but in consequence of the severe embarrassments of the last three years , and of the want of aproper system for the collection of direct taxes , a large proportion of the taxes for the years 1841 , 1842 , and 1843 has been suffered to fall in arrear , and in consequence , the means of the treasury have been inadequate to the payment of the interest on the debt . From January , 1842 , this interest has not been paid , except that for some part coupons have been issued , promising payment at a future day , and receivable in payment of taxes . For the restoration of the credit of the State , it is necessary that the arrears of interest should be provided for , which can be done in the manner spoken of in the case of Pennsylvania , and by enforcing a more prompt payment of taxes . The taxes already levied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected . Maryland has other revenues , independent of the direct taxes , amply sufficient for meeting all the other expenditures of the State . These taxes , to nearly the whole amount now levied , will be necessary to pay the interest on the debt , until an income shall be derived from the large investments in the loans or stocks of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal , and Susquehannah Rail-road and for this purpose these taxes must be enforced . As levied by the legislature , they amount to twenty-five cents upon every hundred dollars of taxable property in the State . We do not say this is a trifling burden . It requires resolution to sustain it . But the case presents every motive which can operate upon the minds of honorable men to induce them to make the effort . The money was borrowed by their agents . It has been expended upon their soil . Its results , thus far , may not be such as they desire ; but for this their own agents , and they themselves , who selected those agents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone to be blamed . The debt is a just debt . They can , and they will pay it . We look upon the position and future conduct of this State as of the greatest importance to the honor , the credit , and the future reputation of the whole country . It occnpies a position , and is placed in circumstances , which render its action almost decisive of the fate of this great question of public morals . Pennsylvania can pay , almost without an effort . Her debt is really nothing compared with her resources . indiana and Illinois are differently situated , and at present can not pay . Maryland occupies an intermediate position . She can pay , but it costs her a strong effort to do so . Her condition is such as to try her sense of honor . Hers is the opportunity to settle the question , whether a popular government is too selfish to be just . Her people have it in their power to say to the world , " We are capable of governing ourselves , for we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no human power can force them upon us , but we freely make them . We owe allegiance neither to kings , nor princes , hor to any earthly potentate ; but we obey His will who created us , and we are governed by His laws . Freely and cheerfully , because we know it to be our duty , will we do this thing . " Let the people of Maryland remember , also , that , if they make this effort , they will transmit to their children the inheritance of an untarnished honor ; that they will lay the foundations of public prosperity deep and strong in the public faith ; that the sacrifices which they are now called upon to make can not long he necessary , and will grow less with the increase of population and wealth , and the rising income from the public works . That they may see these things , and act as if they saw them , is the earnest wish of many who love their country , and think that its honor and welfare are deeply involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by no better name , with which some have attempted to delude the people of Maryland into a belief , that their legislature had not the constitutional power to contract these debts , would not be worthy of a moment 's attention , if the subject on which it is employed were not of such importance . There is an article in the Bill of Rights of this State of the following tenor : " Every person in the State ought to contribute his proportion of public taxes for the support of government , according // to his actual worth in real and personal property . " The argument is , that the legislature has power to tax the people only " for the support of government " ; that the construction of rail-roads and canals is not one of the legitimate objects of government , and , therefore , it is not within the constitutional power of the legislature to tax the people to make or pay for them . We can hardly call this an ingenious argument , for ingenuity would certainly have devised something which should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palpable a falsehood , that it is difficult to believe it could ever impose on any body . Not one of the legitimate objects of government to build rail-ways and canals ! How is this question to be settled ? First of all , by the universal practice of all civilized governments . That which every civilized people , under every form of administration , has caused its government to do , may well be thought to be within the legitimate powers of a government . And what people has ever doubted , that the building of roads and bridges was a subject not only fit for the action of government , but necessarily under its exclusive control ? Have the people of Maryland ever doubted this ? Let them consult their own statutes and ordinances , and see , whether , from the first moment when they acted in a political capacity , this subject has not always been ranked among the powers which the government has exercised . Not only has this been the universal practice , but it is absolutely requisite that the practice should continue . Keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory of a State and another , and affording facilities of passage for persons and property over land by means of convenient roads , and over the waters by means of bridges and ferries , is absolutely necessary . Hardly any object of civil society can be accomplished without them , and the right of eminent domain not only always has been , but always must be , exercised for this end . It has been seriously doubted , whether a government acts wisely in delegating this power to private corporations , even where they are held in check by the legislature ; but we never heard it suggested , that a government could delegate this power without first possessing it . It is very clear , therefore , that these objectors would never have a road made , or a bridge built , or a ferry established , or a canal dug , within // the limits of their State ; - not by the government , for it is not within the powers delegated to the State ; not by those authorized by the government , for the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take land and other private property for a purpose which the government itself has not a right to effect . We suppose no one will be so hardy as to attempt to make a distinction between a ferry and a canal , or a bridge and a rail-road . The power of states over this subject arises from the nature of the object to be accomplished , which is , to effect an easy , cheap , and safe passage ; and , of course , it is restricted to no particular means . The truth is , the whole argument betrays lamentable ignorance of the nature and objects of all social institutions , or it betrays something worse . The first object of government undoubtedly is , to secure its citizens from violence and wrong . But this by no means exhausts its powers , or fulfils its duties . It may do much towards the increase of knowledge , the advancement of education , both religious and secular , the progress of the sciences , the promotion of a free intercourse between communities and nations , and the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do towards these objects , securely and wisely , it is bound to do . This duty has been felt by all governments , and to some extent has been performed by all . Great public works , designed for the common benefit , and executed by the combined power of the whole people , have always been looked upon as monuments of civilization , and of the wisdom and virtue of the administration which planned them . It is now for the first time denied that they are within its legitimate powers . Of course , we do not here refer to the national government . The question , whether the Constitution of the United States gives the power to construct roads within the States , is an open and difficult one ; but it has nothing to do with the subject here discussed . It turns , not on the general question , whether such works are legitimate objects for the action of government , but on the question , whether this power is granted in the Constitution of the United States . The question in Maryland is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken away from the legislature by the // Bill of Rights ? It must exist , unless it was abrogated by the article we have already quoted . The word repudiation , in the sense in which it is now commonly used , was first adopted in the State of Mississippi . It occurred , for the first time , we believe , in the message of the Governor to the legislature of that State , in January , 1841 , in which he adverts to the plan of " REPUDIATING the sale of certain of the State bonds , on account of fraud and illegality . " The material facts in reference to the action of this State upon the subject of its debt are these . In 1838 , the State chartered the Mississippi Union Bank , and , in order to provide capital for the institution , it was enacted in the charter , that the directors might borrow $ 15,500,000 ; and that the Governor might issue seven thousand five hundred bonds , for $ 2000 each , bearing five per cent . interest , and redeemable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver them to the officers of that institution from time to time , in proportion to the amounts subscribed for bank stock , the price of which was to be secured to the satisfaction of the directors . The bonds were made negotiable by the indorsement of the president and cashier of the hank . By an additional act , the Governor was authorized to subscribe , in behalf of the State , for $ 5,000,000 of the stock of the bank ; and he did so . In June , 1838 , he delivered to the bank two thousand five hundred bonds , amounting to $ 5,000,000 , payable in twelve and twenty years from the 5th day of February , 1838 , and bearing five per cent . interest from their date . The charter required the bank to appoint three commissioners for the sale of the bonds , and imposed this restriction on their authority , that the bonds should not be sold under their par value . On the 18th of August , 1838 , the commissioners sold all the bonds to Mr. Biddle for the sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one million each , on the 1st day of November , 1838 , and the first days of January , March , May , and July , 1839 , without interest . This money was punctually paid to the bank , which went into operation ; and before January , 1841 , lost all its capital . Now we feel constrained to say , that , if this matter had rested here , the State of Mississippi would not be legally bound to pay this debt . We think the commissioners did not conform to their authority in making the sale . They // were , in terms , prohibited from selling the bonds under their par value . The par value of a bond is the amount which is due upon it ; and this includes interest as well as principal . This seems to us to be the fair meaning of the words of the charter , and any other construction would render the restriction itself nugatory ; since , by allowing the interest to accumulate long enough , the commissioners would have had it in their power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very moment when they sold them , * 7,000,000 might be due upon them . They made such a sale as not to receive in cash an amount equal to the liability of the State on the bonds , and therefore we . believe that they exceeded their authority . We think , also , that the State had the legal right to insist at a proper time on this want of authority , even against the subsequent purchasers of these bonds ; because any one who takes a title through an agent is bound by law to look to the authority delegated to him , and to see that lie acts or has acted within its scope in making the title . But we need hardly say , that the question , whether a sovereign state shall avail itself of its legal rights , depends upon considerations quite distinct from the mere rights themselves . Rules of jurisprudence are necessarily general , and , being general , they may , and sometimes do , work some injustice . A state , like an individual , ought to place itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice of the particular case . It is due to its own dignity , to the magnitude of the case , to the importance of preserving the great fountain of power and justice pure , that the most enlarged and liberal rules of equity should be observed . It is due to its position , being both a party in interest and a judge , to venture on no decision which will admit of question . And so the State of Mississippi must have thought , for so it acted . In responding to the message of the Govern6r , in January , 1841 , the legislature resolved , " First , That the State of Mississippi is bound to the holders of the bonds of the State , sold on account of the bank , for the amount of the principal and interest . " Secondly , That the State of Mississippi will pay her bonds and preserve her faith inviolate . " Thirdly , That the insinuation , that the State of Mississippi would repudiate her bonds and violate her plighted faith , is a calumny upon the justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // These resolves are such as might be expected from the legislature of a free state under such circumstances ; for a fact which we have not yet stated was known to that legislature , and , in our judgment , is sufficient to settle the question . The legislature met in 1839 , for the first time after the sale of the bonds . Only one fourth of the purchase money had then been paid over to the bank . The facts were communicated by the Governor to the legislature , and they resolved : " That the sale of the bonds was highly advantageou&amp; to the State and the bank , and in accordance with the injunctions of the charter , reflecting the highest credit on the Commissioners , and bringing timely aid to an embarrassed community . " The next legislature , which assembled in 1840 , appointed a committee on the affairs of the bank , but uttered not one word respecting the sale of the bonds . But the constitution of Mississippi contains a provision , that no law shall be passed to raise a loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment or redemption of any loan or debt , unless it be sanctioned by a majority of each house , the yeas and nays being entered on the journals , and be then referred to the next legislature , public notice whereof is to be given in the newspapers three months before the election ; and unless then passed by a majority in each branch of this second legislature . Upon the ground , that the State was not originally bound to pay this debt , and that the illegal acts of their agents had not been ratified by two successive legislatures , after public notice in the newspapers , Governor McNutt made his appeal to the people of the State , and , in 1842 , a majority of the members of both branches of the legislature were found to be in favor of repudiation . But although a majority of the people of Mississippi seem to have formed at that time an erroneous opinion on this question , and although we think meanly enough of the honesty of their advisers , we should not hastily adopt the conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been , from the first , a large body of intelligent and honorable men in that State , who determined to do their duty upon this great question ; and they are now manfully engaged in the work . They have exhibited deep legal learning , sound logic , a clear perception of the great principles of justice and duty , and a calm determination which must // and will prevail in the contest . It may not be during this year or the next ; but it appears to us certain , that the people of this State will see the truth , and act in accordance with it . Sufficient allowance has not always been made for the peculiar circumstances of the case . An intelligent foreigner , who feels a just indignation when he hears of repudiation , probably knows the difference between a Highland chieftain and a London merchant , but is profoundly ignorant that differences quite as great exist between the people of Mississippi and the people of Massachusetts . Probably there are few points in which these differences would be so likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay debts punctually is the point of honor among all commercial people . But the planters of Missis ' sippi do not so esteem it . They do not feel the importance of an exact conformity to contracts . It has not been their habit to meet their engagements on the very day , if not quite convenient . Certainly , they attach no idea of dishonesty to such a course of dealing . They mean to pay , but they did not expect , when they contracted the debt , to distress themselves about the payment . If a friend wants a thousand dollars for a loan or a gift , he can have it , though perhaps a creditor wants it also . We do not mean to intimate , that there are no high qualities in such a character ; but they are different from those which make good bankers and merchants ; and , therefore , bankers and merchants ought not to expect such men to look at a debt just as they do . In time , they will see the substance of the matter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing an arbitrary , unfair , and oppressive course of conduct , and they will take care that it is pursued no longer . They have been in great pecuniary distress . Their condition has been so bad , that they have looked upon a creditor demanding payment of his debt as little better than an enemy , and to be treated accordingly . They have seen , that the institution which had the proceeds of these bonds was managed as if it had been a gambling-house . They have been told by those in whom they had been accustomed to put confidence , that the sale of these bonds was a part of the same nefarious course of conduct which ruined the bank , and that , if they should pay the debt , they must do it for the benefit of those who defrauded the State in making the purchase of the bonds . We may // deeply regret that they acted in conformity with these views . We may believe that the conduct of the State has been unwise and unfair ; that it has shown any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great principles of justice , equity , and clemency , which a sovereign state should always exhibit in its dealings with individuals , especially where it is both party and judge . But let us not show the same want of moderation , by running into extremes ourselves ; let us not exhibit the same want of charity , by believing that a majority of the people of that State are knaves . Their affairs are now improving . The people are recovering from the sore and irritable state into which they had fallen . Allow time for them to see the truth , which the high-minded men of that State know so well how to exhibit and enforce , and we shall find , that , though the people may sometimes make a great mistake , they mean to do right , and they will discover and correct the error . The State of Michigan has denied its obligation to pay a part of its outstanding bonds . The material facts are , that , by an act of the legislature of that State , passed on the 21st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 15th of November in the same year , the Governor was authorized to negotiate for a loan of five millions of dollars , which was to be expended on the public works . Under this authority , the Governor , on the 1st of June , 1838 , entered into a contract with the Morris Canal and Banking Company of the city of New York , by which he constituted that company the agents of the State to make sales of the five millions loan . The power of the Governor to enter into this contract with the Banking Company has not been questioned . Acting under this agency , the Banking Company , before the 15th of November , 1838 , sold to various persons bonds amounting to $ 1,187,000 , and duly paid over to the State the proceeds of those sales . On the 1st day of July , 1841 , the interest on the bonds so sold became payable , and the State not having made provision for its payment , it remained unpaid . Reasons for this default were assigned by the legislature at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellfounded and to afford sufficient excuse for it ; but our limits will not permit us to examine or even to state them . Suffice it to say , that , in February , 1843 , the legislature took the subject into consideration , declared that the State was // " legally and equitably bound to provide for the payment of the principal and interest of these bonds , " covenanted with the holders to fund the interest till July , 1845 , pledged the revenue from the public works to the payment of the interest which should accrue after that time , and voted a direct tax to be assessed and levied in the same manner as the other State taxes , in order to pay any deficiency of the interest which that revenue might fail to meet . Thus far the conduct of the State has been such as the country had a right to expect . We wish it were in our power to approve of its conduct in respect to the residue of this loan , the history of which is briefly as follows . The Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of the residue of these bonds ; and being called on by the Governor , in November , 1838 , to state the account of their sales , and to make such suggestions as they should think important concerning future proceedings , replied by a proposal to pass the whole amount of the bonds , at par , after deducting their commission as agents , to the credit of the State of Michigan ; provided the Governor would deliver to the Banking Company the whole of the bonds at once , and take the obligation of the United States Bank of Pennsylvania to pay three fourths , and of the Morris Canal and Banking Company to pay one fourth , . of the amount , at certain periods which had been fixed in the contract of agency before mentioned . To this proposal the Governor replied , that he bad no objection to the details ; that their contract of agency gave them ft*l1 powers to act as the interest of the State required , and that they must take the responsibility of deciding whether this was the best thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Banking Company say , in answer , that they think it is best for the State to accept the offer , which had been made , and that they have closed the bargain . The Governor afterwards delivered the bonds , took the obligations of the United States Bank of Pennsylvania and the Morris Canal and Banking Company for the price , and in his next message announced the sale to the legislature , and communicated to them the documents respecting it . The legislature interposed no objection . Subsequently , the State received from the purchasers about $1,000,000 , in part payment of their obligations , and then the United States // Bank of Pennsylvania and the Morris Canal and Banking Company having both become insolvent , and having failed to pay the balance of the purchase money , the State declared , that it owed upon these bonds so much as the purchasers had paid , and that it was ready to issue new bonds for that amount upon the surrender of all the bonds so sold ; and that as to the residue , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their agreements are to be judged of by the circumstances attending them . " It only remains to add , that these bonds , all of which went to the United States Bank of Pennsylvania , were pledged by that bank to various banking houses in Europe to secure money previously borrowed , money advanced at the time of making the pledges , and subsequently paid on the faith of the pledges ; that the bonds are , in form and by law , negotiable ; and that no evidence has ever appeared , so far as we know , that either of those banking houses had knowledge , at the time they took the bonds , or when they afterwards advanced money upon them , of any defect in the title of the United States Bank of Pennsylvania . Now we should agree , at once , that , if the United States Bank of Pennsylvania and the Morris Canal and Banking Company held these bonds , the State might justly refuse to consider any greater amount of them as due than had been paid for . The law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to this result . But every system of law with which we have any acquaintance , and certainly the law of Michigan , makes a distinction between the case of these banks and that of bona fide purchasers . We believe the principle to be universally admitted , that , whenever a purchaser of property acquires a title from the seller , which he can transmit , although that title be tainted with fraud , if he sells to a bona fide purchaser , who parts with his m-oney , or any other thing of value , on the faith of the property , such purchaser obtains a valid title , purged of the fraud . This principle is not only well established , but society could hardly get along without it ; and it is most often and most liberally applied to the sales and transfers of negotiable securities . That the United States Bank of Pennsylvania had a title , which it could transmit , does not admit of a doubt . The sale negotiated by the Morris Canal and Banking Company might have been open to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell , and seem to have been in some way interested in the purchase ; but , surely , it is too late to object , after the Governor , who was the immediately authorized agent of the State , had , with a knowledge of all the facts , ratified the contract and delivered the bonds , and after the legislature , with all the facts before them , had interposed no objection , and had taken one third of the pur* chase money . The only possible question , therefore , is , whether the European bankers parted with their money in good faith ; and we are not aware of any evidence to the contrary . The legislature do not assert , that these bankers had notice , either actual or constructive , of any fact which would deprive them of the protection due to all bona fide purchasers of negotiable securities . The mere fact , that the bonds had not been paid for , even if known to the persons to whom they were pledged , would not have this effect . It would be monstrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been paid for , the holder can not give a good title to'it . Such a doctrine would overset half the sales made in the country . But we repeat , we have never seen any evidence , or any reason to believe , that even this fact was known to the foreign bankers . To do the legislature justice , both by their committee and by the act relating to this subject , they preserve a silence which is dignified and proper , if they have no satisfactory evidence of such notice , but believe that inquiries made afterwards may possibly elicit it . And this we understand to be their position . But even without such evidence , we can not doubt the equitable and legal claim of the holders of these bonds to be paid what is due on them , to the extent of the amount for which they were pledged . And we add , that we enter* tam as little doubt , that the State of Michigan will hereafter act according to this view of the subject , and adopt in reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already taken concerning the others . The State of Louisiana has loaned its credit to several banking corporations , the capital stock of which was secured by mortgages on real estate . The bonds issued by this State amount to ahout $ 22,000,000 , of which about $ 17,000,000 have been sold . They are all payable in England . The immense trade of New Orleans , the port of entry and export for the great valley of the Mississippi , and vou.Lviii. - No. 122. 18 // all its tributary waters , has , for a long time , caused capital to be in great demand there ; and this method of obtaining it , by means of loans to banks whose stock is secured by mortgages of real estate , was devised about twenty years ago . These banks were well managed , and from their profits a fund was accumulating , which , before the maturity of the bonds , would have been sufficient to redeem them . But unfortunately , New Orleans partook quite as much as any other city , and probably more than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , more than any other , the corresponding depression which followed . iDuring the period of prosperity , cotton , the great staple , bore very high prices ; property of all kinds was held at values merely factitious , and , confidence being great , and credit being easily obtained , the banks discounted an immense amount of paper , which was found to be bad when the day of trial came . The consequence has been , that the resources of the banks have been very much diminished , and the assets of one or more of them may not be sufficient to pay the bonds loaned to them by the State . We do not think the deficit will be large . Our limits do not allow us to state their condition particularly ; suffice it to say , that , if they are judiciously managed , we believe they can pay so large an amount of the bonds loaned to them , as to leave only a small sum to be paid by the State . In no part of the United States are there men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than in Louisiana . Nowhere is the necessity of preserving the public faith inviolate better known or more strongly felt . The State is gradually , but securely , rising from her great pecuniary difficulties ; property is attaining its just and safe value ; capital is again increasing rapidly , and , almost before they people are aware of it , they will again be in a prosperous condition . It is a high and clear duty of the people of this State to watch vigilantly over their crippled banks ; to see that their assets are honestly applied to the payment of the bonds ; and to adopt such legislative measures as shall secure and preserve the faith of the State towards its creditors , and procure for themselves again the use of the foreign capital which they so much need . We regret , that there should be any thing in the legislation of Louisiana upon this subject to require comment ; but we // feel bound to say , that an act passed at the last session of the legislature , in reference to the liquidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to very serious objection . The act we refer to was passed on the 5th of April , 1843 , and provides , that all debts due to the banks in question may be paid in State bonds issued by the banks , which bonds are to be received in payment at par . It must be borne in mind , that the capital stock of these banks consisted of the obligations of those who subscribed for the stock to pay the sums for which they subscribed , secured by mortgages on real estate ; and before these bonds were issued , it was provided by law , that these obligations of the stockholders , together with the mortgages by which they were secured , should be deposited in the offices of the banks for safe keeping , and as a guaranty for the reimbursement of the principal and interest of the bonds to be issued by the State ; and that all the hypothecary obligations , of whatever nature , subscribed by individuals in favor of the banks , should stand as collateral security for the payment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest which should accrue thereon . Now there is not the smallest doubt , that this law amounted to a contract made by the State and the banks with every bond-holder , that these mortgages should be held by the banks in trust , to secure the payment of the money loaned on the bonds . There is not a court in the country , which would hesitate so to declare upon these facts . And when the State placed these banks in liquidation , and thus took the control of their affairs , it was bound to guard this trust strictly and faithfully . It had no right to receive depreciated bonds at par , in payment for well secured debts which it held in trust for third persons . What would the law of Louisiana , or the courts of Louisiana , say to a tutor or guardian , who should receive depreciated paper in payment of a debt due to his ward , secured by mortgage ? Undoubtedly , they would say it was unfaithful administration , and would order him to make good the difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws condemn as unfaithful and unjust ? As a question of right , this matter admits of no doubt . As a question of the constitutional power of the legislature , it is equally clear . This law impairs the obligation of a plain contract between the State and the banks on the one part , and the bond-holders on // the other ; and it is therefore in conflict not only with the Constitution of the United States , but with the fundamental law of Louisiana , which prohibits the legislature from enacting any law impairing the obligation of a contract . There are other grave objections to this law , which our limits do not permit us to state . In regard to the States of Indiana and Illinois , we have very little to say .

" But both these States have immense natural resources , and a rapidly increasing population fully capable of developing them ; and they must become wealthy . At present , we believe , it is not in their power to comply with their engagements .

How much they can do , and in what ways it can best be done , the people of those States are themselves the most competent to decide . It is to he earnestly hoped , that , in making the decision , they will not forget that their own honor and the honor of the country is deeply involved in it . Their danger is , that they may postpone their measures too long . The great accumulation of interest is adding much every year to their burden . Every year they are becoming more and more accustomed to look upon the load as too heavy to be carried , and , therefore , to believe that no attempt ought to be made to lift any part of it . Such a feeling should be thrown off at once , and a manly vigor , such as the Western people are known to possess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have the ability to pay , and have never questioned the obligation of their promises , is also clear . Unforeseen difficulties and disasters have prevented them from keeping the promises on which so many have relied . They have now had time to survey their difficulties ; to recover from the amazement which their great disasters caused ; to examine their resources , and select the proper means to draw from them the needed supplies . The state of the country has become greatly improved . During the last four years , the people , made wiser by adversity , have been industrious and economical . They have consumed little , and produced a great deal . They have been blessed with fruitful seasons . The bankrupt law has relieved those who were insolvent , and set them at work . Caution and honesty pervade the trade of the country . The general aspect of affairs is becoming prosperous , with a promise of security and permanency . This is the time to act on this great and urgent subject . Delay is not only dishononible , but unwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insolvency is the most expensive of all conditions ; and this is quite as true of a commonwealth as of an individual . Its best arrangements , when in such a condition , can be only a succession of shifts to get round difficulties , // which it would be much wiser , and on the whole easier , to clear away at once . But without regard to the expediency of this course. ) it ought to be , and it will be , enough for the people of Pennsylvania and Maryland , that justice requires them to pursue it . They have not fallen into repudiation . They know the difference between honor and dishonor ; and they know , also , that the honor of their government is their own . They will not fail to ask themselves the question , what difference there is between denying the obligation of a contract , and admitting its obligation , but neglecting to keep it ; between an open repudiation of a debt , and fraudulently withholding the money . They will answer this question , as all rightminded men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both cases , the same injustice is done to the creditor ; that in both cases , the injustice is wilfully done by the debtor ; and that it is of very little consequence by what name it is called , or under the shadow of what pretence refuge is taken . There remains only one other case of which to speak , and no true-hearted American can speak of it without pain . We refer , of course , to those States whose legislatures have by public acts repudiated portions of their debts . Before noticing these acts at all in detail , we wish to say , what is not always remembered , either here or in foreign countries , that no legislature has repudiated a contract , without , at the same time , declaring it to have been made under such circumstances as not to be a valid obligation either in point of law or natural equity . It has been seen , how far we are from admitting that this plea amounts to a full defence . But we think it is of some importance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body in this country has denied the obligation of the State to pay an admitted debt . Reasons affecting the equity of the claims , and grounds which would be tenable if they existed , have always been relied on as the cause of repudiation . We are not aware , that it has been maintained anywhere , that the people of a State can cancel an obligation by their mere will . How is it possible , that the American people should ever listen to a doctrine so absurd ? How can they forget , that the binding force of a contract depends upon a law which neither kings nor people enacted or can repeal ? It comes from the awful Being who created and fashioned us , who sustains our life and judges // our actions . It was enacted by His will ; it is enforced by His power ; and the united will of the whole human race can not influence it . That which is unjust will remain so , though all mankind should call it just , and try to believe it . He who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern the nations upon earth ; and they who disregard their solemn obligations , and break their plighted faith , and repay confidence with deceit , and a trusting dependence on their honor with open injustice , must come to know and feel bitterly , that the high qualities they have set at naught are essential to their own prosperity ; that without them nothing is secure ; that embarrassment and loss , undeveloped resources which produce only discontent , and energies unexercised which create nothing but restlessness , are the inevitable destiny of a people guilty of bad faith . We believe the American people know this ; and because they know it , they who would lead them to do wrong have sought for fair pretences to make it seem right . The great mass of the people of the United States never have listened to these pretences , and , we firmly believe , never will listen to them . It is not strange , however , that some should have hearkened to them , and been led astray . But the time is fast approaching , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the ability to pay its debts , or any part of them , must begin to pay , or begin to be openly and knowingly fraudulent . Two ways are before them , the one leading to justice and honor , the other to repudiation and disgrace ; one or the other must be deliberately chosen , and that soon . It may assist us to discern the character of one of these paths , if we will attend for a moment to the true meaning of the word repudiation . In substance , it means confiscation . There is no just distinction between an act of the legislature requiring me to surrender a part of my property to the public use without compensation , and an act declaring that the State shall not , and will not , pay an equal amount which is due to me . No doubt , the former would alarm a greater number of persons than the latter ; but this only renders it less dangerous , if such things admit of degrees of danger . Analyze the laws , and see if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies . By the act first supposed , the State puts in motion its agents , and its civil // or military force , and transfers to itself the possession and use of that which is mine . But in so doing , it does no wrong . This is an act of eminent domain , such as every government performs occasionally ; and it would cease to be strong enough for any useful purpose , if it did not possess this power . But as soon as my property has been thus taken , the State owes me compensation for what I have surrendered . If it makes this compensation , all is right ; and my property has been lawfully appropriated to the use of the State . If it refuses to make it , then my property has been confiscated , and the State has heen guilty of a gross act of arbitrary power . Such are the principles involved in the law first supposed ; and if we consider the other , we shall find the same principles applicahle there . The State horrows my money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to whom I shall assign the obligation . It now owes to me a recompense for what it has received . This duty grows out of the re ceipt of my money hy the State , as , in the other case , it grew out of the receipt of my property . In the one case , the obligation to make compensation arises out of the mere justice of the claim , or , to use legal language , it is implied from the circumstances of the parties ; in the other case , the obligation arises from the express promise of the State . In both there is a perfect obligation , and the wrong done is the same ; namely , the violation of a perfect obligation to make compensation for money or property used hy the State . It may he added , that the wilful refusal to repay a loan to the State , made on the faith of a positive promise , contains an element of wrong which does not ordinarily helong to mere seizures and confiscations ; for it is treacherous , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the two cases approach still nearer to each other . The written obligation of the State , hy which it has promised to pay to me , or to any one to whom I shall assign such obligation , a sum of money , is , both in form and in substance , property . It is so known to the law , and it is so in fact . It may he the subject of a larceny or a trespass , of a sale or a hequest ; it is a thing of value , of which I have the rightful possession . And it is wholly immaterial to me , and to the question of right , whether the State takes it out of my possession hy force , or renders // it valueless by refusing to pay it . The only difference between the two would be , that in the one case I should lose the paper and ink of the obligation ; in the other case , I should not ; - a distinction which will hardly be deemed important . It is clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same ; and if we can feel a preference for one over the other , we should say without hesitation , let us have confiscation ; let us have seizures made and contributions levied openly , and with as much fairness as acts of such arbitrary power admit , rather than obtain possession of money under the confidence reposed in solemn promises , and then add treachery to injustice by repudiating them . The violent course is the more manly one . Certainly it would be desirable , that perfect justice to all men should he at once the only foundation and the object of human governments . This never has been , and perhaps never will be . But mankind have continued to live , and have enjoyed many , and perhaps most , of the blessings which grow out of the social state , under governments in whose constitutions it is easy to detect bad elements . But if there is one principle of policy which can be considered as settled , and as essential to all tolerable government , it is that which demands the absolute security of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as a just regard is shown for the rights of property ; when these are attacked , they will submit no longer , unless they are content to be slaves . This is a truth made familiar and practical to the people of this country by the war of the Revolution , which grew out of it , and by the written constitution of the Union , and of every State in the confederacy , which embodies and repeats it , and draws around it all the safeguards which human wisdom and foresight can supply . That private property shall not be applied to public uses without a just compensation ; that no man shall be deprived of his inheritance , except by the judgment of his peers and the standing laws of the land ; and that no State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of any contract , are principles as familiar to us as our own names . The anxious care which our fathers took of the right of property has not been in vain . The principle was planted in a friendly soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Anglo-Saxon family by // which this continent is peopled has a strong and honest attachment to property and its rights . It is not a blind and sordid love of wealth , debasing the mind and hardening the heart . As a people , we are not avaricious . We spend freely , and we give with the largest generosity . It is because we know the uses of property , that we value and love it . We want it for ourselves , that we may have a freer and larger scope for wise enjoyment and improvement . We want it for our children , that they may be secured , as far as we can secure them , from the evils of ignorance and dependence . We want it for the charities which are waging perpetual war upon vice , and alleviating the miseries of the human condition and for our churches , and colleges , and schools , which fit us to live in this world , and teach us humbly to hope for a better life hereafter . We want it for our country , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pride . We have connected with it - and we think it a natural connexion - all our ideas of justice , of social order , of personal security , and of the peaceful pursuit of happiness . flow great , then , must be the violence done to the sense of right of such a people , before they can bring themselves to injure these clear and well understood rights of property They must first be corrupted and degraded . In this country , all power emanates from them , and , at frequently recurring periods , returns to them to be delegated anew . And though it may sometimes happen , that they are not responsible for particular measures at the time they are taken , it can not happen , that any unjust thing , of sufficient importance to attract their attention , should be done by their delegated government , and remain without a remedy , except by their will . This subject of repudiation is too large to escape notice , and too important to be passed over without a distinct and strong exertion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever carried into effect , it must be because a majority of the people have adopted it . Can that evil day come without first corrupting the people ? What will then have become of that loyalty , which attaches us to our country with the bonds of strong affection ; of that love of national glory , and that quick sense of national disgrace , without which no people ever were , or deserved to be , great ; of that regard for justice , upon which alone rest our laws and all our social order and internal peace ; of that attachment to property , out of which // spring our habits of industry , our untiring energies , our progress in the arts , and comforts , and securities , and charities of life ? What will have become of all these , when a majority of this people come to look upon a particular body of men , embracing citizens as well as foreigners , as their lawful prey , to be pursued across the barriers of the constitution , and over every safeguard which national honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized and destroyed in the sight of the civilized world ? Let us not think , if we do this wrong , that we are no worse than others , for we are bound by more and stronger obligations than ever rested on any other people . The reverence of the Pilgrims for duty and conscience ; the lofty love of justice of Penn and his associates ; the pure equity , and constant regard for the rights of all , of Lord Baltimore and his colony ; the high honor and chivalric spirit of Smith , and Oglethorpe , and the Southern colonists , all call out to us , not to bring disgrace upon the children of such fathers . The providence of God , which has led us through a feeble infancy , and supported our steps in times of great trial , and raised up mighty men to supply our needs , and stand as examples in time to come ; which has made us millions from a handful , and poured upon us a tide of prosperity such as never blessed any other people , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of justice . The hopes of mankind , that the great experiment of selfgovernment may succeed , and its influences go forth all over the earth , till all men are raised to freedom and established in its secure enjoyment , beseech us not to violate that principle of justice , which is the corner-stone of every free government . They warn us , that we are extinguishing the light which had begun to enlighten the world ; that we are putting into the mouths of kings and nobles the bitter words of contempt against all republics ; that we are enabling them to say , not without an appearance of truth , that , because we have no hereditary nobility , we have no nobleness of soul that , because we have abolished the rights of primogeniture , we can no longer inherit the manly virtues of our fathers ; that in a republic nothing is fixed ; that it is not too much for such a government to attempt by its will to displace God 's eternal laws , for the sake of a base pecuniary advantage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by experience , // so educated by schools and churches , so prosperous and proud , will descend so low , how little can justly be expected of any other people who should attempt self-government ! Such is the language to which the friends of free government abroad are forced to listen , and to the truth of which they begin to assent . But it is not merely the regard which we owe to our fathers , our gratitude to God , and our duty to the principles of a free government , which urge upon us the rightful course . There is , besides , an enlightened and religious public opinion , which shines upon the world like the sun , and penetrates everywhere like the common air . No people can escape from its influence , or resist its power . It has already become the voice of the great family of civilized man . None can refuse to hear it . It comes from the heart of our common humanity , and so must reach the heart of all whom it addresses . As yet , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a deliberate and wilful violation of the plighted faith of great republics , by which distress and ruin are brought into numberless homes , is a subject on which it will speak ? Who can doubt , that it will find in such cases those elements in which all mankind have a common interest ? Have men ceased to entertain a profound regard for good faith ? Has fidelity to engagements ceased to be a virtue of importance ? Has common honesty become useless to mankind ? " Justice is the great standing policy of all civilized states . " All the world now knows it , and no nation can depart from this policy without dishonor and degradation . Let us , then , look upon this matter as it really is , and as all men must at last view it ; nay , as it stands now before that great tribunal where no popular pretexts can avail . There it is of no advantage to say , that many of these debts are held by rich and selfish foreign capitalists , who care for nothing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people . A wise man told us , long ago , that he did not listen with much credulity to any who spoke evil of those whom they were going to plunder ; and the world thinks little of the epithets we bestow on those who ask us only for justice . It demands of us , In what code of morals or laws do we find it written , that the circumstances or condition of a man furnish the least excuse for doing him a wilful wrong ? It asks us , if this is the spirit of our republican doctrine , that // all men are equal in the sight of the law . It asks how we can know the conditions and circumstances of our creditors ; whether we have the means of investigating them ; whether we have attempted to use those means ; how many widows and orphans , whose sole hope of earthly comfort rested upon our honor , we find recorded on our list ; how many aged men , past the season of active labor , have invested the savings of long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to relieve them . These are questions which the public opinion of Christendom already asks , and which must he answered ; and , unless we speedily act upon this subject as Justice and honesty require , the misery of our case will be , that we can make no answer , which will not involve us in deep disgrace . We may , it is true , attempt to plead , that , as to some of these debts , there are technical defences ; and that , in respect to others , the agents who were charged with their negotiation committed gross frauds on the States . Be it so . But the States selected their own agents , and trusted them ; and therefore every just principle requires , that the States should bear the consequences of these frauds . And as to the technical objections , if any such exist , no civilized government is worthy of its name , which would take advantage of them . A government straining after a technical objection to avoid payment of a just debt to a creditor who probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , except to see plainly expressed upon it , that " the faith and credit of the State was pledged " for its payment ! Such a government , we repeat it , is not worthy of the name . It is a great pettifogger , and not a government . The more powerful it is , the greater is its disgrace . The more proud it is , the greater is its meanness . The more enlightened it is , the greater is its sin . We have said , that , in substance , repudiation is confiscation . And what would future times say to a series of acts of confiscation , by which the great republics of the New World , in the middle of the nineteenth century , should appropriate millions of property to their own use ? The inquiry would be made , Was it enemy 's property , seized in time of war ; or was it taken in the midst of a revolution , as a signal and severe punishment for great crimes against the state ? If so , though opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in itself of very doubtful // propriety , the laws of nations do not positively forbid it , and the examples of nations in less favored times might afford some excuse for it . But what must be the reply ? It must be , that these acts were done in a time of profound peace that they fell alike upon citizens and upon strangers ; upon the child , who was too young to be otherwise than innocent , and women and aged men , who were too feeble to be feared ; that they were directed against no crime ; that they were justified by no principle ; that they were naked acts of arbitrary power , prompted by no motive except a base love of money . We can not bring ourselves to fear , that the American people , or any considerable part of them , will ever stand fairly before the world in judgment for this great crime . We know , that their dangers and difficulties are not small but we believe they will be met and overcome by the vigor and courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers undismayed . It is , however , the part of wisdom to look steadily at these dangers and difficulties , and it may aid us to do so , if we consider the effects already produced by repudiation . The first and most obvious effect of even the small favor with which this doctrine has been received is , that it has seriously impaired the pecuniary credit and resources of the country . The conduct of a few States has not only destroyed their own credit , and left their sister States very little to boast of , but has so materially affected the credit of the whole Union , that it was found impossible to negotiate in Europe any part of the loan authorized by Congress in 1842 . It was offered on terms most advantageous to the creditor ; terms which , in former times , would have been eagerly accepted ; and after going a begging through all the exchanges of Europe , the agent gave up the attempt to obtain the money in despair . It is impossible to believe , that any capitalist refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States to pay their debts . Nor is it credible , that the mere failure of a few of the State governments to meet their engagements would have produced this extraordinary effect . It is the truth , and it should sink into the heart of every American , that this loan was refused because Europe doubted the honor of this country . We say it should sink into the hearts of our countrymen ; but it should stir no anger there . We know , that the honor of this Union // is , and we firmly believe it ever will be , untarnished . We know the distinction bei*ween the States and the national government , and the hardship of most of the cases in which States have failed to perform their promises ; and we know , too , how little progress the odious and infamous doctrine of repudiation has made . But the word repudiation has been sounded in the ears of men in Europe , till they have begun to fear it is the settled doctrine of a majority of our people . Every failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a practical result of this theory . And it is , therefore , not at all wonderful , that the pecuniary credit of the country should first he brought into doubt , and then speedily destroyed . We have no right to be angry ; but we can not help feeling a deep concern both for the cause and the effect . For , aside from all considerations which affect our national honor , the pecuniary credit of a State is a matter of great public concern . All governments are liable to unforeseen and pressing wants , which can only be met and supplied through the public credit ; because these wants occur under such circumstances as render immediate and adequate supplies highly important , or absolutely necessary , and when taxation can not furnish them speedily enough to meet the pressing occasion . Our form of government does not exempt us from such wants . The two great political parties , which have ruled this country since the adoption of the Constitution , agree , that any accumulation of money raised by taxation is not to be thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the people than is absolutely necessary , for the time being , to enable the government to exercise economically its appropriate functions . But both parties have found , when in power , what , indeed , any party must always find , that there are always great obstacles in the way of a large and sudden increase of taxes . No people will submit to it willingly . It requires time to cOnvince them of its necessity and policy ; some time is necessary to enable them to accommodate their affairs and resources to the new demand . But the emergency leaves no time . Invasion or insurrection will not wait till public opinion has become reconciled to an increase of taxation , and till the public agents have gone through the slow process of obtaining a supply from that source . We have learned , also , from the experience of the last // three years , that even in time of peace , and when there are no extraordinary demands upon the energies of the country , it may not be possible to carry on the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have seen the national government become so embarrassed , that it could not have performed its most necessary functions , if relief had not been obtained by borrowing money . And we have had some opportunity to see what great pecuniary sacrifices must be made by the public , when money must be had while a shade rests on the credit of the borrower , and how important , in point of economy as well as honor , is an unstained reputation for fidelity to engagements . It concerns , therefore , the safety of every government , that the prompt and adequate resources of the public credit should not be trifled with and lost . The views which we have thus far presented respect our domestic condition and policy ; but the subject has a direct connexion with the foreign relations of the United States . It has always been admitted to be one of the duties , and , consequently , one of the rights , of the sovereign power in every nation , to see that gross injustice be not done to its subjects or citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a nature as to admit of legal remedy , and the courts of the land where it is done are open for redress , the sovereign is bound to wait till that redress has been sought for and refused in the highest court known to the law of that country . It is presumed , that justice will be done according to the course of the law of the land ; and this presumption can be removed only by an actual failure to obtain it in the highest court . No nation can answer for the equity of proceedings in all its inferior courts . It suffices to provide a supreme judicature , by which error and partiality may be corrected This presumption holds even when redress has been refused , unless the decision ' is palpably wrong , - in re minime dubid . But where the decision against the foreign claimant is evidently unjust , or when the law studiously withholds its aid , so that he can not obtain the fruits of a decision in his favor , or when the courts of the country are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hound to listen to the complaints of his subject thus injured , and either make indemnification , or seek it from the people hy whom the wrong has been done . It is apparent , therefore , that at no // 1844 . Debts of the States . distant day , this matter may become the occasion of negotiation with those governments whose subjects are interested in these debts . In such an event , the preliminary question would be , whether any courts of this country are open to foreigners seeking to recover their money of the States . As a general rule , the courts of the States can not entertain a suit against the States . There are only three exceptions known to us , and those are the State of Mississippi , which allows the holders of her bonds to bring suits against the State in her own Court of Chancery , and the States of Maryland and Virginia , which , in some instances , have allowed suits against themselves , but always , we believe , by special laws . How far the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binds the claimant to seek for redress in the courts of the land where the wrong was done , we are not prepared to say . So far as we know , it would be a new case . The chancellor of Mississippi is elected by the people every six years . He is , therefore , appointed by , and directly dependent on , one of the parties to the suit , and the case has been prejudged by the legislature . Now , if the rule should apply at all , and the parties should be held bound to seek for justice at the hands of a judge thus situated , it seems clear , that the decision would he much more open to doubt than in ordinary cases where the foreigner sues a citizen . If the presumption , that justice will he done according to the law of the land , should exist , it would certainly be weak and easily removed , and would be quite as likely to lead to disputes and contentions as to settle them. * It is manifestly of great importance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , for the sake of peace , the law of nations rajses in such cases . Without this presumption , the claim for redress must he made on the government of the United States , and the cases judged of and decided by the parties to the negotiation ; after which , if the foreign government is not satisfied with the result , it has * The conduct of the courts of the States in reference to British debts was a fruitful source of controversy between England and this country in 1792 , and it is notorious , that great amounts of those debts were not , and could not be , recovered , until after the establiebment of the courts of the United States . See the correspondence between Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Hammond , the minister of Great Britain . Wait 's . /hn . State Papers , 1789 to 1796 . Ware v. Hylton , 3 Dal . R. 199 . Elliot 's Debates , 142 - 144 , 282. // just cause for reprisals , and even for war . With it , the matter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign government is bound to be satisfied with its decision , unless so palpably wrong , as to give rise to the belief that it was corruptly made . We have said , that the claim for redress must be made upon the United States ; for we can not entertain the least doubt , that the national government is as much responsible for injustice done to foreigners by the States , as by individuals or corporations . Foreign states can know only that sovereign which has the power to make war and peace , to negotiate and enter into treaties . They can no more have relations with a State , than with a county . If the wrong is done within the territory of the United States , the United States must answer for it . But we believe our Constitution has not left us without the protection which is enjoyed by all other nations who have courts of justice open to foreigners seeking redress , and where they are bound to presume that justice will be done . The Constitution , as originally adopted , contained in Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The judicial power shall extend to controversies between a State , or the citizens thereof , and foreign States , citizens , or subjects . " The eleventh article of the amendments declares , that " The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another State , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign State . " Thus the original provision , as to suits against one of the United States by foreign states , was allowed to stand . Mr. Chief Justice Marshall , in his very able opinion in the case of Chishoim v. The State of Georgia , has stated the reason of this provision in such a manner as renders it quite applicable to our present purpose . He says , the Constitution contained this provision , " because , as every nation is responsible for the conduct of its citizens towards other nations , all questions touching the justice due to foreign nations or people ought to be ascertained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no doubt , therefore , that , by the very terms of the Constitution , a foreign state or sovereign may sue one of the United States in some court of the United States . Nor has the Constitution left it doubtful , or even left it for Congress to provide , which court it shall be ; for it contains // the following words ; " In all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers , and consuls , and those in which a State shall be a party , the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction . " We conceive , also , that a foreign state or sovereign may easily be placed in such a condition as to prosecute these claims . It is incident to the sovereign power , that it should be able to make itself the owner of such claims . The rules as to the purchase and sale of rights of action , which affect individuals , are not applicable to the sovereign . The law presumes , that the government of a country will not be guilty of champerty or maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assignment of a debt , and sue therefor in his own name . And we have no doubt , that the same law exists in all countries . It seems to follow , then , that , if the sovereign should take an assignment of a claim , and sue therefor in the court of a foreign country , the comity and respect due to the foreign sovereign would necessarily prevent the court from inquiring into the causes and motives of the assignment ; especially in a country where the common law exists , which makes all debts negotiable between the sovereign and a subject or citizen . And if this motive were inquired into , it would appear , that the foreign sovereign had taken the assignment merely to discharge a duty to his subjects by affording to them a remedy for a supposed wrong. * Certainly it would not be a subject of complaint or regret on our part , that this course should be taken , and that the foreign sovereign should submit the question to the decision of our own highest tribunal , instead of resorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing becoming necessary , we should look upon an application to the Supreme Court of the United States as not only practicable , but desirable ; and we should feel thankful for the existence of that principle in the public law , and that wise provision in our own Constitution , which enable us to ask foreigners to seek for justice in that * It has sometimes been suggested , in answer to the view taken by us , that the Judiciary Act has so limited the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States , that an indorsee or assignee of a chose in action can not sue in those courts , unless the assignor or indorser could himself sue there . in ; but that limitation has reference only to suits in the Circuit and District Courts . It does not touch the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court , which is conferred by the Constitution , and is not within the control of Congress . // high tribunal which was created to establish it ; a tribunal known to the world as elevated far above all State biases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the South , from the East and the West , across distances wider than half of Europe , and listen to sovereign States , as they contest their claims to territory and jurisdiction a tribunal which sits in judgment on the acts of the legislature of the nation , and decrees them to be valid or void a tribunal which is our own ark of safety , and to which offended Europe may come confidently , and obtain such justice as war and reprisals never gave , and never can give . We have now presented our views of this important subject . We fear , that intelligent men throughout the country have hitherto scarcely done their duty in regard to it . They have looked upon it as interesting only those States who are embarrassed by debts , and those which have taken false steps to escape from them . They have thought it a matter of national concern , only because it affects our character as a people . But they must no longer forget , that the rights of every honest man are violated by an unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been thought to be one of the advantages of a free government , that the individual is not merged in the state ; that each citizen is regarded and cared for , not merely because important to the state , but for the sake of his own welfare and happiness . For him , as a man , laws are enacted ; for him rights exist for him remedies are provided . He stands , before all tribunals , capable of claiming whatever is just . He means not to identify himself with any class , or community , or corporation . As a citizen , he has all the rights which can be had ; and , among those rights , he has eminently that of requiring the government , of which he is a constituent part , to do nothing which shall stain his honor , or shock his sense of justice , or lessen his patriotism , or deprive him of his share of the glory of his country ; and if any public act does this , he has as much right to feel aggrieved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , he walks abroad unharmed in his person ; but a violent constraint has been put upon his love of justice . It is true , his house and land are untouched ; but his country 's glory , for which he would at any time have sacrificed them , has been squandered and lost . He still has a country ; but that which made it lovely in his eyes has been defaced and destroyed . // Let every honest man , then , take care to do what in him lies to protect himself from this great wrong , and never rest , until the faith of his country has been redeemed , and its honor secured from reproach.
