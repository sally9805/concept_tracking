Pike , Albert , 1809-1891 : MUSINGS. from Musings ( 1848 ) This is my birth-day ! Twenty-five years old ! Methinks I stand midway between two deaths  --  The one , which was before my birth  --  the other , That which ere long will wrap me in its shades . And standing thus , how many thoughts spring forth  --  ( Even as stars , watching the eclipsed moon , Swarm out in heaven )  --  into the dark abyss Which time has made my heart . It is not long That I have walked the pathways of the world ; And yet the shadowy phantoms of dead hopes , Withered affections and unnurtured love , Throng round my path and in the memory  --  ( Even as glooms that throng around the stars , ) Making life dark , a lightless wilderness . ..... Alas for my unsandalled feet ! They bleed , Pierced by the thorns which strew the paths of life . I rushed into my youth with burning hopes , High aspirations after starry Fame . The hopes which were the planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time has hidden them With the pale shadow of his stern eclipse . And I have wandered many a day and long Amid the world  --  and tried its friendship well ; And I have struggled with cold poverty , And persecution , obloquy , and wrong , Until my heart grew bitter . I have made The desert , and the mountain snow , my bed  --  Spoken strange tongues , and congregated with The tameless savage of the wilderness , Until I felt as tameless as himself . The morning of my life has passed away , And clouds and dimness rest upon its shapes Of pain or pleasure . I am well content . The golden stars that smile above my head  --  The planet-peopled heaven  --  and the sea Glorious in terror or in beauty  --  all Of brilliant and magnificent on earth , Have yet a charm for me  --  and more than all , My quiet home ;  --  and she who makes that home A living paradise , will cheer me on  --  And I will live , and sing my humble strain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet music of my song .
