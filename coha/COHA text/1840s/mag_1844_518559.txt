txt THE editors of this collection are the Earl Fitswilliam and Lieut. - General Sir Richard Bourke , K.C.B. The original literary executors of Edmund Burke were Dr. Laurence and Dr. King , afterwards Bishop of Rochester . Mr. Burke 's widow died in 1812 , and by her last will bequeathed all the unpublished papers of her celebrated husband to Earl Fitzwilliam , the Bishop of Rochester , and the Right Hon. William Elliot . In the same year the bishop brought out the 9th and 10th volumes of the octavo edition of the works , and subsequently published six more , making a series of sixteen volumes ,  --  a reasonably voluminous monument to the genius of one statesman . The death of Mr. Elliot , and subsequently of the Bishop of Rochester , left the late Earl Fitzwilliam sole possessor of the papers , and they passed , in the course of nature and law , into the hands of the present earl . Of the other editor , and the importance of his aid , the following account is given in a note " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burke , and having been at school and college in England during the last eight years of the latter 's life , passed his vacations and what spare time he could command , in his kinsman s house . He has thus been enabled from his own observation , and the traditions of Beconsfield , to supply such portion of Burke 's personal history as is to be found in the notes to these letters . " The sources from which the contents of these four volumes are derived , and the principles on which the editors have proceeded , are thus sta-ted " Of the letters written by Burke , and now published , the most part were obtained many years ago , through the kindness of the persons to whom they were addressed , or of their representatives , in compliance with the applications of Dr. Laurence and the Bishop of Rochester . They were sent mostly in original , but a few in copy . Of the last , the greater part has been compared with the originals . A few additional letters in original have been obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are printed from corrected drafts found amongst Mr. Burke 's papers . Several letters , both to and from Mr. Burke , have , at various times since his death , and in various publications , been given by others to the world , without the authority of his executors *r trustees . The rule adopted in the present publication has beca , not to re-print any such letters , except in cases where their re-publication was essential to the illustration of his life or character at the period to which they belong . To the letters are added a few short pieces , which , though incomplete , are of some interest . Some papers written by his son Richard Burke , are also given in this collection . " The letters commence from the early date of 1744 , when Mr. Burke was but sixteen years of age . The letters to Richard Shackleton , the son of his quaker schoolmaster , will be read with interest , as specimens of his early style , and evidences of both the pious and the poetical temperament which characterized the productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shackleton are in verse . Some would , perhaps , Iind auguries of future renown in these juvenile rhymes , but we apprehend that many a boy who never grew up to be a great man has written better verses than the following By the foul river 's side we take our way , Where Liffey rolls her dead dogs to the sea ; Arrived , at length , at our appointed stand , By waves enclosed , the margin of the land , Where once the sea with a triumphing roar , Roll 'd his huge billows to a distant shore . There swam the dolphins , hid in waves unseen , Where frisking lambs now crop the verdant green . Secured by mounds of everlasting stone , It stands forever safe , unoverthrowa . In one letter to Shackleton is a striking account of Burke 's collegiate pursuits , which he describes as a succession of furors " You ask me if I read I deferred answering this question , till I could say I did ; which I can almost do , for this day I have shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have said this to you , with truth , a month ago . It would have been of great advantage to . me . My time was otherwise employed . Poetry , sir , nothing but poetry , could go down with me ; though I have read more than wrote . So you see I am far gone in the poetical madness , which I can hardly master , as , indeed , all my studies have rather proceeded from sallies of passion , than from the preference of sound reason ; and like the nature of all other natural appetites , have been very violent for a season , and very soon cooled , and quite absorbed in the succeeding . I have often thought it a humorous consideration to observe , and sum up , all the madness of this kind I have fallen into , this two years past . First I was greatly taken with natural philosophy ; which , while I should have given my mind to logic , employed me incessantly . This I call my furor mathematicus . But this worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the college ; as men , by repletion , cast off their stomachs all they have eaten . Then I turned back to logic and metaphysics . Here I remained a good while , and with much pleasure , and this was my furor logicus ; a disease very common in the days of ignorance , and very uncommon in these enlightened times . Next succeeded the Juror historicus , which also had its day , but is now no more , being entirely absorbed in the furor poeticus , , which ( as skilful physicians assure me ) is as difficultly cured ns a disease very nearly akin to it ; namely , the itch . " Burke became a member of the Middle Temple in 1747 , and although he was never called to the bar , lie prosecuted the study of law for some time , and with his accustomed vigor . Writing from Monmouth in 1751 , he remarks to Shaclileton " I hope my present studies may he attended with more symccess ; at least , I have this comfort , that though a middling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a middling lawyer . I read as much as I can , ( which is , however , but a little , ) and am but just beginning to know some-587 ' // thing of what I am about ; which , till very lately , I did not . This study causes no difficulty to those who already understand it , and to those who never will understand it ; and for all between those extremes God knows they have a hard task of it . So much is certain , though the success is precarious ; but that we must leave to Providence . " He gives an amusing and humorous account of the speculations which his residence at Monmouth , and afterwards at Turlaine , in Wilts , gave rise to . The companion of his studies at this time was a Mr. William Burke , a distant relative " The most innocent scheme they guessed was that of fortune-huntino ; and when they saw us quit the town without wives , then the lower sort sagaciously judged us spies to the French king . You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much talk ; but in a town very little frequented by strangers , with very little business to employ their bodies , and less speculation to take up their minds , the least thing sets them in motion , and supplies matter for their chat . What is much more odd is , that here , my companion and I puzzle them as much as we did at Monmouth ; for this is a place of very great trade in making of fine cloths , in which they employ a vast number of hands . The first conjecture which they made was that we were authors , for they could not fancy how any other sort of people could spend so much of their time at books ; but finding that we received from time to time a good many letters , they concluded us merchants ; and so , from inference to inference , they at last began to apprehend that we were spies , from Spain , on their trade . Our little curiosity , perhaps , cleared us of that imputation ; but still the whole appears very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that you be gentlemen , but I ask no questions ; ' and then praises herself for her great caution and secrecy . What makes the thing still better , about the same time we came hither , arrived a little person , equally a stranger ; but he spent a good part of his hours in shooting and ot.her country amusements - got drunk at night , got drunk in the morning , and became intimate with everybody in the village . He surprised nobody ; no questions were asked about him , because he lived like the rest of the world : but that two men should come into a strange country , and partake of none of the country diversions , seek no acquaintance , and live entirely recluse , is something so inexplicable as to puzzle the wisest heads , eveii that of the parish clerk himself . " From a letter of the same year we find that Mr. Burke then meditated a remove to America . But the same letter alludes to his essay on the " Sublime and Beautiful , " which had then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as of the " Vindication of Natural Society , " probably induced him to abandon the design of emigration . He sends Shackleton a copy of the " Sublime and Beautiful , " and says " This letter is accompanied by a little performance of mine , which I will not consider as ineffectual , if it contributes to your amusement . It lay by me for a good while , and I at last ventured it out . It has not been ill received , so far as a matter on so abstracted a subject meets with readers . Will you accept it as a sort of offering in atonement for my former delinquencies l If I would not have you think that I have forgot you , so neither would I have your father , to whom I am under obligations that I neither can nor wish to shake off . I am really concerned for the welfare of you all . and for the credit of the school where I received the education that , if I am anything , has made me so . ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aston ( C. J. of the Common Pleas in Ireland ) to Mr. Secretary Hamilton . The editors observe that it is given to ihe public " as evidence , that eighty years ago there were disturbances in Ireland , arising from the very same causes as at present ; and as perversely attributed then , as now , to matters wholly foreign to their real origin . " We believe the following to be the language of truth and soberness , and , mutatis mutandis , to be as true and instructive now , as in 1762 " In obedience to your commands , I have the satisfaction to assure you , that upon the strictest inquiry into the causes of the many outrages committed in the different parts of the province of Munster , there did not appear to me the least reason to impute those disturbances to disaffection to his majesty , his government , or the laws in general ; but , on the contrary , that these disorders really , and not colorably , took their rise from declared complaints and grievances of a private nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumults , were the motives avowed by the rioters themselves ; and not broached ostensibly only , when , in fact , some other cause or expectation was the latent spring of their actions . Whether the charge was burning houses , killing cattle , destroying mills , levelling inclosures , or disturbances of a different nature , to the possessions of others , no opportunity was missed of inquiring into the supposed inducement to the committing such an outrage ; and it ever turned out to be the result of some local dissatisfaction , which these miserable delinquents affected to act upon by way of redress , though they ever pursued vindictive , rather than relevant measures , and were extravagantly daring and violent in the execution of them . The subject-matter of their grievance was , chiefly , such as-price of labor too cheapof victuals too dear-of land excessive and oppressive . In some instances their resentment liroceeded against particular persons , from their having taken mills or bargains over the head of another , ( as it is vulgarly called , ) and so turning out , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such was the nature of their complaints ; to redress these , they acted in a very open and violent manner , and might , I think , have fallen under the statute of 25th Edward III. , by carrying their schemes to such an excess as to magnify their crimes into a constructive treason , of levying war against the king . But yet , daring as their proceedings were , there was no ingredient of any previous compact against government , or , as I may say , the original sin of high treason . I believe , indeed , that if the Dey of Algiers had landed , with any forces and a stand of arms , at such a time , people in such a temper of mind would have been readily induced to join him , or a prince of any religion , either for the sake of revenge , redress , or exchange of state , rather than continue in their conceived wretchedness . In the perpetration of these late disorders , ( however industriously the contrary has been promoted , ) papist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . were promiscuously concerned ; and , in my opinion , the majority of the former is with more justice to be attributed to the odds of number in the country , than the influence arising from the difference of principles . " It is curious to find , that in the south of Ireland , in 1762 , as in Wales lately , the genius of insurgency assumed the feminine gender , exacting an oath of fidelity to " Sive and her children , " as the Welsh peasantry recently did to " Rebecca and her daughters . " There is given an unfinished paper of Mr. Burke 's , relative to the Irish disturbances of the same period , in which he traces those in the county of Cork entirely to a local cause , and to the machinations of a crazy protestant attorney . Probably this race of incendiaries is not yet extinct in Munster . There are a good many letters in relation to a pension of 3001. a year , which Mr. Burke obtained in 1763 , in the viceroyalty of Lord Halifax , to compensate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe : " In those days such pensions were hy no means unusual , and were held , without imputation or blame , by persons of station and character . Burke had been about two years with Secretary Hamilton in Ireland , when this pension was granted ; and he had during that time been actively and , no doubt , usefully employed in the service of government , though without any ostensible office or any salary . His connexion with Hamilton , as has been mentioned in a former note , had been of earlier date , beginning in 1759 ; and in applying for the pension , Hamilton probably had reference to the services which Burke had rendered him , prior to his appointment as chief secretary in Ireland . " The following stipulation of a man of genius with a minister of state , is an interesting proof of the reluctance with which a great intellect bows itself to the yoke imposed either by necessity or ambition . Burke writes thus to Hamilton in March , 1763 " You may recollect , when you did me the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you found me with the little work we spoke of last Tuesday , as a sort of rent-charge on my thoughts . I informed you of this , and you acquiesced in it . You are now so generous , ( and it is but strict justice to allow , that upon all occasions you have been so , ) to offer to free me from this burthen . But , in fact , though I am extremely desirous of deferring the accomplishment , I have no notion of entirely suppressing that work ; and this upon two principles , not solely confined to that work , but which extend much farther , and indeed to the plan of my whole life . Whatever advantages I have acquired , and even that advantage which I must reckon as the greatest and most pleasing of them , have been owing to some small degree of literary reputation . It will be hard to persuade me that any further services which your kindness may propose for me , or any in which my friends may wish to cooperate with you , will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive the same reputation . I am fully sensible , that this reputation may be ' at least as much hazarded , as forwarded , by new publications . But because a certain oblivion is the consequence , to writers of my inferior class , of an entire neglect of publication , I consider it such a risk as sometimes must be run . For this purpose , some short time , at convenient intervals , and especially at the dead time of the year , will be requisite to study and consult proper books . These times , as you very well know , can not be easily defined ; nor indeed is it necessary they should . The matter may be very easily settled by a good understanding between ourselves ; and by a discreet liberty , which I think you would not wish to restrain , nor I to abuse . I am not so unreasonable , nor absurd enough , to think I have any title to so considerable a share in your interest as I have had , and hope still to have , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I am conscious that my best and most continued endeavors are of no very great value . I know that your business ought , on all occasions , to have the preference ; to be the first and the last , and , indeed , in all respects , the main concern . All I contend for is , that I may not be considered as absolutely excluded from all other thoughts , in their proper time and due subordination ; the fixing the times for them , to be left entirely to yourself . " It would appear that Hamilton agreed to these stipulations , and that the pension was received on the faith of them . However , the connexion between Hamilton and Burke did not subsist long . It would appear that the former was too exacting , and the latter not sufficiently pliable . In a subsequent letter Burke thus addresses the secretary " So far as to the past : with regard to the present , what is that unkindness and misbehavior of which you complain My heart is full of friendship to you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most intelligent men have fixed , as a proof of friendship and gratitude , in which I have been deficient , or in which I threaten a failure I What you blame is only this ; that I will not consent to bind myself to you , for no less a term than my whole life , in a sort of domestic situation , for a consideration to be taken out of your private fortune ; that is , to circumscribe my hopes , to give up even the possibility of liberty , and absolutely to annihilate myself forever . I beseech you , is the demand , or refusal , the act of unkindness* If ever such a test of friendship was proposed , in any instance , to any man living , I admit that my conduct has been unkind ; and , if you please , ungrateful . " The secretary thus replied " Dear Sir ,  --  As you thought it polite to answer my letter , I conclude you would think it impolite if I did not at least acknowledge yours . I have only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , and what is more , as I wish to think , upon a subject on which I am so much hurt . I approve entirely of your idea , that we should not write , in order to avoid altercation ; and , for the same reason , I am of opinion we should not converse . Yours , &amp;c . " In 1765 Mr. Burke escaped the golden chain . No passage in the biography of a public man affords a more instructive warning to rising talents than // the fate of Mr. Burke 's connexion wfth the Irish government under Lord Halifax , supposing him to represent truly in his letters his relations with Mr. Hamilton , and the losses of time and reputation he sustained in consequence of them . He thus writes to Mr. J. Henry Hutchinson , subsequently Provost of Trinity College , Dublin " You are already apprized , by what Mr. H. has himself caused to be reported , that he has attempted to make a property  --  a piece of household goods of me , an attempt , in my poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice ; for he would fain have had a slave , which , as it is a being of no dignity , so it can be of very little real utility to its owner ; and he refused to have a faithful friend , which is a creature of some rank , and ( in whatever subject ) no trivial or useless acquisition . But in this he is to be excused ; for with as sharp and apprehensive parts , in many respects , as any man living , he never iii reality did comprehend , even in theory , what friendship or affection was ; being , as far as I was capable of observing , totally destitute of either friendship or enmity , but rather inclined to respect those who treat him ill. * * * * * Six of the best years of my life he took me from every pursuit of literary reputation , or of improvement of my fortune . In that time he made his own fortune , ( a very great one , ) and he has also taken to himself the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , you may easily conceive how much I felt at seeing myself left behind by almost all my contemporaries . There never was a season more favorable for any man who chose to enter into the career of public life ; and I think I am not guilty of ostentation , in supposing my own moral character , and my industry , my friends and connexions , when Mr. H. first sought my acquaintance , were not at all inferior to those of several whose fortune is at this day upon a very different footing from mine . " " This place , called Gregories in the more ancient deeds , and Gregories or Butler 's Court in some of later date , continued from this time in the family of Burke , until the death of his widow in 1812 . It is situated about a mile from Beaconsfield , a market and post town in Buckinghamshire , twenty-three miles from London . Upon his first residing there , Burke dated his letters from Gregones , but soon after , probably to avoid the necessity of giving the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , he dated from Beaconsfield ; and continued to do so to the end of his life , but latterly spelling it Beconsfield . A considerable portion of the estate was wood-land , and there was a detached farm ; but surrounding the house , which was large and handsome , there was a considerable extent of arable and pasture land , which Burke delighted to cultivate , seeking in that occupatiori the most agreeable relaxation from the toils and vexations of politics . Some of his letters to the celebrated agriculturist , Arthur Young , given in this collection , show with what earnestness Burke entered into the details of his farm . The proximity of this place to London rendered it the easy resort of the most distinguished characters of the time , who sought Burke 's society or advice . Here , also , he received with the greatest hospitality and attention , the numerous foreigners who desired his acquaintance . It was his greatest pleasure to accompany these strangers to the most beautiful places of this beautiful country , and especially to Windsor , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of British kings . When the French revolution drove a large portion of the nobility and clergy of France to England , Burke 's house received many of the most distinguished , during any length of time they chose to remain ; and for some , he procured lodgings in the town of Beaconsfield , requesting them to use his table as their own . Some years after her husband 's death , Mrs. Burke sold the estate to Mr. Dupr6 , of Wilton Park , near BeaThere are several interesting letters in the first consfield ; reserving the occupation of the house , gardens , and some of the grass land of Gregories , volume , from James Barry , the historical painter , for her life .

" qwq discussion than that of the House of Commons , I should use exactly the same freedom , making myself in the same manner , liable to all the consequences . You observe very rightly , that no fair man can believe me to be the author of Junius . Such a supposition might tend , indeed , to raise the estimation of my powers of writing above their just value . Not one of my friends does , upon that flattering principle , give me for the writer ; and when my enemies endeavor to fix Junins upon me , it is not for the sake of giving me the credit of an able performance . * * * For some years , and almost daily , they have been abusing me in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as being the author of the letters in question . I have never once condescended to take the least notice of their invectives , or publicly to deny the fact upon which some of them were grounded . At the same time , to you , or to any of my friends , I have been as ready as I ought , in disclaiming in the most precise terms , writings , that are as superior perhaps to my talents , as they are most certainly different in many essential points from my regards and my principles . " Still more positively and distinctly he denies the authorship in a subsequent letter " I have , I dare say , to nine-tenths of my acquaintance , denied my being the author of Junius , or having any knowledge of the author , as often as the thing was mentioned , whether in jest or earnest , in style of disapprobation or of compliment . Perhaps I may have omitted to do so to you , in any formal manner , as not supposing you to have any suspicion of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not the author of Junius , and that I know not the author of that paper , and I do authorize you to say so . " This valuable collection of letters is not to be disposed of in one notice . It abounds with interesting documents , and it is an additional proof , if proof were wanting , of the fertility of Mr. Burke , that , after sixteen volumes of his works have been published , four more are now given to the world , which will add to his reputation , and be received as an important contribution to literature . The importance of the matter contained in these volumes excites our surprise that it has been so long suffered to remain unpublished . Upon all the great political events during the life of Mr. Burke , the transactions in India , America , France , and Ireland , will . be found numerous literary documents , all deserving of attentive perusal , and many so elaborately written as to claim the consideration of state papers . The greater number of the letters are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of his various illustrious correspondents . Opening the second volume we light upon a remarkable letter addressed to the Marquis of Rockingham . The date is August 23d , 1775 , when this country had just been fully committed to the fatal quarrel with the American States . The design of Mr. Burke is to incite his noble correspondent to make one last great effort at the head of his friends , to avert impending evils . The state of popular feeling at the period is thus described " As to the good people of England , they seem to partake every day , more and more , of the character of that administration which they have been induced to tolerate . I am satisfied , that within a few years , there has been a great change in the national character . We seem no longer that eager , inquisitive , jealous , fiery people , which we have been formerly , and which we have been a very short time ago . The people look back without pleasure or indignation , and forward without hope or fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or expects any good from those which are in preparation ; but it is a cold , languid opinion , like what men discover in affairs that do not concern them . It excites to no passion ; it prompts to no action . " He then proceeds to show that no improvement is to be looked for , unless individuals of authority and mental power aspire to create the national spirit that is wanting . In the following passage we have a great truth written for statesmen of all times " I do not think that weeks , or even months , or years , will bring the monarch , the ministers , or the people , to feeling . To bring the people to a feeling , such a feeling , I mean , as tends to amendment , or alteration of system , there must be plan and management . All direction of public humor and opinion must originate in a few . Perhaps a good deal of that humor and opinion must be owing to such direction . Events supply materials ; times furnish dispositions ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . I never yet knew an instance of any general temper in the nation , that might not have been tolerably well traced to some particular persons . If things are left to themselves , it is my clear opinion that a nation may slide down fair and softly from the highest point of grandeur and prosperity to the lowest state of imbecility and meanness , without any one 's markimig a particular period in this declension , without asking a question about it , or in the least speculating on any of the innumerable acts which have stolen in this silent and insensible revolution . Every event so prepares the subsequent , that , when it arrives , it produces no surprise , nor any extraordinary alarm . I am certain that if pains , great and immediate pains , are not taken to prevent it , such must be the fate of this country . " He then , with earnest eloquence , presses upon Lord Rockiugham the duty of taking a decided step before the meeting of Parliament " As sure as we have now an existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your friends in an unprepared state , nothing hut disgrace arid ruin can attend the cause you are at the head of . Parliament will plunge over head and ears . They will vote the war with every supply of domestic and foreign force . They will pass an act of attainder ; - they will lay their hands upon the press . The ministers will even procure addresses from those very merchants , who , last session , harassed them with petitions ; and then ,  - -  what is left for us , but to spin out of our bowels , under the frowns of the court and the hisses of the people , the little slender thread of a peevish and captious opposition unworthy of our cause and ourselves , and without credit , concurrence , or popularity in the nation ! * * I am confident that 591 // your lordship considers my importunity with your usual goodness . You will not attribute my earnestness to any improper cause . ii shall , therefore , make no apology for urging again and again , how necessary it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take under immediate deliberation , what you are to do in this crisis . Nothing like it has happened in your political life . I protest to God , I think that your reputation , your duty , and the duty and honor of us all , who profess your sentiments , from the highest to the lowest of us , demand at this time one honest , hearty effort , in order to avert the heavy calamities that are impending ; to keep our hands from blood , and if possible , to keep the poor , giddy , thoughtless people of our country from plunging headlong into this impious war . If the attempt is necessary , it is honorable . You will , at least , have the comfort that nothing has been left undone , on your part , to prevent the worst mischief that can befall the public . Then , and not before , you may shake the dust from your feet , and leave the people and their leaders to their own conduct and fortune . I see , indeed , many , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , or greater , give way to a regular series of judicious and active exertions . This is no time for taking public business in their course and order , and only as a part in the scheme of life , which comes and goes at its proper periods , and is mixed in with occupations and amusements . It calls for the whole of the best of us ; and everything else , however just or even laudable at another time , ought to give way to this great , urgent , instant concern . Indeed , my dear lord , you are called upon in a very peculiar manner . America is yours . You have saved it once , and you may very possibly save it again . The people of that country are worth preserving : and preserving , if possible , to England . " The same principle of the wisdom of creating events instead of waiting for them , is enforced in a letter of Mr. Fox to Burke , dated from Chatsworth , 1777 " With respect to public affairs , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for events , to form a plan of operations ; now , my opinion , is , that no event likely to happen , can be anything to the purpose ; but from the days of Jemosthenes down to ours , it has ever been the resource of all indolent people to prefer the waiting of news to the taking of any decisive measure . Is Philadelphia taken V No* hut there are hopes of it , ' &amp;c. , is something like , though twenty thousand times more futile , than the inquiries about Philip 's death , which are so well treated in the first Philippic . " Mr. Burke 's pen was of course in constant request amongst his friends in both houses . Here are the Duke of Richmond 's instructions for drawing up a protest " We all want a protest . I wished to see you here to-night , and desired C. Fox to beg you to come to me . I send you a mere skeleton , just to point out the line , and beg you will fill it up with good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gall ; it must be temperate and strong , full and short , and finished early . I would give such a work to you alone . " Our next quotation is from a letter to Robertson , acknowledging the present of a copy of his History of America , ' then opportunely pub-lished " The part which I read with the greatest pleasure is the discussion on the manners and characters of the inhabitants of that new world . I have always thought with you , that we possess , at this time , very great advantages towards the knowledge of human nature . We need no longer go to history to have it in all its periods and stages . History , from its comparative youth , is but a poor instructor . When the Egyptians called the Greeks children in antiquities , we may well call them children ; and so we may call all those nations which were able to trace the progress of society only within their own limits . But now the great map of mankind is unravelled at once , and there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinement , which we have not , at the same instant , under our view : - The very different civility of Europe and of China ;  --  the barbarism of Persia and Abyssinia ; .  --  the erratic manners of Tartary and Arabia ;  --  the savage state of North America and of New Zealand ; - indeed , you have made a noble use of the advantages you have had . You have employed philosophy to judge of manners , and from manners you have drawn new resources for philosophy . I only think that , in one or two points , you have hardly done justice to the savage character . " Burke was the great public instructor of his time , " the school-master abroad " in his generation . A letter to a member of the Bell Club , Bristol , is full of sound advice to constituents , and is distinguished by the usual high moral tone of the writer . We give an extract " You will , therefore , not listen to those who tell you that these matters are above you , and ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king has put them . The public interest is more your business than theirs ; and it is from want of spirit , and not from want of ability , that you can become wholly unfit to argue or to judge upon it . For in this very thing lies the difference between freemen and those that are not free . In a free country , every man thinks he has a concern in all public matters ; that he has a right to form , and a right to deliver an opinion upon them . They sift , examine , and discuss them . I'hey are curious , eager , attentive , and jealous ; and by making such matters the daily subjects of their thoughts and discoveries , vast numbers contract a very tolerable knowledge of them , and some a very considerable one .

If upon any particular occasion you should be roused , you will not know what to do . Your fire will be a fire in straw , fitter to waste and consume yourselves , than 592 // to warm pr enliven anything else . You will be only a giddy mob , upon whom no sort of reliance is to be had .

But such must be the events of a war , from the very nature of which no sort of good whatsoever to any side would , or ever could , possibly arise . " There is a letter from the celebrated Boswell , manifesting a strong disposition to do for Mr. Burke what he did for Dr. Johnson , and great is the pity that Burke had not such a biographer . Boswell writes thus " Upon my honor I began a letter to you some time ago , and did not finish it , because I imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former occasion , when he thought your party was coming into administration ; and being one of your old barons of Scotland , my pride could not brook the appearance of paying my court to a minister , amongst the crowd of interested expectants on his accession . At present , I take it for granted that I need be under no such apprehension ; and , therefore , I resume the indulgence of my inclination . This may be , perhaps , a singular method of beginning a correspondence ; and , in one sense , may not be very complimentative . Bnt I can sincerely assure you , dear sir , that I feel and mean a genuine compliment to Mr. Burke himself . It is generally thought no meanness to solicit the notice and favor of a man in power ; and , surely , it is much less a meanness to endeavor by honest means , to have the honor and pleasure of being on an agreeable footing with a man of superior knowledge , abilities , and genius . " Edmund Burke is worthy all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is unquestionably her greatest ornament . To the interest-of Ireland be was enthusiastically devoted , and in her cause he was always ready to sacrifice the objects dearest to his ambition . The pressure of the American war compelled the ministry to think of some relaxation of the commercial chains of Ireland , and Lord North introduced some propositions with that view , which are thus strikingly alluded to by Mr. Burke in a short note to his friend Mr. Champion , of Bristol " I sent a letter to Merchants ' Hall , with the resolutions relative to Ireland . IDo not be afraid , the things pretended to be done for Ireland are frivolous ; and if they were considerable , they XXII . LIVING AGE . VOL .

" The editors make the following explanatory remarks , as true as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These were propositions introduced by Lord North for removing certain restrictions from the trade of Ireland . They were at first well received on both sides of the house , as being founded in justice , and a liberal policy required by the circumstances of the time . Subsequently , * the jealousy of the English manufacturers and traders was so strongly expressed , and so much influenced the conduct of many of the representatives of those interests in parliament , that in the bill founded on the resolutions , it was thought necessary , towards the end of the session , to give up most of the advantages originally intended for Ireland . Notwithstanding Mr. Burke 's earnest representations and advice , the merchants of Bristol were amongst the loudest a , ainst thin measure ; and here began the difference between him and his constituents , which led to his defeat at the general election of 1780 . " In a letter to Mr. Noble , referring to the same proposed measures , Mr. Burke generously ob-serves " To represent Bristol is a capital object of my pride at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can value myself , but that honorable situation . If I should live to the next general election , and if being a member of parliament at that time should be desirable to me , I intend to offer myself again to your approbation .

I do not wish to represent Bristol , or to represent any place , but upon terms that shall be honorable to the chosen and to the choosers . I do not desire to sit in parliament for any other end than that of promoting the common happiness of all those who are , in any degree , subjected to our legislative authority ; and of binding together , in one common tie of civil interest and constitutional freedom , every denomination of men amongst us .

Mr. Burke honorably declined the gift , saying , amongst other things , in reply " If I am so happy as to have contributed in the smallest degree to the relief of so large and respectable a part of my countrymen as the Roman Catholics of Ireland , from oppressions that I always thought not only grevious to them , but very impolitic with regard to the state , I am more than enough rewarded .

It was my wish that the objects of such a settlement should be much more exten*sive , and- have gone not only beyond the Irish Sea , but beyond the Atlantic Ocean . But since it has happened otherwise , I hope we shall be wise enough to make the most of what is left . " On the same subject , in a letter to Dr. John Curry , he Writes thus " My endeavors in the Irish business , in which I was ,  --  indeed , very active and very earnest , both - in public and in private , were wholly guided by an uniform principle , which is interwoven in my nature , and which has hitherto regulated , and I hope - will continue to regulate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of public injustice - and oppression ; the worst species of which are - those which , being converted into maxims of state , and blending themselves with law and jurisprudence , corrupt the very fountains of all equity , and subvert all the purposes of government .

The writer is George Goold , Esq. , grandfather , a note informs us , of the present baronet of the same name . The letter is dated from Cork , 1781 " You no doubt have known our alarm must be much , from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Sir John Irwine , commander-in-chief , came down here on the occasion . One of his aides-dc-camp came to me a few days since , reporting that Sir John had been in much distress for money , as apprehension had run among the people , and he could not find guineas for Latouche 's paper . I answered him that I was singularly happy to have in my power some supply . I gave him about five hundred guineas , and desired his informing Sir John , I would give to him my last guinea , and support his Majesty 's service , &amp;c . The next morning I had General Baugh and Lcrd Ross , to announce Sir John 's feelings at my doing this . They ( that is , the general ) wanted some guineas , and such I gave him . A day or two after , I had a message from the general by his aide-dccamp , to know if I could supply them with nioney for his Majesty 's services . 1 answered him by letter , and be , in consequence sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send you . My interview with Sir John was on the 10th , and , I find , my word was conveyed by Sir John 's letter to Lord Carlisle . The letter I received this day has been in consequence . Yesterday morning , I paid to Captain James Allen , aide-de-camp , five thousand guineas . My letter has been sent to Dublin , and probably may go further . Hence , you see , a Roman Catholic stepped forth in the hour of dan* ger to support the government , when others would not risk a guinea . Your sense of us is , in this small instance , proved . I am singularly happy to have had in my power the doing what I have done ; and hope our legislators will see that there are not a people more steady in this quarter , nor a people that less merit a rod of severity , by the laws , than we . I took in my fellow-subjects in my report , at the time when I took every shilling in advance on my own shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Scotch clergyman , with reference to the Nopopery riots at Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1779 . The letter is a powerful rebuke to the spirit of persecution , and a lesson which may still be read . with profit by many a fanatic preacher and furious pamphleteer . " Ihave lived long enough , and largely enough 591 // in the world , to know for certain , that the religion which ( I believe most firmly ) the Divine wisdom has thought proper to introduce , for its improvement , not for its deprivation , contains in all its parts ,  --  ( perhaps I am presumptuous in thinking so , but , mixed as I think they are all with a great deal of human imperfections , ) - so much of good , as not wholly to disappoint the wise purposes for which it was intended , and abundantly to merit my esteem and veneration . I think so of the whole Christian church having , at the same time , that respect for all the other religions , even such as have mere human reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I , profess ,  --  that I could not justify to myself to give to the synagogue , the mosque , or the pagoda , the language which your pulpits so liberally bestow upon a great part of the Christian world . If , on this account , people call me a Roman Catholic , it gives me not the smallest disturbance . They do me too much honor , who will aggregate me as a member to any of these illustrious societies ; for I do not aspire to the glory of being a zealot for any particular national church , until I can be quite sure I can do it honor by my doctrine or my life , or in some better way than by a passionate proceeding , against those who are of another description . I am not yet ripe for such confidence in myself . " The third volume of this Correspondence consists principally of letters relative to the French Revolution , some of which are curious , while all are illustrative of the furious zeal with which Burke threw himself into the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bold confidential criticisms of Sir P. Francis upon the most celebrated of his friend 's anti-revolutionary pamphlets . The following is an extract of a letter from Francis , dated Feb. 19 , 1790 . A note informs us that the printed paper referred to was probably a proof sheet of the " Reflections , " which were not published until October , 1790 " Waiving all discussion concerning the substance and general tendency of this printed letter , I must declare my Qpinion , that what I have seen of it is very loosely put together . In point of writing , at least , the manuscript you showed me first , was much less exceptionable . Remember that this is one of the most singular , that it may be the most distinguished , and ought to be one of the most deliberate acts of your life .. Your writings have hitherto been the delight and in. - struction of your own country . You now undertake to correct and instruct another nation ; and your appeal , in effect , is to all Europe . Allowing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not deny that it ought to be done with special deliberation in the choice of the topics , and with no less care and circumspection in the use you niake of them . Have you thoroughly considered whether it be worthy of Mr. Burke ,  --  of a privycouncillor ,  --  of a man so high and considerable in the house of Commons as you are ,  --  and holding the station you have obtained in the opinion of the world , to enter into a war of pamphlets with Dr. Price ? If he answered you , as assuredly he will , ( and so will many others , ) can you refuse to reply to a person whom you have attacked ? If you do , you are defeated in a battle of your own provoking , and driven to fly from ground of your own choosing . If you do not , where is such a contest to lead you , hut into a vile and disgraceful , though it were ever so victorious , an altercation ? Dii meliora . ' But if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sarcasm ; let everything you say be grave , direct , and serious . In a case so interesting as the errors of a great nation , and the calamities of great individuals , and feeling them so deeply as you profess to do , all manner of insinuation is improper , all gibe arid nick-name prohibited . Iii my opinion , all that you say of the queen is pure foppery . If she be a perfect female character , you ought to take your ground upon her virtues . If she be the reverse , it is ridiculous in any but a lover , to place her personal charms in opposition to her crimes . Either way , I know the argum cut must proceed upon a supposition ; for neither have you said anything to establish her moral merits , nor have her accusers formally tried and convicted her of guilt . On this subject , however , you can not I ) ut know that the opinion of the world is not lately , but has been many years , decided . But in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on no other topics than those of gallantry , and beauty , and personal accomplishments , you virtually abandon the proof and assertion of her innocence , which you know is the point substantially in question . Pray , sir , how long have you felt yourself so desperately disposed to admire the ladies of Germany I despise and abhor , as much as you can do , all personal insult and outrage , even to guilt itself , if I see it , where it ought to be , dejected and helpless ; but it is in vain to expect that I , or any reasonable man , shall regret the sufferings of a Messalina , as I should those of a Mrs. Crewe , or a Mrs. Burke ; I mean all that is beautiful or virtuous amongst women . Is it nothing but outside ? Have they no moral minds ? Or are you such a determined champion of beauty as to draw your sword in defence of any jade upon earth , provided she be handsome ? Look back , I beseech you , and deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office that perfectly becomes you . If I stop here , it is not for want of a multitude of objections . The mischief you are going to do yourself , is , to my apprehension , palpable . It is visible . It will be audible . I snuff it in the wind . I taste it already . I feel it in every sense ; and so will you hereafter ; when , I vow to God , ( a most elegant phrase , ) it will be no sort of consolation for me to reflect that I did everything in my power to prevent it . I wish you were at the devil for giving me all this trouble ; and so farewell ! " That Burke , whose mind was at this period in a state of irritability amounting to disease , felt such criticisms as the foregoing intolerably galling , may be gathered from the letter which we now proceed to quote , addressed to Sir P. Francis by Richard Burke , inclosing his father 's answer to Sir Philip 's severe strictures . The peevish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pompous manner in which the writer asserts his father 's claims to supreme wisdom . Richard Burke writes thus : " You must conceive that your letter , combating many old ideas of his , and proposing many new ones , could not fail to set his mind at work , and to make him address the effect of those operations to you . I must , therefore , entreat you // not to draw him aside from the many and great labors he has in hand , by any further written communications of this kind , which would , indeed , be very useful , because they are valuable , if they were conveyed at a time when there was leisure to settle opinions . If you find anything in my father 's letters or conversation on this subject , which , being in conformity to your general principles and thoughts , may bring your present impressions a little nearer to those of my father , I shall be glad of it . There is one thing , however , of which I must inform you , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , that my father 's opinions are never hastily adopted , and that even those ideas which have often appeared to me only the effect of momentary heat , or casual impression , I have afterwards found , beyond a possibility of doubt , to be the result of systematic meditation , perhaps of years ; or else , if adopted on the spur of the occasion , yet formed upon the conclusions of long and philosophical experience , and supported by no trifling depth of thought . * * Are you so little conversant with my father , or so enslaved by the cant of those who call themselves his friends , only to insure themselves through him , as to feel no deference for his judgment , or to mistake the warmth of his manner for the heat of his mind Do I not know my father at this time of day ? I tell you , his folly is wiser than the wisdom of the common herd of able men . " The " I tell y6u , " in this last passage , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filial veneration , ) is in a strain of offensive rudeness , as if the writer was revenging a personal insult offered to his father . We believe it is not true that the follies of great men are on a level with the average wisdom of the world . On the contrary , common men rarely commit the extravagancies into which genius occasionally plunges , when it stoops with the wing that should only mount . We now come to the letter of Burke himself . He replies thus to the charge of loose compo-sition " The composition , you say , is loose , and I am quite sure of it -I never intended it should be otherwise . For , purporting to be , what in truth it originally was ,  --  a letter to a friend , I had no idea of digesting it in a systematic order . The style is open to correction , and wants it . My natural style of writing is somewhat careless , and I should be happy in receiving your advice towards making it as little vicious as such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and color of a style , which grows out of the writer 's peculiar turn of mind and habit of expressing his thoughts , must be attended to in all corrections . It is not the insertion of a piece of stuff , though of a better kind , which is at all times an improvement . ' * He defends the " foppery " of the passage respecting Marie Antoinette , in the following excited mood " I really am perfectly astonished how you could dream , with my paper in your hand , that I found no other cause than the beauty of the queen of France , ( now , I suppose , pretty much faded , ) for disapproving the conduct which has been held towards her , and for expressing my own particular feelings . I am not to order the natural sympathies of my own heart , and of every honest breast , to wait until all the jokes of all the anecdotes of the coffee-houses of Paris , and of the dissenting meeting-houses of London , are scoured of all the slander of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder them with impunity . I know nothing of your story of Messalina . Am I obliged to prove juridically the virtues of all those I shall see suffering every kind of wrong , and contumely , and risk of life , before I endeavor to interest others in their sufferings ,  --  and before I endeavor to excite horror against midnight assassins at back-stairs , and their more wicked abettors in pulpits ? What ! - Are not high rank , great splendor of descent , great personal elegance and outward accomplishments , ingredients of moment in forming the interest we take in the misfortunes of men ? The minds of those who do not feel thus , are not even systematically right . What s Hecuba to him , or he to Hecuba , that he should weep for her ? - Wby , because she was Hecuba , the queen of Troy ,  --  the wife of Priam ,  --  and suffered , in the close of life , a thousand calamities ! I felt too for Hecuba , when I read the flue tragedy of Euripides upon her story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court or city of Troy , before I gave way to the sentiments which the author wished to inspire ; nor do I remember that he ever said one word of her virtue . It is for those who applaud or palliate assassination , regi. cide , and base insult to women of illustrious place , to prove the crimes ( in sufferings ) which they allege , to justify their own . But if they have proved fornication on any such woman ,  --  taking the manners of the world and the manners of France ,  --  I shall never put it in a parallel with assassination ! - No : I have no such inverted scale of faults , in my heart or my head . * * Pray why is it absurd in me to think , that the chivalrous spirit which dictated a veneration for women of condition and of beauty , without any consideration whatever of enjoying them , was the great source of those manners which have been the pride and ornament of Europe for so many ages ? And am I not to lament that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking a manner , by means of speculations of finance , and the false science of a sordid and degenerate philosophy ? I tell you again ,  --  that the recollection of the manner in which I saw the queen of France , in the year 1774 , and the contrast between that brilliancy , splendor , and beauty , with the prostrate homage of a nation to her ,  --  and the abominable scene of 1789 , which I was describing ,  --  did draw tears from me and wetted my paper . These tears came again into my eyes , almost as often as I looked at the description ; - they may again . You do not believe this fact , nor that these are my real feelings ; but that the whole is affected , or as you express it , downright foppery . My friend ,  --  l tell you it is truth ; and that it is true , and will be truth , when you and I are no more ; and will exist as long as men with their natural feelings shall exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sir Philip Francis was not silenced by the answers of the two Burkes , for we find a very able letter from him to the elder , dated November , // and matter of that work . As to the composition , Sir Philip denies that Burke 's style is English " Once for all , I wish you would let me teach you to write English . To me , who am to read everything you write , it would be a great comfort , and to you , no sort of disparagement . Why will you not allow yourself to be persuaded that polish is material to preservation l " Coming to the substance of the work , he thus briefly but completely demolishes the passionate declamations of his friend " From the plain , unlabored narrative of history , I can produce you pictures of the constant miseries of the people of France , that would surpass everything that you , with all the efforts of your eloquence , have painted of the sufferings , great , I own , and much to be regretted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems that they had their Etats g6n6rauce to appeal to . A French historian , now open before me , and who writes with great guard and moderation , says , tine assembl6e des Etats g6n6raux , tenue en 1412 , merita le reproche qu'on a fait quelquefois h ces grandes assembl6es , de voir et d'exposer tous nos maux sans en soula*er un . ' This , I believe to have been constantly the case . The people derived very little , if any , protection from the statesgeneral ; certainly not within any period in which the history of modern nations is distinctly written , and may be safely relied on . If this state of the case be generally true , it follows that the French of this day could not act as we did in 1688 . They had no constitution as we had to recur to . They had no foundation to build upon . They had no walls to repair . Much less had they the elements of a constitution very nearly as good as could he wished . A proposition so extraordinary as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common readers with doubt and surprise , ought to have been made in limine , since the most important deductions are drawn from it . If it be not true , or if it be left to stand upon an assertion , for which no argument or evidence is produced , all that part of your Reflections ' which impeaches the French Assembly for taking new ground to act on , is a petitio principii , and will be , in effect , a justification of the revolution you condemn , if the French can show that your premises are not founded in fact . If they had no model in their own country , they must , of necessity , begin anew . They could not , in this respect , be guided by the example of England , because in our own case there was a constitution to resort to in theirs , there was none . Allowance should be made for men whose duty it is to act in such a situation . They may commit many errors ; but neither will I charge them with the fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many things have been done which greatly deserve to be lamented ; and the more , because they weaken and disgrace a cause essentially just and honorable . The loss of a single life in a popular tumult , excites individual tenderness and pity . No tears are shed for nations. ** The fourth and last volume contains a mass of valuable correspondence relative to Irish affairs , a field whereon the genius of Burke shone with its original brightness . The high opinion which a man of the stamp of Burke entertained of the Catholic Church of Ireland , ( an opinion expressed 597* in the following extract from a letter to Dr. Hussey , ) is worthy of reverent attention , particularly at a period like the present , when the ecclesiastical affairs of that country are soon to come under a general review , and when , important as it is to accumulate every ray of light upon a subject so arduous , it is of greater consequence still to increase and multiply feelings of good-will and sentiments of Christian charity . " I wish very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a primitive Christian Church . With little improvements , I think the Roman Catholic Church of Ireland very capable of exhibiting that state of things . I should not , by force , or fraud , or rapine , have ever reduced them to their present state . God forbid ! But being in it , I conceive that much may be made of it , to the glory of religion , and the good of the state . If the other was willing to hear of any melioration , it might , without any strong , perceivable change , be rendered much more useful . But prosperity is not apt to receive good lessons , nor always to give them ; re-baptism you wo n't allow , but truly it would not be amiss for the Christian world to be re-christened . " Burke felt no respect whatever for the political Protestantism of Ireland . We shall quote a striking passage from a letter to his son , where he reprobates , in his fervent way , the self-styled Protestant ascendancy , and vindicates both Catholic clergy and laity " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well know what that word means , and nobody ever would or could inform me , ) are dupes of their own calumnious representations , which serve to mislead them , and irritate those against whom they are made . In order to render the Catholics contemptible , they have ever represented them as men , in all cases incapable of forming any ideas or opinions , or even wishes of their own ; but that their bodies and souls were at the entire disposal of their priests . These miserable creatures , the zealots of the ascendancy , have been fed with this stuff as their nurse 's pap , and it is never to be got out of their habit . Their low and senseless malice makes them utterly incapable of forming a right judgment on anything . Such is their notion . But I , who know the Catholics of Ireland better than these gentlemen who never have conversed with them , and who , of course , are more ignorant of the real state of their own country than that of Japan , know that at no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of influence over the Catholic people . I have never known an instance , ( until a few of them were called into action by the manoeuvres of the Castle , ) that in secular concerns they took any part at all . " In the opinion of Burke the influence of the Protestant divines over their flocks exceeded that possessed by the Catholic over theirs . In the same letter he observes " At present , being stripped of all adventitious aids , and having nothing but the mere credit belonging to them , I think that , though not wholly without influence , ( and God forbid they or any clergy should , ) they have rather less than any other clergy I know . You and I have talked // over this matter . To those who are acquainted with the prescript form to which the church of Rome binds its clergy , both as to opinions and the exercise of their functions , ( which dogmas , forms , and rules , are just as well known to laity as to priests , ) it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence which doctors have , who can teach just what they please , and what . they think is most likely , for the time being , to be acceptable and to gain the people . No Roman Catholic priest can make a pleasing discovery to his congregation . He and his congregation are bound by the authority of their whole church in all times and in all countries , whose general and collective authority infinitely lessens the individual authority of every private pastor , as the strictness of other laws lessens the power of individual magistrates . Whereas , most of us , who examine critically full as little as any of them , and for the greater part think less about it , and are indeed incapable of doing so , we do and must receive our doctrine from our priest , who himself is not bound up to anything beyond his own ideas ; and consequently , the mass of us depend more upon the individual pastor . " In another letter to Richard Burke , he censures the Society of United Irishmen for the error of supposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he maintains that they are of Irish parentage , the workings of faction in Dublin , and not of tyranny in London . How far this doctrine may be in accordance with the state of facts at the present time , is a question into which we must forbear to enter . " They think that the conduct of the Castle is the result of directions from hence , and that here they do nothing but plot some mischief against Ireland . Alas ! I wish they could be got seriously , and with a ruling spirit , to think of it at all . But things move in the reverse order from what they imagine . They think that ministers here instruct the Castle , and that the Castle sets the jobbing ascendancy in motion. : whereas , it is now wholly , and has , ever since I remember , been , for the greater part , the direct contrary . The junto in Ireland entirely governs the Castle ; the Castle , by its representations of the country , governs the ministers here . So that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amongst ourselves . " In the next extract , also from a letter to his son , we find Burke dashing with his bold hand the general outline of the national policy which we have since seen fully developed by great talents of another order , and the ultimate issue of which is still hidden from our view . " What signifies their sputtering out a few hasty and undigested invectives against an armed and systematic tyranny l If they are not capable of a quiet , determined , manly sullenness , and can not feel a resentment far above the loquacity of womanish invective or lamentation , at the nefarious and unparalleled insults of last session , and at all the slanderous tales propagated ever since , they are never likely to obtain the object they seek ;  --  the first object which rational men ever had , or ever can have in view . The grand juries ( the thirty-two mouths of the Castle ) have aimed a deadly blow . It can not now be returned . It must be borne ; but borne as by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least riot court ir*sults , by again kissing the feet of the insulting enemies of their nation . Let them use a still , discontented , passive obedience . In that mode , I assure them , there is ten thousand times more force than in a giddy unsupported resistance . " The Post Office appears to have labored , in 1795 , under the same suspicions which have lately agitated the public mind with respect to that important establishment . We find Mr. Burke and his friends in Ireland fearful to trust their letters to the public conveyance , and communicating through private channels . Dr. Hussey says , in one of his letters " I wrote two short letters to you since the notification of recall to Earl Fitzwilliam . When I have your letters to guide me , I march on with courage and confidence . I will not trust this Post Office ; it shares in the general corruption of the country . The gentlemen who wait upon you will give a full account of this country . I advise them to stop under your hospitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to see their way clearly . They will also tell you what is the voice and wish of this kingdom concerning you . " Mr. Burke observes , in reply " Such is the state of the Irish post , that whether my two last letters , or either of them , ever came to your hands , is more than 1 am able to divine . I had began a third , and had made some progress in it . It would have been , I fear , a long one ; but the precipitancy of the late revolution got the start , not only of my pen , but of my conceptions . While I was discussing the merits of a single measure of a government , the government itself was no more . It is an age of astonishing events . Nothing happens in the ordinary course . " The revolution alluded to is the fatal recall of Lord Fitzwilliam . How dangerous was the crisis to the Catholics amid their friends , appears from another passage in the same letter " The only amends I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to request you to quit it as speedily as possible . Consult Mr. Grattan , with whom I have no reserves , and I wish you to have none . Show him this . Except he advises you to remain , my opinion is , that your liberty arid your life are not safe for an hour . Had I imagined that the old junto would have been the ruling power , I should just as soon have asked you to go to Paris as to Dublin . " Here we must close our notices , which we have extended beyond our usual limits on account of the space occupied by this illustrious man in the eyes of the world , and the veneration with which men of all parties are wont to receive his precepts , even when they cross their own political , prejudices or party interests.
