txt IN a recent number of the present series of " Political Portraits , " that of that noble and devoted champion of freedom and truth , William Leggett , the sad duty was imposed on us of presenting , as an obituary tribute to his memory , the biographical sketch which , in advance of his unexpected death , had been designed , at the same time for the gratification of the public interest , so warmly attached to his name , and as a just tribute of respect to the virtues and services of the living man . A similar mournful task , accompanied with a similar change of a previously formed intention , is now again imposed upon us in the case of the distinguished and lamented citizen whose name heads the present page . We regret that from the fact of no other portrait of him being left , than that deeply impressed on the hearts of his friends , it is not in our power , in like manner , to accompany the present written sketch of his life and character with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of which it was the transparent expression . Although he but rarely suffered himself to be withdrawn from the tranquil happiness of his private life , to that participation in public affairs from which alone is to be derived such conspicuous popular eminence as has heretofore been the leading rule in the selection of the subjects of the present series , yet 1'Ir . Sedgwick 's name-through the united influence of his writings and of his social reputation-has been so extensively known , as that of an enlightened , zealous , and influential Democrat , a valuable citizen , aud a singularly pure and warm-hearted man , that , apart from any bias of private friendship , we regard the present imperfect notice as not less due to his memory , than , we can not doubt , it will be acceptable to our readers , and to the Democratic Party at large , of which lie was so honorable an ornament . Mr. Sedgwick was born in December , 1780 , in the town of Sheffield , Massachusetts . At the date , therefore , ( Nov. 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicted on his family , friends , and country , a loss so severe , he was in his fifty-ninth year . At the age of seven , his father-whose name is well known to the American public , as one of the ablest , wisest , and best sons of a period prolific of great men-removed with his family to the village of Stockbridge , on the river Ilousaionic , distant but a few miles from Sheffield . here , in one of the most beautiful spots of the beautiftil county of Berkshire-* // a spot now already made , by the consequences of that event , an American classic ground  --  the father of Mr. Sedgxvick planted the family home of which we trust that the roof-tree will never cease te flourish there ; and in the midst of the healthful physical influences of a fine mountain air , scenery , and country life , and the still more beneficial moral atmosphere shed over it by his own rare wisdom , benevolence , and purity of character , reared to maturity a family of seven children-three daughters and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eldest . Of Juda e Sedgwick the present is not a suitable occasion to speak at much len th . The association is , however , so close  --  and so signal and valuable an example is afforded in his case , of the multiplied benefit which such a parent can confer on society , by his care in moulding the mental and moral education of such a family-that w can not omit a passing notice of his life , and of a character , of whose leading traits that of the subject of the present memoir was but the hereditar repetition . The following succinct outline of the prominent events of his life is transferred to our pages from the Encycloptedia Americana : " THEonORE Sznewicir , a judge of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts , was born at Hartford , Connecticut , in May , 1746 . His father , a respectable merchant , died when he was about ten years of age , leaving little property ; but the generosity of his eldest brother enabled him to study at Yale College . He then turned his attenton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ; and , before he was twenty years old , in April , 1766 , he was admitted to the bar . He practised in Berkshire county , Massachusetts . He embarked in the revolutionary strug*le wit his constitutional ardor . In 1776 , he served as an aid to General Thomas , in the expedition to Canada . and subsequently made great exertions in procuring supplies for the army . At the same time , his humanity , in affording protection to the tories , put his popularity in no small hazard . He represented Sheffield in the Massachumetta General Court several times , before and after the revolution . In 1785 and 1786 , he was a member of congress , under the old confederation . In the winter of t787 , he contributed much to the 5u1 ) prCssiOn of the insurrectionary spirit then pervading the state , frequently exoosing himself to outrage , insult , and even death . His exertions in putting down , what was called Shay 's rebellion , are honorably mentioned in the history of the times . In 1788 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that adopted the federal constitution , of which he was one of the principal advocates . In the same year , he was a member of the House of Representatives of the state , and was chosen its speaker . In March , 1789 , he took his seat in the lower house of Congress , and was successively reelected to it until March , 1796 , when he was chosen to the Senate , where he rerusined until March , 1799 , having , during a considerable portion of one session , acted as president pro tern , in the latter year , he was again elected a member of the House of Representatives , and chosen speaker . In 1802 , he was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts , and retained that office until his death , January 24,1813 . As a statesman and jurist , Mr. Sedgwick enjoyed a high reputation . His philanthropic efforts in the course of the emancipation of the negroes , deserve especial record . He was one of the counsel who , soon after the adoption of the constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction was given to that instrument as to abolish slavery in the state . ' As an interestin0 illustration of two of the passages in the life o* // Judge Sedgwick , referred to in the above sketch , we are tempted to quote , from a pamphlet in our possession , the following account of the slave who was made the medium of that application of the declaration in the Massachusetts Bill of Rights , that " all men are born free and equal , " which produced the result spoken of in the concluding word.s above quoted : " Elizabeth Freeman ( known afterwards by the name of Mum Bett , ) was born a slave , and lived in that condition thirty or forty years . She first lived in Claverac , Columbia county , in the state of New-York , in the family of a Mr. Hogeboom . She was purchased at an early age by Col. Ashley , of Sheffield , in the county of Berkshire , in the now commonwealth of Massachusetts . In both these States , and I believe everywhere in the Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not so much to be ascribed to the superior humanity of the people , as to the circumstances of the case . The slaves were comparatively few . Society , except perhaps in the capitals , was in a state nearly primitive . The slaves were precluded from the table in but few families . Their masters and mistresses wrought with the slaves . A great dewee of familiarity necessarily resulted from this mode of life . Slavery in ew York and New England was so masked , that but a slight difference could be perceived in the condition of slaves and hired servants . The character of the slaves was moulded accordin*ly . Sales were very rare . The same feeling which induces a father to retain a child in his family , or at least under his control , disinclined him from parting with his slave . There was little distinction of rank in the country . The younger slaves not only ate and drank , but played with the children . They thus became familiar companions with each other . The black women were cooks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no great difference between the fare or clothing of blacks and white laborers . " In this state of familiar intercourse , instances of cruelty were uncommon , and the minds of the slaves were not so much subdued but that they caused a degree of indignation not much less than if committed upon a freeman . " Under this condition of society , while Mum Butt resided in the family of Col. Ashley , she received a severe wound in a generous attempt to shield her sister . Her mistress in a fit of passion resorted to a degree and mode of violence very uncommon an this country ; she struck at the weak and timid girl with a heated kitchen shovel : Mum Bett interposed her arm , and receivd the blow ; and she bore the honorable scar it left to the day of her death . The spirit of Mum Bett had not been broken down by ill usage -- she resented the insult and outrage as a white person would have done . She left the house , and neither commands nor entreaties could induce her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the law to regain possession of his slave . This was shortly after the adoption of the constitution of Massachusetts . The case was tried at Great Barrington . Mum Bett was declared free : it being , I believe , the first instance ( or among the first instances ) of the practical application of the declaration in the Massachusetts Bill of Rights , that all men are born free and equal . ' " The late Judge Sedgwick had the principal agency in her deliverance . She attached herself to his family as a servant . In that station she remained for many years , and was never entirely disconnected from his family . " She was married when young : her husband died soon after , in the continential service in the revolutionary war , leaving her with one child . Daring the residue of her life she remained a widow . She died in December , 1829 , at a very advanced age . She supposed herself to be nearly a hundred years old . " how well the individual slave to whose person were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of rightly // using , the boon of liberty thus conferred on her , will appear from the following additional extract from the same source : " She knew her station , and perfectly observed its decorum ; yet she had nothing of the submissive or subdued character , which succumbs to superior force , and is the usual result of the state of slavery . On the contrary , without ever claiming superiority , she uniformly , I believe in every case , obtained an ascendancy over all those with whom she was associated in service . Her spirit of fidelity to her employers was such as has never been surpassed . This was exemplified in her whole life . I can convey an idea of it only by the relation of a single incident . " The house of Mr. Sedgwick , in this town , ( Stockbridge ) was attacked by a body of insurgents , during the Shay 's war , so well remembered in this vicinity . Mr. Sedgwick was then absent at Boston , and Mum Bett was the only guardian of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but suffered them to search the house to find him , which they did , by feeling under the beds and in other places of concealment , with the points of their bayonets . She did not attempt to resist , by direct force , the rifling of property , which was one of the objects of the insurgents . She , however , assumed a degree of authority ,  --  told the plunderers that they dare not strike a woman , '  --  and attended them in their exploring the house , to prevent wanton destruction . She escorted them into the cellar with a large kitchen shovel in her hand , which she intimated that she would use as a weapon in case of necessity . One of the party broke off the neck of a bottle of porter . She told him that if he or his companions desired to drink porter , she would fetch a corkscrew , and draw the cork , and they might drink like gentlemen ; but that , if the neck of another bottle should be broken , she would lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shovel . Upon tasting the liquor , the party decided that if gentlemen loved such cursed bitter stuff , they might keep it . ' " Understanding from the conversation of the party , that they intended to take with them , in their retreat , a very fine gray mare that was in the stable , which she had been in the habit of riding , she left the house and went directly to the stable . Before the rioters were apprised of her intention , she led the animal to a gate that opened upon the street ; stripped off the halter , and , by a blow with it , incited the mare to a degree of speed that soon put her out of danger from the pursuit of the marauders . " Even in her humble station , she had , when occasion required it , an air of comroand which conferred a degree of dignity , and gave her an ascendancy over those of her rank , which is very unusual in persons of any rank or color . Her determined and resolute character , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob , was manifested in her deportment and conduct during her whole life . She claimed no distinction ; but it was yielded to her from her superior experience , energy , skill , and sagacity . In the latter part of her life she was much employed as a nurse . Here she had no competitor . I believe she never lost a child , when she had the care uf its mother , at its birth . When a child , wailing in the arms of its mother , heard her steps on the stairway , or approaching the door , it ceased to cry . " This woman , by her extreme industry and economy , supported a large family of grandchildren and great-grandchildren . She could neither read nor write ; yet her conversation * instructive , and her society was much sought . She received many visits at her own house , and very frequently received aud accepted invitations to pass considerable intervals of time in the families of her friends . Her death , notwithstanding her great age , was deeply lamented . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , become an historical name , not unworthy of the space here bestowed upon it . The monument erected over her grave by the gratePA attachment of the Sedgxvick family to her memory , is not the least // of the objects of interest to the steps of the stranger who visits the village of Stockbridge . Of the judicial character of Judge Sedgwick the following contemporary remarks will serve to convey a sufficient idea to the unprofessional reader to whom it may otherwise be unknown . They are taken from an old Massachusetts paper : " Some time ago we heard that Judge Sedgwick intended to resign his seat upon the bench of our Supreme Court . In consequence of this report , the gentlemen of Berkshire , Hampshire , Worcester , and Middlesex Bars , have written letters to the Honorable Judge , expressive of the high sense they entertain of his worth as a Magistrate , and the loss which the bunch must sustain on his resignation of his seat . We can not but hope , that Judge Sedgwick will continue to the public the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been conspicuous , and have secured to their author not only the esteem and veneration , but also the love of his countrymen . His learning , his integrity , his impartiality , render him an object eminently attractive . Mr. Williams in his Term Reports has given us from Judge Sed*wick specimens of judicial eloquence which would do honor to a Buller or a Mansfield . In the arrangement of his thoughts he is logically precise ; in their expression he is lucid and elegant , in their embellishment he is chaste even to severity ; in their delivery he is dignified and majestic . The manners of Judge Sedgwick are such as must have been in the mind of Chesterfield when he wrote his celebrated letters on politeness . There is in them a certain inexpressible something , which declares him one of those favorites of nature , on whom she has bestowed the rarest and by no means the least valuable gift which she has the power to dispense . We have endeavoured to draw an outline of the character of this excellent Judge and worthy man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete a picture , which , if a faithful resemblance of the original , can not fail to engage the attention and produce the delight of posterity . " Eminent as he was for his public services and honors , it was , however , within the less conspicuous sphere of domestic privacy that the character and life of Judge Sedgwick most strongly claim our admiration . The active external employments in which it has been seen that he was engaged , did not prevent the devotion of a large portion of his time to the happiness of his home and the education of his family-in the manifold senses properly embraced in the word " education . " He knew no greater enjoyment than that of the most constant and intimate conversational intercourse with his children , for the united ends of entertainment and instruction . Of the natural influence , upon all the latter , of such a perpetual and pervading contact with a mental and moral nature of so superior an order , in the person of a parent , it will not perhaps be trenching too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remark , that by its fruits in the present instance may it best be known . In his political character Judge Sedgwick was , of course , ( considering his time , his State , and the social atmosphere in which his lot was cast , ) a strong Federalist of the old school . At the same time , in personal character , illustrated by his daily life , he was animated by no other spirit than a truly democratic one ,  --  manifestin* itself in the republican simplicity of his habits and manners ; in the active philanthropy // which was his predominant sentiment ; and in that noble deference and respect for the rights of others , without regard to accidental social classifications , in which is implied a practical recognition too often unknown to the professing democrat , of the essential principle and spirit of equality and liberty . The strong and radical character of the democracy , to the illustration of which the pages of this work have from its outset been devoted , will scarcely be considered by any as liable to suspicion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for that stout old Federalism of the Hamiltonian era of which Judge Sedgwick afforded one of the finest specimens . It was an honest faith  --  a patriotic , true-hearted , and high-minded one  --  and very natural to the political and social circumstances of the times . And so far are we from participating in the senseless bias of prejudice against any present member of the Democratic Party for an honest attachment , at a long bygone day , to that antique " Federalism " which can refer for its justification to the name of Washington , that , on the contrary , such a change of opinions being in the direction of , and not in opposition to , the progress of the times , the developement of principles , and the evidences of experience , we look upon that circumstance , provided it be untainted with any apparent motive of interest or ambition , rather as a presumptive evidence of true integrity , manliness and patriotism ; and of such a sound basis of reflection , and enlightened conviction , as affords the safest ground for political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the month of January of 1813 , the the staunchness of his Federal faith was never subjected to that modification which we have very little doubt , from the general tone of his character , the subsequent progress of the great American experiment would have worked in his opinions ; as it in point of fact has done in those of several of the members of his family , whose earlier political sentiments were of course but the reflection of those of their father , and of the social influences by which they were from infancy surrounded . This was in an especial degree the case in the person of the subject of the present memoir , to whom we now again return . The events of Mr. Sedgwick 's life , on which the biographer can fix as the prominent points to form the outline of its narration , are very few , and may be briefly told . Destined to the practice of the law , he had the advantage of receiving his professional education under the watchful eye of his father . On his admission to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1801 , where he united himself in partnership with Mr. Harmanus Bleecker , the present Chargd d'Affaires of the United States at the Hague . Their partnership , accompanied with the most intimate friendship , continued through the entire period of Mr. Sedgwick 's professional life , until an impaired state of health compelled him , in 1821 , to withdraw from the profession , and to retire to his patrimonial home at Stockbridge ; where the // even current of his life has ever since flowed tranquilly on , in the midst of a rare combination of the best elements of true happiness for himself and in the active diffusion of an enlightened beneficence to others , in all directions about him within the sphere of his influence . Of his practice at Albany , unable to speak of our own knowledge , we prefer to give the following testimony , communicated to us by a gentleman who may now , without impropriety , be ranked at the head of the bar of the State of New York ; and who entered upon the professional career which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a short period before Mr. Sedgwick 's retirement from it . It should be borne in mind , in forming an estimate of Mr. Sedgwick 's professional practice and rank , that the period referred to was that in which the Albany bar was adorned with that unforgotten galaxy of talent which numbered among its stars a Van Yechten , a Henry , and a Van Buren : " I can only speak , from personal knowledge , of the latter part of Mr. Sedgwick 's professional career . During its whole term , he was associated in business with a kindred spirit , our present worthy representative at the Hague , Mr. Bleecker . Their practice was extensive and of the most respectable character , both in the office and at the bar . Mr. Sedgwick took his full share of it in each department , and his conduct in each was uniformly marked by the rectitude , generosity , and frankness which distinguished him in the other relations of life . He was a safe and conscientious adviser ; for though he warmly entered into the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) or of advant* ) , e to himself , coutd tempt him to maintain or abet inequitable pretensions . In the details of professional duty he was regular and methodical ; and though no lover of technicalities , careful and exact in the transaction of the business entrusted to him . Endowed with talent which fitted him for the higher and more attractive duties of the profession , he did not disdain the labors of the attorney and solicitor . His industry and faithfulness sn this respect must have cost him much self.denial , and are therefore entitled to the higher praise . He was a ready and impressive speaker , and maintained a high rank among the members of a bar distinguished by its ability and learning . His style and manner reflected the moral qualities of his mind . When he had a strong confidence in the truth and justice of his positions , his arguments were earnest and powerful ; but he never learned the art , nor acquired the habit , of stifling or disguising his own convictions . He was a cogent reasoner , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disdained everything like chicanery and artifice. *Bringing into the forum the same high tone of moral purity , the same transparent candor , and the same spirit of benevolence , which were apparent in the discharge of all his other duties , he always commanded the attention and confidence of those who listened to him , and was justly regarded , by his brethren and by the whole community , as one of the lights and ornaments of his profession . Had he chosen to remain in it , and to devote himself exclusively to its labors , he would doubtless have reached a more conspicuous position ; but even those who regretted his retirement in the very prime of life , from this field of usefulness , were compelled to admit , that in seeking happiness in the bosom of his family , in scenes of rural life endeared to him by youthful associations , and in the great work of doing good to his species , he earned-though surely it came to him unexpected and undesired  --  a fame more enviable and enduring than any which belongs to mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the above the following extract from a communication by an intelligent writer in the " Ncw York Amencan , " // who refers , as the foundation of his testimony , to an intimate acquaintance of thirty years with its subject : " At the period above referred to , Mr. Sedgwick had just commenced the practice of the law in the city of Albany , ranking high in his profession , and still higher in society . Had he been covetous of wealth , his industry alone would have secured it . Had he been ambitious of professional eminence , his talents placed the object within his reach . Had he aimed at political disthiction , his personal popularity , the manliness of his mind , and the attractive urbanity of his manners , would have rendered his success certain . But it was not in his nature , I may say it was not in his power , to place his heart upon either of these . " The original foundations of his character were cast too deep-his desires were too moderate , his philosophy too just . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast his eye over the landscape of life , of men and of things , and to have viewed the scene with doubt and distrust . The great objects of the vulgar pursuit , he thought not worth the struggle . " Satisfied with a simple competency , which he had slowly and honorably acquired , he retired from his profession while yet in the prime of life , and with unremitted diligence devoted himself to doing good . " After his retirement to Stockbridge , Mr. Sedgwick applied himself , with all the active habits of his mind , to the cultivation and enjoyment of literary and philosophical pursuits  --  to the pleasures of society , and of a home as eminently blessed to him , as its kindly hospitality was agreeable to all who visited it  --  to the various useful amusements of country life  --  and to the exemplary discharge of all the duties of his position , not only in the more private relations at which it is not for us here even to glance , but in every capacity in which it was in his power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a man , a neighbour , and a citizen . One of his favorite objects was to promote , by his example , advice , and aid , the formation of a taste among his fellow-townsmen for fine cultivation of the fruits of the field and of the garden . He was twice elected President of the Agricultural Society of the county . He also represented his town several times in the Legislature of the State . In the latter capacity , as early as the year I *27 , after much examination and reflection , he introduced a project for the construction of a railroad from Boston to Albany ; which , after several years of earnest effort , in which he had to encounter every obstacle of prejudice , timidity , and ridicule , he at last succeeded , by the impetus which lie had given to it , in carrying successfully through . And though it has not been permitted him to witness the hill completion of this great measure , of which he may be regarded as the father , yet he lived long eaough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened but shortly before his death for more than half the distance-with the universal favor of the public opinion , at first strongly hostile to it . As an enlightened political economist , and zealous philanthropist , Mr. Sedgwick could not be indifferent to the important subject of Politics . He took an especial interest in the great controversy of the Tariff ; he was a member of the Free Trade Convention at Philadel // phia in 1831 ; and notwithstanding the strong prevalence of a difl'eren public opinion , and imagined sectional interest , in his portion of the country , he was a strenuous opponent of the whole " American System . " In fact the general direction of the political opinions to which his candid reflections and warm popular sympathies had by this time led his mind , were decidedly adverse to those of the party which supported Mr. Adams in the Presidential Chair . The reader will not , therefore , participate in the surprise which was felt by many of the old Federal friends of Mr. Sedgwick and of his family , on his coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson 's election to the Presidency . No man ever for an instant questioned the disinterested sincerity of Mr. Sedgwick 's opinions ; and his open accession to the Democratic ranks-then in hopeless minority in his native State-was received by the latter with warm welcome and congratulation . It is scarcely necessary for us to add , that Mr. Sed*wick has ver since , by the unwavering consistency of his subsequent course , through all the darkest of the hours which ensued , amply justified and confirmed that confidence which his well-known character and name at once unreservedly commanded from the Democracy of the State . His name , as the most popular that could be selected , was more than once united on the gubernatorial ticket , with that of the distinguished citizen whose recent election . after fourteen years of unsuccessful candidateship , has at last marked the turn of the political tide , in the noble old Bay State , which had stood so long stationary at the high flood of its old Federalism . At the last election Mr. Sedgwick had declined the nomination for Lieutenant Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone influenced him to this course ; for at no period were his convictions stronger , or his sympathies more warm , with the cause of tle Democratic Party than at the present , when principles were involved in it of whlch his sagacious understanding appreciated all the importance , to the object nearest his heart  --  the amelioration of the condition of the great mass of the people . It has been a source of peculiar regret to his political friends that his death took place but a few days before the consummation of that recent brilliant electoral victory achleved by his party , which would have given to none a more sincere pleasure than to himself , though he had abstained from per sonal participation in the contest as a candidate . It may be proper to advert to Mr. Sedgwick 's opinions on two of the most prominent topics of moral reform which have lately agitated the public mind  --  the Temperance and Anti-Slavery questions . rJhe very earnestness of his enlightened philanthropy always disposed him to look witb disapprobation upon those excesses of impracticable fanaticism , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms in behalf of which their ardor is excited* His mind was too fully imbued with a pervading sympathy with the principle 12 // of freedom  --  and with an appreciation of its inestimable value as the best practical agent of working out the highest possible degree of social amelioration  --  to allow him to look with favor upon any portion of that false system of legislation which would seek to enforce great causes of moral reform by the compulsory processes of law . He was therefore from the outset strongly opposed to the measure commonly referred to as the " Fifteen Gallon Law , " notwithstanding that he gave in other modes as warm a support to the rremperance cause , as he exhibited in his own personal habits a practical example of its principles and of its benefits . With reference to the subject of Slavery , his views were equally characterized by his habitual liberality , moderation , independence , and sympathy with the cause of human freedom . they were fully stated in a letter which he addressed to the Anti-Sdavery convention assembled at Albany on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he had received to attend the convention . He declined the invitation , though with not less courtesy than firmness declaring at the same time his hostility to slavery , as a great moral , political , and social evil  --  and his devotion to the unlimited right of free discussion , impliedly guarantied in the present case by that provision made in the Constitution for its own amendment . He condemned the movement upon Congress , out of which so much excited bitterness had grown , as a wrong and mistaken one-as he also considered the spirit which ( with many noble exceptions ) had characterized too much of the agitation of this subject at the North , and which had naturally awakened a strong feeling of exasperation on the part of the South , as widely at variance with that whi ch should animate a great moral and democratic cause , such as he regarded the object of effecting the voluntary and peaceful termination of American Slavery . This letter was a noble and beautiful production  --  and transparent throughout with the character of the mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's recent sudden death are doubtless familiar to the recollection of many of our readers . We willingly spare ourselves the task of their narration , by quoting the following account of them from the pen of the physician who attended his last moments , Dr. Childs of Pittsfield . This town , the scene of this unhappy catastrophe , is about twelve miles distant from Stockbridge . The date referred to is the evening of the seventh of November , 1839 : " The deep-felt sorrow which pervades this community , in consequence of the sudden death of our much lamented friend , Mr. Sedgwick , calls for all the alleviation which can come from a recital of the particular occurrences attending the last few hours of our highly esteemed and generally beloved fellow-citizen . " Having been present and witnessed the melancholy scene , I feel impelled by a sense of duty to the friends of the deceased , and to the public , to make this communication . " At 7 o'clock on the evening of November 6th , I met Mr. Sedgwick at the house of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had assembled // previous to the approaching State election . He appeared cheerful and happy , greeting in his usual cordial manner his acquaintances as they entered the room . Distinguished for his social conversational powers , he was listened to with peculiar interest and unaffected pleasure . Various topics of discourse engaged his attention , as he conversed with different individuals . " At 8 o'clock we were summoned to supper prepared for the occasion on which we had assembled . While at the table he expressed the sincere gratification he experienced in witnessing so large an assemblage of the substantial yeomanry . He spoke of the securities the interest of the country derived from such a population , and declared his entire confidence in the ability of the people to maintain and perpetuate those principles , on which are based our civil and political institutions . " Having partaken of the refreshments provided with great moderation , observing that his dyspeptic habit would not allow him any considerable indulgence , he expatiated on the abundant provision of a kind Providence for our comfort and enjoyment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . " Being requested to address the company , at about half past 8 o'clock he rose , and in a most solemn and impressive manner introduced the subject of his remarks . Among other observations , he said , that the principles he advocated and the sentiments he should advance were the result of much reflection and no inconsiderable observation ; that under existing circumstances , and especially at his period of life , he should be pardoned for what otherwise might seem to savor of egotism-he could now have no object but so to speak and so to act , that his rapidly approaching end might be that of peace . " His remarks bore the characteristics of feeling and sentiment of a disinterested friend and patriot , giving his parting admonitions . He adverted to the fact of the existence of a difference of political principles , of the grounds of that difference , and the cause which tended to its perpetuation ; he spoke of the influence of wealth , both individual and corporate , as naturally hostile to democratic principles , and that the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great class of our community possessed of moderate property , and niainly on the industrious farmer and mechanic . " The subject of the monetary affairs of the country occupied his chief attention . The conduct of the banks was arraigned and exhibited in its true light  --  the fallacy of their pretensions exposed , and the proper basis of the credit system presented , its importance admitted , and the folly of charging the Government with any attempt to destroy it . The credit system , ' he said , we must have and shall have-the public ought not to suffer from bank suspension ; they have yielded large profits , and if necessary they ought to make sacrifices , rather than that the public should suffer . ' " He adverted to the state of parties in the county and commonwealth , and exhoited the friends of equal rights to alacrity and perseverance , anticipating that their efforts would eventnally be crowned with success . Every sentiment he uttered was from the heart , and dictated by the liberal spirit of a philanthropist , " Near the close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evident , from his subdued manner and a slight faltering of his voice , that some change had come upon him . Fondly did we hope , as he sat down , that it was merely a temporary exhaustion , from which he would soon recover . But alas ! the citadel of life was attacked , and as he attempted , soon after , to leave the room , lie fell partly down , and it was too evident he had received a paralytic attack , partially dis abling one half the left side of the body . Still he retained the exercise of his intellectual faculties , and expressed a strong confidence of a speedy favorable result . The character of the attack was , however , gradually and more surely developing its real nature . All the aid which physicians and kind friends could render was uiiavailing . It only palliated and contributed to prolong life for a few hours . The affection of the head increased to a complete apoplexy , and between two and th*eo oYlock he ceased to breathe . // " Till within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those about him , neither suffering bodily pain nor mental aberration . He died without the slightest convulsion , with a countenance placid even in death . Though perhaps himself not fully aware of his immediate danger , still he expressed a calm submission , by repeating the emphatic language , It is all right . ' " Thus is one suddenly removed from us , severing the tenderest ties of love and friendship . None who knew him but mourn his loss . An affectionate family are plunged in sorrow , and the community are deprived of one whose kindness and libeislity will not soon be forgotten . When such men die , the country has reason to mourn . The Providence of God is inscrutable , but it is our strong consolation that infinite wisdom and infinite benevolence orders all events . " Such a man could not be stricken thus suddenly down , without deeply affecting the best sensibilities of the public mind . The announcement of his death elicited from numerous quarters spontaneous tributes to the rare excellence of his character , in various personal sketches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference to presenting any summary of our own of his character , we will obviate the impression which already probably has been created on the minds of some readers-that so hi0h a tone of unmingled eulogy but evinces the partiality of friendship , quickened by the recent pangs of regret-by the following quotations from three distinct accounts which have fallen within our observation . rrhe exact correspondence between these different sketches will serve at the same time to verify the common testimony of them all , and to vindicate the general tenor of our own preceding remarks , from the appearance which they might else wear of undiscriminating exaggeration . The first is taken from the columns of the " Massachusetts Eagle , " and is dated from Stockbridge : " The life and character , that is , the personal virtues of this man , are of chief in* terest to us . They are an unspeakable consolation to his family , whose hearts are now smitten with grief ; who have lost in him sympathies and affections in their purest and best estate . In his domestic and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother of a family extensively known by the published works of some ef its members , but more advantageously known for the personal virtues of all , he embodied , illustrated , and enforced those maxims of wisdom and virtue , which he received from his eminent and wise father . His house was dedicated to a generous , . kind , and unaffected hospit lity . His affections were not circumscribed , nor limited to those allied to him , his personal intercourse with all , was that of a friend . No man ever parted from him , but with the conviction that he was beloved by hirn* This was a true conviction ; for he always found , or at least , thought he found , in every man the element of some goodness , however much it might be obscured by vice . He had a strong , true , and unaffected love of mankind , and a stronger faith in the virtues of man than many have , believing that not only their miseries , but their vices are caused more by the inequality of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With him it was a great object to remove these inequalities ; his writings are devoted to this great object , believing as he did , that one of the chief evils of society is the power which one class of men has over another , and that a state of mutual dependence is most favorable to virtue and happiness . I can not but think that a chief inducement to him to write upon the subject of " Public and Private Economy , " was to prevent poverty  --  to show the laboring man how he might improve his cont1*tioti . The chapters on the poverty existing in the United States are invaluable . // " Were it proper to designate his most conspicuous virtues , where all existed in harmony , we should say they were his love of truth , and his benevolence . Truth be always sought , and was therefore a great friend to free discussion , and a liberal msn in its true sense . He maintained his opinions with a zeal and firmness which showed his love of truth ; but with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinions of others who differed from him . His benevolence was under the guidance of sound religious principle , and warm religious affections . In his estimation the great business of life was to do good to one another . Though ho thought favorably of mankind , he was always for making them better . Kindness he thought the most efficient means by which to improve the moral character of men . He may have over-estimated such means , but such an opinion shows the benevolent character of his mind . " We must bring this sketch to a close , with a painful consciousness of its imper* fections , and that our remarks are much below their subject . " It is a great happiness to have known him  --  to have had him for a friend . His life and character are left to us . He lived to be a blessing to mankind . Not only our town , but our county and our state has lost one of its most valuable citizens . " May his example be an incentive to all to live a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . " The second is from the " New York American , " and is the testimony of a personal friend , though a strong-nay , apparently , a violent and bitter-political opponent : " Few men have passed through life with more rectitude of mind and purpose , than the late TnzoDoaE SamewicK . To a naturally mild and amiable temperament he added a cultivated intellect , an unaffected benevolence , and great simplicity of manners . His mind was active and inquiring ; his judgment just , his morality pure , and his principles well defined and well reflected . " He enjoyed the great and unspeakable advantage of having but little within his own breast to contend with . He had no latent or secret springs of evil in his nature , which his resolution was called upon to repress . He had none of those dark or violent passions , against which reason and virtue sometimes strive in vain . I3ut , on the contrary , the genial spirit of mildness and of sociality reigned in his bosom . The liveliest sympathies , the warmest affections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried their impress in his countenance ; they were manifested in his voice , his air , his manner . Their influence ennobled his conduct , even while they concealed from the superficial observer the character of his talents . " I know of no instance in which integrity so vindicated the loftiness of its nature , as in him . The consciousness of rectitude , and the entire freedom from all malignity of thought or purpose , seemed to thro - around him an air of ease , of self- respect , and even of dignity , which no rank or talent could confer . " His personal appearance was strikingly plain . He was not only free from the pride of appearance , but negligent in his dress ; while his address was unpretending , simple , and familiar . Nor was there much of elegance or of polish either in his language or style of expression ; and yet the word gentlemen was written , as it were , in letters of light all over him . No habit , no situation , no circumstance could conceal it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , the natural off spring of the purity and manliness of his mind . " In his efforts to promote the interests of others , Mr. Sedgwick did not confine himself to any particular class , occupation , or walk in life . Encouraged , perhaps , by the example of his universally admired and highly gifted sister , he employed his pen upon several subjects , and with ability and success . He gave a portion of his time to the gublic , in the Legislature of his native State , and devoted still more to the agricultural interests of the cnunty in which he resided . Horticulture , litera* lure , and even politics , occupied his leisure hours . " // The third is taken from the " Providence Republican Herald . " Equally characterized by us elegance and its justice , we transfer it without curtailment to our pages : " Died , at Pittsfield , Mass. , on Thursday , November 7th , Hon. Theodore Sedgwick , of Stockbridge , aged 58 . Mr. Sedgwick , on the evening preceding , addressed a meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquence . It was his dying attestation to the cause which he had so much at heart . At the close of the meeting he was seized with apoplexy , and , despite the best medical aid , expired itt a few hours . Thus has fallen , in the vigor of his days , one of the most estimable of the sons of New England , who had long enjoyed the respect and confidence of his fellow-citizens , who had received from them the well-deserved testimonials of public favor , and who seemed to be designated , by the general appreciation of his talents and worth , at no distant day , for the highest station within the gift of the people of his native state . His best inheiitance from a distinguished father , the late Judge Sedgwick , was a vigorous constitution of mind , which he matured by diligent self-cultivation . His attention was early directed to the study of law ; which profession he practised for many years with reputation and success at Alhany , N. Y. About fifteen years since , he retired to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever since resided . " The cessation of professional labor was not succeeded by a life of inactive kisure . The temper of his mind forbade it ; and he was constantly occupied with subjects of the highest importance to the legislator , the patriot , and the philanthropist . He obeyed the dictates of a lofty moral nature , not less than the injunction of the great apostle , in honoring all men , ' and in seeking at all times to promote the greatest good of the whole number within his range of being useful . He embraced with the heart of a true lover of his kind , and with a discriminating preference , those plans of the intellectual , moral , and social improvement of the people , which are the sign and glory of our times . He was eloquent in enforcing the peculiar duties of American citizens under our republican form of government , and in pointing out what he deemed to be the dangers of the country , in abandoning the simple , industrious and frugal habits of our ancestors , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is setting in upon us , especially in our great cities , and corroding the best elements of our life and prosperity as a people . It is hardly necessary to say that in the cultivated and hospitable society with which he was surrounded , he carried into practice the principles which he inculcated , and was himself in all his relations the just example of a true son and citizen of the Republic . " Some of the best thoughts of Mr. Sedgwick are to be found in a work published by him on Public and Private Economy , the concluding volume of which is now in a state of preparation for the press . Without affecting a philosophical arrangement and precision in this work , the lamented author has given the results of much observation and reflection , and has furnished one of the most valuable contributions yet offered by the pen of an American writer to the science of which he treats . " Mr Sedgwick 's political opinions illustrated his independence and sterling integrity . Educated in a school of politics opposed to the principles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished associations , with a sacrifice both of feeling and interest , to his coavictions of right and duty ; and devoted himself , with his accustomed energy , to the great cause of popular sovereignty and equal rights . His undoubted sincerity and transparent honesty endeared him to the Democracy of his State . No man better understood the principles of the Democratic party in our country , or was more truly convinced of their vital importance to the national prosperity , and to the perpetuation of our republican institutions . In the great political struggle now going on he took an active part , especially in support of t4t*.t most important of all measure* , the separation of bank and state , and the ind* // pendent safe keeping of the public money for public uses . To the service of the people he paid the tribute of his life and death . " It is the moral character of Mr. Sedgwick , which united him so closely to the sympathies of those who remain , that we delight to dwell upon , now that he is taken away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frank , confiding , affable , and generous . He carried his heart in his hand . There was nothing for him to con. ' ceal . He was a high toned man , of singular purity of mind and life . He had no compromises of honor and integrity . Expediency was not in his vocabulary . He scorned the thought of doing that for the party , which was not also just and honorable in itself . Where he was best known , he was most loved . We may not invade the sanctity of a home , now made desolate , to speak of him as a husband , a father , and a brother . His memory is in the hearts of his friends . He rests in peace . " The deceased was personally known to but few of our readers . We have made our feeble offering of remembrance in the fraternal spirit of that great brotherhood in which he was enrolled , and which is circumscribed by no boundaries of state or country . " And that the Democracy of his native State are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , we record here , in conclusion , the following emphatic resolutions unanimously adopted by a very large Democratic meeting held at Boston on the 21st of No-vember : " Resolved , That in the death of THEOUORE Sznewica , humanity has lost a benefactor and democracy a champion , whose purity of principle and firm devotion to the best interests of the people , rendered him pre-eminent as an advocate of equal rights and just laws . " Resolved , That though in the midst of the triumph of those principles of free government which his zeal , and talent , and devotion , even to the sacrifice of his life in the cause of truth , so eminently contributed to advance in this commonwealth , we are called upon to . mourn that he was not spared to witness the fruits of his disinterested labors ; yet it is a glorious reflection , worthy his memory and worth , that he died as a patriot and a friend of man would best love to die-in vindicating , to his latest breath , the rights of humanity and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above little remains for us to add . The works alluded to as from the pen of Mr. Sedgwick have , on a former occasion , * been made the subject of a review in the pages of this work , and now claim from us merely a reference of the reader to the opinion expressed , and the account rendered of them there . We understand that at the time of his death he was engaged on a work on the general subject of " Party , " which , though of course left in an unfinished state , will probably be published by his son , rrheodor Sedgwick  --  a gentleman , though yet young , already known with high honor to the Democracy , as well as to the bar , of the city of New York . We look to the appearance of this work with much interest . We trust that it will not be long withheld from the public . The subject is one which has of late years grown into an importance which should engage the anxious consideration of every true lover of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rectitude , and patriotism , which so remarkably characterized Mr. Sedgwick 's modes of thinking // and reasoning on political topics , lead us to expect , in his reflectiong on this subject , a peculiarly valuable contribution to a discussion upon which we have been for some time contemplating to enter . Such , then , was Theodore Sedgwick . The memory of his virtues , that gave their keenest poignancy to the first regrets of his friends , affords too the most soothing balm to heal them ; while the example left by the daily beauty of his life will long continue to exert a plea* sant and a good influence on those whose fortune it was to be familiar with it . His death-calm as aa infant 's slumber , and leaving upon his countenance , undimmed by any trace of physical or mental suffering , all the light of the transparent loveliness of one of the purest and kindliest of earthly spirits-seems to our imaginations but a natural and happy transition from one mode of existence to another , without affecting the intimate ties of mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numerous friends who mourn his departure from before the bodily vision and contact of the human sense . A singular presentiment appears to have brooded over his mind for several preceding months , that the close of his earthly way of life was very nigh at hand  --  a presentiment revealing itself on frequent occasions which the memory of various friends can now too distinctly recall and interpret . To a mind thus pure from thought , feeling , or memory of evil-thus fortified with all the preparation of calm philosophical reflection  --  and secure in its reliance on the anchor of that religion whose essential truths were as deeply established in the convictions of his reason , as its spirit was seen of all men to be the animating principle of his whole character and conduct in life - such a presentiment wore no terrors for him , however it mi* , ht at times cast a passing shadow of gloom over domestic and social affections peculiarly strong and tender ; while in the actual mode of his death-its tranquillity , its freedom from distracting pain , accompanied with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wish always entertained and often expressed by him . l*arely has the hand of friendship had to record a death-rather let us say , a departure-in which a more emphatic meaning is felt , by all who knew him , to reside in the exclamation with which we conclude this imperfect tribute to his rare worthQuis desiderio sit pudor aut modus Tam can capitis ! We will not close the present paper , without adding , to the tribute which it is designed to offer to the memory of one distinguished member of this family , some mention of another , whose death preceded by several years that which it has been our painful task here to record . The second son of Judge Sedgwick , HENRY DWIGHT SunowIcK , though his earthly career was earlier terminated , and though he never exhibited his talents on the open stage of public life , was a man of // no less shining mark than the elder brother to whom the preceding pages have been devoted . He died in December of 183I-havin* been already for several previous years withdrawn , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had eminently adorned . He had been engaged for many years in the practice of law in the city of New York , in connexion with his brother Robert , now travelling in Europe ; and had risen to a rank of professional standing not inferior to the high social distinction , and strong personal attachment , accorded by all who knew him to the many noble and . lovely traits of his private character . To talents which distinguished him , even in a family in which al have stood far above the ordinary level , Henry Sedgwick united a *noral purity , a glowing fervor , and a certain sweet tenderness of dis*o* sition , that in truth seemed to present one of the most beautiful phases in which human character ever exhibits itself . He was truth itself-* all candor , generosity , kindliness . Within his breast no harsh or bitter passion ever found a resting place-powerfully as it could be aroused , at sight of oppression , falsehood , or wrong , to a just sense of manly indignation and abhorrence . He possessed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while sometimes apt to give an air of eccentricity to some of hi per sonal habits , made him the only one unconscious of the real merit or beauty of the acts of disinterested and untiring kindness to others which he was constantly performing . Selfishness , indeed-he knew not what it was ; as little as , in any good cause that kindled the quick ardors of his enthusiasm , he knew the meaning of the word fear . Remarkably independent in the formation of his opinions , he was not less courageous , alike in their expression and in the action to which they might lead . His sensibilities were extremely acute-his affections as tender as they were deep  --  and his sympathies prompt and strong with misfortune or oppression , or with any cause that addressed its claims to the noble philanthropy of which his heart was the home . Nor was his benevolence of that order that exhausts itself in the sickly and barren blossom of mere sympathetic regrets ; it rapidly ripened to the fruit of earnest , persevering , practical beneficence-and many were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found comfort and support in the taste of it ; many , those who felt what was uttered by one , in the emphatic language applied to Job , that " when the eye saw him then it blessed him . " It was the remark of an intimate friend of Mr. Sedgwick-himself " kaud sordidus auctor naturee verique " - that he had never known a man in whom was combined in similar degree a great intellectual power , of true , logical reasoning , and wise , healthy judgment-with a flow of feeling , from a perennial fount , unusually warm , deep and voL. vii . NO. xxva. - rEn. 1840 . K // strong . And this was the most striking peculiarity of his mind , t a. * while both of these distinct characteristics were so blended anci har* monizeci together that each derived from the other an improving an elevating influence , the former had as little power to chill or check the warm tide of the latter , as the latter appeared to exert to obscur* the clear light of the former . The following sketch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions of intimate knowledge ; and which , though quickened by a warm gratitude , was yet guided by a fine intelligence and cultivated powers of judgment and discrimination . We give it from a preferene to allow more competent witnesses to speak the testimony which from ourselves might seem to wear the hue of exaggeration : " Such and so dear*as he was to all his friends , his absence is an aggravated loss to them ; yet we could not wish that his worth had been less , that our regrets might be diminished , nor can we say that we could better have spared a better man . No , he was so much more an object of confidence and honor than ordinary men , that the want of no inan ' * presence and influence could be more felt . But because he is ne* still here , he is not lost . rrhe value of his example and his sentiments , the effects of his services , and the recollections of all his goodness , yet abide with us . It is delightful to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a d our moral trust in our species b calling up a genuine illustration of what a man should be in all relations of life-husband , father , brother , friend , and member of society - surely it is no exaggeration to say that *n all these was without a fault , and no act of his life has blemished his lure name , or severed his dear ties . Often when I think of him , it is in relation to some principle which is undetermined in my own mind , or in doubts concerning some futur2 nrran* ements of life that may be more or les safe , more or less useful  --  and I stop and ask myself why were his opinions such a light ? Why did prudence cease to be a virtue in relation to him ? Why could we so securely trust in him ? His integrity , benevolence , and excellent understanding , certainly furnish an answer  --  but I should name his understanding first , because intelligence informed his virtues , and gave them their application and usehe might have been just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions of right and wrong , th re could not have been the same efficacy in his dispositions . I know not whether a primitiv moral sense led him in the ways of wisdom , or whether a rare sagacity showed him the better part , and it became his choice-certain it is , his virtues were no accidents , they grew up with his convictions , and were fostered by them . I think I never knew a man more sincere in morals , even in what are called little things ; one whose goo will and good opinions had in them more of cordiality and service*bleuess , and less of compliments and flatteries . There was a sn - // *licity in his honesty that made ambiguities and subterfuges detestable to him . Profession without practice seemed to him , not only unworthy , but foolish . He was never indifferent to any truth ; nothing which concerns God 's nature and will , and man 's obligation . and felicity , could , he seemed to consider , be wisely disregarded by a thinking and accountable being . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hox discerning and kind they were-in many cases how indulgent and how full of pity ! But in none did he lose discrimination in charity , or make any compromise between virtue and vice . Sins of passion and of ignorance , the deviations of untaught and unguarded minds , he always compassionated-aiways weighed the fault against the virtues and the capabilities of the offender-always believed in the regenerating principle , in the compensating power of the moral nature . But wicked habits and a seared conscience , all open-fronted and combined villany , all hypocrisy a 1d sordidness , his soul hated , and his generous indignation was most eminently excited and sustained against false profession , and iron-handed , cold-hearted selfishness . " Though he lived in the midst of society , surrounded by the iniquity that abounds , he was unspotted from the world . Pleasure did not catch him in her toils , nor avarice sully his hands with the gains of t*apacity . All the days of his active life , innocence found in him a defender , truth a champion , religion a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a liberal supporter against the enmity , the apathy , and the prejudices of other men . Who that ever knew him doubts or denies all this ? " One circumstance we may be permitted to advert to as alone securing to Mr. Sedgwick a title to the gratitude which few will be disposed to deny to such a claim . It was chiefly , if not wholly , to his appreciation . of her dormant powers , and to his encouragement and advice in the developement of them , that we owe all those charming productions of his sister 's pen , which are doubtless familiar to most of our readers , as among the most beautiful and valuable ornaments of American literature . To the same source is also to be attributed the noble direction which the genius of a Bryant has taken , in its worthy devotion to the cause of those great principles of democratic philanthropy to which the columns of the " New York Evening Post " have been devoted ever since it has been under the editorship of that gentleman . Mr. Sedgwick took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have since shed so shining a lustre on the name we have here ventured to introduce ; and it was chiefly under the influence of his persuasions that Mr. Bryant was induced to remove to New York from the obscurity of the uncongenial practice of a country lawyer , in a neighbouring village to Stoclibridge ; and through his means that he first beame connected with the Evening Post-with which arduous capacity // lie has since identified a reputation inferior in honor only to the more brilliant fame of his muse. * Mr. Henry Sedgwick was a frequent contributor , not alone to the Evening Post , but to several other newspapers and periodicals . Some interesting papers in the North American were from his pen . He wrote occasionally also in vindication of his religious opinions , which were those of Unitarian Christianity , from the attacks to which those opinions were at that period more often subjected than at present . Such writings were always , however , in a fine tone of liberal candor and kindliness . rrhe intense activity of his mind thus sought an additional vent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and important professional practice could not suffice to engross . He was the author of a number of pamphlets , generally marked by close and strong reasoning , originality of thought , perspicacity , and often elegance , of style , a graceful personal modesty , and uniformly by that spirit of warm and enlarged philanthropy which was the source whence his fine powers derived their chief stimulus to exertion . He may be regarded as one of the most influential of that school of Free Trade , then in a persecuted minority , which has now , we rejoice to say , conquered over to its own doctrines the decided preponderance of the public opinion even at the North . On this subject his pen was as prolific as it was able and zealous . The bent of his mind especially disposed him to regard it in the point of view of its moral importance , with reference to its influence on the condition of the great mass of society ; and among his other writings there are none which his friends can peruse with more satisfaction than a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , " under the title of " An Appeal for Justice to the Poor , " with the worthily adopted signature of * We are here tempted to introduce an anecdote suggested by this allusion to the earlier days of Mr. Bryant 's literary career , which reflects equal honor on all the distinguished names included in it . His first published poem after his removal to New York , ( " Thanatopsis , " and the lines " To a Water Fowl , " had previously appeared anonymously in Boston in the North American Review , then a comparatively obscure and limited publication , ) was his beautiful lines to the " Green River , " the name of a small stream near Great Barrington , the scene of Mr. Bryant 's early years . They first appeared in the year 1820 , in the " Idle Man , " a well-known delightful publication of Mr. Dana . At this period Drake-whose early death was scarcely premature , since he lived long enough to bequeath us " The American Flag , " and " The Culprit Fay " - resided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where it was the custom of his intimate friend Halleck to visit him for the holyday of Saturday afternoon and Sunday . On one of these occasions , being accompanied by Mr. Dana , the latter exhibited the manuscript of the lines to " Green River , " just received from their author , then unknown to fame . The sympathetic genius of both Drake and Halleck instantly appreciated all their beauty , and all the promise of an illustrious hereafter which shone from them ; and Halleck , by transcribing them , and exchanging his copy for the poet 's original , possessed himself of a manuscript of which he well foresaw the future value as an autograph relic  --  and the same has ever since remained in his possession as one of his most precious private treasures . // " A FrienJ to the Poor . " These , as alsO a inimb*r of ot1x*v v*1n*b1o contributions to that paper ( which was expressly established by Mr. Condy Raguet for the advocacy of the Free rfrade doctrine ) were published during the course of the year 1831 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind on this subject overcame the obstacles to exertion of this nature , which proceeded from a state of almost complete blindness , and a derangement of health that too sadly affected the integrity of his mental powers . He was the author of the suggestion for the Free Trade Convention at Philadelphia , on the 30th of September , 1831 , which he successfully urged upon the public mind , through the columns of the Evening Post , over the signature of " A Lover of his Country . " He also formed one of the preliminary meeting in Philadelphia from which issued the call for a more general and national assemblage . Of this body the state of his health ( having been shortly before stricken with a paralytic attack ) did not permit him to participate in the proceedings , though we find the name of his brother Theodore , the subject of the earlier portion of the present paper , recorded as one of its members . Mr. Henry Sedgxvick was , however , present on the occasion , and was invited by the Convention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for him to be supported by his friends . We will advert to only two other points of interest in this gentleman 's life  --  the one at the very outset , the other at the close , of his professional career , and by their harmony together proving that both proceeded from the same noble source deeply implanted at the foundation of his character . For the first we would refer the reader to the case of Greenwood vs . Curtis , in the sixth volume of the Massachusetts Reports . This was an action by the plaintiff , a resident of a Southern State , to recover on a contract which had been made on the coast of Africa , between his agent and the defendant  --  the latter then resident there as proprietor of several factories of the slave trade-for the delivery of a number of slaves in exchange for a cargo of goods . The defendant had but partially fulfilled the contract , having violated his engagement to deliver a balance of slaves remaining due on a settlement of the account current between the two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plaintiff to maintain his action , on a contract of such a nature , in the Courts of Massachusetts . The case was also considerably complicated by other points arising out of the special facts of the transaction . On one of these the Court felt itself able to sustain the action , and give judgment for the plaintiff , without throwing the stress of the case fuhl.y on that essential point , the immorality of the contract ; although incidentally , and with very weak reasoning , it did pronounce against the leading argument of the defence , viz. that the contract was essentially vitiated by its immorality . Judge Sedgwick was absent from the bench at the time of rendering the // judgment , engaged on his western circuit . He disapproved , however , of the opinion of the Court , and has added to the regular report of the case a long dissenting opinion , which is given by the reporter in the form of a note . This opinion was wholly the production of the pen , and to a great extent also of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student of law  --  the Judge having been so forcibly struck , in the course of a warm discussion of the subject with his son , with the large liberality of.his views , the soundness of his application of the principles of law , and the acute cogency of his reasoning , as to depute to the latter the task of preparing his opinion . It is a long , elaborate , and noble production , and we think a conclusive argument , on the highest legal and moral principles , against the right of the plaintiff to recover in the case . And characteristic as it is throughout , equally of the mind and heart of its author , we are glad of this opportunity of referring to it as a worthy monument to his memory . The other scene in his professional life to which we will advert , before concluding this too protracted Article , is alike its last and its brightest-we refer to the celebrated controversy of the Greek frigates , in 1826 . The Greeks , at that period struggling , with seeming hopelessness of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan of ? 2,000,000 in London . From these funds their deputies in that city contracted with two eminent mercantile houses in New York for the construction of two frigates , to be despatched as quickly as possible to the scene of action where their services were so urgently wanted . We will not at this day stir again , more deeply than necessary for the present purpose , the bitter waters of the controversy which grew out of this transaction . Without naming the houses , one of which is no longer in existence-nor entering into details familiar to public notoriety at a period yet fresh within the memory of many of our readers-it will be sufficient for us to state , that the confidence reposed by the unfortunate Greeks in the professed philanthropy , and the reputed commercial honor , of the agents thus selected by them , proved in the sequel disgracefully abused . The funds were most lavishly squandered ; the estimates and representations on which the contract had been assigned to the houses were grossly falsified by the event ; and finally , on the cessation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drafts of the houses  --  a considerably larger amount having been already drawn than the estimated cost of both frigates-extortionate demands of compensation for their agency were made by the latter , for which the vessels were held responsible . It became in the sequel necessary , for the special agent sent out to New York by the Deputies to protect their interests , to sell one of the vessels in order to obtain the means for the completion and equipment of the other . This gentleman , Mr. Alexandre Contostavlos , cast himself on the advice and aid of Mcssrs . H. D. and 1 . Sedgwick , and Messrs . Duer and Robinson , as // his counsel ; and the first named of these gentlemen in particular took up with his characteristic ardor and devotion a cause which so warmly addressed all his most generous sympathies . On an arbitration which was had upon the disputed accounts between the parties , an award was rendered which was denounced  --  and most justly-by the counsel for the Greeks , as grossly inequitable and illegal . The proceedings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended with a still gathering degree of excitement and acrimony . Mr. Contostarlos was placed in this difficulty of position , that not only was he most anxiously impatient for the departure of the remaining frigate - already delayed long after the time at which it was expected and urgently needed in Greece  --  but was in danger of its seizure and confiscation by the U. S. Government , the whole transaction being directly contrary to the laws of the United States , though the deputies had made it an express condition of the order for their construction , that it should only be undertaken if in accordance with those laws . It was found extremely difficult to obtain possession of the frigate out of the hands of the arbitrators ; and it was not without a display of spirited resolution , not unattended with personal danger , that Mr. Henry Sedgwick  --  the leading counsel in the business-was able to obtain the possession , and transfer it to the sacred cause for which it was designed . Into this affair he threw his whole soul . It excluded almost all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and the excitable sensibilities of his heart , in a constant state of tension so highly wrought , that its eventual effects were most prejudicial-most fatal , indeed  --  to both the mental and physical health of the devoted advocate . The bright and keen temper of the blade wore through its fragile sheath  --  and Henry Sedgwick was too soon perceived to have become a noble martyr to the noblest of causes . Among the numerous publications which were elicited by the mutual heats of this controversy  --  and in which all the overshadowing power of the high commercial and social influence of the houses and the arbitrators in question could not prevent a most signal triumph of the cause of the Greeks , before the tribunal of public opinion-our limits will permit us to cite only the following concluding passage cf the pamphlet " Narrative , &amp;c. " of the Greek Agent , himself a gentleman of distinguished ability , worth , and patriotism . We quote it notwithstanding its introduction of the names of still living parties , for the sake of the honorable tribute which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who most of all the gentlemen engaged was the master mind , the animating spirit , of the whole affair : " But what will fill every bosom with horror remains still to be told . I think I mentioned that the deputies , in commissioning these two frigates , wrote to both houses not to undertake the building of them in case the laws of the United Stat*w should be opposed to their construction and departure . Messrs . - and - // answered that there was no law to prevent it , and , without any farther trouble , undertook their construction . It was now , during the arbitration , contended by my counsel , and must be acknowledged on all hands , that this transaction was illegal , and that the frigates were subject to seizure and confiscation at every moment , and at the instigation of any man who should choose to be an informer . Was it then generous , was it just , was it christianlike , that these arbitrators , after having awarded to these houses a commission amounting altogether to $80,381 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and order their balances to be paid , and throw upon a foreigner not only the whole responsibility of the law , but also the impossibility of sending out this last resource to his country ! Generous reader , whoever you are , calm your anxiety . The frigate , the only frigate , which cost ? 155,000 sterling to the Greek nation , is now on her way to Greece . For the same country that gave birth to these arbitrators , gave also existence to Henry D. and Robert Sedgwick ; without whose intervention and assistance , the generous way in which , through their disinterested solicitations , a bond to an amount of $600,000 has been signed by several individuals , and their unparalleled exertions , the frigate , with this award , could never leave these American shores !

We select the folloxving from a Boston paper . In making this quotation , it will scarcely perhaps be necessary for us to allude to the qualification of some of its general statements , which the intelligent and friendly reader can make for himself , as to the latter portion of his professional practice , with reference to the probable , though long unsuspected , state of Mr. Sedgwick 's health ; and even this remark we are induced to make , only to meet and remove some erroneous impressions which may possibly linger on the minds of some persons , from circumstances of unaccountable eccentricity , within the period alluded to , to which they otherwise might not have possessed the proper clue " Died , at Stockbridge , on Friday last , after a long and distressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law , in the 47th year of his age .

RICHARD RUSH is the second on of the celebrated Dr. Benjamin Rush of Pennsylvania . To have been brought up by his father , is to be well educated ; for his communicative temper and habits made him a preceptor , continually imparting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learning , manners , industry , and emulation , of which he was an example as well as teacher , who left the world replenished with his principles and pupils . Richard Rush was born in Philadelphia , in August , 1780 , and is now therefore fifty-nine years old , enjoying a degree of bodily as well as mental activity and health unusual at that period . After having been at the usual preparatory schools , he was entered in the college at Princeton , at the age of fourteen , at which institution his father , and his maternal grandfather , Richard Stockton of New Jersey , had both been educated , both of whom were Signers of the Declaration of Independence . At college , though but little addicted to hard study , he was fond of debate and public speaking , for which intellectual exercises he early exhibited the germs of future excellence . He took his degree in the autumn of 1798 , being the youngest in a class of thirty-three . Immediately upon his graduation , he commenced the study of the law in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leaders of the Philadelphia Bar . The year following the whole country was in a state of martial excitement , under the wrongs and insults of France . The youth of the country poured in their addresses to the President , Mr. Adams , with // a tender of their services in case of war ; and young Rush , then seventeen years of age , did not hold back from the general feeling , though he was not of " MacPherson 's Blues . " This fervor of the country did not last long , neither invasion nor war having followed , except partial hostilities with France upon the ocean , where , as usual , our flag was triumphant . Towards the latter part of his time with Mr. Lewis , he gave himself up to close study , and was admitted to the bar in December , 1800 , when but little over twenty . His habits were at this period formed to laborious self-discipline and culture . During the six or seven years that followed , being still a member of his father 's family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not cease his devotion to study , making the night " joint laborer with the day , " and , although of a robust and strong constitution , endangering his health by the intensity of his application . The law , history , ancient and modern literature , government , the orators , the poets-these were the fields into which he went , reading the best authors . He formed at this time that intellectual habit so effective in the acquisition and retention of knowledge , and so beneficial to the mind itself , of digesting by reflection all that he read . Every volume received the full power of his attention ; important facts or thoughts were recalled , and entered in his own language in common-place books , and a short criticism and opinion passed upon many of them when finished . Nor , among the other studies which engrossed at this period the industrious energies of his mind , was that of politics forgotten , although he took no active part in them at this period of his life . If his personal and professional associates were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , in early life , the republican principles of Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Madison . The former , in the beautiful letter , published among his works , that he wrote on religion to Dr. Rush in 1803 , begins by saying : " In some of my delightful conversations with you in the evenings of 1798- ' 99 ( the black cockade days ) , and which served as an antidote to the afflictions of the crisis through which our country was then laboring , the Christain religion was our topic . " It was from such fountains the son took in political principles which throughout a life now not short have emphatically governed him . The first political meeting which he ever attended was one held in the State House Yard in Philadelphia , in 1807 , on the occasion of the attack by the British on our frigate Chesapeake . He had up to this time been known only as an ambitious and extremely studious young member of the bar . He made an animated and vigorous speech on the subject of the wrongs we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular , which was received with the warmest applause , and introduced him most favorably to the Republican party . Hitherto known but little as a public speaker , he was now looked upon as destined to eminence in this field . The year following brought him for the first time into professional notice . In // 1808 , in a speech that occupied the principal part of the day , he defended the Editor of the Aurora , Colonel Duane , who was prosecuted by the Commonwealth for a libel upon Governor McKean . This speech endeared him very much to his democratic fellow-citizens . There was a soundness in its political doctrines , and an eloquent fearlessness in its whole character , that seemed to entrench him at once in their warm affections . As an incident illustrative of the effect produced upon the friends of Colonel Duane by Mr. Rush 's powerful appeal for his client , it may be stated ; that one of the oldest democrats , who heard it , embraced him when he concluded , and took him up in his arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After this speech business at the bar poured in upon him rapidly . In this connexion he has often spoken , and always in terms of grateful acknowledgment , of the early professional friendship he received from the present Judge Hopkinson of Philadelphia , in all ways in which it could be cordially afforded to a young tyro at the bar . At the succeeding Congressional election , that patriarch of the democratic party in those days , and friend of Mr. Jefferson , Thomas Leiper , * together with Col. Duane and Dr. Lieb called on Mr. Rush and asked him to_the allow his name to be placed among the candidates for Congress ; but he declined , being at that epoch intent upon his profession . But he continued to receive ever afterwards manifestations of marked attachment and confidence from these and other champions of the democratic cause . Colonel Duane was unbounded in his thankfulness for his defence of him , and sent him a large fee-which was declined , Mr. Rush considering him as a persecuted man . Public bodies in Philadelphia , composed of democrats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Board of Health , the Guardians of the Poor , and other democratic functionaries , of the Northern Liberties . In January , 1811 , Governor Shyder appointed him Attorney General of Pennsylvania . His practice was now increasing daily . In the spring of this year a misunderstanding between Mr. Brown and himself ( Peter A. Brown , Esq. , of the Philadelphia Bar ) led to a duel . Neither party received any injury , and it is to the credit of both , that the event did not interrupt the courtesy of their subsequent intercourse . As Attorney General , he was necessarily brought into much intercourse and correspondence with Governor Snyder and his associates in the State administration , then consisting of the powerful democrats of the State of that era , viz. : Mr Findlay , afterwards Governor of the State , now Treasurer of the Mint ; General Porter , father of the present Governor ; Mr. Boilean , Mr. Bryant , and Mr. Cochrane-the esteem and confidence of all whom , as well as of the members of the * Mr. Jefferson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Major Butler , of South Carolina , and Mr. Leiper , were the only ones in Philadelphia to which he was ever invited during those days of Federal persecution ; and that the Federalists used to cross the streets to avoid him . // Political Portraits. - No . XVIII . April , Legislature whom he used to see in his visits on business to the seat of the State government , he gained in a high degree . At this point of time , and a little earlier , national politics had grown to be of intense interest . The s.tate of our relations with both England and France , the multiplied wrongs we had received from both , and the peculiar aggravation and malignity of those from England , as they included impressment and the killing of our citizens with her cannon off our shores , rendered a war with one or the other country almost inevitable . Home questions of a highly exciting nature also existed , and were of daily discussion in the press ; among others , that of renewing the charter of the old Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which Col. Duane was still Editor , contain Mr. Rush 's contributions on this subject against the renewal of the charter , on Mr. Madison 's original ground of its unconstitutionality . His father , though never in active politics , nor at all a party man , after the Revolutionary struggle ended , was nevertheless always opposed in his opinions to the banking and paper systems , and corresponded with Mr. Madison on the funding system ; in the strong condemnation of which he joined . The son had been deeply indoctrinated in the same opinions . Hence his opposition to the recharter of the late Bank of the United States is in unison with his early convictions ; as has been the case with thousands , owing to the usurpations of the late bank ; for these usurpations all honorable and correct merchants , like the Presidents of the first Bank of the United States , old Thomas Willing of Philadelphia , and David Lenox , though of the Federal party , would have joined in condemning , as having sprung from a reckless school of foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of banking . Thomas Willing would have gone to the rack before he would have issued as currency the notes of a defunct bank , have brought down upon himself a penal statute from Congress . In November , 1811 , on the appointment of the late Judge Duval to the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States , Mr. Madison , then President , immediately nominated Mr. Rush to the office of Comptroller of the Treasury , which Judge Duval had vacated . This appointment was entirely unexpected by him , as it had been unsought ; but it seems to have been peculiarly acceptable to the democratic party of his State , whose favor and confidence he universally enjoyed , to an extent never surpassed perhaps by any one at his age . He declined accepting this appointment at first , but wrote to the Secretary of State , on receiving the commission , asking time to deliberate . He did not accept it until he had ascertained from that source , that its duties would raise no official impediment to the occasional exercise of his profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . r* he ensuing January he removed with his family , having married a southern lady , to Washington . // The friendship between his father and Mr. Madison was a good passport to the kind dispositions of the latter towards him on his first arrival in Washington ; and it was his good fortune to gain the esteem arid friendship of that great and good man , and to have been honored with his confidence ever afterwards . The war having been declared against England in June , 1812 , Mr. Rush was selected to deliver a public oration in Washington on the 4th of July immediately following . The occasion was a marked one , and the auditory not less so , consisting of the President , Heads of Department , nearly all the members of both Houses of Congress1 besides citizens and strangers  --  the foreign ministers among the latter . It was delivered in the Hall of the House of Representatives1 and made a large addition to his rising reputation . It has been preserved among the repositories of American eloquence ; and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark , that in portraying the causes of the war , in order to prove that it was both just and necessary , the views which he gave of the question of impressment showed a perfect knowledge of that whole subject , and have left on record an exposition of it , whether as to argument or rhetoric , force or fire , not easy to have been surpassed on such an occasion ; parts of which have passed into the national classicality of our school-books as models of patriotic eloquence . As the contest proceeded , few persons in the country did more towards causing its true nature to be rightly understood . His mind and pen were always active and ardent in explaining and upholding the cause of his country ; in exhortation and encouragement under the incessant attacks of the Federalists upon the Administration ; the effects of whose opposition undoubtedly were to strengthen the hands of the public enemy . The columns of the National Intelligencer , then the great Democratic paper of the Government and nation , and the Democratic press of Philadelphia , were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public ; the latter paper , cunducted by his zealous friend Colonel Binns , having first given circulation to his communications under the signature of " John Dickinson "  --  the same signature that he adopted while explaining at a later day , in the Globe , the policy of General Jackson in regard to the French treaty of indemnity . In the session of 1813 his early friend Mr. C. J. Ingersoll , then in the House of Representatives , was his guest in Washington ; and their efforts were united , as they have been since , in the cause of their country , the former being at that time her zealous and eloquent champion in Congress . In the summer of 1814 , when the war was assuming its greatest fury , and Federal Opposition proportionably augmenting its own , Mr. Rush addressed a letter to the Mayor of Philadelphia , apprising him of Admiral Cochrane 's hostile intentions along our shores , before his incendiary proclamations were made public ; for which letter he received torrents ' of Federal abuse . A few we*ks U2 // afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful arts , and to legislation , burnt , Baltimore approached , and Philadelphia threatened . In February , 1814 , the posts of Secretary of the Treasury and Attorney General being vacant , the former by the resignation of Mr. Pinckney , the latter by Mr. Gallatin having overstaid the time it was kept open for him while engaged in negotiations for peace abroad , Mr. Madison placed either post at Mr. Rush 's disposal , leaving the decision with himself . He was then thirty-three years of age . He went into the latter , and thus , as a member of the Cabinet , became associated with the President in his official , as he had already possessed his personal , confidence . His habits of investigation and study , especially in the field of public law , had laid the best foundation for a knowledge of the high duties of this important station . For their discharge he was accordingly always found ready ; and by residing in Washington , and ceasing to practice in other courts , he was always at hand . One of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts on the subject of our citizens holding intercourse with the enemy by going on board of their ships within our waters or off the coasts ; in the course of which , with the lights of a mind imbued with the principles applicable to the belligerent and neutral state of nations , and cognizant of the political obligations of the citizen , he discriminated the cases of lawful and unlawful intercourse with the enemy . This letter was published in the National Intelligencer and elsewhere , and had its effect in helping to disseminate correct views on a subject so important ; and the general soundness of the opinions he gave to the different departments of the Government , in all the variety and complication of its service in a state of war , and the changing face of things on a return to peace , has never been called in question . It may be added , that with the exception of one of the terms of the Supreme Court , when he was prostrated by a dangerous illness , during which he was consoled by a daily visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was never found wanting in the prompt and efficient performance of his duty before that high and imposing tribunal , being always ready to proceed with the causes of the United States as they were called on for argument . While a member of the Cabinet , he kept a minute , as long the war lasted , of what passed at every Cabinet meeting , and did the same of events from the first breaking out of the war ; noting down from time to time his conversations with Mr. Madison when carrying with them a public interest . Nor must the fact be omitted , that as a cabinet councillor , though youngest in the body , he was the strenuous and unshaken advocate for the most vigorous war measures against the enemy , which the Federalists , at every stage of the war , were endeavoring to paralyze and check ; not only by their rancorous opposition to Mr. Madison , whom at last they were for sending to // Elba with Bonaparte , but by constantly holding out delusive expectations of peace-declaring always that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In proportion to the zeal with which Mr. Rush was known to oppose these and similar unpatriotic and false allegations , did he draw down Federal hostility , and become an object of its unsparing attacks . While Attorney General , an Act of Congress devolved upon him , in conjunction with the Secretary of State , then Mr. Monroe , the duty of prescribing the plan and manner in which a new edition of the laws of the United States should be published . As the first law officer of the Government , the execution of this duty was chiefly assumed by Mr. Rush . He submitted his plan , which was a comprehensive one , to the Secretary of State , by whom it was approved in all its parts . It directed for the first time the republication at large of all repealed or expired laws and treaties , in order that the progress and history of our whole system of federal legislation , as well as of our international relations , might be traced by easy reference to every law or treaty that had ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journals of the old Congress during the Confederation , with a view to the republication in full of all such acts or ordinances as affected the territorial domain of the States or Union ; or as might serve to connect , by a short chronological series , the early official acts of the Revolutionary Government , or those of the Confederation between 83 and 89 , with the formation of the present , Constitution of the United States . The whole work was superintended by Mr. Rush with the greatest care , and forms the edition of 1815 in five volumes . The first volume , which comprises the documents last described , contains a body of ancient and fundamental law belonging to our Federal and State systems of government , than which no other of the same compass is more valuable at the present day to the student of our political history and to the jurist ; and none is more authentic , since every document was invariably collated with the original roll deposited in the Department of State , where the original roll existed . His plan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be consulted with advantage by any one desirous of embodying in the best form the statutory code of any of our States , as it has formed the model for that of the Union . On Mr. Monroe 's installation in the Presidency , in March , 1817 , he appointed Mr. Adams Secretary of State , recalling him from the London mission where he then was . Until he could arrive in the United States , Mr. Rush was commissioned by the President to act as Secretary of State . This appointment being temporary , only a partial share of its duties devolved upon him . He corresponded with the Spanish Minister , Mr. Onis , on our relations with Spain ; held interviews with the Abb6 Correa , Minister from Portugal  --  but still better known as the venerable sage and philosopher of Portugal , and friend of Mr. // Jefferson-on our relations with that country produced by the revolution in Pernambuco ; and concluded an arrangement with the British Minister , Mr. Bagot , by which it was stipulated that Great Britain and the United States should reciprocally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to one vessel on each of the lakes , of not more than one hundred tons burden , and armed with only one eighteen pound cannon . This was the principal diplomatic business which added itself to the ordinary routine of the home business of the Department during the season he was connected with it . But he has often spoken of it as one that afforded him a rich treat by the oppor tunities to * , n the original it opened him of readiuc ' i , the correspondence of our early and illustrious diplomatic men-Franklin , the elder Adams , Jefferson , Jay , and others of Revolutionary fame . The volumes containing it were sent to his house after office hours , and he was enabled to revel in these pages of political wisdom , sagacity , and knowledge , from men whose names may be said to mark an era in diplomatic history , and the treasures of whose minds are generally conveyed in a style of such classic purity . Mr. Adams arrived in the United States towards the latter end of the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department , of which Mr. Rush had been the incumbent for six months . The contest for Governor between Mr. Findlay and Mr. Heister coming on at about this time in Pennsylvania , Mr. Rush 's devotion to the interests and prosperity of his State would not allow him to be a mere spectator of it although residing in Washington . He took an active part in the election with his pen , exerting his utmost zeal in favor of the Democratic candidate , Mr. Findlay , who was taken up as the successor of Governor Snyder-that pure patriot and wise Chief Magistrate , so long the favorite and boast of Pennsylvania . One of his pieces that appeared in the Democratic press was republished in Philadelphia in the pamphlet form , and circulated throughout the State with acknowledged advantage . He had the satisfaction to witness the success of his friend and candidate , Mr. Findlay , in opposition to his federal competitor . On the 31st of October , 1817 , the President appointed Mr. Rush Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of Great Britain . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified him for this new station , which came to him as unsolicited as it was naturally gratifying at his time of life . It opened at that era of our affairs a wide and dignified sphere of public duty . The war with Great Britain over , it became an important object with our Government to settle a great number of questions remaining unadjusted with that nation , the discussion of which in time of peace might give better hope of useful results than had ever been accomplished anterior to the war , when practical wrongs were con*tantly producing an irritated state of feeling ketween the two coun // tries . To Mr. Rush were to be confided the high duties and negotiations to be entered upon in these hopes . Mr. Adams , with his happy command of resources for compliment , as of resources for everything , perceiving that while temporarily in the Department of State he had been aiming to make himself acquainted with our foreign affairs , jocosely remarked , before he took his departure for England , that he should have to treat him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador to England- " make him write his own instructions . " With the ample and able ones of Mr. Adams , Mr. Rush embarked with his family from Annapolis for London in November , 1817 , in the Franklin seventy-four , Commodore Stewart . The incumbent of the London mission is at all times loaded with a crowded variety of business , direct and incidental ; and it would be in vain , in a limited sketch like this , to attempt an enumeration of a tithe of all that fell into Mr. Rush 's hands while on this mission , during the prolonged term of more than seven years . His official correspondence , which may be seen in some six or eight folios in the Department of State , attests that he was no idler . He wrote also largely to the President in the shape of private and informal letters , from the first year of his residence to the last , besides maintaining , under Mr. Adams 's instructions , a regular correspondence with all our foreign ministers and diplomatic agents in Europe and on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political and commercial affairs where he was stationed , he might be constantly receiving and imparting information to bear usefully on the knowledge of our own foreign interests in all their broadest relations . The first regular negotiation upon which he entered with the British government was in August , 1818 , in conjunction with Mr. Gallatin . The subjects brought into it were manifold-I . The slave question under the treaty of Ghent . 2 . The Fisheries . 3 . The North Western Boundary line , and Columbia River questions . 4 . The renewal of the commercial convention of 1815. 5 . The intercourse between the United States and British West India Islands , and that between the United States and their North American colonies , inland and by sea . 6 . Impressment. 7 . The law of blockade . 8 . The colonial trade in time of war . 9 . The law of contraband , and various minor questions . After ample discussions , which continued until the 20th of October , the plenipotentiaries of the two nations agreed upon and signed on that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from among the above contested ones , were arranged : -1 . The Fisheries , securing to us the right to fish off certain coasts and islands of the British possessions north of us , and within their bays and harbors ; whereby an imminent prospect of collision between the two countries was prevented , the British contending that we had lost all our fishing rights under the old treaty of 1783 by the war of 1812 ; which we denied . 2 . The boundary line from the Lake of the Woods . 3 . An article e%fectin* // a temporary arrangement of claims beyond the Rocky Mountains and to the Columbia River . 4 . A prolongation for ten years of the commercial convention then in existence between the two countries . And 5. an article that laid the foundation , through an umpirage by the Emperor of Russia , of indemnification to our southern citizens whose slaves had been carried off by the British ships at the close of the last war , in violation of the treaty of Ghent . Besides the joint official despatch from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiation , with all the arguments , as published among our State Papers , Mr. Rush transmitted to Mr. Monroe a full account of it in a separate communication taken from his own private journal kept of every day 's proceeding . He did not , while in England , confine his attention or his communications to business strictly official , but extended both over a wider surface , in the hope of making his public residence there useful to his country in other things . On the state of European politics generally he *wrote whenever deriving information from sources other than those opened by the press to all ; and it was his habit once a year to present to the Secretary of State , from personal observation and inquiries , parliamentary documents examined and digested , and all other sources of information accessible , besides general views of the internal state of the British Empire , as regarded commerce , manufactures , her institutions of public force and finance , and other statistical matter . To the great naval establishments of England he gave , at all intervals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent attachment to the interests and glory of our own navy , and a personal fondness for such inquiries , the great naval arsenals of England , and transmitting , as voluntary communications to the Navy Department , or board of Navy Commissioners , or to some one of our naval constructors , whatever struck him during these visits that appeared to be worthy of note . He did the same  --  and particularly in letters to Commodore Rodgers as President of the Navy Board , and to Commodore Decatur as his personal correspondent-whenever obtaining , through his intercourse with those who directed the naval administration of England , information that he thought might be of use ; carefully mentioning new plans that were executing or projectted , and new inventions for carrying forward naval science . The execution of Arbuthnot and Ambrister , for joining the Seminole Indians who were at war with us , raised at first a prodigious flame in England . The fact of the commanding general of an American army hanging two British subjects contrary to the sentence of a court martial , was at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and seemed horror-struck . This event devolved upon Mr. Rush an important and delicate duty . The stocks fell under the first shock of the news , from an apprehension that war would follow . Our Minister was anxiously looked to by the British // government for the necessary explanations . Note upon note came to him from Lord Castlereagh bearing the endorsement , " Immediate . ' 1 His interviews with him were frequent and prolonged , and with What discretion , united to firmness , he carried himself on that whole occasion , his official despatches to our Government will attest . He had to defend General Jackson against the whole array of the British Cabinet , with Lord Castlereagh , Lord Liverpool , and Mr. Canning in the van , one and all of them prejudiced against him in the beginning , in common with the British public at large and both Houses of Parliament , to an extent not easy to be conceived  --  to such an extent indeed that Lord Castlereagh declared , that " war might have been produced by holding up ajinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage of hell , were among the epithets that the newspapers of London lavished upon him . Mr. Rush has often recurred to this perio4 in conversation with his friends , as one of extraordinary interest , and to himself as the most anxious of his mission ; mentioning among other anecdotes , that a deformed and hideous picture of the General was paraded in the streets , the men who held it up on a pole bellowing forth , in vociferous repetition , " JAcKsoN THE MURDERER ! " But the defence of our hero , while an anxious task , was triumphantly accomplished on all the points on which he had been assailed , by the patriotic zeal , knowledge and conciliatory course of Mr. Rush , aided by the powerful and just exposition which Mr. Adams had given of the case in his celebrated letter to Mr. Erving , our Minister in Spain , a copy of which was sent to him . Mr. Rush distinctly justified our heroic and traduced chief on the ground of humanity as well as all the grounds of public law ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men , who , worse a great deal than the savages themselves , stirred up the latter to the butchery of our citizens along the frontier , and to the slaughter of whole families , wo* men and children included , in methods of atrocity to make humanity shudder . Mr. Tompkins was at this time Vice-President of the United States1 but was taken up in 1820 as candidate for Governor in Ne* York1 and ran against Mr. Clinton . Had he been chosen7 a vacancy would have existed in the Vice-Presidency , and the country was beginning to bend its thoughts towards a successor to Mr. Tompkins in the event of this contingency . A Democratic Convention that assembled that year at Lewistown in Pennsylvania , from all parts of the State , for the re-nomination of Governor Findlay , that able head of the party at that time and sterling champion of their principles and cause at all times , also nominated Mr. Rush , although in England , for the Vice* Presidency , in - case the contingency in question should occur-the most signal mark of confidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pennsylvania . To so impressive and endearing an evidence of confidence and affection from his native State he // was deeply sensible , and clung to it as a proud trophy in a foreign land . To be remembered at all when absent is gratifying  --  to be so remembered doubly gratifying , as it holds up to the world of strangers an authentic proof of qualities and merits being appreciated where they have been longest and best known . A remarkable incident in Mr. Rush 's mission to England was the overture of Mr. Canning to him in the summer and autumn of 1823 on the subject of the Spanish American states . It had been a regular part of his duty to watch over the interests of these rising states , a duty which he never failed zealously to perform , above all in striving to conciliate , in all just ways and upon all proper occasions , the good will of the Court and Cabinet of England in their behalf ; towards which end he had repeated interviews with Lord Castlereagh in all the earlier parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good service he rendered to the great cause of human liberty in South America in these ways during his mission . At his domicil the informal representatives and agents of the new states who flocked to London throughout a period of five years , found a hospitable reception , social countenance , and the warmest political sympathy ; to which the Garcia del Rios , the Paroissiens , the Ravengas , and other distinguished names of the new states , could bear testimony . But in the autumn of 1823 , their cause , prosperous as it had been up to that time , began to look gloomy . France , under the old Bourbons , had made war upon the constitutional system of Spain ; the Duke D'Angoul*me had crossed the Bidassoa , with a French army of eighty thousand men , and announced in his proclamations , almost in direct words , an intention , in which the Holy Alliance were to join , of stretching their united arms across the ocean to reinslave Spanish America as soon as they should have cloven down liberty in old Spain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Cadiz , the last strong-hold of the constitutional party , was soon expected to fall . England got alarmed . Mr. Canning was then Foreign Secretary . He approached Mr. Rush , as the plenipotentiary of the *Jnited States , to sound him on the policy of the two nations ' interposing , by some formal convention or other joint act , their influence and determination to check the execution of the dangerous ' schemes of this unholy confederacy of Emperors and Kings . Notes passed and conferences were held of a highly confidential nature between the two functionaries , which have never been published by either Government . It is generally understood that Mr. Rush declined pledging his Government to anything , unless England would place herself in equal condition with the United States , by acknowledging , as the latter had then done , the independence of the new states , assigning his reasons why she should take this step . In that event Mr. ' Rush declares his readiness to throw himself in the breach , and assume the responsibility of taking the joint measure proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government , for which there was no time to wait . England declined to take at that time the step which Mr. Rush required . The latter kept our Government fully informed of what was going on by the earliest possible opportunities ; and had the satisfaction to receive its approbation of his whole course under an emergency so critical . This was the more acceptable to him as he was thrown entirely upon his own judgment from the beginning to the end of the emergency . Mr. Monroe was heard to say , that if the Cabinet had been at his elbow , step by step , he could not have acted more to his satisfaction . His communications were the key to those memorable declarations in Mr. Monroe 's Message of the second of December , 1823 , received with such enthusiasm*by the whole country , that the United States could not behold such an interposition by the Holy Alliance " in any form with indifference ; " and that " the American eontiuents , by the free and independent condition which they had assumed and maintained , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonization by any European power . " In Stapleton 's Life of Canning this important subject is touched% the author remarking , that- " Towards the latter end of August , 1823 , Mr. Canning sounded Mr. Rush , the then Minister of the United States in this country , as to whether in his opinion the moment were not arrived when the two Governments of Great Britain and the United States might not come to some understanding with each other on the subject of the Spanish American Colonies ; and whether it would not be expedient for themselves , and beneficial for the world , that the principles of it should be clearly settled and plainly avowed . " The work adds : " As that gentleman 's answer is written in the same spirit of confidence , it will not be right , and fortunately it is not now material , to state the nature of that answer , farther than to say that in every respect it was highly creditable to its distinguished author . " Mr. Rush desired to return home to his country in 1823 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prevented by a very extensive negotiation being put into his hands by the Government in that year , which did not close until August , 1824 . Its important and onerous duties had the effect of prolonging his stay until the year following . The ii*gotiatk*n was one of unusual compass , and embraced questions of novelty as well as great magnitude . The right of the United States , da grounds of natural as well as public law , to the navigation of the River St. Lawrence in its whole length and breadth , to and from th' sea , was on this occasion for the first time brought into discussion with Great Britain . Their right to the territory west of the Rocky Mountains , and their rights ak*ng the North West coast of America , were also asserted and discussed itt a manner far more full and explioit than in his fornler negotiation jointly with Mr. Gallatin . The West India Ttad* question , under various new lights since the former vcYL. vii . NO. xxvxrI. - APiUL% 1840 . V // negotiation , was most copiously treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so formidable , was handled under some of its earlier aspects before being submitted to the King of Holland ; several maritime questions of great moment , and various other points and topics of high international concern , which it does not fall within the purpose of such a sketch as this even to enumerate . Foreseeing the great labor , and still more the responsibility , of so complicated a negotiation , he was desirous of a colleague ; more especially as two plenipotentiaries , Mr. Huskisson and Mr. Stratford Canning , were appointed on the side of Great Britain , with the opportunity of constant access to the- British Cabinet during its progress . A special Secretary was also appointed by England to keep the records of that negotiation ,  --  in so important a light was it regarded . That the Government did not grant Mr. Rush a colleague must be taken as a proof of its confidence in his unassisted ability and prudence . Mr. Adams 's instructions were full and able , as they always were to our foreign Ministers ; but in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must needs have happened , and did , that he would be often left to the resources of his own mind to solve difficulties not anticipated , and meet discussions started by the occasion . His full report of the whole negotiation at its close , though writing to the Government from time to time during its pendency , is contained in an official despatch to the Secretary of State dated the 12th of August , 1824 , comprising sixty closely printed pages , as published by the Senate in January , 1825 ; which is not mentioned as a merit , but only as a proof of the compass of its matter , its merit rather consisting in its condensation . Although no treaty was effected by this negotiation- ( except one for a restricted concert of naval operations between the two powers against the slave trade , which the Senate did not ratify ) - much was done towards ascertaining the policy and views of Great Britain , on many points of great importance , a little of which may be here mentioned . She refused to entertain proposals from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against private property upon the ocean  --  a great consummation to humanity if it could be effected , and which the example of England and the United States probably would have effected with all nations . But England turned away from it instantly , under the proposals Mr. Rush made-in a manner scarcely to have been expected , considering her overflowing zeal to get rid of the slave trade . We are unavoidably driven to account for her determination to continue practices so intrinsically barbarous , and the principle of which has long been given up , among civilized nations in war upon land , by recollecting her own large means of privateering , and capturing private property in war upon the ocean . She refused to depart from the ground she had taken on impressment in the negotiation of 1818-that is , she would not surrender her alleged // right to enter our vessels on the high seas to search for her men , unless we would give her previous guarantees that none were on board , of a nature that we had told her , in the negotiation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scouted our claim to the navigation of the St. Lawrence . She would hardly listen to it with patience , as the protocols of the negotiation attest . She denied Mr. Monroe 's princzple ? fl regard to colonization on the American continents , declaring her own right to colonize oit all parts of it unoccupied , as fully as when she made her Nootkah Sound convention with Spain in 1790 . She claimed the right of navigating , equally with ourselves , the Columbia River ; and Mr. Rush is known to hold the opinion that we shall probably not find it an easy task to obtain the recognition of our rights from her west of the Rocky Mountains , or on the coast of the Pacific . All these and other subjects of international concern between Great Britain and this country are gone into with great care and research in the despatch from him mentioned , to which the critical posture of our affairs with England at the present moment can not fail to give deep interest . He holds the opinion indeed , that she will proudly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be little likely to yield up any part of it without an earnest struggle . When Mr. Adams was chosen President by the House of Representatives after the fierce contest among the four rival candidates in 1824 , he appointed Mr. Rush Secretary of the Treasury , and called him home to take charge of that Department . Having been so many years out of the country , he had not participated in the angry strife which that memorable election engendered ; but had taken post upon the old democratic principle of the caucus , under which Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Madison had been elected ; and was in favor of Mr. Crawford , the caucus candidate . This being known through his private correspondence , those of his Democratic fellow-citizens in Pennsylvania who went for the same candidate placed his name at the head of the Crawford electoral ticket , his return home being then expected in time to vote , should that ticket succeed . He left London in June , 1825 , leaving behind him in England to high character , which a long residence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gentlemanly courtesy ; and arrived in the United States in July . He found surrounding Mr. Adams , in the new Cabinet , Mr. Clay , Mr. Barbour , Mr. Southard , Mr. Wirt-all of them men whose public lives , like his own , had been identified up to that epoch with the Democratic Party . Separated for some years from our home affairs , and having given no special attention while abroad to our Treasury concerns , it was his wish , on returning , if the President had thought the change proper , that Mr. Southard should be in that Department , and he be assigned to the Navy Department ; investigations // in the latter sphere having engaged large portions of his time and attention in the great naval kingdom where he had been residing . The President deciding against a change , he entered with great industry upon the duties of the rrreasury devoting himself to them exclusively , and with an application the most resolute . I-us reports to Congress while in that Department are now , like his negotiations abroad , part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a strenuous advocate for American manufactures , as were nearly all the middle , northern , and western portions of the Union at that time ; though our intervening history and present condition have unavoidably changed the nature of that question , as was admitted in a letter published by Mr. Rush himself last fall . He neither advocated prohibition , nor permanent protection , as means of encouraging our manufactures-limiting his recqmmendations to such aid only by law as would be required to give them a start against the pre-existing skill and superior capital of older nations . He inculcated uniformly and as strongly the policy of fostering the other great branches of national industry in all ways just and practicable . A reduction of duties on teas and wines , still high when he caine jnto the Department , were favorit* measures with him ; and his full report to the House of Representatives on the growth and manufacture of silk , prepared and transmitted in 1828 , in compliance with a previous call , may be considered as having given the first impulse to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , to become at no distant day so great and productive a source of home industry throughout the United States , south , middle , east , and north . His ample report to the house of of Representatives in 1826 , on an enlargement of the warehousing and drawback systems , is a direct appeal to Congress for encouraging , by legislative assistance in these ways , our commerce with all parts of the world upon the broadest and most liberal scale . He was for outstripping England in these as the liberal points in her commercial system , instead of keeping behind her ; dwelling upon them also as the points that had mainly conducted to the commercial grandeur of Holland , and as especially proper for the United States to make the most of , at an era when the emancipation of all Spanish America opened such boundless fields to a new carrying trade , which it was their true policy to seize upon . rrhus the partisan of no one branch of industry in particular , his reports show an enlightened estimate of the various interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination , as the true road to national wealth and power ; and-whatever th' degrees in which different readers may coin* cide with or dissent from them-they evince a range *f thought and fainiliarity with the commercial policy of other nations now and heretofore , especially England , that fully qualified him to counsel with the representat4ves of the nation on the best means of promoting the natiqi s // terests in connexionwith these large views which his sense of his duty prompted him to suggest and develope from the Department he filled . Mr. Rush was was very much the slave of his oThce while in the rrrea .. sury Department , never having been absent a dayfrom its duties during the three years and a half that he held it , except . on one occasion when he was confined to his house by a weeks illness . Towards the close of Mr. Adams 's Presidential term , his name was placed on the ticket with that of Mr. Adams , as a candidate for the Vice-Pre* sidency , and he received at the election that followed the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residency-General Jackson being then chosen President , and Mr. Cahoun Vice-President . He ceased to be Secretary of the Treasury ii March , 1829 , when General Jackson 's administration commenced , and a couple of months afterwards went to England at the united reque&amp; of the City of Washington and towns of Georgetown and Alexandriz , to negotiate for them a loan of a million and a half of dollars , which Congress had authorized them to make at six per cent. , for the purpose of meeting their subscriptions to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal . The credit of these places being supposed to be but little known in Europe , no sanguine expectations of his success appear to have been entertained . There were merchants in Baltimore who alleged that he woild not obtain it under twenty per cent. , and bankers in Philadelphia who predicted that it could not be got at all . His first attempts to get it in England were not successful . In July he erossed over to Holland , where he was also thwarted at first , and retnrned again to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not , as hinted ja his communications , consider himself as having been treated with any extreme measure of liberality by the Barings . Staying in London throughout the autumn , and waiting events , a correspondence was opened between himself and the house of the Cromelines of Amsterdam .. - that ancient house of scrupulous honor , and endeared to the United States by having been first to trust them in theit glorious but perilous Revolutionary struggle . This correspondence was actively yet silently carried on for some months , and ended in Mr. Rush 's obtaining the whole loan atfive and a half per cent. , with which he returned home in January , 1830 . He made a full report of his proceedings to his three constituents , and the City of Washington published it . The municipal government of the City , and that of each of the towns , passed resolutions approving of his course in the whole matter , and thanking him for his judicious and successful exertions . This trip to Europe renovated his health , which has since been uninterrupted . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Pennsylvania , his native State . To this change he was mainly impelled from the more favorable opportunities it would afford of superintending the studies of his children , than a large or commercial city , and // from the attractive localities about that ancient town , once the seat of our Revolutionary Congress . The Antimasonic question was then raging in Pennslyvania , and a new one to him . At leisure to examine it , he did so . * by his principles to regard combinations and monopolies of all kinds as adverse to the interests and rights of the many in favor of tle few , he became convinced of the abuses to which Masonry miglt be put in the hands of ill disposed and weak minded men , and ex*essed his convictions fervidly in several public letters , that circulated widely in those portions of the country where the Antimasonic principle prevailed . These letters so recommended him to the Antimasons , that the leading members of that party in Lancaster County , the head quarters of its strength in Pennsylvania , formally solicited him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up among those from whom they intended to select . their candidate for the Presidency at their convention which was to meet in Baltimore in the autumn of 1831 . This he declined , having expressed his opinions and written his letters with no selfish views . The convention , not having Mr. Rush 's name before it , nominated Mr. Wirt . It was scarcely doubted by any one , that Mr. Rush would have received the nomination had he ccnsented . In 1833 he removed to the county of Philadelphia , where he now lives , in a matemal home . In September of this year came out General Jackson 's famous cabinet paper setting forth the causes that made it his duty to remove the public deposits from the custody of that perfidious institution , the Bankof the United States . Opposed to the recharter of the old Bank , Mr. Rush had , nevertheless , as a member of Mr. Madison 's cabinet in 1816 , gone with that illustrious statesman , with Alexander James Dallas , that renowned and accomplished champion of the democratic cause in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some faith , in concurring in a new Bank of the United States , supposed to have become necessary , in the disordered state of the finances which the factious efforts of Federalism to pull down everything during the war had produced ; and with thousands of Democrats , including nil Democratic Pennslyvania , had sustained the new bank while it acted honestly . But in General Jackson 's exposure of its misdeeds all such beheld the necessity of its downfall . Mr. Rush in particular could not fail to see , in the democratic principles he would have applied to Antimasonry , a tenfold stronger ground of alarm at the conduct of the Bank ; for here was an institution whose sway was over the whole Union , using its unlimited millions in corrupting the press and controlling the laws ; and these had been the allegations against the associated power of Masonry-whether rightfully or not , we are not now arguing . The difference was so great , that any parallel would be absurd ; for while it was said by Antimasons that the ties of the Lodge influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was evident that the carporate power of the Bank , *wielding its tremendous money power , siruck at the entire root of legislation itself . It was able , as the end has shown , to set at defiance the very Constitution of the United States , the latter providing that only gold and silver shall be money ; w**ile this bank , by its career of law-breaking , fraud , and despotism , has at length fairly got the better of this Constitutional provision , ard we have seen through its means irredeemable rags legalized as mcney by the legislators og several of the States . Hence it has undermined and uprooted the very attributes and powers of popular sovereignty . The timely and fearless stand he took in justifying the removal of the deposits , as a step of imperious necessity and o7 the highest wisdom , was in unison with the democratic principles i4entified with his education and his public life . It endeared him tu the democratic party of the nation , who had been no stranger to his early name and long exertions in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epoch , when the timid and calculating held back , when some of the stoutest hearts quniled under the terrifying proscriptions of the Bank of the United States . The letters that he continued to write from time to time , under calls made upon him , sometimes from States distant from his own , through his well known national name , powcrfully laid open the enormities of that unprincipled institution . It may perhaps be affirmed that few , if any , of our public men among his contemporaries , have been more before the public than Mr. Rush , as a political writer . The posts he has held in the service of the Republic have made him a writer , while all his intellectual aptitudes and personal qualities seem calculated to have given him rank among its public speakers . With a mind of rich mould-an admirable knowledge of men-with information gathered from a wide scope of lonely study and extended practical observation-with a ready command of language , advantages of voice , ardor of temperament , controlled by judgment , purity and boldness of heart-had his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in executive and diplomatic duties , he would have found before him a wide field for useful and distinguished service . But these aptitudes and qualities have come to his aid in political discussion with his pen . His political essays are in a style popular , interrogatively argumentative , dignified , and bold . Restrained and mild in all his personal relations , he applies the lash of argument , in the cause of offended truth , with strong and skilful power of attack , and with entire fearlessness . His strongest political essay , as a single production , is perhaps the letter written by him in the fall past , to some of the citizens of Berks County in his own State , and largely republished out of Pennsylvania . The letter addressed to him asked his views upon the " questions of financial policy connected with the Independent Treasury and the // present suspension of specie payments , " and was from thirteen of the truest and oldest names of that old democratic county . Mr. Rush 's reply has embodied and explained in a condensed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States throughout America and in Europe , as mainly causing the suspension ; takes strong views of the necessity and advantages of the Independent Treasury ; and psrticularly called public attention to the dangers the Bank of the United States is bringing , and has already brought , upon the highest interests of the foreign commerce of the United States . He dwells upon the rapidly increasing facilities of commercial intercourse between England and India through the Arabian and Persian Gulfs by means ofsteam , as likelytQ turn English attention to the culture of cotton in India ; and charges it upon the Bank as the worst of all offences against the trade of the United States , that it should have done its best towards making it England 's interest to go on with this culture of India cotton , by having , in its criminal avarice , piled up monopolies of American cotton in the warehouses of Liverpool . His views under this head are now but the more striking , as it has been seen by a speech of Sir James C. Hobhouse , in the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a member of the Cabinet , and President of the India Board of Control , how seriously the English are beginning to look to their possessions in India for their supplies of raw cotton . In the latter end of March , 1835 , a most angry dispute existed between the State of Ohio and the Territory of Michigan , on the subject of their respective boundaries . It had risen to such height that the prospect of bloodshed seemed imminent . In this extremity President Jackson anxiously called upon Mr. Rush , in conjunction with General Howard of Baltimore , to repair to the scene of dispute , in the capacity of representatives of his friendly solicitude , and charged with his constitutional powers as far as he could exert them , to ward off so frightful a calamity among brethren of the same family . They promptly consented , and there being not an hour to lose immediately set off . Travelling day and night , they got to the scene of *border preparation and strife by the time desired . rllhough no final arrangements were , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their earnest mediation was zealously interposed between the parties , with at least the advantage of a temporary abatement of their exasperation , and gaining time for ulterior arrangements . They returned after a few weeks ' absence , their conduct , on that angry and threatening emergency , meeting the President 's entire approbation . In the summer of 1836 Congress passed a law accepting the legacy of about one hundred thousand pounds sterling that had been bequeathed to the United States by James Smithson of Lcmdon , for the purpose of founding at Washington an institution " for the increase // and diffusion of knowledge among men ; " and authorized the President to take measures for its recovery . General Jackson immediately applied to Mr. Rush to go to England for that purpose . He had previously declined political office tendered to him by General Jaekson , but acceded to his wishes , made known in a gratifying manner , to take in hand this trust . He arrived in London in September of that year ; and on Mr. Van Buren 's election to the Presidency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new commission from him . In August , 1838 , he returned with the whole sum , upwards of one hundred and four thousand pounds sterling , which was safely deposited in gold at the Mint , to the credit of the United States , a few days after his arrival . The right of the United States to this bequest had got entangled in the English Court of Chancery ; and the fidelity , promptitude and economy with which Mr. Rush succeeded in vindicating their right , and realizing the sum for the United States , are best attested by his letters to the Government which have been published by Congress : " Unfit as I am for Heaven , " said Warburton , " I had rather hear the last trumpet than a citation from , the Court of Chancery to pass my life there . " Mr. Rush at least was more fortunate . This being the latest trust with which he has been charged by his country , it is here worthy of remark , that in all the public trusts committed to him he has borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct in all that rek*ted to money . His charges for contingent outlays during his long mission to England , when sent to Congress , drew notice from that body , and from the press , by their smallness ; and no account , charge , nor item of any kind whatever , has ever stood against him on the public books after he left an office . While attending to this trust in London , he beheld day by day in the newspapers there gross misrepresentations of the opinions and policy of the anti-bank party in the United States , mingled with coarse defamation of General Jackson and other high names of our country belonging to that party  --  the whole stimulated by the Whig papers of our own country that flowed in by every packet , to say nothing of the Anglo-American houses in London , headed by the I3arings and their hangers-on , ever ready to lend countenance to it all . In this condition of things , with no corrective to such perpetual mis. * statements and unworthy calumnies ever appearing in the London newspapers-for none would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of a pamphlet , Mr. Van Buren 's letter to Sherrod Williams , written when the former was Vice-President ; by which the London public before whom the highest American names were thus being held up in daily disparagement , might see , not a partisan and scurrilous , but a statesman-like and gentleman-like view of the bank question . For this act he was furiously abused on both sides of the water , by the Whig papers of the United States and by the V2 // London stock-jobbers . This was perhaps to have been expected ; but it was not to have been expected , that for such an act of simple justice to the majority of his countrymen , and to the functionaries of his Government in a foreign land , the extraordinary spectacle would have been exhibited of his having been denounced by the Whig Governor of Pennsylvania in a public message to the Legislature of that State . Governor Ritner ought to have known better . He ought to have known , as Mr. Rush believed , that the Pennsylvania Bank of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , was at that time tottering in its resources , and pursuing an unprincipled course . Instead of denouncing Mr. Rush , his true duty , as a well informed and moral Chief Magistrate , would have been to have denounced the Bank ; whereby frauds upon a transcendant scale , and rnischiefs innumerable that have since burst to light , might have been prevented , a mad career of dishonest speculation arrested , and the American character saved from much odium abroad . Many of the London stock-jobbers then*selves , misled by the trickery of our own stock-jobbers in the interest of that Bank , now doubtless wish they had not turned so deaf an ear to Mr. Rush 's safer counsels , as the enormous depreciation of its stock in the London market and everywhere gives such sensible reasons for inferring . Mr. Rush 's life , as we have seen , has been engrossed in various departments of most important ahd honorable service to his country at home and abroad-few of our distinguished'men more so . So engrossed , there has not been much time to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life he would sometimes delight to roam . But what we may term political and diplomatic literature has occasionally been the recreation of his riper years . Little things , falling under this class , have occasionally been thrown from his pen , fugitive it is true in their nature , but here and there one that the public will recollect . Of this stamp is the sketch he gave of the character of Mr. Canning , when the shock of his sudden death reached the United States in lb*7 , soon after he had arrived at the pinnacle of all his hopes , as well as the height of British power for a subject  --  the Premier-ship . The sketch appeared in the National Intelligencer , almost on the day after the news came , when Mr. Rush was at the head of the Treasury , and was the work of a few hours stolen from sleep , as his friends have often heard him say ; but which his full knowledge of Mr. Canning 's character from long intercourse and otherwise , in its Euglish , European , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily . This production on reaching England was republished by the most prominent of their newspapers , in most instances with a marked notice of it , and was quoted with applause in the House of Lords . In 1833 , he published a volume entitled " Memoranda of a Resi // deuce at the Court of London . " This work purports to record some of the public and personal incidents passing under his experience in England during his first fifteen months of his mission . It was almost universally well received in the United States on first coming out , and nearly as much so in England . To the renown of the latter country in peace and in war , and to her social merits , he did liberal justice ; but on proper occasions , when America was at stake , showed how above all things the institutions and glory of his own country were nearest his heart . In stating the question of impressment , as belonging to his first negotiation , he necessarily portrayed the wrongs of which England was guilty , as also on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in an angry spirit , but the contrary . This was more than enough to draw out the wrath of a work which , whenever it may speak with fairness of any American production , would be evidence , prima facie , that it wanted a right American spirit  --  the London Quarterly Review . With the exception of this work , it met favor from the reviewing world generally in that country , sometimes in a high degree . The Edinburg Review says of it , that the " spirit of a conventional body would not have improved Mr. Rush 's private journal ; " characterizes his public negotiations as marked by " intelligence , firmness , and straightforwardness ; " and has even alluded to them under some points of comparison in connexion with Jefferson 's and Franklin 's . In describing scenes in private mansions , those of the nobility and many others which his public station opened to him , as Mr. Rush in many instances does , he had in hand a delicate task , but has never on any one occasion violated social confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been out seven years , and the correctness of his narratives and other personal incidents in which the names of persons whom he met in England are introduced , has on no one occasion , that we have ever heard of , been called in question ; while there have been numerous tributes to their truth . The Quarterly Review stands alone in having , in its hasty burst of displeasure , questioned their fidelity  --  and this not on the authority of any name of the hundreds recounted , but on its own assumptions . His book passed to a second edition in each country . He dedicates the second American edition to Mr. Madison . A leading idea of Mr. Rush throughout the bookwhether a just or erroneous one , must be a matter of opinion-is , that the power of England , far from being on the decline , or stationary , is on the increase , through the increasing extent and solidity of her resources , and he inculcates the wisdom of our statesmen being on their guard against any supposed falling off in her means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wars for the last century , she has contrived , by the preponderance of her naval power , to make the increase of her commerce go hand in hand with her wars , // and that her riches have gone on increasing in a greater ratio than her debt . As we have spoken of his attachment to our navy , and as it may be that times are near when again its gallantry will be tried , we quote the following page from his book  --  the very last in it ; which , whilst it records a disaster , can not fail to awaken the liveliest associations of our public glory , as it attests the noblest attributes of our institutions " January 26 , 1819. - Mr. *** *** called upon me . He talked a good deal . An idle rumor was flying about the streets of Bonaparte 's escape from St. Helena ; the rumor adding that a fast sailing American schooner was in the plot . This led him to speak of the achievements of the American navy , upon which he touched with sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allusion to the actio between the Chesapeake and Shannon . That , on the whole , he sai ought to be considered as the fairest eriterion ofthe naval prowess of ' the two countries , frigate to frigate . I did not argue the point with him , and he soon left me . " The Chesapeake , it is true , was captured . The British captair* won his prize gallantly . Let no American gainsay this , for it is for Americans to rob valor of its renown ? We heard how the victory was hailed in England  --  the more as *t seemed to break the spell of a series of naval actions with us that had gone against her . But whatever joy it created there , I believe , nay , I am sure , it could not have equalled the opposite feeling in the United States . I rememberwhich of us can forget ?  --  the first rumor of it . I remember the universal , the indignant incredulity . I remember how the post-offices* were surrounded for several days by anxious thousands ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something by anticipation as the mail approached , under the startling reports that kept coming in . And when at last hope left us , when the dread certainty of her capture could no longer be hidden , I remember the public gloom . I remember the solemn processions , the funeral discourses , the tears that testified it . Do n't give up the S/tzjp !  --  the last words of Lawrence , slain by the first broadside-were on every badge and on every tongue . His flag for his winding sheet , his body was conveyed by his victors to Halifax , and committed to British earth with honors due to the brave ,  --  but not long did it lie there . A vessel fitted out and manned by the affectionate patriqtism of twelve New England sea captains bore it back in mourning honors to his country , where it reposes under the laurel as its cypress ; for he , yes , he too , had triumphed in his turn , ship to ship , gloriously triumphed over the proud flag of old England !

What wa* the loss of a single frigate ? Not aw // atom in the nation 's strength ! But the heart-felt pain it created showed the intensity of public feeling among a people where each one , under their noble institutions , indentified himself with the nation , and seemed as sorely struck down by a public misfortune as by a personal blow . What may not be hoped of such a people in peace and in war , if true to themselves and their happy and glorious Union ? " We have endeavored to give a brief but honest portraiture of the life , character , and public services of Mr. Rush . From its exhibition much information and instruction can be gained , highly interesting as connected with the history of the country . It holds up to our youth a bright example  --  and to rising statesmen it demonstrates , as the surest and most certain road to eminence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political integrity , and a well stored mind , must be added an unflinching devotion to principles . Mr. Rush is of ordinary stature-his frame is of a firm structurehis countenance denotes a thoughtful and gifted mind-his eye , quick , intelligent , and piercing , seems to anticipate his articulation . In conversation he is animated and graceful-in manner eminently distinguished . The reputation he has left behind him in Great Britain confirms what is well known at home , that while the representative of his country near the first court in Europe , he was faithful to her interests and watchful over her honor  --  and in his more social relations he is remembered with high esteem and friendship . Enjoying now a voluntary seclusion from an active participation in political life , Mr. Rush devotes his time to those pursuits which are deeply connected with the domestic and foreign relations of the country . At the late election in December last , by the Legislature of Pennsylvania , of a representative in the United States Senate , Mr. Rush was , by a public letter addressed to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permit hi* name to be used as a candidate . He declined , however , on the ground that custom had sanctioned the selection of one Senator from the eastern and one from the western section of the State ; and as the former was already represented he would not wish his friends to oppose the election of a gentleman from the western part of the Commonwealth . In contemplating the history of Mr. Rush 's public career , whether at home , in the field of State or national politics , in the Cabinet , as the constitutional adviser of the Executive , or as the representative of his country abroad , we are led to hope , that the time is not far distant when his country will again call him from his retirement amid the leafy solitude of his rural home , that the voice of his experience aria wisdom may again be heard in the councils of the nation@@184090562.txt THE Democratic Review has from its commencement adhered strictly o the resolution then adopted , to stand aloof from the delicate and dangerous topic of Slavery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently conflicting principles  --  and so variously distorted and discolored by the different media through which it is viewed by the champions of the opposing interests connected with it , and of the mutual fanaticisms which its recent agitation has stimulated , in some cases , to the verge of insanity-that while any attempt at a cairn and dispassionate discussion of it , on a middle ground of impartial candor , would find but few listeners and fewer converts , we are conscious that it would probably only provoke the emulous hostility of both the conflicting schools of opinion-an effect certainly seriously detrimental both to the work itself and to the distinct and higher objects which prompted its establishment . From this resolution it is no part of our intention to depart , in discussing the subject stated in the above-written title to the present paper . Although the one subject has been the source out of which has grown the prominence into which the other question has recently risen in our Constitutional discussions , yet the connexion between them is only accidental and temporary ; it is easy to separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Right of Petition , as an abstract Constitutional principle , without regard to any present application of it to the question of Abolition , farther than may be necessary for the illustration of the views in relation to it , which we propose to express , because we think them true and just . For doing this , which had for some time been in our contemplation , we take advantage of the convenient occasion afforded by the appearance of the able pamphlet on the subject , which has just been published by Mr. Colton , and to which a reference is made below . Characterized equally by cogency and acuteness of logic , liberality and argeness of views , and by sound principles of Constitutional doctrine , it is a very valuable contribution to a discussion which , though much agitated within the walls of Congress , does not yet seem to have engaged that degree of popular attention and interest to which its importance entitles it . It is not to be denied that a largely preponderating opinion exists throughout the North in favor of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length in which it has been of late asserted by its special champions whose zeal has been derived from the bearing which it has been made to have upon the Abolition agitation . rrhose Northern Members of Congress who on a recent occasion hazarded the record of their names against that extreme assertion of the principle , did so in the face of a formidable responsibility which they must have known to await them among their constituencies ; - and done in a spirit of duty to the Constitution and their country , and in honest sincerity of conviction , it was an instance of moral courage from which it is probable that no inconsiderable number shrank who in truth may have participated in the same views of the question . This question has been a subject of earnest agitation in Congress for several years-on each occasion the strength of the opinion hostile to the high sanctity of the asserted Right of Petition advancing under the process of discussion , and of the attention attracted by it to a question before little scrutinized . The South has always been influenced by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to go in united phalanx against it . But after a countless number of times that a vote has been taken , in one form or another , on the question of the rejection of Abolition petitions , and the various resolutions adopted for the summary disposal of them , it was not till the 27th of last January that a majority was found to take the ground of an open , decisive , unequivocal refusal to receive them . The resolution which was adopted in the House of Representatives in the twenty-fourth Congress , on the 26th of May , 1836 , ( Mr. Pinckney 's resolution ) was as follows : " Resolved , That all petitions , memorials , resolutions , and propositions , relating in any way , or to any extent whatever , to the subject of slavery , shall , without being either printed or referred , be laid on the table , and that no farther action shall be had thereon . " That adopted at the first session of the twenty-fifth Congress ( Mr. Patton 's resolution ) on the 21st December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That all petitions , memorials and papers touching the abolition of slavery , or the buying , selling , or transferring of slaves in any State , District , or Territory of the United States , be laid upon the table without being debated , printed , read , or referred , and that no farther action whatever shall be had thereon . ' * At the opening of the succeeding session of the same Congress , December 11th , 1838 , the following series of resolutions was adopted on the motion of Mr. Atherton of New Hampshire : " Resolved , That this Government is one of limited powers , and that by the Constitution of the United States , Congress has no jurisdiction whatever over the institutution of Slavery in the several States of the Confederacy . " Resolved , That petitions for the abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia and the Territories of the United States , and against the removal of slaves from one State to another , are part of a plan of operations set on foot to affect the institution of slavery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution within their several limits . // " Resolved , That Congress has no right to do that indirectly which it can not do directly , and that the agitation of the subject of Slavery in the District of Columbia or in the Territories , as a means or with the view of disturbing or overthrowing that institution in the several States , is against the true spirit and meaning of the Constitution , an infringement of the rights of the States affected , and a breach of the public faith on which they entered into this Confederacy . " Resolved , That the Constitution rests on the broad principles of equality among the members of this Confederacy , and that Congress , in the exercise of its acknowledged powers , has no right to discriminate between the institutions of one portion of the States or another , with a view of abolishing the one or promoting the other . " Resolved , Therefore , that all attempts on the part of Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia or the Territories , or to prohibit the removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institutions of one portion - of the Confederacy and another , with the views aforesaid , are in violation of the Constitutional principles on which the Union of these States rests , and beyond The jurisdiction of Congress ; and that every petition , memorial , resolution , proposition or paper , touching or relating , in any way or to any extent whatever , to slavery as aforesaid , or the abolition thereof , shall , on the presentation thereof , without any farther action thereon , be laid on the table without printing , reading , debate or reference . " And finally in the early part of the present session , the first of the twenty-sixth Congress , after a month spent in the discussion of the subject , the following were adopted  --  the first on the motion of Mr. Thompson , of South Carolina , and the second on that of Mr. Johnson , of Maryland : " Resolved , That epon the presentation of any memorial or petition praying for . the abolition of slavery or the slave trade in any District , Territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any resolution , or other paper touching that subject , the reception of such memorial , petition , resolution or paper shall be con*idere* as objected to , and the question of its reception shall be laid on the table , without debate or farther actien thereon . " Resolved , That no petition , memorial , resolution , or other paper praying the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia , or any State or Territory , dr the slave trade between the States or Territories of the United States in which it now exists , shall be received by this House , or entertained in any way whatever . " lit the Senate , after frequent unsuccessful attempts on the part of Southern Senators to oblain a direct refusal to receive these petitions , the practice has long settled down to this-though no general resolution has been adopted to regulate it - namely , that ort the presentation of one of the petitions an objeution is made to its reception . This brings up that question , which is , however , immediately , on motion of some Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table by a silent vote  --  a motion to lay on the table being , by the rules , not debateable. the question of reception is thus in form never decided or acted upon ; so that both of the opposite opinions on the subject of the Right of Petition may find a certain degree of partial satisfaction in this disposition of them ; the one considering that they are negatively rejected , by reason of no decision being ever had on the question of reception *  --  and the other considering that the laying of that motion on the table // is a mere postponement and suspension of the question ; and that as the incident accompanies the principal , the petition itself virtually , in parliamentary presumption , goes with the motion to lay on the table , - being thus in fact received , and liable at any time to be called up for consideration , on motion and vote to that effect . One thing is very certain , and must strike every reader on comparing the resolutions of the present session with those which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as regards the attention given to the petitions , was as decided under the method of procedure established by the several Pinckney , Patton , and Atherton resolutions , as by the absolute rejection at the threshold which is the effect of the present rule . Like most compromises of this nature , the former resolutions were exceedingly loose , feeble , and equivocal-nor could they but fail of accomplishing their object , namely , as stated in the preamble to the first of them , " that the agitation on this subject should be finally arrested , for the purpose of restoring tranquillity to the public mind . " For they virtually reco* , nized the doctrine put forward by the advocates of the Right of Petition , and paid to that right the highest tribute in their power , at the same moment in which they trampled on it-that is to say , as the right existed to their own simultaneous recognition of it . It was evidently and avowedly their object to treat the petitions with studied contempt and detestation-not to give them a moment 's consideration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or debate them ; of course , therefore , the majorities which adopted these resolutions must have been ready to reject the petitions point-blank if they had felt it in their power . Their refusal to do so , though strenuously urged by the Southern Members , as well as by their own declared antipathy to the petitions and petitioners , was an acknowledgment of the whole constitutional principle of the Right of Petition as asserted by the latter-an admission that they were bound , however reluctantly , to receive the petitions . Now it is appears very clear that the distinction on which these resolutions were all based , between the obligation to receive and that to consider , was an utterly untenable one-as a mere quibbling refinement of special pleading , alike unworthy of the dignity of legislation , andforeign to that higher spirit of enlarged liberality and common-sense simplicity , which should govern the construction of constitutional provisions . Who can fairly deny that those who then denounced these resolutions , as violations of a cardinal principle of popular right , had the whole truth and force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the duty of Congress to hear , ex* amine , refer , and debate , as inseparable from the admitted duty of receiving ? If the Right of Petition was such a constitutional principle as to impose on Congress , however bitter and sore its reluctance , the imperative obligation to receive , how hollow a mockery was it , then , of that principle and right , to refuse to do anything beyond this naked and worthless formality of reception  --  to keep the work of X*OL . VII . NO . XXvIII. - APRIL , 1840 . W // promise to the ear , but break it to the hope ! ' Such at least could never have been the intention of the framers of the sacred Charter of Liberty to which both parties in this controversy appealed for the authority of their course . Such at least could never be the true spirit in which the meaning of a high constitutional guarantee should be construed and applied . Plausibly then-rightfully indeed-were these resolutions denounced as substantial outrages upon the very principle to whose sanctity they themselves , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony . Nor can it be a matter of surprise that they had the effect of almost irreparably entangling the question , and confusing the public mind in relation to it . Whether politic or not in demanding the rejection of these petitions , Mr. Calhoun and the South were undeniably in the right in their declarations that to this complexion it must come at last '  --  and that the middle ground by which it was attempted to compromise the question could not permanently be maintained . It would certainly have been a far wiser course , as well as a worthier and manlier , to meet the principle of the Right of Petition fearlessly at the outset , and to decide frankly upon its essential merits , on a large and liberal view of it , with a consistent application of the consequences necessarily following from such decision , whether it should incline to the one side or the other . The neutral course which was attempted , of a barren recognition of the empty form of the Right as claimed , with a simultaneous substantial violation of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked-like all timid compromises of this nature-the worst of the alternatives presented by the case . We have always felt clear in the conviction-which will now be found to be admitted even by many who did not venture to vote for Mr. Johnson 's resolution-that these petitions ought either to have been received , referred , and respectfully considered and acted upon , or to have been frankly met with a positive rejection at the threshold . We have no remark here to make upon the refined parliamentary intrigue , on the part of the Southern members of Opposition in the House of Representatives , which led to the adoption of the two resolutions , that of Mr. Thompson and that of Mr. Johnson , which have been quoted above . The latter having been offered as an amendment to the fermer , it was supposed that the Northern Democratic Members would adhere to the ground of the two preceding sessions , beyond which the resolution of Mr. Thompson did not advance ; and that by an unanimous vote against the strong measure of rejection , as proposed by Mr. Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whig , the odium , in that section of the country , of the failure of that amendment would be cast upon the Northern Democrats ; so as to give a color to the denial which the Whig leaders at the South attempt to urge against the charge of their present political coalition and identification with the Abolition party at the North . The assertion may safely be hazarded , that never were men more chagrined at the failure // of a favorite movement , than were many of those loudest in advocating the amendment in question at its unexpected and undesired success . The fact was simply that among the Northern Democratic Members there were a few bolder spirits who saw the absurdity of the position formerly occupied by themselves and their party in Congress on this question , and who rose to a higher and clearer view of the principles involved in it , braving the probable temporary unpopularity which might attend such a vote , until explanation and reflection should have time to do their work in satisfying their constituencies of its perfect propriety and constitutional soundness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time frustrated the ingenious intrigue we have alluded to , and carried forward this question to a point from which it is not likely to be again made to recede ; and will doubtless result in establishing more just and enlarged views than have heretofore prevailed at the North on this subject of the " Right of Petition . " There is an important distinction which should not pass unnoticed , between the two resolutions of the present session  --  a distinction which was entirely lost sight of in the protest which the Legislature of the State of New York saw fit shortly after their passage to adoDt . It is this . The one is more comprehensive in the subjects which it embraces , while the latter is more positive and strong in its action upon those which do fall within its scope . The former embraces all petitions or papers in any way " touching that subject " ( Slavery in the United States ) ; the latter confines itself to those praying for a certain specific action-namely , " the abolition of slavery in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the slave trade between the States or Territories of the United States , in which it now exists . " The latter refuses to receive these particular petitions - it does not refuse to receive all propositions relating to the general subject in the various points of view in which it may be regarded . Yet such is the ill considered assertion of the New York Legislature , in the resolution of censure to which we have referred . The importance of this distinction will not fail to strike the reader 's mind . It may be perfectly competent for a legislative body to declare that a certain specific action which it is called upon to take is beyond the rightful powers conferred upon it by the organic law of its creation , and that therefore it will not even listen to any propositions inviting it to such action ; while it might not be equally proper or rightful for it to announce a determination not to receive any proposition in any manner , or in any point of view , relating to the same subject . As for Mr. Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petitions in question-not even those praying for the distinct object of the abolition of slavery , and the internal slave trade , in the District or in the States or Territories . Mr. Adams , in describing its effect , says that it hangs them up midway between Heaven and earth , // so that no one could pronounce whether they were received or not . It , at least , therefore , is no positive violatiQn of the great " Right of Petition . " On the contrary , by not directly , and in terms refusing to receive them-it may be said in fact by implication , like the resolutions of former sessions , to recognize and sanction it . It simply declares in substance that such petitions , &amp;c. , on their presentation , shall be considered at once as objected to , and thereupon that the question of their reception shall be laid upon the table without debate or farther action . This then establishes nothing more than the actual practice which , we have seen , has for some years prevailed , in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of that denunciation for the violation of the " Right of PetitiQn , " of which so much has been lately heard , has been wont to direct itself . And undeniably it is fully within the competence of each House , under the established parliamentary practice , and their own rules of proceeding , of which the constitutionality has never been questioned , thus to dispose of any subject , whether brought befQre it in the form of petition or in any other mode . Any member has the right to object to the reception of any particular petition ; for which there may be various rightful reasons-such as , disrepect to the body or to any member of it ; plain absurdity or gross indecency ; or the utter and unequivocal absence of any power on the part of the body to which it is addressed to grant the prayer of the petition , or to act at all or the subject to which it relates . Such objection raises the question of reception , which is commonly considered as passed over sub silentio , ky implication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular case . This question of reception may be debated and acted upon like any other ; or like any other it may be disposed of , at the discretion of the House , by being laid on the table ; from which , however , it is at all times liable to be called up . And certainly it would seem , as before mentioned , that there can be no doubt , notwithstanding Mr. Adams 's remark , that as the coherent necessarily accompanies the principal in the operation of this motion , the petition is laid on the table with the question of reception , and therefore is in fact received by the House , and must be kept on file among its documents , ready to be called up at any future time when the wise and proper motives which , it is to be presumed , have induced the House to postpone its present consideration , by laying it upon the table , may cease to exist . The question of the expediency of this course is not here brought into view ; but if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately , it is not easy to distinguish why the House may not , under its unlimited power to adopt rules for the regulation of its own proceedings , condense all these multitudinous details , in the case of a particular class of petitions , into one aggregate , generalizing the practice , as it were , from several thousand individual instances , into one comprehensive and summary rule . It becomes merely a // question of mode of procedure ; and such a rule merely a piece of labor-saving machinery . And certainly those who admit the right of the body to adopt the course in question in each individual case- ( and who can impeach its constitutionality ? ) - must concede that *f the House has maturely determined uniformly to pursue that course in relation to a particular class of petitions , it is far better-with reference to the obvious economy of time , labor , expense , and to the well known angry excitement , on the part of a large portion of the House and of the country , awakened by the agitation of the subject on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary general rule , than by a specific action of the body on each individual case . But Mr. Johnson 's resolution , while it does not go near so far in the subjects embraced within its action , carries that action much farther within the more limited scope of its application . It refuses point-blank to receive at all the propositions for the abolition of slavery , and the slave trade , within the District or the States and Territories . This therefore brings us directly to confront the principle of the " Right of Petition , " as we have been of late accustomed to hear it asserted . There are two grounds on which this right is made to rest by its advocates , as one of the great cardinal principles of American liberty . The first is the ground of original natural right , sacred , unalienable and indefeasible , antecedent and superior to legal or constitutional enactment  --  the right of complaint , of prayer , on the part of any sufferer of wrong or evil , to those in whose hands the institutions of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the express guarantee contained in the following clause of the Constitution , which was added as the first of the amendments to that instrument , as it came from the hands of the Convention of its Framers : Gongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . " This second ground is found indeed partially to merge itself in the former  --  the expression , that " Congress shall make no law to abridge the right , " &amp;c. , referring it back to a deeper foundation , as a right not to be abrogated or impaired by human legislation or authority . Well , the soundness of both these grounds is conceded . It is the inference only which is impeached-namely , the alleged obligation incumbent on each House of our Federal Congress to rew*eive m*nd act upon all petitions that may be addressed to it . Regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an original natural right . There are many other original natural rights of various degrees of importance to the complete enjoyment of such happiness as may be within the compass of human capability . It is but one of a class . Without an enumeration of them all , a reference to that of freedom of speech and of the press will suffice for our present pur // pose . With the value of this few persons would place in comparison that of the right of petition . Yet is not this , like every other natural right , subject to necessary restrictions growing out of the mutual relations created by the congregation of men into civil and political societies , with the mutual rights and duties incident to such relations ? Is it not limited by the just amenability of the individual to legal punishment for its abuse when to the damage of his neighbor , and d fortiori when to the plain and undeniable general detriment of the common weal ? Does it carry with it the irresponsible privilege of slander and libel  --  or does it entitle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ears or eyes of the whole community , in the public highways for example , revolting , disgusting and demoralizing recitals or exhibitions ? This will not be claimed . In the same manner it would be easy to put cases of the abuse of all our other natural personal rights , which would extort the concession that they are necessarily , in all human society , subject to certain restrictions and limitations , according to their various nature and mode of action . The Right of Petition , then , is not , any more than the rest , exempt from such necessary limitations . It may be abused-it may be totally perverted from its legitimate design and use into a mere engine of disorder and mischief . Now , from the very nature and mode of the action of this right , it is only in the authority to which it addresses itself that the power can reside to apply this restriction to its abuse which it can not be denied ought , as in the case of every other similar righi , to exist somewhere . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibilities of our attachment to the right shockcd at the idea of applying what seems the only restriction which the nature of the case admits of , namely , a refusal to receive the petition-always under a high responsibility to the public opinion of a people familiar with the great principles of democratic freedom , and vigilantly jealous of their sanctity . That this discretion as to the reception of petitions is the proper and rightful check upon the abuse to which this , like every other natural right , is subject , has always received the sanction of the universal recognition of the principle , in the case of different other applications of it . For not even the most fanatic advocate of the " Right of Petition " of the present day denies to a legislative body the right to refuse to receive petitions of various kinds that might be named ,  --  such as those disrespectful to the body , or insulting to any of its members  --  or grossly indecent in language , or outrageously blasphemous  --  or plainly absurd , and for an object impossible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , the disrespect to the body may be deserved , the individual insult may he but the just truth  --  and both may be inseparable from the statement of the grievance complained of . As for the ground of indecency or gross blasphemy , it may be a matter of taste and education ; and a petitioner would not find it difficult to quote cla*sic Elizabethan authority for such language as would cause his petition at // the present day to be scouted with indignation , by universal consent , from the threshold of the Hall . And then as for that of plain absurdity or impossibility , that must be a question of opinion ,  - -  in some men 's vocabularies the latter word has no place ,  --  and we daily witness that that which seems ridiculously impossible to one age is hourly familiar in practice to the next . Yet in all these cases none denies the discretionary right of the legislative body , under their high responsibilities to conscience and the universal reason of man kind , to apply to such abuses of the Right of Petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive them . And this concession yields the whole ground contended for by the champions of the Right in the present controversy . rhe principle of a correlative obligation on the one part to receive all petitions , as essentially incident to the right on the other to present them , is either in its nature absolute and unlimited-for the admitted exceptions above instanced are not where stated or defined  --  or else the element here contended for , of a wise and conscientious discretion on the part of the legislative body as to the reception of particular petitions , in its undeniable privilege of regulating its own internal proceedings , must be admitted into the question , as equally a substantial right on the one side , with the right of petition on the other . And once thus admitted  --  and how can it be excluded ? - it is clear that it opens wide the whole field of the circumstances of the occasion , with all the considerations of propriety and public policy involved in them , to bear upon the decision of the body in any particular instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in which men must needs be extremely chary of its exercise , and must venture to act only under high and imperative motives of duty and right . And neither is it ever likely to be abused , nor , under our institutions , could even any abuse of it be attended with evil effect , in the multitude of means and modes in which an obnoxious subject can be forced upon the attention of such a body - means and modes of a higher order , as valuable rights , while at the same time of a more effective character . Assuming the above course of reasoning to be correct , it appears , then , that while the Right of Petition is an original natural right , it is necessarily at the same time subject to the restriction upon its possible abuse which is alone to be found in the discretionary right , on the part of the governing authority to which it addresses itself , of refusal to receive . And the-question here presents itself too , whether it is a right of such nature and value as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic liberty that high reverence and jealous attachment , which should incline us to an extreme latitude of construction in its favor , and to a corresponding rigid severity in permitting the application of its restrictive counter-principle , or antagonist right , on the part of the legislative body . For example , in the case of the right of religious liberty , our strong bias must lean in favor of the right ; and in construing the terms of the constitutional // guarantee we would always carry its principle far beyond the mere literal construction of the phrase , to all such enlarged analogical applications of it as may seem most in harmony with its spirit and intent . We would not be content that Congress should merely refrain from passing any " law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . " We would not patiently suffer even thatthe indirect operation of anykind of official act on the part of either of the component branches of that body , or of any of the functionaries of the executive department of the government , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to cast the slightest weight of moral influence in favor of any one sect over any other But this " Right of Petition , " about which we have lately heard so much , is one of a very inferior order , and one to the construction and application of which every American democrat must bring a very different spirit . It seems indeed to argue a strange misappreciation of the true genius of our institutions , to insist upon this as one of the cardinal principles of American liberty . It is true that the recognition of its existence- ( though not to the exclusion of its natural and necessary limitations ) - is to be found , as above quoted , in the Constitution . But it should be borne in mind that the men of that time had received all their political education in the English school-  --  and a noble school of freedom it was for that day . In England the movement and struggle of the people had always been upward , forcing their way slowly up towards the light of liberty , against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despotic . To such a people the right of petition , to this paramount omnipotence above them-an omnipotence extraneous from themselves , both in its constitution , and in its distinct and often adverse interests-was indeed a great cardinal principle of popular freedom ; as also that of " peaceable assembling " for the purpose ,  --  which in fact was always regarded as the most important part of the right , being that for which it was most necessary to secure , from the jealous fears of authority , a full constitutional guarantee. * As the adoption of our present Constitution * Mr. Colton , in the excellent pamphlet to which allusion has before been made , gives the following concise summary of the history of the Right here considered , in the English school in which it had its origin as a principle of popular liberty : " In the English Bill of Rights of 166S in the following clause : - That it is the right of the subject to petition the king , and that all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal . ' In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people were conceded , from time to time , experience suggested that this point should be made prominent . The importance of it consisted in the fact , that the subjects had no voice in the Government by representation . Probably it would never have been thought of as part of a constitutional Government but for this defect ii* the frame of society . It was always a right in the nature of social relations , but it was not always recognized . Not unfrequently , after it became a law , was it suspended by arbitrary pewer , and the petitioners were spurned or otherwise maltreated , by commitment to prison , by prosecution , and by sundry pains and penalties . In some instances it was aggravated into the crime t*f high treason , even in violation of the securities of law , and thus the last refuge of the // the men of that day were familiar with this phrase as one of the rudiments , the truisms , of their political school ; and it was accordingly copied into that instrument from the English Bill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its draft as projected by the Convention , required byone of the States , and assented to without objection bythe rest . But surely in the midst of the wide democratic freedom of our institutions , the question presents itself now to the American citizen with a very different aspect . The right of petition is no longer to him one of those dear and sacred privileges to which should attach the inestimable value now claimed for it , by those who use it avowedly as an engine for the indirect accomplishment of an ulterior object beyond the conceded scope of the constitutional power of Congress . lie possesses a higher right , in which the inferior is overshadowed and reduced to insignificance , the right of dictation . Prayer , in affairs of human government , is not the appropriate language for his lip ; nor can he whm enjoys the right to utter the accents of command , attach any peculiar value to the poor privilege of supplication. the subject for relief , or redress , or help , or facility in business , as the case might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government , neither was he permitted to present a petition at the foot of the throne . The object of these seventies was to frighten and deter subjects from the use of this privilege , and thus to confirm and strengthen the high and irresponsible prerogatives of the Crown , Petition , the humble , dependent , supplicatory right of petition , was all that was claimed , in hope of the grace of the benefit solicited . The petition might be disregarded ; the chances were many that it would be ; of that complaint was seldom , if ever , made ; but all they asked was the privilege ; all they wanted was a security that they would not be punished for making a request , as that was the only mode of signifying or obtaining their wishes , not otherwise provided for by the laws , or the will of the Sovereign . Even after this right was fully recognized end well secured , both the Parliament and the Sovereign were aecustomed to leave petitions from the most respectable bodies unnoticed at one time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1643 a petition from the general assembly of Divines was left unnoticed . In the same year the University of Cambridge was treated in the same manner , in 1648 the citizens of London and Westminster , in joint petition , were unnoticed ; and , when they applied again for an answer , none was returne*d . The protest of the twelve bishops in 1641 , their ar*est and commitment to the Tower , and their trial and acquittal , are well known ; and yet the next year , when the current was changed , petitioners were still visited with like pains and penalties for the use of the privilege . All along during the remainder of the seventeenth century and the whole of the eighteenth , the British Parliamentary records exhibit the frequent re - jection of petitions from respectable bodies , on the question of rejection . In 1706 it was resolved , that no petition for money should be received without a recommendati&amp;a from the Crown ; and in 1713 this resolution was made the standing rule of the House . The law forbidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ten to present it , was long in force . If more than twelve persons assembled for any objects connected with the Government , it became the duty of magistrates to disperse them , by force if necessary , and resistance was high treason . *From these facts we disc&amp;ver , that the use of petition originated in the wants and necessities of the subjects of monarchical Governments , who had no voice in the maksng and administration of law , as the only mode of declaring their wishes ; that the act was simply one of supplication ; that all they claimed was exemption from pains and penalties in the use of this privilege ; and that these petitions were very commonly rejected on the threshold , or remained unnoticed , or were treated with undisguised contempt . It is the right of the subject to petition the King , and all commitments and prose cutioss for such petitioning are illegal . ' Such was the law , and su*ch the history . " W2 // American citizen possesses the freedom of speech , of the press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has free scope and play through these instruments , to work out that conviction in the public mind *requisite to make it practically effectual . I*he privilege of addressing prayer to the temporary depositories of governmental authority delegated from the individual citizen himself , constitutes no enlarging or strengthening addition to these means of influence . What cares he for this privilege ? If desirous of carrying out any particular r@form , can he not write freely for it in newspapers and Reviews-can he not speak freely for it , at the street corners , from the house tops , in the frequent popular assemblage-can he not freely allow it its full influence in his selection of candidates for public office  --  and is he not certain that if it indeed possesses the vital strength and health of the truth , it will irresistibly force on its way by these means , till it shall inoculate a sufficient proportion of the public mind ti claim the eager favor of the occupants and the seekers of the seats of legislation ? This point might be presented in some other views , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little substantial weight or force in the declamation of which we hear so much about the precious sanctity of the " Right of Petition , " resting on the basis of the eternal laws of God and nature . In countries in which the governors and the governed are twain-where there is absolute power on the one side ( wholly or in part ) , and compulsory subjection on the other , it may indeed have a deep foundation in natural right and justice . But it is idle to draw analogies from such sources to a country in which the governed and the governors are one  --  the latter being but the delegated agents of the former , jealously restricted in power , and responsible at sho4 intervals to the great source of their little brief authority . It is no reply to this argument , to say that minorities need the right as against majorities . It has been sufficiently shown that the solitary individual does not need it , in the arnple freedom he enjoys for other and far higher means of influerjce on the course of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed when he has his work already more than half done to his hand , by having a considerable party which , fit is in the right , a little perseverance will soon either place in actual majority , or in such a position as to exercise a commanding influence between the great parties that always divide every free commonwealth . The origin of the erroneous opinion so extensively prevailing at the North upon this point , we take to be this . The freedom of speech and of the press are indeed rights of inestimable value , in comparison withwhich even the Union itself is ofbutlittle worth . During the course of the Abolition agitation at the North , violent and foolish attempts have been made to outrage these rights , against the &amp;*se of which their t*bvse constitutes no valii argument . They thus became blended to // gether in the public mind with the right of petition to Congress , which was under agitation at the same time ; and with which thus became naturally associated those feelings of sacred respect and attachment most justly indeed due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue . Our object in the present Article is simply to draw attention to the true merits of this greatly exaggerated " Right of Petition . " The consequences that naturally follow from the views of it above stated , are sufficiently obvious on the surface to dispense with the necessity of more than a brief allusion to them . We hold , then , that we are in no respect bound to construe the terms of the Constitution to which appeal is made , in the same large and liberal spirit which we would apply to the other rights which are enumerated in the same clause ; nor to extend them beyond the limited sense fixed by a strict construction of them . And in the present case all those who entertain a different view from that of the petitioners , as to the effect of the movement of which these petitions have been made the principal instrument , are perfectlyjustifiable in obeying the motives which dictate to them the duty of quieting the agitation of this exciting and dangerous topic in Congress , provided they are borne out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construed . If , therefore , " Congress " refrain from passing any " law " abridging " the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition for a redress ofgrievances "  --  the requisition of the Constitution is sufficiently satisfied . Now , the resolution in question is simply an internal rule for the regulation of its own proceedings , under the unlimited privilege to that effect conferred by another clause of the Constitution . The exercise of the popular right , of peaceable assemblage and petitioning , is left complete and undisturbed . The petition is presented to the bodyits object made known in the act  --  and then commences the equal mutual right on the part of the latter as to its own action on it . What is there to forbid its action by anticipation upon any particular class of petitions , with the prayer and character of which it is perfectly familiar ? What is there to prevent it from making up its determination iii advance , either on the ground of its want of constitutional power or of expediency , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entertain , during the brief term of its existence , any farther petitions of the subject , which , in such a state of the case , become a mere idle and vexatious waste of time and national expense , apart from all other graver considerations ? We can see no just impediment , either in the terms of the Constitution , or in the original nature and value of the Right of Petition . Let it be kept in mind that the question is not as to the good policy of this course in the present instance , upon which different opinions may be entertained ; but simply as to the constitutional right of the House thus *o exercise its privilege of regulating its own proceedings , in relation to // a particular class of petitions , after the other party have exercised their complete right of peaceably assembling and petitioning . So far as the object is concerned of making known to the body the grievance and prayer of the latter , it is still fully attained-for it is only after becoming acquainted with it that it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in fact nothing more than a summary rejection of its prayer , the subject having been before amply discussed in the body , and , so far as regards all future petitions of a similar nature , having been determined by it in advance . And moreover , while the operation of the rule confines itself to the existing Congress alone , even within that brief period any Member may still present the petition , and more for a repeal or suspension of the rule of restriction - besides , that there are , as remarked by Mr. Adams , abundant other ways and means by which , if desired , the obnoxious subject may be brought before the attention of the body . It is not necessary to go into the question of the constitutional power of Congress to grant the prayer of a particular petition . r* he absence of such power is not necessary to confer the right of refusal to receive . A settled prejudgment or predetermination on the part of the body-under its high responsibilities to conscience and to public opinion-is sufficient . Drawing the just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher view of rightful constitutional power which refers itself to great pervading principles of good faith , wisdom and duty , rather than to the naked letter of a written document , we think that they do not possess the " power , " in the case covered by the resolution which has here been considered . But this position is not necessary , we repeat , to the justification of the principle of that resolution-though of course adding to it , in its present application , a strong d fortiori confirmation . One concluding remark alone we will add , for the benefit of that class of Northern readers , which we know to be a large one , who , while strongly opposed to the Abolition movement , on the ground of that State-Rights Principle which they justly regard as the true conservative principle of our Union , are yet honestly opposed to Slavery as " a great moral , social and political evil , " ( to quote Mr. W. C. Rives ) , and anxious for the arrival of the day which shall witness its extinction by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the sun of that day is ever destined to dawn . It is chiefly from this class that partisans have been won over by the specious appeals which have been founded upon the alleged outrages upon the " sacred Right of Petition , " as identified with the cause of the Abolition movement . A slight degree of reflection would seem sufficient to convince all rational minds of this school of opinion , that this false movement upon the Federal Government can produce no other effect than both to aggravate the very evils they complain of , during their present existence , and indefinitely to postpone the attainment of their own object . For between this movement and that object rises the insuperable barrier // of the State-Rights Principle , now decidedly , and we trust forever , in the prepouderance throughout the Union . Against this the movement in question must always dash itself in vain . It becomes a political cause ; and in the act loses all the character of mild and affectionate persuasiveness appropriate to a purely moral one  --  and throws away all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause when animated by the divine might of the truth , and advocated in a spirit and manner worthy of its professed character . It connects itself in fatal union with all the other exciting partisan questions of the day , every one of which hinges more or less directly on the cardinal principle of the State-Rights theory  --  and necessarily arrays against itself all the sympathies and efforts of that great political party of whose system of doctrine that principle is one of the fundamental articles . Hence the general unanimity of the Democracy of the North in opposition to the Abolitionists , with the fact that ninetenths of their numbers are derived from the party which it is unnecessary for us here again to demonstrate to be substantially identical - so far as they possess any distinctive character-with the old Federal school of consolidation and centralization . It must be apparent , therefore , to the class to which this remark addresses itself , that instead of the resolution of which we have spoken being one , as it has been called , to " stifle the groans while riveting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to throw back and break down the movement in question , it ought rather to be regarded as the greatest blessing that could be conferred on him , and as the first indispensable step towards * more enlightened course of moral action in his behalf.
