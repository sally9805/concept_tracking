txt A GREAT part of the appropriate work of each generation of men is to train up the succeeding generation . The fathers-they are gone , or just lingering at life 's verge ; and the sons , already in middle life , have taken their places . They who are now employed in the various departments of public , private and social service , at home and abroad , by sea and land , doing the world 's constant and multifarious work , in thirty years , according to a general estimate , will have passed away , and their places will be occupied by those who now are children . This passing away of one generation after another every few years ; this onward move // ment of the wheel of life , hearing the sons and daughters of men through their earthly probation ; these revolutions in society , gradual yet decisive and inevitable , overthrowing , not like a political revolution one man or family in one nation , but every person in every family throughout the earth-declare impressively the momentous importance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of National Popular Education , " the second Annual Report of whose General Agent is before us , proposes to assist in the promotion of popular education in the West , by the transfer of competent female teachers from the older and consolidated communities of the East , to the imperfectly organized communities of that new country . From the first organization of this Board , we have desir*id to bring its plan to the notice of our readers ; but have thought it best to xvait until it had been in some measure tested by experiment , so that xve could speak not only of its theory , but of its practical workings . We believe that that time has arrived . The Board has been in active existence for nearly three years , and has issued two Annual Reports . We will give our attention in this article to the object proposed by this Board-popular education in the West  --  and to the plan which it sets forth for aiding in the accomplishment of that object . The value of this object is beyond all our power to estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community or nation , is the difference between intelligence and ignorance , comforts and privations , wealth and poverty , elegance and rudeness , virtue and vice , religion and superstition , dignity and degradation-in a word , between heathen barbarism and Christian civilization . The influence of the general education of a people in promoting among them competence and wealth  --  the abundant possession of all the necessaries , comforts and ornaments of life-is incalculable . By a fixed and inevitable law , ignorance is allied with poverty , and intelligence with wealth . The best productions of earth , of whatever kind , and wherever gathered , are attracted sooner or later , as by an invisible magnetism , into the hands of the more intelligent nations and communities . The great reasoti* why those nations who have possessed and wrought earth 's richest mines of gold and silver , and have gathered her diamonds and other precious gems , have been poor ( and they usually have been poor ) is because they have been ignorant . All the precious metals which Spain has gathered ( and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in vain , because her people were ignorant . They dug and others possessed . They labored in their rich mines , and the results of their labors passed ere long into the hands of the more intelligent . rJlhe greatest natural advantages , // the most fruitful soils , the best facilities for commerce and manufactures , can not durably enrich an ignorant nation or community . And , on the other hand , natural disadvantages of soil , climate and position , can not prevent wealth and prosperity from crowning the industry and skill , the sagacity and providence , which an educated people will be sure to possess . Their intelligence , with its accompanying qualities , will change earth 's sterility into fertility ; and , subduing the mighty forces of nature to the purposes of art and labor , will make them successful ministers of abundance , comfort and ornament . The great improvement which has been made within a few centuries , and especially within the last fifty years , in all those modes and instruments of industry which contribute to the wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbandry which give such an increased reward to labor on the soil ; these new and almost magical modes of traveling and transportation on sea and land , by which we rush with winged speed , and with the heaviest burdens , along our coasts and upon our lakes , up and ( lown our rivers , through the sides of our hills and mountains and over our valleys , and across the widest oceans , and thus pour into our commercial emporiums the productions of a vast interior and of foreign climes , and distribute them by a thousand channels through all the land ; these wonderful improvements in the implements of manufacturing industry , multiplying ten thousand fold its results , these laborsaving , or rather labor-doing , machines , these automatic artificers , performing the work of hundreds of persons , and all work , from the most ponderous to the most delicate and intricate , while they ask neither for bed and board , nor for raiment and instructionall these astonishing improvements in the production of comforts , elegancies and wealth , have been effected by intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by that education of the whole people in the common branches of knowledge , and that education of a part of the people in the higher branches which should always go together , and which are mutually dependent , so far at least that the first can not exist without the last . The greater part of the improvements in agricultural , mechanical and commercial industry have been made by practical men , by intelligent workmen-laborers who have received a good common education-understanding and skillfully aJ ) plying the principles which highly educated philosophers have sought out , established and illustrated . An intelligent workman is ever watching the powers and processes of nature and art with a keen eye for the discovery of saving and beneficent improvements ; while an ignorant workman will toil on all his life it i the very neighborhood of a great improvement without discovering it . The educated or intelligent laborer employs his head as well as his hands . // His mind is intent on discovering new modes of saving labor , or making labor productive of superior results . Hence there is immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all laborers , the whole people . We thus multiply the persons who have capacity and disposition for improvements . We thus bring out and develop more minds of practical and inventive genius . For if among a hundred workmen intellectually disciplined and sharpened by a good common education , there are found ten , who prove to have eminent talent for productive improvements , then among five hundred workmen educated in like manner , there will be found five times as many thus eminent ; and even a larger proportion , for much is gained by the intercourse , and mutual excitement and interest , of the skillful . General education brings to the day many brilliant intellectual gems , which otherwise would have remained hid , their brightness un* known to others and even to themselves , and employs their light for those discoveries and improvements which pour abundance and wealth into the lap of society . Here , undoubtedly , is the chief cause of the highly inventive and practical character for which New England has been so distinguished-in the thorough education of her people-. - in her colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher branches of science , and the other educating all the people in the common departments of learning . Universal popular education is truly the highest political economy . It is a living fountain of progressive national enterprise , abundance and prosperity . Still more worthy of note is the influence of thorough popular education to prevent crime and promote social and public order and morality . There is a strong tendency toward virtue in mere mental cultivation and knowledge . God has so made all things , and so orders his providence , as to incite to virtue , and warn from vice . The more knowledge therefore men have  --  the more they know of the nature and operations of the worlds of mind and of matter-the more they will see that virtue will promote , and vice Will destroy , their best interest . But when xve add to intellectual discipline instruction in morals and religion ; when both head and heart are educated ; when truths both human and divine*re instilled into the young mind by appropriate teaching and example ; then the moral influence of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conclusion we are led by observation and experiment . This is the testimony of those who have wisdom and experience in teaching youthful minds . The late Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education addressed a private circular to several eminent and experienced teachers in different parts of the country , asking them to give such an opinion as their experience would authorize , respecting the effi // ciency of a thorough common school education in securing upright conduct and good morals  --  a thorough education in schools , conducted on the cardinal principles of the New England systems , and improved as such schools ought to be , and may be . They all gave their opinion , that , of children thus educated , not more than one in a hundred , and some that less than one in a hundred , would fail to be upright and orderly citizens . Such testimony is corroborated by the opinions of all judicious observers . It would be corroborated by an examination of the records of our prisons , and of the ranks of infamy and crime . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not depart from it . " The cause of popular education , therefore , is identified with the cause of social and public order and morality . Thorough popular education will be almost universally efficient in preventing crime and securing public virtue . Thorough popular education , we say  --  and by this we mean good and universal education . It will not do to educate the few and leave the many to ignorance ; nor even to educate the many and leave the few to ignorance , though that of course is better : for the neglected , the uneducated , will not only curse themselves and society by their crimes , but by the contagion of their example and influence will exert a corrupting power on the educated . Thorough popular education , therefore , is commended by the weighty arguments drawn from public virtue and welfare . It is commended to us by the powerful pleadings of our social burdens and injuries  --  the pleadings of pauperism , the taxation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the assaults , the pillage , the arson , the murders , with which society is afflicted . It is commended to us by the pitiful pleadings which come from the wasted probation and ruined souls of the wretched victims of crime , from the cells of our penitentiaries , and in the voices of those whose forfeited lives are taken away by the gallows . It is commended to us by the suppliant sufferings-sufferings fully known only to the All-seeing-of the wives and little children of the drunken , the thriftless , and abandoned . It is commended to us , in a word , by the almost infinite voices of human iniquity and of the sufferers by human iniquity . It is indeed necessary and wise to appoint and execute penalties for crime . But when , oh ! when will men learn how much better it is to prevent crime by thorough and universal education of the young . There is in this country an obvious and peculiar necessity for universal education , to which we should not fail to advert . The sovereignty of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government is in the hands of all ; and as their character is , so will that power be wielded . We have the blessing of free or popular government-an inestimable blessing . // And its wise administration , indeed its continued existence , depends on the intelligence and virtue of the people-that general intelligence and virtue , to which general and Christian education is essential . No well-informed and judicious person will claim , for a moment , that the countless and boundless advantages of civil freedom can be safe in the hands of ignorant or vicious voters . The people must have the intelligence to understand , and the virtue to regard , the rights , privileges and duties , declared , defined and prescribed in their free constitutions and equal laws . What but mere pieces of paper are written constitutions , charters and laws , unless they are understood , guarded and obeyed ? How much will a free constitution avail with those who are ignorant of its provisions , or too unprincipled to regard them ? How much will a free press avail for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read ? How much will it not avail for evil in the hands of men who love error and falsehood ? There is a natural alliance between civil freedom and popular intelligence and virtue . And there is a natural alliance , which can not long be held in abeyance , between popular ignorance and vice and civil anarchy and despotism . There is , indeed , a strong tendency and great power in freedom to educate the people  --  to diffuse among them knowledge and morality in various ways , but especially by the institutions of education and religion . And here is one rich reason of hope for our own country , and for that great nation across the ocean which has recently begun to imitate our republican example . In order to have our free institutions safe , the people must be educated . A Christian education for the whole people ! This is our palladium . It will not do to educate a part only . It will not do to educate the children of the rich , and to leave the children of the poor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation , and leave another part to rush on in population and power without schools and colleges . It will not do to allow sectarianism in religion to prevent the universality of instruction . The ignorant have the same part with the intelligent in the national sovereignty ; and no ballots count faster than theirs . Our civil safety imperatively demands universal education . The same ship carries us all , and the nuskillfulness or viciousness of a part will dash us all on the rocks . Our destinies are all woven into the same web ; and if a part of the xvoof is defective , the whole becomes worthless , and we perish together . the ignorance , or wickedness , of a part of the nation endangers the civil prosperity and existence of the whole . Thus the object of this Association is one which appeals strongly , not only to religion and philanthropy , but to patriotism . rp here is one feature in this object which deserves for a moment our special attention . It proposes to assist educational efforts in the West  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special // importance . They are specially important for two reasons . The West is to be the most populous , and the dominant , portion of these United States . And in the West , just now , there is great neglect and lack of popular education . The capacity of that region for population is unequaled in our territories ; and its increase in population is beyond all parallel in the history of the world . In that spacious area , to which the Atlantic States are a mere fringe , richly supplied with all natural resources , will dwell the vast and ruling majority of our republic . It is worthy , therefore , of paramount consideration by patriots , philanthropists and Christians . From the census of 1830 to the census of 1840 , the population of the whole Northxvest increased one hundred and eight per cent . It more than doubled in ten years ; while the population of the whole country doubles only once in txventy-flve years , and that of some of the Eastern States remains nearly stationary . The approaching census of 1850 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this increasing multitude of people , this sea of human beings constantly swelling and rising , not only by its natural fountains , but by these rushing and various tides from all parts of our own country and from all parts of Europe , there is an alarming deficiency of education . According to the census of 1840 , one in every seven of the adult inhabitants of Indiana and Illinois could not read and write . At an educational convention in Indiana , in the year 1847 ' , it was estimated , by intelligent and judicious persons , that there were in that State thirty thousand voters , and twenty-five thousand mothers , who could not read and write . In the report for last year of the Secretary of the State of Illincis , who is ex-officio superintendent of common schools , it is estimated that there are in that State two hundred and fiftyfive thousand children of a proper age for school , only eighty-five thousand of whom attend school at all-that is one in three . Txvo-thirds without the advantages of schools ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading journal in Iowa , by one appearing to be thoroughly conversant with the facts , that there are in that State six hundred and seventy-three school districts , and only one hundred and five schools ; and that there are forty thousand six hundred children in the State between the ages of five and twenty-one , and only seven thousand and seventy-seven children in schools . That is , less than one in six of the school districts , and only one in six of the children have the advantages of a school ! These are facts which should be pondered by the friends of God , of man , and of their country , in connexion with the truth , that general popular education is an indispensable source of national enterprise , industry and wealth , of private and public virtue , and of civil prosperity and republican security . // We have thus considered , as fully as our limits will permit , the excellence of the object proposed . Let us now turn 9ur attention to the plan for contributing towards its accomplishment . Contributing , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add what it may , in its humble method , to those beneficent influences which are at work for the education of the West-to contribute some streams towards that flood of intellectual and moral light which wisdom and benevolence would pour over those new States . The features of this plan , which has been reduced to practice , and has been in operation now for more than two years , are these . The thing to be done is to transfer to schools in the West female teachers , of suitable intellectual and religious character , from the East ; where it is believed there are many , who , from motives of benevolence and interest , and some , who , from motives of benevolence only , will gladly engage in such an enterprise . The whole operation is under the control of a Board of eminent western gentlemen , ardent and judicious friends of popular education , and belonging to different evangelical Christian denominations . The persons who accept the proposal to go out as teachers under the auspices of this Board , are collected into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparatory course of training for a few weeks , usually six weeks , under the care and tuition of able and judicious teachers and lecturers . rFhis is for the double purpose , of ascertaining their qualifications , that no unsuitable persons may be sent out upon mere recommendation ; and of giving to those who may be sent such general and various instruction and advice as will obviously be of service to them in their work . The only expense , which the Board ordinarily incurs for the teachers , is that of their brief preparatory course , and of their journey to the place of their employment . Their support there will be derived from their schools ; and the Board , having conducted them to their field of instruction , claims no control over them , or their future plans . The teachers must be persons of good Christian character , who can give proper religious instruction , and exert a good rehgious influence in their schools ; and will have the disposition to organize and teach Sabbath schools , and to exercise , in all appropriate ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the evangelical denominations , arid are expected , while freely entertaining their own views on matters of difference between various Christian churches , to be ready and anxious , with a spirit of enlarged charity , to act in harmony with all evangelical Christians . // At the West , arrangements are made for ascertaining suitable places for schools , and making all suitable preparations for the reception of the teachers ; so that they can go with letters of introduction to the very persons who are responsible for their protection and support . The Board will endeavor , in various ways as they are able , especially by judicious agents , to awaken , and influence aright , public sentiment and public action at the West , in behalf of the great object of popular education ; in connection of course with the friends of education there , unobtrusively , and with deference to their judgment . Such is the plan . Its excellence in many respects is obvious and worthy of notice . 1 . It employs the best and cheapest kind of teachers-female , Christian teachers-who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructors of children ; and are better fitted than men by the gentleness of their spirit , and the liveliness of their sympathies and affections , for the work of training and instruction . Teaching is peculiarly the appropriate profession of woman . But all theory apart , the superiority of female teachers for common schools is sufficiently attested by the fact , that where there has been the least improvement in popular education , where schools are in the lowest state , there is employed the greatest proportion of male teachers ; and where there has been the greatest improvement in popular education , where schools are in the most advanced state , there is employed the greatest proportion of female teachers . And this proportion has kept pace with the advancing improvement , in the state of Massachusetts , whose common schools are unequaled by those of any other State or nation in the world , and have been rapidly improving for the last ten years , the increase in the number of male teachers from 1837-8 to 1847-8 , was only fifty-four ; while the increase in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand . In the present high state of schools in that commonwealth , seven-tenths of the teachers are females . In Provideuce , where the schools have been carried to a high point of excellence , seven-eighths of the teachers are females . To sustain our assertion that the kind of teaching which the Board has chosen is the cheapest , it is only necessary to state , that the average rate of salaries paid to female teachers in Massachusetts , is less than half that of the salaries of the male teachers . 2 . The plan falls in with the great law of political economy , the law of supply and demand , and is in accordance with a high but much neglected rule of religious economy . It opens a free channel between the supply and demand . There is a great need of teachers at the West , as we have seen . The whole field of instruction there is waiting to be occupied , is cal // Nov* hug aloud for laborers to enter in , and sow and reap the rich harvest* And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern States , who would willingly enter that field , if a way was opened7 there to find employment far more adequate and appropriate to their powers , attainments , taste and spirit , and of course far more useful , than they find here . According to the census of 1840 , there wa in New England an excess of adult female population of nearly twenty thousand . Their brothers go from home , on the sea , to the new States to the distant Pacific coast , in pursuit of wealth , or from the impulses of ambition . Let them also go forth , with equal enterprise , with the same self-denial , but with holier motive , and to a nobler work  --  the work of Christian education  --  the work of saving the children and youth of those new States from ignorance , and training them for intelligence and irtue , for patriotism and piety , for usefulness and heaven . They are ready , they will rejoice7 to do it , if enabled by appropriate means . There has been a serious error in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-denying devotion ( which , as every careful ob erver and especially every pastor well knows , exist in much the largest measure and highest degree among the female sex , ) have been to a great extent without fitting and worthy spheres of action . The policy of the Roman Catholics in this respect has been wiser than ours ; though some of their methods are objectionable . We should open wide to these devoted female spirits the honorable sphere of instruction , for which nature and grace have specially fitted them . We should organize and encourage orders of sisters of Education  --  the noblest charity  --  to go forth and labor under the bonds , not of an awful and irrevocable vow , but of their own free love and voluntary devotion . There are now hundreds , not to say thousands , employed in the cotton mills and other factories of New England , or but half employed or unemployed in their paternal homes , or working with the needle from morn to midnight for a miserable pittance , who , if the way was prepared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expanding and ennobling their own minds and hearts , and subserving the highest interests of the country and the church . 3 . It is an excellence of this plan , of secondary momemh , yet quite worthy of notice , that it is extremely economical . it secures large results in proportion to the money expended . It is well known , that , of all our measures of benevolent operation for the West , those which are educational , though essential to the well working of all others and therefore fundamentally important , are the most expensive . It requires , for instance , a large amount of money to endow and sustain Colleges and Theological Seminaries in that region . But here is an educational measure , which is cheaper than any mode whatever of doing good in // the new States ; not excepting that cheapest and noblest of all , the sending out and sustaining able and faithful ministers of the gospel . It requires no funds for educating teachers . It takes those who are already educated , and willing to be employed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . It requires only the means of finding them in the East , and transferring them to schools in the West . The sum requisite for this is about one hundred dollars for each teacher . That is , all the expenses of the Board for all purposes , including the brief preparatory course and the agencies , divided by the number of teachers actually introduced to the useful labors of their schools , gives a result of less than one hundred dollars . The expenditures of the Board for the two first years , according to their Annual Reports , amounted to $10,212 . During these two years it sent out one hundred and ten teachers . The average expense therefore for each was about ninety-three dollars . Now , as the expectation may be fairly entertained-it is already justified , so far as nearly three years experiment can justify it-that they will teach from one to ten years each , it appears that the annual expense of the Board for each teacher wll range from ninety-three dollars down to nine dollars ! But we have been led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had intended to present by itself  --  the resuIts of the plan , its actual working . It is not only excellent in theory ; it proves excellent when put to the test of practice . It works well . The experiment of nearly three years has justified it . We will briefly state what the Board have done . They were so fortunate as to secure the services of Gov . Slade of Vermont , as their General Agent ; who , if our memory serves us truly , declined being any longer a candidate for the gubernatorial office , which he had held for several years , that he might engage in this enterprise . His undertaking the public advocacy and general agency of this object has done more than any thing else to commend it to public attention and confidence . It was a practical endorsement of it , and a pledge of his future service to it , by one , who , in a long public life , had acquired a wide reputation for ability , sound judgment , integrity , moral courage , industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gov . S lade engaged in this enterprise in its new and untried state , at the expense of great personal inconvenience , labor and self-denial . And we feel constrained to say , that he deserves the gratitude of the friends of popular education ; and that he never occupied , when in the gubernatorial chair of the state of Vermont , or when representing her on the floor of the Congress of the United States , a position of so much usefulness and honor . // In the performance of his duties , Gov . Slade has traveled extensively in the Eastern and Middle States , addressing public assemblies and forming associations , for the purpose of obtaining teachers , awakening public interest in the enterprise , and raising funds for its prosecution . He has also visited the Western States , from Ohio to Minesota , conferring with the friends of popular education , addressing public assemblies and State Legislatures , forming associations , and doing whatever seemed necessary to interest the public mind in common schools , to procure places for teachers , and to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the influence of his labors at the West , is of itself worth more than all that the Board has expended . " One hundred and ten teachers have been sent out , during the two years ' operations of the Board . They have been drawn from the following States , in the following proportions . From Massachusetts , 34 ; Vermont , 29 ; Maine , 14 ; New Hampshire , 11 ; Connecticut , 8 ; New York , 8 ; Rhode Island , 4 ; Pennsylvania , 1 ; Virginia , 1 ;  --  and have been sent-To Illinois , 34 ; Indiana , 31 ; Wisconsin , 11 ; Michigan , 11 ; Iowa , 7 ; Tennessee , 5 ; Missouri , 3 ; Kentucky , 2 ; Western Pennsylvania , 2 ; Ohio , 2 ; Territory of Minesota , 1 ; and North Carolina , l. " - p. 7 . These teachers belong to the Congregational , Baptist , Methodist , Episcopal , and Presbyterian denominations . All applicants from any of these denominations , who have been judged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of this number , at the end of the second year , ninety-three were teaching ; and three were expected soon to renew their labors , suspended by sickness . During the present year , two classes have been sent out , numbering forty , the last in the month of October , making the whole number sent out in three years , one hundred and fifty . In Hartford , the place where the teachers are to pass through their preparatory course , a suitable building has been pro*rided , and suitably furnished , partly by the funds of the Board , but chiefly by the liberality of gentlemen in that city ; " while three ladies of that city , fully competent to the task , have consented to perform the service of receiving applications from and for teachers , selecting the teachers to be admitted to the preparatory probationary course , deciding who shall be sent forth under the patronage of the Board , and designating the pl*'ces to which they shall be sent . " rJlhe two classes of the first year went through the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beecher , who was one of the chief projectors of the enterprise , and devoted herself to its organization , " with a zeal and industry worthy of the great cause of Christian education to which she has devoted her life . " The preparation of the first class in the second year was under the superintendence of Miss Tappan , of Geneva , N. Y. ; and that of the other classes of the second and third years was under the sn // perintendence of Miss Swift , of Northampton , Mass . The Board expect the benefit of the matured experience and judgment of Miss Swift in the preparation of future classes . A circular letter was addressed , in October , 1848 , by the General Agent , to all the teachers who had been sent out , requesting an answer to various important inquiries , respecting their condition , their schools , and their success in doing good . Replies to to this circular had been received from most of the teachers , at the date of the last annual Report , January 1 , 1849 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From the replies received , and information previously communicated , it is estimated that there are about 4500 children and youth , under the instruction of the teachers of the Board . The stipulated rate of compensation is from $75 to *200 a year , with board ,  --  generally from $100 to $150 . Improvements in the school houses , and , in some cases , the erection of new ones , have been effected by our teachers  --  the number of their pupils is increasing , and the hope of increased usefulness appears to be entertained by them all . " All concur in representing the impression made by our movement as decidedly favorable . It is evidently disarming prejudice , and preparing the way for more al ) plications for teachers , a more just appreciation of their merits , and more adequate compensations for their services . " The Bible is variously used in all the schools ; while the teachers are not unmindful of the duty of engaging in Sabbath school instruction .

" - pp. 15 , it ; . There have been , as was to be expected in such a new enterprise , some instances of hardship and disappointment , such as the teachers ought not to be called upon to encounter . But these , we are fully assured , are few and exceptional ; and , moreover , were chiefly among those teachers who were sent out at the commencement of the Board 's operations , when the arrangements at the West for the location and reception of teachers were , almost of necessity , quite imperfect , very different from those which exist now . For such exceptional cases , the Board will hereafter make provision . On this point we quote a paragraph from the Report before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to support its teachers at the West , there have been , and will continue to be , cases forming appropriate exceptions . They are the cases of sickness  --  the failure to fulfill engagements to receive and employ teachers  --  the occasional necessity of their removing , for the want of support , or for other causes , from one place to another , and sometimes of their remaining in positions where the people for whose benefit their benevolence prompts them to continue , and where it is evidently very important they should continue to labor , can not sustain them . " " The undersigned feels it his duty to recommend such an alteration of the Cbnstitution as shall authorize the Executive Committee to appropriate the funds of the Board , at their discretion , to meet the various exigencies suggestedY-pp. 12 , 13. // It has sometimes been objected that the ranks of the teachers would soon be thinned by marriage ; and not a little small wit from various quarters has been expended on the supposed liability of the plan to failure in this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter in its true light . " Eight of the teachers have been married . Of these , two continue to act as teachers , and all have been placed by the change , in positions of usefulness scarcely less important than those to which the Board had assig ed them . The objectors to our enterprise , on the assumption that the teachers will speedily exchange their fields of labor for the marriage state , may dismiss s their fears , and give us their confidence-if , indeed , they have ever really withheld it , for the reason suggested . The marriage of even a much larger proportioa than is thus exhibited in two years , should not be an objection to this enterprise , and would not be , among the intelligent friends of Western improvement . " - p. 8 . While upon this part of the subject , we will quote a few ' extracts from letters written by the teachers : for we can not in any other way give so satisfactory an idea of the necessity , nature , and success of their work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we quote from the Appendix of the second Annual Report before us . The others are from letters never published . We make but one extract from a letter . " At the first sight of this place my heart sickened , and I thought I could never make it my home ; but after a few days ' reflection and acquaintance with the people , I became quite reconciled , and now I think if it is the will of ( hod that I should remain here , and I can be useful , I shall be contented . There are a few here who prize education ; but most of the parents have permitted their children to grow up in ignorance . I find , indeed , many women and even men who can not read . " " One rule I made when I began to teach was-never to punish a scholar in presence of the school . At the commencement of my last quarter , a boy of about sixteen came to my school . I hesitated about enrolling his name , as he had turned one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-out of the school-house . But I thought that perhaps Providence had sent him to me for some good , so I took him . Once he rebelled ; I kindly reproved him , telling him that , upon a recurrence of the act , I should be obliged to detain him after schooL He rebelled again , and when dismissing the school , 1 told him he might remain . Lie took off his cap with an air of conscious superiority , at least of strength , and sat down . Need I be ashanied to own that I trembled and 0-rew faint for I knew not what to do . But God was my refuge and stren*gth . When alone with him , I took him by the hand , arid knelt down , and with one arm around him , carried his case and mine to God in fervent prayer . He was melted ; *nd after a moment of conversation with him , he asked my forgiveness . I never had occasion to keep him after school again . I mention this to show not my skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am deeply interested in the Sabbath School . My pupils all attend . My class consists of fifteen young ladies , mostly from among my pupils , and they seem to be deeply interested in the study of the Scriptures . This interest has increased , of late . At my request the Sabbath School in my native town have sent me a very good library , and some of Newcomb 's questions . Our number has been thereby increased , and I trust greater good will be done . I also meet my pupils at a stated time for religious instruction and prayer , and each season increases the interest . There are some praying pious hearts among // them , and sweet it is to hear them pour out the fullness of their souls to our Father in heaven . I have reason to believe this number to be increasing . I find many in a very interesting state of mind .

At first they were very suspicious , and my movements were narrowly watched ; but I invited them to visit my school , and several of them havinodone so , have expressed entire satisfaction with my proceedings . Through the blessing of God upon my labors , I have succeeded in gaining the onfidence of the people , and awaking an interest in the cause of education , so that they have promised to support my school as long as I will stay among them . " " The Sabbath School organized the past summer was first proposed by a son of Catholic parents , a young man of about fifteen years of age . They are surrounded almost entirely by Catholic families . His first step wa to obtain a room , which was done by occupying the only one in his father 's house .

" A teacher in Illinois writes " Early in the spring a Union S. School was organized . We have over a hundred , including teachers and scholars . They meet in a little building , where I have been teaching . It is just sixteen feet square ; and we have had seventy-two present on some Sabbaths . If you could look in upon us some of these warm Sabbath mornings , and see how crowded we are , you would think the children loved their school . I have a class of female from irteen to twenty years of age . " In a subsequent letter she says : " You ask some account of the work of grace in the Sabbath S thool . There seemed to be nothing like excitement . It was individual interest prod ced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become reconciled to the Savior . Seven from the school united with t e Methodist Church , five with the Baptist , and four with the Cumberland Presbyterian . Most of these are very ignorant . We must judge of them , according to the light previously enjoyed . With such preaching as they have , and the loose way professing Christians live , we can not help fearing with regard to some in the day of trial their faith will fail . The Sabbath here is universally regarded as a holiday . Ministers and people make it a day of visiting . The grocery is open and as much frequented as on any day . To many , the Bible has all the novelty of a new book , so little do they know of its sacred history and divine teachings . One example will shew this . I asked a girl of fifteen , in the progress of the Sabbath School lesson , What a synagogue was ? She replied , Why , Miss H. , do n't you reckon it 's some kind of a grocery ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 184&amp; . " I organized alone a Sabbath School . At first , I was the only teacher , and only seven scholars assembled in a little low mud-walled log house . 1 think , could you now be present , and realize the vast change , it would afford you equal pleasure with myself . Soon after its commencement , young men and young women began to come in , and we have had a great number connected with the school . You may judge something of my trials , when I tell you , that // for one year no voice was heard there in prayer , save that of your unworthy friend ; and a large number of young men were looking to me as their guide . But strange as it may seem , the happiest Sabbaths of my life were thus spent . Now there are several pious teachers , a beautifully pleasant new school room , filled with bright children and youth , and some of those who were unable to read can now accomplish , what some who have been all their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power which has operated upon them is an astonishment to myself . It is all of God and to him be the glory . " A teacher writes from a Dutch colony in Michigan " Rev. Mr. Van Raalte gave me a cordial welcome , and an assurance of his cooperation in any method I wished . He was not willing to trouble me with a large number of scholars this summer , and none of the degraded class , in my day school . But I learned a few Dutch words , and told the children that all who wished might come Sundays , without paying money . This took like a charm ; and I now have a large number learning to read English from the New Testament . Dr. Wyckoff of Albany visited the colony in June . He called at my school , and promised to send a library of $10 worth of Sabbath School books the first opportunity . I have now completed a four month 's term , and am now out of school dealing with chill-fever , but hope to go in again soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflicting hand from me , and allow me to continue my feeble efforts in his service , I shall be thankful .

" I found a school of about forty girls , from the ages of seven to seventeen , and in rather poor order . I immediately went to work to see if I could obtain more quiet , and have succeeded admirably ; so much so that it is being noticed by the scholars . Our school now numbers seventy and is increasing almost weekly . It is opened in the morning by reading selections from the Bible , singing *ccompanied by the melodeon , and prayer . I never was happier in my lile ; and if I can be the means of benefiting any one , shall feel that all my labor and privations are as nothing . " Here is another from Minesota .

" The personal favors shown me , during my sojourn among you , are precious mementoes , in this far off land . The counsels of Mr. Gallaudet , and the instructions of Miss Swift , are in memory 's store-house , like apples of gold in pictures of silver . The literary and scientific lectures of Messrs . Grant , Beecher , Barnard and others , have already been of service to me , and the school at St. Anthony , never pleases me so well as when I discover in it something which indicates that the model was brought from the schools of'Hartford , Connecticut . You will be gratified to hear that I succeed quite beyond my own expectations , in carrying out the suggestions , and transmitting to others the instructions , which were so freely given .

Mr. G. , the pioneer , from Maine , arrived October 1st , 1847 , and endured " Missionary " hardships , while building the first saw-mill , which now furnishes timber with astonishing rapidity . His family had been here about three weeks , and were living in // very close quarters when I came , but after I had promised to he more useful than three Irish girls , through the day , and to sleep almost any where , they consented to take me under their roof , which was the best part of the house , though that was unfinished . " I had been at service hut two days , when Mrs. G. became the mother of the first white daughter , ever born in this place . In addition to my other duties , the honor of being the nurse , was conferred upon me , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to leave the sleeping to others . But the promise , As thy day so shall thy strength be , ' sustained me , while my Father 's hand led me by a way which I knew not , and in paths that I had not known . " My school commenced June 21st , with twelve scholars , in the skeleton of a building which had been used for a dwelling house , and the proprietors certainly deserve credit for fitting up so comfortable a school-house at so early a day , while they are so full of business in building their own dwellings . " The scholars have increased until we number forty , from three to twenty years of age . Some of them are as well instructed as those of their age in New England , for that was their home a few weeks ago . One boy of twelve from Maine , is fitting for college , and is quite a prodigy in scientific attainments . Another portion of my school have learned what they know at Western schools , ' and Western schools must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been better for them , and easier for me , had they never seen a school-house , for their bad habits are hard to overcome . The French and half-breeds ' are very teachable , and they make astonishing progress in reading , spelling and repeating from memory . Every child , of every color , age and grade , hastens to school ; and we are as happy a company as need to be . " The new school-house is large and well planned , and will he ready for use by the first of October . It is uncertain whether I occupy it or not , for we think it may be necessary to divide the school , and if so , I shall choose the little ones , and those of stammering tongue for my charge . " We have ourselves read many of the letters written by these teachers , and have sufficient and reliable testimony respecting those which we have not read ; and we are confident that no better testimony can be asked , that these teachers are doing , successfiully , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devotion , with cheerfulness and joy amid their labors and self-denials , and to the general , and often very great , satisfaction of the communities in which they are employed . These noble women , in their schools , gathering around them the children and youth , disciplining , enlightening and refining their minds , controlling their passions and wills , and molding their characters by the mingled power of authority , religious truth and Christian kindness ; training up those who will be qualified to be teachers ; and affording an illustration in some measure of what an education is , and. , of what a school should be-these noble women , in those new communities , setting an example of intelligence , refinement and goodness ; inciting them to an interest in popular education , prompting them to the building and improvement of school-houses , and even churches ; organizing and superintending or teaching in Sabbath Schools ; and engaging , harmoniously , with good people of various names , in every good work-who can estimate their beneficent influence ? What minister of the gospel in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a teacher in his parish ? What Home missionary would not rejoice to have such a teacher as his pioneer or coworker ? What Sabbath School missionary would not think himself fortunate to find such instrumentality , willing to be eniployed in his operations ? What friend of God and goodness would not be thankful to meet with such codperation ? We will only add that this enterprise has the confidence , and its practical working has more than fulfilled the expectations , of eminent friends of popular education , residing in the West , who early gave it their attention and support , and are members of the Board formed to control and forward its prosecution-such men as Prof. Stoxve and Dr. Aiken of the Presbyterian church ; Bishop McLlvaine and Dr. Aydelott of the Episcopal Church ; Rev. Mr. Magoon of the Bapiist Church ; and Judge McLean aud Dr. Elliott of the Methodist Church . In conclusion , we commend this enterprise to the attention , confidence and aid of the friends of popular education-an object to which , surely , all should be friends . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be supplied . If the Board should be enabled to employ suitable and sufficient agencies for enlisting teachers in the East , and securing for them places and appropriate arrangements in the West , their schools and teachers would soon be greatly multiplied . We commend the enterprise especially to Christian women . They have a peculiar right in it . Indeed , it is chiefly theirs . Upon their agency , mainly , depend its prosecution and success ; and the honor of its usefulness belongs chiefly to them . It should awaken their zeal and enthusiasm . We hope that they will be its earnest and persevering friends ; that they all will do what they may , by pecuniary aid and personal influence ; and that many of them , partaking of the spirit of " those women who labored in the gospel " with Paul , will respond to this loud call for the inestimable services of Christian teachers , saying , " Here am I. Send me. "                  @ @ @
