Is there no end to the mul. tiplication of such voluntary associations ? And how is it possible to make room for another annual presentation to my people , without wearing out their patience , and interfering unwarrantably with the ordinary ministrations of the sanctuary ?

Such a mode of disposing of such a question , ill befits the position occupied by the American churches , with respect to the forming communities and nations of the West , and the great enterprise of evangelizing the world . Perhaps a weightier topic never has been , perhaps till the end of time never will be , presented to the Protestant Christians of these United States , than that involved in their relations to the cause of freedom , learning , religion , and indeed every department of Christian civilization , among the swarming millions of the great central valley of the North American continent . The case is , so far as we can recollect , peculiar in the history of the world , and seems a marked and striking dispensation of divine Providence . For nearly two centuries of our history , the unique elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt along our Atlantic coast ; while the gigantic forests of the West resounded not to the stroke of the axe , and the wild flowers of her ten thousand prairies were - " born to blush unseen , And waste their sweetness on the desert air . In this long period , our fathers had time and scope to reduce to practice those principles of civil and religious freedom , which exiled them to our shores . Society organized on this continent after a new model , had time to pass through the fermentation , which is inseparable from any great social experiment , and to become firmly settled upon its first principles , which are now no longer mere theories , but the results of the experience of several generations . Their institutions of government , education and religion had all become consolidated , and reached that maturity , which marks an advanced state of civilization . Thus had divine Providence mysteriously and wonderfully brought the fundamental principles of our civilization to these shores-tested them in practice-confirmed them by the experience of nearly two centuries , and made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation of equal brethren-of a system of education for a nation of freemen  --  and of a church which knew no priest but the one Mediator , no authoritative creed but the divine word , and no head but Christ . No sooner are these grand results achieved , than the barriers are removed which had hitherto confined us to the Atlantic coast , and in the lapse of a single half century , our border is removed from the Hudson and the Alleghanies , to the Colorado and the borders of the great American desert . Jn that brief period we have been spread over a territory not inferior , in the extent of its capabilities of sustaining human life , to the whole of Europe . Over all this vast region states are coming into being , and advancing in all the physical elements of prosperity , with a rapidity unparalleled in history , and undreamed of in romance . Nor has this work of ex. // tension yet ceased , or been checked in the smallest degree . the tide is still sweeping on with accelerated velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1 ) redict , within what limits divine Providence shall ultimately confine it . And yet it is an indispensable condition of our well-being both here and hereafter , that through all this wide-spread and teemin* mass , there should be diffused the great original principles of our civilization-that these principles should become the fundamental laws of society , from the Atlantic to  --  the going down of the sun , and from the lakes to the southern gulf . We do but dream if we indulge the thought , that we can long enjoy the civil and political institutions of ou ' fathers1 or that we can diffuse them over the " great valley , " if we apostatize from their religious freedom , or abandon their free and universal education . Most clearly then has the finger of God pointed out the calling , the mission of the American patriot , philanthropist , Christian . Our fathers brought the seeds of our peculiar civilization across the ocean , and planted and nursed them at the expense of home and kindred and life . Fo.r them they gave their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their prayers , he accepted their offering* Those principles were precious in his eyes , and he made the social edifices reared upon them , to be the admiration of the world . Our work is the diffusion of thes s e principles , over all that vast region which God has given us to possess . He says to every genuine son of the Pilgrims , go plant the principles of you . fathers wherever , on this continent , the jurisdiction of your country extends , or the English language is spoken . The North American continent is now to be peopled with swarming millions . Forest and prairie are to be converted into cornfields , and cities are to rise amid the solitudes of six thousand years . The principles of civil and religious freedom have been evolved-they have been planted and taken deep root on our soil , and it is the high calling of patriotic and Christian men , to diffuse them through all these millions , and make them the central principles of society , over regions of the earth not less important to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This work is essentially organic . It consists not mainly in preaching a doctrine , or a scheme of doctrinesnot even though that scheme of doctrines be the Gospel itself , but in founding institutions ; such institutions as embody the Gospel and bec me its living instruments , to secure its publication in perpetuity , not only to the present but to all coming generations . Many seem to have a very defective view of the work of Christian benevolence in our new settlements . They seem to imagine that our main object is to communicate , to the greatest possible number of individuals , so much of Gospel truth as may be barely sufficient to save the soul . This is certainly a mistake , This is not a nation of heathens : and it is matter of devout gratitude to God , that few of our population can avoid , even if they would , knowing enou , h of the Gospel to ave the soul , if all that is known were received and believed . The case of our home missionary enterprise is but very slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our own foreign missions . The leading idea of both of these is , to obtain for Christianity a lodgrnent among the elem nts of society ; it is to sow the seed ; to mingle it with the soil in which to vegetate , and , when it shall have received the early and latter rain , bear the ripe fruits of a Christian civilization . But our domestic missionary enterprise takes up the work at a very different stage . The seed has already been sown broad- // 277 cast over the land , and has taken root . Christianity has long ago found a lodgm ent among the elements of society . The millions who are flowing like a deluge over our unoccupied territory hear it along with them . It may be found in some form in every mover 's wagon , and every steamboat cabin . But this peopling of vast regions hy immigration creates a rare exigency in human history ; and involves the necessity of reconstructing society on a scale of immense magnitude . Our work then is something more than preaching ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it is founding , as we have already said , institutions ; it is organizing society on Gospel principles . In ordertherefore more fully to comprehend the nature of this enterprise , let us inquire what are the leading organic powers of Christian society ? I'o this no one can hesitate a moment to reply in three words , government , education , religlon . In the case before us1 the first of these great interests we find already provided for , and a system made ready to our hands , in reference to which , regarding it in its true intent and spirit , the good man has no occasion to express any wish , except his fervent ejaculation , " esto perpetua . " And this system of government was. , by an unparalleled provision of divine Providence , prepared by the wisdom of our fathers , as truly for the territory of Wisconsin or Nebraska , as for the state of New York or Connecticut . This interest may therefore he dismissed from further consideration at this time , as already settled and provided for . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Gospel requires , and such as can give life and perpetuity to such a government . We hold it then to be as plain as demonstration can make it , what the sons of Puritan fathers are called , as by an audible voice from heaven , to do in this grand emergency of the continent we inhabit . There is no call for a complicated scheme , a vast system of machinery . The work is simple , definite , tangible , and with the help of God we may add , easy . It is simply to extend over all this vast country , those simple systems of educational and religious organization and action , which our fathers founded , and which under God have exhibited an omnipotent efficacy to make the social edifices they reared the glory of all lands . He who is engaged in founding and fostering these institutions as widely as possible over all our territory , is obeying the call of God ; he who is not doing this , and is relying on other means to accomplish the work , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he is not wise to discern this time . We think it equally clear from this general view of the subject that whatever other " national societies " or great permanent charities , , * designed for the benefit of our own population , are turned aside , for the want of time or patience to give them a hearing , the effort for home missions and western education should not be of the number. - " These ought ye to have done and not to leave the others undone . " The particular plans now in operation in reference to either of these two great objects may be defective , and require review and amendment , but the objects themselves are the objects , they are instar omniu7n : if these are done all is done , if these are neglected nothing is done , all is lost . The nature of the enterprise to be achieved for our country is therefore we think obvious . It is no new theory we are to apply , no new invention whose utility we are to test . No reflecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of American society resides . It is in // 278 Collegiate Education in the T&gt;Festern States . her schools and her churches ; when these are revolutionized or perish , our civilization will share the same fate ; and if , on the other hand , the peculiar civilization of the period of our revolution is ever to fill up the ample boundaries of our national domain , it is to be accomplished by giving to the schools and churches of that period , a like ubiquity of presence and influence . We have some most remarkable facilities for accomplishing this result , which if we neglect , posterity will be amazed at our negligence and folly . Though the new communities of the West are composed of materials the most heterogeneous , there is one element which is almost omnipresent , and that one is Puntani*m . It is not grouped together in colonies , as if afraid of contact with opposing influences , and shunning the fierce moral conflict of which the plains of the West are the battle-field ; it is confined to no climate , occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ubiquity and its energy . Of no other element of society in the West can it be said with equal truth , that it is intimately mingled with every part of the mass . And its efficiency is never denied , however much it may be hated or feared . Whereever this element is found , there you will always find men cherishing a fond , and often a tearful , remembrance of the institutions of the home of their fathers , and a readiness to co-operate , often at the expense of great personal sacrifice , in founding these institutions in the home of their adoption . As we were once riding with a friend over a beautiful prairie of great extent , in all the wildness and loveliness of its primeval solitude , how lovely , ' exclaimed that friend , ' this will be when covered with an intelligent and pious population , with its neat schoolhouses , and its church spires crowning these beautiful eminences . ' That was the utterance of a true Puritan heart , and there are few portions of our country where you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such men will found churches after the model of their fathers ; they will long and pray , even in the solitudes of the wilderness , that they and their children may enjoy the teachings and the example of the enlightened and pious minister of Christ , and join in public prayer and praise as they used to do in the home of their childhood . They will found schools , and academies , and colleges . And as they begin to see around them the first foundations of such a society as they revere and love , they will be ready to say , " now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , for mine eyes have seen thy salvation . " These facts present to American Christians some grave considerations . What other religious enterprise , either domestic or foreign , we earnestly ask , can comparc in claims upon the American churches , with that of extending to such men , in their dispersion and their feebleness , the aid which is indispensable in the founding of those institutions for which they are sighing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our free Protestant society , the very ark of the testimony ? Rome pursues with sleepless vigilance the German or Irish emigrant , however ignorant or degraded , to the hovel of his poverty-wherever she finds him employed , in constructing our railroads , digging our canals , or becoming the hewer of wood and the drawer of water to the more opulent inhabitants of our populous cities , and makes his very ignorance , prejudice , and superstition the potent instruments of establishing her iron despotism over all this land of freedom . The mingling of these foreign elements with our population is almost the whole secret of her power : and well has she shown that she // understands its value . She is expending her treasures in strengthening , encouraging , and extending it , free as the waters of our great river . Can Protestants learn any thing by this example ? Puritanism enjoys in this very particular , an immense advantage over Romanism itself . Her sons are probably more numerous , certainly more universally diffused , and vastly more intelligent and influential . Romanisin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the whole face of the country , and become intimately mingled with our population . There are permanent causes , which we will not detain the reader to enumerate , but which will probably forever prevent such a diffusion of foreign Catholic population . But the characteristic of Puritanism is ubiquity . Surely then those who love the principles and institutions of their fathers , will avail themselves of such an advantage , given them by the providence of God , to the very utmost . And when these men would found churches , and schools , and colleges , they will receive all the aid which can come from the sympathies , the prayers , and the free contributions of their brethren in all parts of the land . Surely the men who have left the colleges , and churches , and literary privileges which they loved as their lives , to be the pioneers in such an enterprise as this , will not be left to bear the burden alone , to be conscious that their minds are starving for the want of books , and still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around is languishing for that very knowledge which they could impart , were not their whole energy absorbed in providing for the sustenance of themselves and their families ; and to call in vain for aid , while they still gaze on upon the moral desolations around them , till the heart sickens , and the eyes grow dim . Surely , when colleges have been founded , and been in successful op eration for half a generation , exerting a silent but mighty influence on all the institutions of society , they are not to be allowed to languish , and even utterly to perish , for the want of a few thousand dollars , and thus to be the occasion of discouragement to all that love truth and freedom , and of exultation and triumph to all their enemies . We can only say , our Romanist adversaries are not likely to be guilty of any such folly . This subject is presented perhaps in a still stronger light , by viewing the case in yet another aspect . Rome is well aware that if she ever gains dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her seminaries of learning . In this she is making a wise use of her past experience . She is not likely soon to forget that it was by the influence of her Jesuits on the universities , that she recovered half Europe , which at one time seemed hopelessly lost to her by the Reformation . In Austria* itself , now so drunk with the cup of her sorceries , half a century , or a little less , from the outbreak of the Reformation , hardly one man in thirty adhered to her communion ; her priests ' orders were deserted by the youth of the nation for more than half a generation . Austria belonged to the Reformation ; but her sad subsequent story is soon told . Through her rulers , the Jesuits obtained a controlling influence in her universities and schools of learning , and what is she now ? Bereft of the life-giving truths she had once embraced-the graveyard of all intellectual and moral freedom . Little less sad is the history of other extensive portions of Europe , and those among the fairest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools of learning . This lesson , as we have said , Rome remembers , and she is putting forth her utmost strength to * Ranke 's History of the Popes , pp. 164-172. // 280 Collegiate Education in the Western States . apply it again to our own country . Not that we would even suggest that Rome has any intention of educating our whole population . She has no such thought ; she never did that either in France or Austria . No , she is well aware that if she can control the universities and colleges , the nation is hers . And though there is little in her creed to which we can subscribe , in this article we fully concur . The religious system which controls the universities and colleges of the West for the next generation , will he the dominant system . This is a weighty truth , and in view of it we can not but conclude , that the society whose first two reports.stand at the head of this article , was formed none too soon . This question is now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds on both sides very deeply . Rome is sparing no pains to fill the whole country with her colleges and female seminaries , and through them to obtain the education of all the leading minds in society . At the very time we are writing , leading Protestant ministers in a great Western city are preaching discourses to warn their people against Jesuit srhools ; Protestant and IRomish religious newspapers are engaged in earnest controversy on this very question ; and a prominent secular journal , conducted by men who are called Protestant , is defending the Jesuits , and disparaging the Protestant seminaries which are struggling for existence around them . At a time like this , surely an organization like the Society for Promoting Collegiate and Theological Education at the West , can not be deemed uncalled for or untimely . But perhaps , while the correctness of these general views may be pretty generally admitted , a doubt may still arise as to the wisdom of the particular plan adopted by the society referred to in the opening of this article , for affording aid to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , then , let us direct our attention . We understand the scheme in brief to be this : to extend a fostering hand to such a number of Protestant colleges and theological seminaries as the circumstances of the new states shall seem to require and the funds of the society shall justify  --  to select such as , considering their location , constitution and all other circumstances , are fitted to exert the widest and most salutary influence  --  to afford aid only so far as may be needful from year to year , in supporting instructors and providing the books and apparatus , which shall be most urgently necessary ; thus leaving to the several communities themselves to erect buildings and make permanent endowments-in short , helping the people to found these institutions for themselves , not founding them for them , and to extend this mode of effort just as far as the means placed at the disposal of the society will allow . Now , to us it does not seem to admit of much doubt whether , in view of the experience of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise plan . If it be not such , we confess we know not where to look for one that is . The problem which we are endeavoring to work out by our missionary movements in the West , may be thus enunciated : to stimulate and aid the Puritan principles which are every where spread abroad through all these regions , to organize themselves into those institutions , which are their proper embodiment , and which will secure for them their proper power over society . this statement does not need to be enforced by any argument . He who does not thus understand the problem , has not yet learned what we would do if we could . He has need to go back and prepare himself for his work by a study of its first principles . In what manner , then , do the religious principles of our fathers tend // to work themselves out in organization ? Who can be at a loss for one moment for a reply ? Their first conatus is to organize the local church , and to obtain for old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular instruction , in season and out of season , in the things which pertain to the kingdom of God . Their next enterprise will be to provide for the instruction of the young in the first rudiments of learning ; and this will be done with or without aid . In no family where these principles live , will the child grow up to manhood without being able to read the word of God ; and no neighborhood where these principles l ) revail , will be without its " commOn school . " Almost simultaneously with the laying of these two corner-stones of society , these same mighty principles will begin to forecast the future and to agitate society with the questions , where are the schools of the prophets , at which we may train up our gifted sons for the service of God ? - hoxv shall we supply these churches with a succession , " truly apostolic , " of learned and pious ministers ? And how shall they answer these questions , if not in the same way in which our fathers answered them before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild flowers , and in the very footprints of the savage ? Is it not obvious , that in no other possible way the principles of our fathers can work themselves out ? Can our brethren who are scattered over the great West , make their principles felt in the organization of society by any other possible process ? Can you , without treason to your principles and cruelty to your brethren , tell them that they must be content to depend for Christian teachers and other learned men on the seminaries of the old states for generations to come ? Suppose that this universal impulse of Puritan principles receives the friendly aid of a benevolent so VOL . IV . 36 ciety , such as the one in question . Our brethren are then told in effect : unite your counsels and your efibris - agree on suitable locations and plans of organization and instruction , such as the experience of generations has sanctioned , and then we will aid you-what you can not do . foryourselves in your present feebleness , we will do for you . You must sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack we will supply . What results , we ask , may be expected from such an organization , thus carried out ? Not lung less surely than studding over the whole West with a noble constellation of colleges , constructed after a model , the power of which is tested by our whole history as a nation , and in proper contact with the multitudinous population of the " great valley . " Is this a wise plan ?  --  or is it one which ought to be turned aside , because it was born a few years too late , and there is now no room for it around the table of our common benevolence ? Surely this is a matter which stands little in the need of the aid of argument . Such an enterprise , thus carried out , must create a movement through every departmentof education , which will be felt to the remotest extremity of our national domain , arid as long as our rivers flow down to the Gulf . It will enable our religious principles to exert their full power upon the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of our country , have long since seen and acknowledged the almost unlimited influence for good on the educational interests of the country of those religious bodies , which are generally called Presbyterian . It is a fact , too notorious to require any argument , that they have been the educatar&amp;of this nation . What , then , is the secret of their power in relation to this great interest ? We answer , one principal reason is found in their insisting , in all their churches , // on an educated ministry . Whereever you find a community imbued with these principles , you find the church of God , with the regular and stated ministrations of a learned and pious ministry , regarded as essential arrangemen ts of society . No family which holds those principles can feel at home , or that they live in civilized society , where these privileges are not enjoyed . To train a son to be a learned and faithful ambassador of Christ , is the highest ambition of every truly Puritan parent . Nor is it difficult to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is found in the very system itself , and is no accidental appendage . That system of religious faith , under all its modifications , recognizes the knowledge of divine things as lying at the foundation of all true religion . It places no dependence , on the one hand , on forms and ceremonies and priestly incantations , and on the other , just as little on the heats and fervors of the soul which do not spring from a sound and true knowledge of God . It also recognizes the right of private judgment . Truth is not to be transmitted from father to son by tradition . Each individual mind is to be called into action in reference to the great themes of redemption . Individual understandings are to be enlightened-individual judgments are to be formed by the action of their own reason , in the interpretation of the word of God-individual consctences are to be quickened , and individual wills to be swayed by divine truth . Society , under that system , is to be held firm and steady to its principles by teaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not by the overshadowing influence of authority . Now , who can fail to see that if such a system be penetrated also by fervent religious affections , ( and what system was ever more strongly marked by such affections ? ) it must apply to the educational movements of society in almost irresistible moving power ? The grand conservative element in such a society , is religious teaching ; and it must be such religious teaching as can grasp the entire mind of the community , and hold it firm by the simple power of conviction . We ask , then , can there be any difficulty in comprehending the force of the peculiar power which this system always exerts upon the interests of education , or the process by which its results are produced ? It is impelled to found colleges by an instinct as natural as that which impels the waterfowl to its element . It is its nature , and in doing so , it is only giving a center and a head to an educational movement which must be as universal as its influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very life of the body politic , so it is plain that even the remotest member must , to a greater or less extent , feel its power . On the other hand , it seems to us as obvious , that without founding and fostering seminaries of learning , the peculiar religious system referred to can not exert its peculiar religious influence on society , as that the human body can not live without food . They are as truly a natural and necessary part of the social organization to which it gives birth , as its churches or its common schools , and essential to the vigorous action of both . Does it , then , require argument to prove that such seminaries of learning are of vital importance in the process of reconstructing society from the heterogeneous materials which are peopling our unoccupied territory ? Will any man think it wiser and safer to confine our efforts to the distribution of Bibles and tracts and the " bound volumes , " and to supporting home missionaries and colporteurs , and leave the problem of education to be wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesuit colleges ? Or can a xvise man conclude , in view of the considerations thus far presented , that any other mode of missionary effort at the West can have any claim of precedency to this effort to found institutions of learning ? Is it not rather plain as demonstration , that the founding of churches and schools of learning is our main work ? - our peculiar calling ?  --  the very thing to which we are required to devote our primary efforts , in preference to any thing else ? - required , we say , by our principles , our history and the very nature of the enterprise we have undertaken . We disparage no other mode of doing good for the West . God speed every one that loves Zion , and prays for her prosperity . But we must plainly state the case , as it seems to us , and as we think our argument proves it to be . There is no possible way in which our principles can work themselves out , and tell as they ought on society , except through seminaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources of the West are so great , and its growth in wealth so rapid , that it is able to found its own seminaries of learning without our aid ? And would it not follow from the same premises quite as conclusively , that it is able to support its own pastors , and purchase its own Bibles , tracts and religious books ? To us , we confess , it seems peculiarly reasonable that the friends of liberal education in the West , scattered and feeble as they are , should need aid in laying the first foundations of their colleges , rather than any other of these enterprises . It requires a much greater accumulation of resources at a single point , and consequently cooperation and concerted action upon a vastly greater scale . But these , among an alluvial population , are peculiarly difficult to be secured . Local interests , sectional jealousies , and individual prejudices act with peculiar vigor , uncounteracted by any great established system of central attraction ; and a population newly settled in the wilderness are so engrossed by urgent wants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is exceedingly difficult to arouse them to act for a great common object , however important , which is not quite so near home . Thousands will bear their part in building the church , who will not think the time has yet come when they can do any thing to found a college , which is to be located a day 's journey from their residence . The same may be said of supplying the people with religious books . The question is not whether , if all the people in any district were agreed as to the necessity of founding a college on given principles , there would be wealth enough to do it , but whether those who do feel its importance , and are willing to cooperate in the work , may be reasonably expected to have the means of accomplishing it . And we are satisfied that whoever studies this question candidly and thoroughly , will come to the conclusion , that if the XVest needs aid in any thing , it is in founding such seminaries of learning as will effectually baffle the machinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral wants of this mighty people . Nor do we see any reason to object to the details , or to the practical working of the plan . the main objection we do see , is that its resources have hitherto borne no proportion to the magnitude of the enterprise it has undertaken , or to the importance of the results at which it aims . This is an objection which we trust the efficient patronage of an enlightened community will speedily and entirely remove . In such a board of directors as that which controls the operations of this society , the churches can surely confide . Their task is one of great difficulty and responsibility . Of this we doubt not they are aware ; and // we believe that every one who loves the principles for which we labor , will pray that God will give them the grace and wisdom they need to secure a right decision of all the complicated and difficult questions on which they are called to deliberate . One of the most delicate and difficult questions which is likely to claim the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears from the second report is already under consideration , is that of enlarging the sphere of the society 's operations . In one direction , it is surely desirable that such an enlargement should take place as speedily as possible . It is desirable that its action should be extended over a wider field . Its aid has hitherto been confined to the three states , Ohio , Indiana , illinois . The reason of this fact we suppose to be , that the society had its origin in the urgent necessities of five institutions in those three states , which were all the offspring of Christian liberality , mostly in the eastern and middle states , and the very existence of which seemed deRendent on receiving further aid from the same source . To rescue these seminaries from the peril they were in , seemed to be the first duty of the society ; and during the first two years of its existence its resources have been scarcely sufficient to meet their most urgent and pressing necessities . But the nature of the work on which the society has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . The society must speedily fail altogether , or take a high and commanding position  --  a position from which it can judge with impartial wisdom at what points over all the " great valley " the cause of learning and evangelical religion demands that the hand of Christian benevolence should be extended to aid in the founding of seminaries of learning , *and be prepared to grant at every one of these points a needed assistance and encouragement . God speed the day when the society shall occupy such a position . It will be to the West like the rising of the morning star , or the full dawning of the day . If the Protestant Christians of these United States will place this society in such a position , they can educate the West , and neither European immigration , Europeari gold , nor Jesuit cunning can hinder it . They can mold it after the Protestant model , and fill it full of Christian freedom and evangelical truth . We are quite sure that if " his holiness " enjoyed like advantages , he would use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an extension of the society 's operations , which , whenever we reflect on it , fills us with anxiety . Shall the society extend its fostering hand to enterprises of this sort in those states in which slavery molds every thing into conformity with itself ? It may be seen at a glance that the funds by which the society 's operations are sustained must come almost wholly from the free labor states . Will , then , the good men of those states be willing to give their money to found institutions of learning , where , from their location , they must be subject to all the corrupting and withering influences which are inseparable from the system of do . mestic slavery ? And , what is a question still more pertinent-ought they to 1e willing ? For ourselves , we confess we feel the most thorough discouragement of any considerable success of seminaries of learning in communities in which slavery , or the interest of slaveholders , is predominant . The entire experience of this nation and of the world is against it . Slavery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the abomination that maketh desolate . " It does and it will make desolate . In the soil which it curses , such churches and such schools , of Whatever grade , as our Puritan fathers founded , can not // flourish . Any people who adopt and foster that system , we care not under what plea of " expediency " or " hard necessity , " must be content to see their churches decay and dwindle , and their sch6ols of learning wither like some delicate plant of the tropics when exposed to the frosts of the polar circle . With those who , with much earnestness and apparent sincerity , plead the " hard necessity entailed " on them from their fathers , we have now no controversy ; but granting it so , then we say , the sad consequences already pointed out are " entailed " also . If , like the servant of Zeno , the philosopher , they assure us that they are " fated " to live under that system , then , like the philosopher himself , we must say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences . The consequences are such as have been pointed out , and from the fate which hinds these consequences to the system under which they live , no human power can deliver them . For this benevolent association , therefore , to engage in the work of founding colleges after the New England model , in the states in which slavery is the established and immutable organization of society , would seem to us to be little short of engaging in a struggle against omnipotence . It is an enterprise scarcely more hopeful than to attempt the growing of cotton or sugar cane in Iceland orKamskatcha . It seems to us that the providence of God is calling upon our brethren at the South , as with a voice of thunder , to put away this abomination , as the only condition either of intellectual or religious health and prosperity . And while we continue to behold throughout the slave states an inflexible determination to put down , by the terrors of the lynch court or the bowie knife , every attempt to give utterance to the instincts of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to three millions of human beings held by them in hopeless bondage , we shall have little hope that such institutions of intellectual and religious freedom as the colleges of New England can flourish in such a moral climate . We are not deficient in sympathy or kindness for our brethren in the slaveholding states ; some of them we know only to admire and love , and if they will point out any way in which such enterprises as we are speaking of can be reasonably expected to succeed and prosper , under the influence of the system of slavery , most gladly would we see the wealth of the North flow over the South free as water , in fostering and sustaining their seminaries of learning . But as at present advised , we honestly think that our whole experience as a nation , and the very laws of society and of God , forbid such a hope . if we are mistaken , we shall be glad to see our error . We would not undertake to settle this painful question , definitively , in advance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those to whom it is specially entrusted . We will not deny that within the geographical line which encloses what are commonly called the slave states , there may be districts of considerable extent , in which , though slavery has a being , it exists somewhat as slavery existed in New England before the Revolution . We will not take it upon ourselves to say peremptorily , in the present stage of the enterprise , that in a region where the land is divided not into plantations but into farms ; where the great staple of the soil is not cotton or the cane , but grain and grass ; where the labor is chiefly performed by freemen cultivating their own fields ; where the ratio of the blacks to the whites is as one to five , and is steadily diminishing ; and where the slaves , instead of being driven ' to their tasks in gangs , * labor side by side with their masters and their masters ' sons ; it may // not be as wise to co-operate with those who are yearning after improvement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under evangelical influences ; as it was to found and sustain Yale College in Connecticut , in the times when every farmer , who had grown a little richer than his neighbors , bought for help , ' a negro or two , lately from Guinea . Where slavery may fairly be regarded as being , what it was in Connecticut at the time referred to , a temporary blot upon the surface of society , rather than the controlling influence in the community for which society exists , it may be that the establishment of Christian institutions both of worship and of education , with their transforming and reorganizing influence , is the wisest of all measures for the removal of slavery . But where slavery is *vrought into the whole system of society , and laws , manners , morals , religion , are just what slavery makes them , the attempt to found educational institutions such as we are now speaking of , seems to us to be inconsistent with a wise economy . We see also that the society has under consideration , a plan to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female seminaries , and other institutions of a lower grade than colleges . The expediency of such an extension , it seems to us , must turn wholly on the extent of the resources , which may be reasonably expected to be at the control of the society . We think it evident enough that the life of our whole system of education , resides in our colleges , and if these are vigorously sustained on truly Protestant principles , that life must rapidly extend itself to the whole system . If so , to starve the colleges for the sake of aiding seminaries of a lower grade , would be like starving the stomach for the sake of fattening the limbs . But if the resources of the society are adequate , such an extension would seem exceedingly desirable . We submit to the serious consideration of all wise and patriotic men-what might not this society accomplish for the cause of education , by distributing a fund of fifty thousand dollars annually , in sums of five hundred dollars , to one hundred male and female academies , properly located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each institution so aided should , as a condition of receiving aid , furnish to its pupils certain facilities , or occupy some given grade of elevation ? In the present great intellectual and moral crisis of our country , is not this a mode of advancing the cause of Protestant education , which is at least worth considering ? With such an enlargement of its plans of operation , and with the necessary resources at its control , we declare our conviction , at whatever hazard of being thought enthusiastic or monomaniacs , that this society would be second , either in moral grandeur or in usefulness , to no scheme of benevolence hitherto devised in or for our country . It would be a grand organic effort of the principles of Protestantism , of civil and religious freedom , which must prove irresistible by any force that could be called to act against it , and which would be distinguished by nothing so much as the grandeur of its results compared with the simplicity of its machinery , and the smallness of its resources . We can not doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of the princely donations of the wealthy , and , what is not less desirable , the widow 's mite . We have now finished what we have to say directly of the plans and principles of the Society . There is however one objection to our argument , which we have all along foreseen , to which we wish to devote a little space , before we lake leave of our readers . We are danger of being accused of advoca. // ting a sectarian scheme of education , and as this is very far from our intention , we think it necessary to develop our meaning on this point a little more perfectly . We have all along spoken of Puritanism and Puritan principles , as the main spring of education in this country . What we mean by Puritan principles , we suppose we have sufficiently indicated ; in pointing out those principles which we regard as being the source of the whole educational movement of this country , from the landing of the Pilgrims to the present time . Indeed we maintain that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education ever can spring . One of them is the will of centralized government . Such a system is that of Prussia , where the people submit to receive such an education as the government gives them , just as they submit to such taxes and such military service as the government imposes . Such a system God grant our country may never have-such a system we never can have , till we cease to be a free people , and are ruled by a government , which is thoroughly centralized , and in the main absolute . Dark as the prospect sometimes appears , we trust that day is yet far distant . The only other possible source of a system of general education , is the all-pervading presence and influence of a religious faith , which hangs all the hopes and destinies of man for time and eternity on a sound and true knowledge of God , which fully recognizes the inalienable right of " private judgment , " and which relies on individual conviction as the grand conservative power of society . Of these principles it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In our own judgment , such is far from being the fact . We have called these principles Puritan , because in our honest judgment , they have never been so clearly stated , so fully declared , and so consistently acted out , as by the Puritans of England and their descendants in this country . And yet most heartily do we recognize the presence of their principles , not only in Presbyterianism and Congregationalism , but in a greater or less degree in most of the other Protestant communions of this country . Especially do we hail as an omen of good to the nation the rapid extension of them in that yearly increasing family of denominations , which are known under the generic name of Methodists , and which all trace their origin to the Wesleys . Indeed these principles lie down deep in the very foundations of Protestantism , and the time is rapidly coming , when all men must either adopt them and carry them out to all their logical and practical consequences , or take passage on some one of the numerous railroads , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome , all those men who , having put their hand to the plough of Protestantism and looked back , have thereby proved themselves unworthy of the glorious destiny to which she is hastening . Such timorous souls there will be of course , in an age like ours , resounding with moral conflict , and for our part we rejoice that there are railroads for their accommodation . In the words of the great Roman orator we say , " Quare , secedantimprobi , secernant se a bonis , unum in locum congregentur ; muro denique , id quod stepe jam dixi , secernantur a nobis : * * * sit denique inscriptum in fronte uniuscujusque civis , quid de republica sentiat . " God speed the day . While therefore we plead not guilty to the charge ofadvocatingasvs. tern of sectarian education , we have no squeamishness in maintaining , that a peculiar system of religious faith furnishes , we do not say the only desirable , but the only possible foundation , of an educational superstructure for a free people . A free people can have no system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneously from its own heartwhich is the natural product of its own life . And with our eyes open we can not but know , that large masses and communities of human beings , were never so quickened into intellectual and moral life as spontaneously to originate a system of general education , by any other electricity than that of the Gospel of Christ , as understood by the Puritans , and to a good degree , by all Protestants . We would gladly believe , if we could , that Romanism or Puseyism would educate a free people as well as Puritanism : but we can not believe it without giving the lie to history , and denying the fundamental laws both of mind and of society . In speaking as we have done in our previous remarks , we are occupying therefore no sectarian position . We are advocating education - universal education - the education of unnumbered millions of freemen  --  the organization of systems and institutions of edu cation , which shall he unfailing fountains of vital truth to a multitudinous free people , while grass grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the shapeless masses of unwrought materials , of which this mighty social edifice is to be constructed , ( the mightiest , we solemnly believe , ever reared on the soil of earth , ) we see , scattered through all this chaos , one element , which history tells us is the one only educator of freemen . As wise master-builders let us avail ourselves of that element , so indispensable to the strength , the symmetry , the durability of the whole edifice . We need , we must have results which that element alone can produce-we must have free general education , or our fate as a people is sealed , our days are numbered . Let us then be wise : let us place that element where it can act out its own nature , and exert its own proper power on all the forming mass . This is not to act as a sectarian , but as a xvise man and a true patriot.
