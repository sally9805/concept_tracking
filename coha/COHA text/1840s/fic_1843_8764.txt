What 's done we partly may compute , But know not what 's resisted . Burns . PREFACE . The subject of the following play is taken in part from the beautiul tale of Cervantes , La Gitanilla . To this source , however , I am indebted for the main incident only , the love of a Spanish student for a Gipsy girl , and the name of the heroine , Preciosa . I have not followed the story in any of its details . In Spain this subject has been twice handled dramatically ; first by Juan Perez de Montalvan , in La Gitanilla , and afterwards by Antonio de Sols y Rivadeneira in La Gitanilla de Madrid . The same subject has also been made use of by Thomas Middleton , an English dramatist of the seventeenth century . His play is called The Spanish Gipsy . The main plot is the same as in the Spanish pieces ; but there runs through it a tragic underplot of the loves of Rodrigo and Doa Clara , which is taken from another tale of Cervantes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted with La Gitanilla of Cervantes , and the plays of Montalvan , Sols , and Middleton , will perceive that my treatment of the subject differs entirely from theirs .

Count of Lara You were not at the play to-night , Don Carlos ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had engagements elsewhere . Pray who was there ? LARA . Count of Lara Why , all the town and court . The house was crowded ; and the busy fans Among the gayly dressed and perfumed ladies Fluttered like butterflies among the flowers . There was the Countess of Medina Celi ; The Goblin Lady with her Phantom Lover , Her Lindo Don Diego ; Doa Sol , And Doa Serafina , and her cousins . DON CARLOS . Don Carlos What was the play ? LARA . Count of Lara It was a dull affair ; One of those comedies in which you see , As Lope says , End note 1 : 1Kb the history of the world Brought down from Genesis to the Day of Judgment . There were three duels fought in the first act , Three gentlemen receiving deadly wounds , Laying their hands upon their hearts , and saying , " O , I am dead ! " a lover in a closet , An old hidalgo , and a gay Don Juan , A Doa Inez with a black mantilla , Followed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows she is not ! DON CARLOS . Don Carlos Of course , the Preciosa danced to-night ? LARA . Count of Lara And never better . Every footstep fell As lightly as a sunbeam on the water . I think the girl extremely beautiful . DON CARLOS . Don Carlos Almost beyond the privilege of woman ! I saw her in the Prado yesterday . Her step was royal ,  --  queen-like ,  --  and her face As beauteous as a saint 's in Paradise . LARA . Count of Lara May not a saint fall from her Paradise , And be no more a saint ? DON CARLOS . Don Carlos Why do you ask ? LARA . Count of Lara Because I have heard it said this angel fell , And , though she is a virgin outwardly , Within she is a sinner ; like those panels Of doors and altar-pieces the old monks Painted in convents , with the Virgin Mary On the outside , and on the inside Venus ! DON CARLOS . Don Carlos You do her wrong ; indeed , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair . LARA . Count of Lara How credulous you are ! Why look you , friend , There 's not a virtuous woman in Madrid , In this whole city ! And would you persuade me That a mere dancing-girl , who shows herself , Nightly , half-naked , on the stage , for money , And with voluptuous motions fires the blood Of inconsiderate youth , is to be held A model for her virtue ? DON CARLOS . Don Carlos You forget She is a Gipsy girl . LARA . Count of Lara And therefore won The easier . DON CARLOS . Don Carlos Nay , not to be won at all ! The only virtue that a Gipsy prizes Is chastity . That is her only virtue . Dearer than life she holds it . I remember A Gipsy woman , a vile , shameless bawd , Whose craft was to betray the young and fair ; And yet this woman was above all bribes . And when a noble lord , touched by her beauty , The wild and wizard beauty of her race , Offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned upon him , with a look of scorn , And smote him in the face ! LARA . Count of Lara And does that prove That Preciosa is above suspicion ? DON CARLOS . Don Carlos It proves a nobleman may be repulsed When he thinks conquest easy . I believe That woman , in her deepest degradation , Holds something sacred , something undefiled , Some pledge and keepsake of her higher nature , And , like the diamond in the dark , retains Some quenchless gleam of the celestial light ! LARA . Count of Lara Yet Preciosa would have taken the gold . DON CARLOS Don Carlos ( rising ) I do not think so . LARA . Count of Lara I am sure of it . But why this haste ? Stay yet a little longer , And fight the battles of your Dulcinea . DON CARLOS . Don Carlos ' T is late . I must begone , for if I stay You will not be persuaded . LARA . Count of Lara Yes ; persuade me . DON CARLOS . Don Carlos No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Count of Lara No one so blind as he who will not see ! DON CARLOS . Don Carlos And so good night . I wish you pleasant dreams , And greater faith in woman . Exit . LARA . Count of Lara Greater faith ! I have the greatest faith ; for I believe Victorian is her lover . I believe That I shall be to-morrow ; and thereafter Another , and another , and another , Chasing each other through her zodiac , As Taurus chases Aries . ( Enter Francisco with a casket . ) Well , Francisco , What speed with Preciosa ? FRANCISCO . Francisco None , my lord . She sends your jewels back , and bids me tell you She is not to be purchased by your gold . LARA . Count of Lara Then I will try some other way to win her . Pray , dost thou know Victorian ? FRANCISCO . Francisco Yes , my lord ; I saw him at the jeweller 's to-day . LARA . Count of Lara What was he doing there ? FRANCISCO . Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruby in it . LARA . Count of Lara Was there another like it ? FRANCISCO . Francisco One so like it I could not choose between them . LARA . Count of Lara It is well . To-morrow morning bring that ring to me . Do not forget . Now light me to my bed . Exeunt . SCENE II . A street in Madrid . Enter Chispa , followed by musicians , with a bagpipe , guitars , and other instruments . CHISPA . Chispa Abernuncio Satanas ! End note 2 : 1Kb and a plague on all lovers who ramble about at night , drinking the elements , instead of sleeping quietly in their beds . Every dead man to his cemetery , say I ; and every friar to his monastery . Now , here 's my master , Victorian , yesterday a cow-keeper , and to-day a gentleman ; yesterday a student , and today a lover ; and I must be up later than the nightingale , for as the abbot sings so must the sacristan respond . God grant he may soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ay , marry ! marry ! marry ! Mother , what does marry mean ? It means to spin , to bear children , and to weep , my daughter ! And , of a truth , there is something more in matrimony than the wedding-ring . ( To the musicians . ) And now , gentlemen , Pax vobiscum ! as the ass said to the cabbages . Pray , walk this way ; and do n't hang down your heads . It is no disgrace to have an old father and a ragged shirt . Now , look you , you are gentlemen who lead the life of crickets ; you enjoy hunger by day and noise by night . Yet , I beseech you , for this once be not loud , but pathetic ; for it is a serenade to a damsel in bed , and not to the Man in the Moon . Your object is not to arouse and terrify , but to soothe and bring lulling dreams . Therefore , each shall not play upon his instrument as if it were the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain modesty , according with the others . Pray , how may I call thy name , friend ? FIRST MUSICIAN . First Musician Gernimo Gil , at your service . CHISPA . Chispa Every tub smells of the wine that is in it . Pray , Gernimo , is not Saturday an unpleasant day with thee ? FIRST MUSICIAN . First Musician Why so ? CHISPA . Chispa Because I have heard it said that Saturday is an unpleasant day with those who have but one shirt . Moreover , I have seen thee at the tavern , and if thou canst run as fast as thou canst drink , I should like to hunt hares with thee . What instrument is that ? FIRST MUSICIAN . First Musician An Aragonese bagpipe . CHISPA . Chispa Pray , art thou related to the bagpiper of Bujalance , who asked a maraved for playing , and ten for leaving off ? FIRST MUSICIAN . First Musician No , your honor . CHISPA . Chispa I am glad of it . What other instruments have we ? SECOND AND THIRD MUSICIANS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHISPA . Chispa A pleasing instrument . And thou ? FOURTH MUSICIAN . Fourth Musician The fife . CHISPA . Chispa I like it ; it has a cheerful , soul-stirring sound , that soars up to my lady 's window like the song of a swallow . And you others ? OTHER MUSICIANS . Musicians We are the singers , please your honor . CHISPA . Chispa You are too many . Do you think , we are going to sing mass in the cathedral of Crdova ? Four men can make but little use of one shoe , and I see not how you can all sing in one song . But follow me along the garden wall . That is the way my master climbs to the lady 's window . It is by the Vicar 's skirts that the devil climbs into the belfry . Come , follow me , and make no noise . Exeunt . SCENE III . Preciosa 's chamber . She stands at the open window . PRECIOSA . Preciosa How slowly through the lilac-scented air Descends the tranquil moon ! Like thistle-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetly from yon hollow vaults of shade The nightingales breathe out their souls in song . And hark ! what songs of love , what soul-like sounds , Answer them from below ! SERENADE . Stars of the summer night ! Far in yon azure deeps , Hide , hide your golden light ! She sleeps ! My lady sleeps ! Sleeps ! Moon of the summer night ! Far down yon western steeps , Sink , sink in silver light ! She sleeps ! My lady sleeps ! Sleeps ! Wind of the summer night ! Where yonder woodbine creeps , Fold , fold thy pinions light ! She sleeps ! My lady sleeps ! Sleeps ! Dreams of the summer night ! Tell her , her lover keeps Watch ! while in slumbers light She sleeps ! My lady sleeps ! Sleeps ! ( Enter Victorian by the balcony . ) VICTORIAN . Victorian Poor , little dove ! Thou tremblest like a leaf ! PRECIOSA . Preciosa I am so frightened ! ' T is for thee I tremble ! I hate to have thee climb that wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Victorian None , my love , but thou . PRECIOSA . Preciosa ' T is very dangerous ; and when thou art gone I chide myself for letting thee come here Thus stealthily by night . Where hast thou been ? Since yesterday I have no news from thee . VICTORIAN . Victorian Since yesterday I 've been in Alcal . Ere long the time will come , sweet Preciosa , When that dull distance shall no more divide us ; And I no more shall scale thy wall by night To steal a kiss from thee , as I do now . PRECIOSA . Preciosa An honest thief , to steal but what thou givest . VICTORIAN . Victorian And we shall sit together unmolested , And words of true love pass from tongue to tongue , As singing birds from one bough to another . PRECIOSA . Preciosa That were a life indeed to make time envious ! I knew that thou wouldst visit me to-night . I saw thee at the play . VICTORIAN . Victorian Sweet child of air ! Never did I behold thee so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou done to make thee look so fair ? PRECIOSA . Preciosa Am I not always fair ? VICTORIAN . Victorian Ay , and so fair That I am jealous of all eyes that see thee , And wish that they were blind . PRECIOSA . Preciosa I heed them not ; When thou art present , I see none but thee ! VICTORIAN . Victorian There 's nothing fair nor beautiful , but takes Something from thee , that makes it beautiful . PRECIOSA . Preciosa And yet thou leavest me for those dusty books . VICTORIAN . Victorian Thou comest between me and those books too often ! I see thy face in every thing I see ! The paintings in the chapel wear thy looks , The canticles are changed to sarabands , And with the learned doctors of the schools I see thee dance cachuchas . PRECIOSA . Preciosa In good sooth , I dance with learned doctors of the schools To-morrow morning . VICTORIAN . Victorian And with whom , I pray ? PRECIOSA . Preciosa A grave and reverend Cardinal , and his Grace The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is this ? PRECIOSA . Preciosa It is no jest ; indeed it is not . VICTORIAN . Victorian Prithee , explain thyself . PRECIOSA . Preciosa Why , simply thus . Thou knowest the Pope has sent here into Spain To put a stop to dances on the stage . VICTORIAN . Victorian I have heard it whispered . PRECIOSA . Preciosa Now the Cardinal , Who for this purpose comes , would fain behold With his own eyes these dances ; and the Archbishop Has sent for me  --  VICTORIAN . Victorian That thou may'st dance before them ! Now viva la cachucha ! It will breathe The fire of youth into these gray old men ! ' T will be thy proudest conquest ! PRECIOSA . Preciosa Saving one . And yet I fear these dances will be stopped , And Preciosa be once more a beggar . VICTORIAN . Victorian The sweetest beggar that e'er asked for alms ; With such beseeching eyes , that when I saw thee I gave my heart away ! PRECIOSA . Preciosa Dost thou remember When first we met ? VICTORIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden . Thou wast sitting Under the orange trees , beside a fountain . PRECIOSA . Preciosa ' T was Easter-Sunday . The full-blossomed trees Filled all the air with fragrance and with joy . The priests were singing , and the organ sounded , And then anon the great cathedral bell . It was the elevation of the Host . We both of us fell down upon our knees , Under the orange boughs , and prayed together . I never had been happy till that moment . VICTORIAN . Victorian Thou blessed angel ! PRECIOSA . Preciosa And when thou wast gone I felt an aching here . I did not speak To any one that day . But from that day Bartolom grew hateful unto me . VICTORIAN . Victorian Remember him no more . Let not his shadow Come between thee and me . Sweet Preciosa ! I loved thee even then , though I was silent ! PRECIOSA . Preciosa I thought I ne'er should see thy face again . Thy farewell had a sound of sorrow in it . VICTORIAN . Victorian That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than silence is , and yet a sound . Hands of invisible spirits touch the strings Of that mysterious instrument , the soul , And play the prelude of our fate . We hear The voice prophetic , and are not alone . PRECIOSA . Preciosa That is my faith . Dost thou believe these warnings ? VICTORIAN . Victorian So far as this . Our feelings and our thoughts Tend ever on , and rest not in the Present . As drops of rain fall into some dark well , And from below comes a scarce audible sound , So fall our thoughts into the dark Hereafter , And their mysterious echo reaches us . PRECIOSA . Preciosa I have felt it so , but found no words to say it ! I can not reason ; I can only feel ! But thou hast language for all thoughts and feelings . Thou art a scholar ; and sometimes I think We can not walk together in this world ! The distance that divides us is too great ! Henceforth thy pathway lies among the stars ; I must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Dost thou still doubt ? What I most prize in woman Is her affections , not her intellect ! The intellect is finite ; but the affections Are infinite , and can not be exhausted . Compare me with the great men of the earth ; What am I ? Why , a pigmy among giants ! But if thou lovest ,  --  mark me ! I say lovest , The greatest of thy sex excels thee not ! The world of the affections is thy world , Not that of man 's ambition . In that stillness Which most becomes a woman , calm and holy , Thou sittest by the fireside of the heart , Feeding its flame . The element of fire Is pure . It can not change nor hide its nature , But burns as brightly in a Gipsy camp As in a palace hall . Art thou convinced ? PRECIOSA . Preciosa Yes , that I love thee , as the good love heaven ; But not that I am worthy of that heaven . How shall I more deserve it ? VICTORIAN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love thee more ; my heart is full . VICTORIAN . Victorian Then let it overflow , and I will drink it , As in the summer-time the thirsty sands Drink the swift waters of a mountain torrent , And still do thirst for more . A WATCHMAN Watchman ( in the street ) . Ave Maria Purissima ! ' T is midnight and serene ! VICTORIAN . Victorian Hear'st thou that cry ? PRECIOSA . Preciosa It is a hateful sound , To scare thee from me ! VICTORIAN . Victorian As the hunter 's horn Doth scare the timid stag , or bark of hounds The moor-fowl from his mate . PRECIOSA . Preciosa Pray , do not go ! VICTORIAN . Victorian I must away to Alcal to-night . Think of me when I am away . PRECIOSA . Preciosa Fear not ! I have no thoughts that do not think of thee .

PRECIOSA Preciosa ( laying her hand upon his mouth ) . Hush ! Hush ! Good night ! and may all holy angels guard thee ! VICTORIAN . Victorian Good night ! good night ! Thou art my guardian angel ! I have no other saint than thou to pray to ! ( He descends by the balcony ) . PRECIOSA . Preciosa Take care , and do not hurt thee . Art thou safe ? VICTORIAN Victorian ( from the garden ) .

We have stopped a moment to breathe our horses ; and , if he chooses to walk up and down in the open air , looking into the sky as one who hears it rain , that does not satisfy my hunger , you know . But be quick , for I am in a hurry , and every man stretches his legs according to the length of his coverlet . What have we here ? BALTASAR Baltasar ( setting a light on the table ) . Stewed rabbit . CHISPA Chispa ( eating ) . Conscience of Portalegre ! Stewed kitten , you mean ! BALTASAR . Baltasar And a pitcher of Pedro Ximenes , with a roasted pear in it .

BALTASAR . Baltasar Ha ! ha ! ha ! CHISPA . Chispa And more noise than nuts . BALTASAR . Baltasar Ha ! ha ! ha ! You must have your joke , Master Chispa . But shall I not ask Don Victorian in , to take a draught of the Pedro Ximenes ? CHISPA . Chispa No ; you might as well say , " Don't-you-want-some ? " to a dead man . BALTASAR . Baltasar Why does he go so often to Madrid ? CHISPA . Chispa For the same reason that he eats no supper . He is in love . Were you ever in love , Baltasar ? BALTASAR .

He awakes slowly . HYPOLITO . Hypolito I must have been asleep ! ay , sound asleep ! And it was all a dream . O sleep , sweet sleep ! Whatever form thou takest , thou art fair , Holding unto our lips thy goblet filled Out of Oblivion 's well , a healing draught ! The candles have burned low ; it must be late .

Hypolito But in truth Thou wilt not marry her . VICTORIAN . Victorian In truth I will . The angels sang in heaven when she was born ! She is a precious jewel I have found Among the filth and rubbish of the world . I 'll stoop for it ; but when I wear it here , Set on my forehead like the morning star , The world may wonder , but it will not laugh . HYPOLITO . Hypolito If thou wear'st nothing else upon thy forehead , ' T will be indeed a wonder . VICTORIAN . Victorian Out upon thee , With thy unseasonable jests !

HYPOLITO . Hypolito And wouldst thou venture ? VICTORIAN . Victorian Ay , indeed I would ! HYPOLITO . Hypolito Thou art courageous . Hast thou e'er reflected How much lies hidden in that one word , now ? VICTORIAN . Victorian Yes ; all the awful mystery of Life !

Hypolito Ay , there it is ! and , if I were in love , That is the very point I most should dread . This magic glass , these magic spells of thine , Might tell a tale were better left untold . For instance , they might show us thy fair cousin , The Lady Violante , bathed in tears Of love and anger , like the maid of Colchis , Whom thou , another faithless Argonaut , Having won that golden fleece , a woman 's love , Desertest for this Glauc .

VICTORIAN . Victorian Good night ! But not to bed ; for I must read awhile . ( Throws himself into the arm-chair which Hypolito has left , and lays a large book open upon his knees . ) Must read , or sit in reverie and watch The changing color of the waves that break Upon the idle seashore of the mind ! Visions of Fame ! that once did visit me , Making night glorious with your smile , where are ye ? O , who shall give me , now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom Upon Olympus , making us immortal ? Or teach me where that wondrous mandrake grows Whose magic root , torn from the earth with groans , At midnight hour , can scare the fiends away , And make the mind prolific in its fancies ? I have the wish , but want the will , to act ! Souls of great men departed ! Ye whose words Have come to light from the swift river of Time , Like Roman swords found in the Tagus ' bed , Where is the strength to wield the arms ye bore ? From the barred visor of Antiquity Reflected shines the eternal light of Truth , As from a mirror ! All the means of action  --  The shapeless masses  --  the materials  --  Lie everywhere about us . What we need Is the celestial fire to change the flint Into transparent crystal , bright and clear . That fire is genius ! The rude peasant sits At evening in his smoky cot , and draws With charcoal uncouth figures on the wall . The son of genius comes , foot-sore with travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He takes the charcoal from the peasant 's hand , And , by the magic of his touch at once Transfigured , all its hidden virtues shine , And , in the eyes of the astonished clown , It gleams a diamond ! Even thus transformed , Rude popular traditions and old tales Shine as immortal poems , at the touch Of some poor , houseless , homeless , wandering bard , Who had but a night 's lodging for his pains . But there are brighter dreams than those of Fame , Which are the dreams of Love ! Out of the heart Rises the bright ideal of these dreams , As from some woodland fount a spirit rises And sinks again into its silent deeps , Ere the enamored knight can touch her robe ! ' T is this ideal that the soul of man , Like the enamored knight beside the fountain , Waits for upon the margin of Life 's stream ; Waits to behold her rise from the dark waters , Clad in a mortal shape ! Alas ! how many Must wait in vain ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no spirit rises ! Yet I , born under a propitious star , Have found the bright ideal of my dreams . Yes ! she is ever with me . I can feel , Here , as I sit at midnight and alone , Her gentle breathing ! on my breast can feel The pressure of her head ! God 's benison Rest ever on it ! Close those beauteous eyes , Sweet Sleep ! and all the flowers that bloom at night With balmy lips breathe in her ears my name ! ( Gradually sinks asleep . ) ACT II . SCENE I. Preciosa 's chamber . Morning . Preciosa and Angelica . PRECIOSA . Preciosa Why will you go so soon ? Stay yet awhile . The poor too often turn away unheard From hearts that shut against them with a sound That will be heard in heaven . Pray , tell me more Of your adversities . Keep nothing from me .

Would I were with them ! HYPOLITO . Hypolito We shall all be soon . VICTORIAN . Victorian It can not be too soon ; for I am weary Of the bewildering masquerade of Life , Where strangers walk as friends , and friends as strangers ; Where whispers overheard betray false hearts ; And through the mazes of the crowd we chase Some form of loveliness , that smiles , and beckons , And cheats us with fair words , only to leave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  Not knowing friend from foe .

Victorian I never loved a maid ; For she I loved was then a maid no more . PRECIOSA . Preciosa How know you that ? VICTORIAN . Victorian A little bird in the air Whispered the secret . PRECIOSA . Preciosa There , take back your gold ! Your hand is cold , like a deceiver 's hand ! There is no blessing in its charity ! Make her your wife , for you have been abused ; And you shall mend your fortunes , mending hers . VICTORIAN Victorian ( aside ) .

( Tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; never from my hand Shall that be taken ! VICTORIAN . Victorian Why , ' t is but a ring . I 'll give it back to you ; or , if I keep it , Will give you gold to buy you twenty such . PRECIOSA . Preciosa Why would you have this ring ? VICTORIAN . Victorian A traveller 's fancy , A whim , and nothing more . I would fain keep it As a memento of the Gipsy camp In Guadarrama , and the fortune-teller Who sent me back to wed a widowed maid . Pray , let me have the ring . PRECIOSA . Preciosa No , never ! never ! I will not part with it , even when I die ; But bid my nurse fold my pale fingers thus , That it may not fall from them . ' T is a token Of a beloved friend , who is no more . VICTORIAN . Victorian How ? Dead ? PRECIOSA . Preciosa Yes ; dead to me ; and worse than dead . He is estranged !

VICTORIAN . Victorian Not dare ? Look in my face , and say if there is aught I have not dared , I would not dare for thee ! ( She rushes into his arms . ) PRECIOSA . Preciosa ' T is thou !

Preciosa I should have perished here among these Gipsies . VICTORIAN . Victorian Forgive me , sweet ! for what I made thee suffer . Think'st thou this heart could feel a moment 's joy , Thou being absent ? O , believe it not ! Indeed , since that sad hour I have not slept , For thinking of the wrong I did to thee ! Dost thou forgive me ? Say , wilt thou forgive me ? PRECIOSA . Preciosa I have forgiven thee . Ere those words of anger Were in the book of Heaven writ down against thee , I had forgiven thee . VICTORIAN . Victorian I 'm the veriest fool That walks the earth , to have believed thee false . It was the Count of Lara  --  PRECIOSA . Preciosa That bad man Has worked me harm enough . Hast thou not heard  --  VICTORIAN . Victorian I have heard all . And yet speak on , speak on ! Let me but hear thy voice , and I am happy ; For every tone , like some sweet incantation , Calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my beloved , speak into my heart , Whatever fills and agitates thine own . ( They walk aside . ) HYPOLITO . Hypolito All gentle quarrels in the pastoral poets , All passionate love scenes in the best romances , All chaste embraces on the public stage , All soft adventures , which the liberal stars Have winked at , as the natural course of things , Have been surpassed here by my friend , the student , And this sweet Gipsy lass , fair Preciosa ! PRECIOSA . Preciosa Seor Hypolito ! I kiss your hand . Pray , shall I tell your fortune ? HYPOLITO . Hypolito Not to-night ; For , should you treat me as you did Victorian , And send me back to marry maids forlorn , My wedding day would last from now till Christmas . CHISPA Chispa ( within ) . What ho ! the Gipsies , ho ! Beltran Cruzado ! Halloo ! halloo ! halloo ! halloo ! ( Enters booted , with a whip and lantern . ) VICTORIAN . Victorian What now ?

Victorian Strange as a Moorish tale ! CHISPA . Chispa And we have all Been drinking at the tavern to your health , As wells drink in November , when it rains . VICTORIAN . Victorian Where is the gentleman ? CHISPA . Chispa As the old song says , His body is in Segovia , His soul is in Madrid . PRECIOSA . Preciosa Is this a dream ? O , if it be a dream , Let me sleep on , and do not wake me yet ! Repeat thy story ! Say I 'm not deceived ! Say that I do not dream ! I am awake ; This is the Gipsy camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hypolito ! Speak ! speak ! Let me not wake and find it all a dream ! VICTORIAN . Victorian It is a dream , sweet child ! a waking dream , A blissful certainty , a vision bright Of that rare happiness , which even on earth Heaven gives to those it loves . Now art thou rich , As thou wast ever beautiful and good ; And I am now the beggar . PRECIOSA Preciosa ( giving him her hand ) . I have still A hand to give . CHISPA Chispa ( aside ) . And I have two to take . I 've heard my grandmother say , that Heaven gives almonds To those who have no teeth . That 's nuts to crack . I 've teeth to spare , but where shall I find almonds ? VICTORIAN . Victorian What more of this strange story ? CHISPA . Chispa Nothing more . Your friend , Don Carlos , is now at the village Showing to Pedro Crespo , the Alcalde , The proofs of what I tell you . The old hag , Who stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll hang her for the crime , To make the celebration more complete . VICTORIAN . Victorian No ; let it be a day of general joy ; Fortune comes well to all , that comes not late . Now let us join Don Carlos . HYPOLITO . Hypolito So farewell , The student 's wandering life ! Sweet serenades , Sung under ladies ' windows in the night , And all that makes vacation beautiful ! To you , ye cloistered shades of Alcal , To you , ye radiant visions of romance , Written in books , but here surpassed by truth , The Bachelor Hypolito returns , And leaves the Gipsy with the Spanish Student . SCENE VI . A pass in the Guadarrama mountains . Early morning . A muleteer Muleteer crosses the stage , sitting sideways on his mule , and lighting a paper cigar with flint and steel . SONG . If thou art sleeping , maiden , End note 18 : 1Kb Awake and open thy door , ' T is the break of day , and we must away , O'er meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find thy slippers , But come with thy naked feet ; We shall have to pass through the dewy grass , And waters wide and fleet . ( Disappears down the pass . Enter a Monk . A Shepherd appears on the rocks above . ) MONK . Monk Ave Maria , gratia plena . Ol ! good man ! SHEPHERD . Shepherd Ol ! MONK . Monk Is this the road to Segovia ? SHEPHERD . Shepherd It is , your reverence . MONK . Monk How far is it ? SHEPHERD . Shepherd I do not know . MONK . Monk What is that yonder in the valley ? SHEPHERD . Shepherd San Ildefonso . MONK . Monk A long way to breakfast . SHEPHERD . Shepherd Ay , marry . MONK . Monk Are there robbers in these mountains ? SHEPHERD . Shepherd Yes , and worse than that . MONK . Monk What ? SHEPHERD . Shepherd Wolves . MONK . Monk Santa Maria ! Come with me to San Ildefonso , and thou shalt be well rewarded . SHEPHERD . Shepherd What wilt thou give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( They disappear . A mounted Contrabandista Contrabandista passes , wrapped in his cloak , and a gun at his saddle-bow . He goes down the pass singing . ) SONG . Worn with speed is my caballo , And I march me hurried , worried ; Onward , caballito mio , With the white star in thy forehead ! Onward , for here comes the Ronda , And I hear their rifles crack ! Ay , jalo ! Ay , ay , jalo ! Ay , jalo ! They cross our track . ( Song dies away . Enter Preciosa , on horseback , attended by Victorian , Hypolito , Don Carlos , and Chispa , on foot , and armed . ) VICTORIAN . Victorian This is the highest point . Here let us rest . See , Preciosa , see how all about us Kneeling , like hooded friars , the misty mountains Receive the benediction of the sun ! O glorious sight ! PRECIOSA . Preciosa Most beautiful indeed ! HYPOLITO . Hypolito Most wonderful ! VICTORIAN . Victorian And in the vale below , Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its noisy belfries , Sends up a salutation to the morn , As if an army smote their brazen shields , And shouted victory ! PRECIOSA . Preciosa And which way lies Segovia ? VICTORIAN . Victorian At a great distance yonder . Dost thou not see it ? PRECIOSA . Preciosa No . I do not see it . VICTORIAN . Victorian The merest flaw that dents the horizon 's edge . There , yonder ! HYPOLITO . Hypolito ' T is a notable old town , Boasting an ancient Roman aqueduct , And an Alczar , builded by the Moors , Wherein , you may remember , poor Gil Blas Was fed on Pan del Rey . O , many a time Out of its grated windows have I looked Hundreds of feet plumb down to the Eresma , That , like a serpent through the valley creeping , Glides at its foot . PRECIOSA . Preciosa O , yes ! I see it now , Yet rather with my heart , than with mine eyes , So faint it is . And , all my thoughts sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged Against all stress of accident , as , in The Eastern Tale , against the wind and tide , Great ships were drawn to the Magnetic Mountains , And there were wrecked , and perished in the sea ! ( She weeps . ) VICTORIAN . Victorian O gentle spirit ! Thou didst bear unmoved Blasts of adversity and frosts of fate ! But the first ray of sunshine that falls on thee Melts thee to tears ! O , let thy weary heart Lean upon mine ! and it shall faint no more , Nor thirst , nor hunger ; but be comforted And filled with my affection . PRECIOSA . Preciosa Stay no longer ! My father waits . Methinks I see him there , Now looking from the window , and now watching Each sound of wheels or foot-fall in the street , And saying , " Hark ! she comes ! " O father ! father ! ( They descend the pass . Chispa remains behind . ) CHISPA . Chispa I have a father , too , but he is a dead one . Alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I remain . I neither win nor lose . Thus I wag through the world , half the time on foot , and the other half walking ; and always as merry as a thunder-storm in the night . And so we plough along , as the fly said to the ox . Who knows what may happen ? Patience , and shuffle the cards ! I am not yet so bald , that you can see my brains ; and perhaps , after all , I shall some day go to Rome , and come back Saint Peter . Benedicite ! Exit . ( A pause . Then enter Bartolom wildly , as if in pursuit , with a carbine in his hand . ) BARTOLOM . Bartolom Roman They passed this way ! I hear their horses ' hoofs ! Yonder I see them ! Come , sweet caramillo , This serenade shall be the Gipsy 's last ! ( Fires down the pass . ) Ha ! ha ! Well whistled , my sweet caramillo ! Well whistled !  --  I have missed her !  --  O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bartolom falls. )
