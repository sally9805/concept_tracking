AUTHOR 'S PREFACE . I can not but feel sensible how much this little comedy owes , for its success , to the admirable acting it has drawn forth . It has had the good fortune to present Mr. Charles Kemble in that line in which he is the peculiar delight of the public , and in which he stands unrivalled . Mr. Jones , Mr. Duruset , and Mrs. Faucit , are likewise entitled to my warmest thanks for the talent which they have exerted on the occasion . If I make separate mention of Mr. Fawcett and Miss M. Tree , it is because I have had no previous opportunity of acknowledging their merits in another piece of mine , the opera of Clari ; and I take this occasion to express my high and grateful sense of their excellence in both . The part of Captain Copp , in the hands of Mr. Fawcett , is one of those rich and racy pieces of acting , that can only be furnished by the veteran artist in whom vigorous original talent has been refined and mellowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of youthful days , with the generous flavor of maturer age . I may speak almost impartially on this subject , for , in fact , Mr. Fawcett has made the character his own by his inimitable acting . If I say that Miss M. Tree , as Mary , frequently equals the best points of Mademoiselle Mars in the French original , she will not think I undervalue her genius by a comparison with the finest comic actress in existence . Of her Clari , I can but re-echo the admiration already bestowed upon it throughout the kingdom . I understand that the authorship of this comedy has been claimed by different persons in the public papers , on the ground of their having produced translations of the French original , which have been performed at the minor theatres . In reply to this I would observe , that I have never seen any of those translations . My play was written last autumn at Paris . It was founded on a printed copy of " La Jeunessc de Henry V. , " of which a number of editions have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the dialogue differs essentially throughout , especially in the part of Captain Copp . I am not aware that the circumstance of one person 's having translated a foreign play for any individual theatre , gives him an exclusive property in the original play . I believe foreign plays are considered open to any one , to alter and adapt according to his taste and ability ; and , after all , the honour of a translation or adaptation is a matter very little worth contending for . But , while I totally disclaim all benefits from contemporary translutions , I must advert to material advantages which I have received from other sources , and I regret that I am restrained from acknowledging them except in general terms . My manuscript had been revised by a literary friend , to whom I am indebted for invaluable touches ; and the Songs were supplied , during my absence , by , as I am informed , " a very amiable and accomplished young lady , " whose concealment of her namo shows that her modesty is equal to her merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EDITORIAL INTRODUCTION . This is the production of an American dramatist , Mr. Pavne , author of " Brutus . " As will be seen from his preface , it is borrowed from the French , and was originally brought out in London as far back as 1824 . It keeps possession of the stage as a favorite after-piece , and is frequently played . The character of Captain Copp , which is original with Mr. Payne , is skilfully drawn ; and the historical traits of Charles and Rochester appear to be pretty faithfully preserved . Of course these last are neither very exemplary nor agreeable personages ; although there are too many to be found , who resemble them , in the haunts of fashionable dissipation . The incident of the watch , on which the plot principally turns , is said to be true ; but this is rather traditional than historical . The comedy forms a light , gay , dashing little afterpiece ; and , without conveying any very pointed moral , it keeps the attention pleasantly awake . Mr. Charles Kemble , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inimitably successful . The piece was originally dedicated to him in the following terms : TO CHARLES KEMBLE , AS A SLIGHT TESTIMONIAL OF GRATEFUL FRIENDSHIP , AND SINCERE ADMIRATION OF HIS TALENT , THIS TRIFLE IS INSCRIBED BY JOHN HOWARD PAYNE .

Lady Clara Yes , my lord , her majesty will have it , that you are the chief cause of the king 's irregularities . Roch . Rochester Oh , I 'll warrant it : and of his not loving her , too  --  is it not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , in truth , my lord , your continual jests on the married state  --  Roch . Rochester Heaven bless it ! Lady C. Lady Clara Your continual ridicule of married men  --  Roch . Rochester Heaven help them ! Lady C. Lady Clara Your licentious example , and still more licentious poetry  --  Roch . Rochester What 's coming next ? Lady C. Lady Clara All these , I say , make you the most dangerous of men . Roch . Rochester Dangerous ! My dear Lady Clara , you make me vain . Lady C. Lady Clara It is well known that you are the king 's prime companion in all his excesses . Roch . Rochester What , is my loyalty to be made my reproach ? Must I not stand by my monarch in all his moods ? Would you have me weep , when my sovereign laughs ? Would you have me whine , when my sovereign calls for a jolly song ! No , no , my lady , that might have done in the days of the Roundheads ; but times are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us  --  A merry monarch makes a merry court  --  so God save the jovial king , and send him boon companions . Lady C. Lady Clara Laughing . I see it is in vain to reason with you . Roch . Rochester Then give over the attempt . Let us talk of something of a nearer and a dearer interest  --  of your merits and my most ardent flame . Lady C. Lady Clara Ah , me ! I fear , like many other of your flames , it will but end in smoke . You talk of being desperately in love : what proof have you ever given ? Roch . Rochester What proof ? Am I not ready to give the greatest proof a man can offer  --  to lay down this sweet bachelor life , and commit matrimony for your sake ? Lady C. Lady Clara Well , this last , I must say , coming from a Rochester , is a most convincing proof . I have heard you out , listen now to me . Rochester bows . If , by your ascendancy over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bring him back to reason  --  Roch . Rochester Your ladyship forgets one of my talents Lady C. Lady Clara Which is it ? Roch . Rochester That of getting myself banished two or three times a year . Lady C. Lady Clara And if the woman you profess to love should offer to partake your exile ?  --  Roch . Rochester I am a lost man  --  I surrender . That last shot reached my heart . Lady C. Lady Clara Sighing . Ah , my lord  --  if that heart were only worth your head ! Well , is it agreed ? Roch . Rochester It is your will  --  I undertake the sacrifice  --  but , madam , bear in mind my recompense . Lady C. Lady Clara You may hope for everything . Adieu , my lord . I now begin to believe in your passion , since you are willing to make a sacrifice to it , even of your follies . Exit , R. Roch . Rochester Alone . A pretty task I have undertaken , truly ! I  --  Rochester  --  become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work upon ! Charles , who glories in all kinds of rambling frolics ! True , he has had none but pleasant adventures as yet . If I should trick him into some ridiculous dilemma ? My whole life has been a tissue of follies , and I am called a man of wit . I am now to attempt a rational act , and I shall be called a madman ! Well , be it so  --  matrimony will be sure to bring me to my senses . Enter Edward , languidly , R. Ah ! here comes my young protg  --  How downcast he seems ! How now , Edward , what 's the matter with you , boy ? Edw . Edward Sighing . Nothing , my lord . Roch . Rochester Good heaven , what a sigh to heave up nothing with ! Tell me the truth this instant . Hast thou dared to fall in love ? Edw . Edward I hope , my lord , there is no harm in indulging an honest attachment . Roch . Rochester An honest attachment ! A young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings in the sunshine of beauty , to talk of an honest attachment . Why , thou silly boy , is this the fruit of all the lessons I have given thee ? Edw . Edward Did not your lordship tell me , that one of the first duties of a page was to be zealous in his devotion to the fair ? Roch . Rochester Yes ; but I told thee to skim over the surface of beauty , just dipping your wings , like a swallow , not plumping in like a goose  --  I told you to hover from flower to flower like a butterfly , not to bury yourself in one like a bee . An honest attachment ! What a plebeian phrase ! There 's a wife and seven children in the very sound of it . Edw . Edward My lord , I know your talent for putting things in a whimsical light , but , could you see the object of my passion  --  Roch . Rochester Nay , a truce with all description . But who , pray , is the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord ! Roch . Rochester One of the maids of honour , I 'll be bound , who has privately been petting you with sweetmeats , and lending you love-tales . Edw . Edward No , my lord . Roch . Rochester Pray , then , give me some clue . What is the name of your beauty ? Edw . Edward Her name , my lord , is Mary . Roch . Rochester Mary ! a very pretty , posy-like name  --  And what sequestered spot may the gentle Mary embellish with her presence ? Edw . Edward She lives at the Tav ... Nay , my lord , promise not to laugh . Roch . Rochester Come , the residence of this fair one ? Edw . Edward Why , then , my lord , she inhabits the tavern of the Grand Admiral , in Wapping . Roch . Rochester Usquebaugh and tobacco ! the tavern of the Grand Admiral !  --  Ha ! ha ! ha !  --  An honest attachment to some pretty bar-maid ! Edw . Edward No , my lord , no bar-maid , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rochester With mock gravity . Oh , then , she is heiress apparent to the tap-room , and you no doubt look forward to rise in the state through the dignities of drawer , tapster , and head-waiter , until you succeed to the fair hand of the niece , and the copper nose of the uncle , and rule with spigot in hand over the fair realms of Wapping . You , who I flattered myself would have made the torment and delight of all the pretty women at court , you to be so completely gulled at the very outset ,  --  the dupe of a green girl , and some old rogue of a publican ! Edw . Edward Indeed , indeed , my lord , you do the uncle injustice . He is a perfectly honest , upright man  --  an old captain of a cruiser . Roch . Rochester Worse and worse ! Some old buccaneer , tired of playing the part of a monster at sea , has turned shark on shore . And do you dare to appear in such a house with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! I have taken care to avoid that . I have introudced myself into the house as a music-master . Roch . Rochester And your musical name , gentle sir . Edw . Edward Georgini , at your service . Roch . Rochester Ha ! ha ! ha ! very soft and Italianish  --  I 'll warrant this heroine bar-maid will turn out some unknown princess , carried off by the old buccaneer landlord , in one of his cruisings . Edw . Edward Your lordship is joking ; but , really , at times , I think she is not what she seems . Roch . Rochester Ha ! ha ! ha ! I could have sworn it . But silence  --  I hear his majesty dismount . Run to where your duty calls  --  we 'll take another opportunity to discuss the merits of this Wapping Princess . Edw . Edward Goes out muttering . There 's many a true thing said in jest . I am certain her birth is above her condition . Exit , L. Roch . Rochester I must see this paragon of bar-maids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no delay  --  I 'll see her this very evening . Hold ! Why not fulfil my promise to Lady Clara at the same time ? Beef-eaters appear at door , C. It is decided :  --  I 'll give his majesty my first lesson in morals this very night . But he comes . Enter Charles , door in C. Chas . King Charles II Good day , my lord ?  --  What , musing ! I never see thee with that air of grave cogitation , but I am sure there is some mischief devising . Roch . Rochester On the contrary , I am vehemently tempted to reform . Chas . King Charles II Reform ! ha ! ha ! ha ! why , man , no one will credit thy conversion ! Is not thy name a by-word ? Do not mothers frighten their daughters with it , as formerly with that of Beelzebub ? Is not thy appearance in a neighborhood a signal for all the worthy burghers to bar their windows and put their womankind under lock and key ? Art thou not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom ? Roch . Rochester Heaven forefend , that in anything I should take precedence of your majesty . Chas . King Charles II But what proof do you give of your conversion ? Roch . Rochester The most solemn  --  I am going to be married ! Chas . King Charles II Married ! And who , pray , is the lady you have an idea of rendering miserable ? Roch . Rochester The Lady Clara ! Chas . King Charles II The Lady Clara ! The brilliant , the discreet , the virtuous Lady Clara ! She marry Rochester ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Roch . Rochester Ah , my liege , heaven has given her a superabundance of virtues  --  She will be able to make a very virtuous man of me with her superfluity . Chas . King Charles II Well , when thou art married , I will undertake to write thy epithalamium . Roch . Rochester Then your majesty may at once invoke the Muses . All is settled . With great gravity . As soon as the rites are solemnized , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire with my lovely bride to my castle at Rochester , under permission of my creditors , the faithful garrison of that fortress . Chas . King Charles II What ! is your castle again in pledge ? Roch . Rochester No , my liege , not again . It has never , to my knowledge , been exactly out of keeping . A castle requires a custodian . Chas . King Charles II Ah , Rochester ! Rochester ! Thou art an extravagant dog . I see I shall be called on to pay these usurers at last . Roch . Rochester Your majesty is ever bounteous . I should not have dared to solicit , and certainly shall not presume to decline . Chas . King Charles II Ha ! ha ! Thou art an arrant juggler . But , to business ,  --  where shall we pass the night ? Roch . Rochester Assuming a serious air . I must beg your majesty to excuse me this evening  --  I have an engagement of a grave and important nature . Chas . King Charles II Grave and important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave engagement take thee ? Roch . Rochester To the tavern of the Grand Admiral in Wapping ! Chas . King Charles II I thought it was some such haunt . And the object of this business ? Roch . Rochester A young girl , beautiful as an angel , and virtuous as a dragon  --  about whom , there hangs a mystery that I must investigate . Chas . King Charles II A mysterious beauty ! It is a case for royal scrutiny  --  I will investigate it myself . Roch . Rochester But , my liege  --  Chas . King Charles II No buts . Provide disguises . We will go together . With mock gravity . I like to study human nature in all its varieties . There 's something of philosophy in this ,  --  one often gets a useful lesson in the course of a frolic . Roch . Rochester Aside . It shall go hard but your majesty shall have one to-night . Aloud . Ah , how few , except myself , give your majesty credit for your philosophy ! And yet , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's excesses ; and should any disagreeable adventure be the result  --  Chas . King Charles II Psha ! I take the consequences on myself . Provide two seamen 's dresses , a purse of gold well filled , and arrange everything for nine precisely . Till then , farewell . Exit , L. D. Roch . Rochester I will attend your majesty . So ! the plot is in train . This night , the lesson . To-morrow , my disgrace . Within eight days , my marriage , and then , at my leisure , to repent and reform . Exit , L. D.

For three days he has not been here to give me a lesson  --  no matter  --  Peevishly . I do n't care  --  I shall forget all my singing , that 's certain : he was just teaching me such a pretty song , too  --  all about love . I 'll try it  --  Attempts to sing.  --  no , I ca n't  --  it 's all out of my head  --  well , so much the better !

No , no , I recollect too well what it was to get on shore after a long voyage . The first glimpse of a petticoat  --  whew ! up boarding pikes and grappling irons !  --  Recollecting himself . Ahem  --  no , no , child , mus n't venture in these latitudes . Mary . Mary Copp Ah , my good uncle , you are always so careful of me . Copp . Captain Copp And why not ?

To be sure , you have n't his jolly nose , and your little mouth is but a fool to his . But then , there are his eyes , and his smile , and the good humoured cut of his face  --  Sighing.  --  poor Philip ! What !  --  Wiping his eyes . Psha ! let 's change the subject , because , d'ye see , sensibility and all that gammon , it does me no good  --  none  --  so let 's talk of something else .

If he did not mean to come again , he might have said so . Copp . Captain Copp Oddsfish , neglect thee  --  neglect his duty ! I 'll break him on the spot . Thou shall have another master , my girl . Mary . Mary Copp Eagerly . Oh , no , on no account ; I dare say he is not well , some accident has happened . Besides , there is no other teacher in town equal to him , he sings with such feeling . Copp . Captain Copp Ah ! girl , if I had my old messmate , Jack Rattlin , here , he 'd teach thee to sing .

Mary . Mary Copp Softening . Well , it 's very provoking to be interrupted in one 's lessons , just in the middle of a new song  --  I 'll warrant you 've been teaching it all over town . Edw .

The king , my messmate , is Jack Mizen . Edw . Edward The king with you !  --  Aside . I see it all  --  he 's after Mary  --  ah ! I am lost . Roch . Rochester Do n't be alarmed , friend Georgini ; none but the most innocent motives have brought us here . Edw . Edward Innocent motives bring you and the king at night to a tavern in Wapping , where there is a beautiful girl ? Ah ! my lord , my lord  --  Roch . Rochester Nay , to convince you that you have nothing to fear , I permit you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme  --  Aloud . You must play off your character of music-master upon the king . Edw .

But take care how you act ; the least indiscretion on your part  --  Edw . Edward Ah ! my lord , I am too much interested in keeping the secret . Roch . Rochester That is not all . In whatever situation the king may find himself , whatever chagrin he may suffer , I forbid you to assist him in the slightest manner . You are to see in him only the sailor , Jack Mizen . Edw . Edward Should his majesty chance to incur any danger , my lord , I can never be passive . In such case , I have but one course . Roch . Rochester There can be no danger  --  I shall myself watch over his safety . Edw . Edward That decides me  --  I think I apprehend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Charles II Without . Yo , ho !

Well , messmate , shall we soon see this marvellous beauty ? Edw . Edward Apart . So  --  this is his majesty 's innocent motive ! Roch . Rochester Peace , friend Jack , here 's one of her admirers  --  her music-master  --  Chas . King Charles II Ah ! you teach the young lady music , do you ? Looking carnestly at him . Zounds ! how like he is to the page you gave me lately ! Edw . Edward Apart . Ah ! my face strikes him . Roch . Rochester Hum  --  I ca n't say I see much resemblance . He is taller than Edward , and older , and the expression of his countenance is not the same . Chas . King Charles II No , no , not altogether , but there is a something  --  Roch . Rochester Why , to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a father  --  and , your majesty knows , likenesses are stamped at random about the world sometimes . Chas . King Charles II Laughing . I understand  --  duplicate impressions  --  like enough . Staircase , R. S.

King Charles II To Rochester . By heaven , she 's a divinity ! . Edw . Edward Low to Rochester . What does he say ? Roch . Rochester To Edw . That your divinity is a devilish fine girl . Chas . King Charles II To Rochester . Amuse this confounded singing-master . I wish to have a duo with his mistress . He 'll only mar music . Roch . Rochester To Edward , with an air of great business . My good Mr. Georgini , I have something particular to say to you  --  Drawing him to a corner . His majesty suppressing a laugh , fancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Edw . Edward Yes , that he may have Mary all to himself  --  Drawing near her . Roch . Rochester Drawing him back . Come , do n't be childish . What , you pretend to follow my lessons , and want complaisance ! Charles has been making advances to Mary , who appears at first a little shy . Chas . King Charles II Do let me assist you , my pretty lass . Mary . Mary Copp Do n't trouble yourself , sir ; Mr. Georgini is to help me make tea . Edw . Edward Breaking from Rochester .  --  Crosses to Mary . I am here , madam  --  what can I do to help you ? Chas . King Charles II Puts the kettle , as if accidentally , against his hand  --  dryly . Take care , young man , you may scald your fingers . Roch . Rochester Drawing Edward back , and speaking low . Why , what a plague , boy , are you doing ? Charles continues to assist Mary , mingling little gallantries , and blundering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling with Rochester . I shall go mad ! Mary . Mary Copp Oh , dear sir , you 're so kind , you quite put me out  --  Laughing.  --  hey !  --  you have taken my hand instead of the teapot . I will not say you are awkward , sir , but really , you have the oddest manner of assisting  --  nay  --  let go my hand , I beg . Chas . King Charles II By Heaven , it is a beautiful one ! Mary . Mary Copp Nay , nay  --  pray , sir . Withdrawing her hand with smiling confusion .  --  Apart . Upon my word , I do n't see any thing so very rude in these people . Edw . Edward Endcavoring to get away from Rochester . Let me go , I entreat you ; I can stand this no longer . Roch . Rochester Holding him , and suppressing a laugh . Psha ! man , if you think to marry , or rise in the world , you must learn to be deaf and blind upon occasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . And how is possible so pretty a lass should not be married ? Mary . Mary Copp Married  --  bless me ! I never thought of such a thing . Chas . King Charles II No ! never ? and yet surrounded by lovers ? Mary . Mary Copp Lovers ! I have n't one , sir . Chas . King Charles II Indeed ! and what is that young man , fidgetting yonder ? Mary . Mary Copp He ?  --  he is my singing-master , sir . Chas . King Charles II And he sings to some purpose , I 'll warrant . Mary . Mary Copp Delightfully . Chas . King Charles II And gives you a love-song now and then ? Mary . Mary Copp Oh , often , often ! Chas . King Charles II I thought so  --  he has it in his countenance . Edw . Edward To Rochester . You must let me go  --  you see I am wanted . Roch .

I warrant , there come none but sweet notes from these lips . Offers to kiss her . Mary . Mary Copp Resisting . Sir , give over  --  let me go , sir . Mr. Georgini  --  help , help ! Edward bursts from Rochester , who is laughing . At this moment , Enter Copp from Stairs , R. S. E. , with punch . Copp . Captain Copp Avast there , messmate ! what the devil , yard-arm and yard-arm with my niece ? Charles desists , a little confused  --  Edward approaches Mary . Mary . Mary Copp Flurried . I am glad you are come , uncle  --  this rude stranger  --  Copp . Captain Copp Taking her arm , he puts her over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's niece in his own house ! Fire and furies ! Chas . King Charles II Pretending to be a little gay . I insult your niece , messmate ? Since when has an honest tar 's kissing a pretty girl been considered an insult ? As to the young woman , if she takes offence at a piece of sailor civility , why , I ask pardon , that 's all . Copp . Captain Copp Softened . Oh , as to a piece of civility , d'ye see , that alters the case ; but , guns and blunderbusses ! if any one should dare  --  Roch . Rochester Crosses to Copp . Come , come , uncle Copp , what a plague ! you were a youngster once , and a frolicsome one , I 'll warrant . I see it in your eye  --  what  --  didst ever think it a crime to kiss a pretty girl in a civil way ? Copp . Captain Copp No , no , in a civil way , no , certainly ; I can make allowance when a lad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near each other  --  oddsfish  --  you say right , at your age , I was a rattler myself . Come , Mary , Crosses , R. no harm done . Mary goes up to table . Come , lads , take your seats  --  They seat themselves . Edward attempts to place himself by Mary . Charles interferes , and takes the place ; he then tries to sit on the chair on her left hand , which Rochester perceiving , prevents , by sitting there himself  --  Edward sits in the chair on the left , next Rochester . Come , my girl , pour out the tea  --  I 'll fill out the punch , and we 'll have a time of it , i'faith  --  Come , I 'll give you a jolly song to begin with  --  Sings .

King Charles II Then punch be it  --  Come , clink with me , neighbour Copp  --  clink with me , my boy . Copp . Captain Copp Oh ! I 'm not proud , I 'll clink with anybody  --  that 's to say , mind ye , when the liquor is good , and there 's a good fellow in the case . Chas . King Charles II Rising . Well , here goes  --  To the health of Mary , the fair maid of Wapping . Copp .

Captain Copp  --  another broadside , old boy . Roch . Rochester Why , what the douce , neighbor  --  has your powder magazine taken fire ? Why , what has Rochester done to you to occasion such a terrible explosion ? Copp . Captain Copp What 's that to you ? What have you to do with my family secrets ? Rochester ! His very name makes my blood boil  --  Mary . Mary Copp My dear uncle , be calm . You promised never to speak on this subject . Roch . Rochester Why , what connexion can there be between you and Rochester ? Copp . Captain Copp No matter , he has been put to the proof , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll say no more about it , my girl . You know me  --  when I say mum , that 's enough . Chas .

Captain Copp Rising and coming forward . Your pleasure , quotha  --  and who the devil are you ? You are a pleasant blade . Sturdily . But it 's not my pleasure , look ye . Chas . King Charles II Recollecting himself . I mean to say , that I feel a deep interest in your welfare . Copp . Captain Copp Gruffly . Thank ye , thank'e ,  --  but I am not used to such warm friends on such short acquaintance . Apart . I wonder is it myself , or my niece , this chap has fallen in love with at first sight ! Chas . King Charles II ( C. ) Apart to Rochester . I am curious to know what charge they have against you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles . And so am I , and I 'll make this old buccaneer speak plain , before we leave him . Chas . King Charles II You have misunderstood me , friend Copp , I am no defender of Rochester . I know him to be a sad fellow . Copp . Captain Copp ( R. C. ) As destitute of feeling as a stock-fish . Edw . Edward ( L. ) He is a great genius , however . Copp . Captain Copp He is an evil genius , I know . Edw . Edward He has a very clear head  --  Copp . Captain Copp But a very black heart . Roch . Rochester This Rochester is a sad light-headed fellow , that 's notorious ; but will you have the goodness , my blunt Captain Copp , to mention one heartless act of his ? Copp . Captain Copp Loudly . Ay , that I will . Is it not a burning shame  --  Mary . Mary Copp ( R. ) My dear uncle , you forget your promise . Copp . Captain Copp Let me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear ; I have you under convey . Roch . Rochester Out with it , what is his crime ? Copp . Captain Copp Crime ! Is it not a burning shame , I say , to disclaim his own niece  --  to keep from her every stiver of her little fortune , and leave her to pass her days in a tavern , when she has a right to inhabit a palace ? Edw . Edward Eagerly . What do I hear ? Roch . Rochester What , and is this young woman the niece ?  --  How can that be ? Copp . Captain Copp Simply enough . Her father , Philip Copland , married a sister of Lord Rochester . Roch . Rochester Apart . Philip Copland is indeed the name . Chas . King Charles II This is most singular . And this Philip Copland was your brother ? Copp . Captain Copp Ay , but worth a dozen of me  --  a steady man , an able officer , an ornament of the regular navy . I was always a wild dog , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself on board a privateer . In time , I became a captain , and returned from my last cruize just in time to receive poor Philip 's last breath  --  his sand was almost run out . ' Brother , ' said he , ' I feel that my cruising is over ; but there 's my little girl . Take care of her for my sake , and never bother the Rochesters again . '  --  ' Brother , ' said I , ' it 's a bargain ; tip us your fist on it , and die in peace , like a good Christian . ' He grasped my hand and gave it a gentle squeeze . I would have shook his , but it grew cold in mine , and poor Philip was no more ! With great feeling . Mary . Mary Copp My dear uncle  --  Laying her hand on his shoulder . Copp . Captain Copp Rousing himself . But the girl was left , the girl was left ; Embracing her and  --  Taking her arm under his ,  --  and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of her as long as I have breath in my body . Chas . King Charles II Well , brother Tom , what do you think of all this ? Roch . Rochester It touches me to the soul . Chas . King Charles II And so you took home the child ? Mary . Mary Copp Oh ! yes : and my uncle 's bounty and kindness have taken care of his poor girl ever since . Copp . Captain Copp Oh ! you should have seen what a little thing it was ,  --  a little chubby-faced thing of four years old , no higher than that table . Now she 's a grown girl . Chas . King Charles II And you have given her a good education , it appears ? Copp . Captain Copp And why not ? What tho ' I 'm a dunce , that 's no reason that Mary Copland should be a fool . Her father was a man of parts . Chas . King Charles II And you have given up your voyages for her ? Copp . Captain Copp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after me about deck ? I sold my ship , and bought this tavern , where I receive none but good fellows , who drink , and smoke , and talk to me of voyages and battles all day long . Chas . King Charles II But ambition might have induced you  --  Copp . Captain Copp Ambition ! you do n't know me ; my only ambition tion is to marry my niece to some honest citizen , and give her a dower of one thousand pounds , with as much more , when old Captain Copp takes his long nap . Roch . Rochester Apart . Generous fellow ! Aloud . Let me advise you to apply to the Earl of Rochester . Edw . Edward Oh ! yes , he will provide an honourable match for your niece . Mary . Mary Copp Piqued . Much obliged , Mr. Georgini , but nobody asked your advice . Copp . Captain Copp Apply to him !  --  no  --  no  --  I 'll have nothing to do with the Rochesters . Chas . King Charles II But why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oddsfish ! they say he is not much better  --  he 's a wild devil , a great friend of Rochester  --  and birds of a feather , you know  --  Chas . King Charles II Apart . Now comes my turn . Roch . Rochester True enough , Captain Copp ; they say he is a rover  --  rambles about at night  --  frolics in taverns . Copp . Captain Copp Well , let him cruise , so he does not cruise into my waters . He 's a desperate rogue among the petticoats , they say  --  well , I like a merry heart , wherever it beats . Charley has some good points : oh , dam'me , I like Charley ; and if I could but give him a piece of my mind  --  Chas . King Charles II What would it be , friend Copp ? Copp . Captain Copp To keep more in port , anchor himself at home , and turn that fellow , Rochester , adrift  --  there might then be some hopes of him . But , come , ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn out , and turn in  --  these are late hours for the Grand Admiral  --  come , a parting cup . To Mary . See that the fires are out , my girl , and all hands ready for bed . Mary . Mary Copp I will , but no more drinking , uncle . Going , L. Copp . Captain Copp Well , well  --  no more  --  only one parting cup . Mary . Mary Copp Only one  --  recollect , you have promised  --  no more . Exit , L. D. Copp . Captain Copp Only this last drop . Come , my lads , this farewell cup , and then you must push your boats . Roch . Rochester Now to execute my plan . Making signs that the King will pay . Hist , Captain Copp ! Whispers while Charles is drinking . Copp . Captain Copp Ay , ay , all right . Goes up to R. of table and sits . Roch . Rochester Low to Edward . Follow me quietly  --  I 've something to say to you . Apart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack , I think you 'll soon find yourself among the breakers ! Exit , followed by Edward , L. D. Copp .

Chas . King Charles II Looking over the paper . Um ! wine  --  punch  --  wine  --  punch  --  total , five pounds ten  --  a mere trifle ! Rises . Copp . Captain Copp Coming down . Do you call that a trifle ?  --  Gad , messmate , you must have made good prizes in you last cruise  --  or you 've high wages , mayhap . Chas . King Charles II Laughing . Ay , ay , I 'm pretty well paid  --  Here , Tom Taffrel , pay Copp 's bill , and let 's be off . Looking round . Hey  --  where is he ? Copp . Captain Copp Oh ! he went off in a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that you would pay the bill . Goes up to table again . Chas . King Charles II With all my heart . Apart . It 's odd that he should leave me alone  --  my raillery has galled him . Poor Rochester , Laughing , how ill some people take a joke ! Feeling in his pockets . Five pounds ten , you say ? Copp . Captain Copp Just so  --  five pounds ten . Chas . King Charles II Searching in all his pockets . Well ! this is the oldest thing  --  I am certain I had my purse . Copp . Captain Copp Apart . My neighbour seems rather in a quandary . Chas . King Charles II Feeling more eagerly . Some one has picked my pocket . Copp . Captain Copp Avast there , friend  --  none but honest people frequent the Grand Admiral Chas . King Charles II All I know , is , that one of these honest people must have taken my purse . Copp . Captain Copp Come , come , messmate  --  I am too old a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I understand all this  --  your companion makes sail  --  you pretend to have been robbed  --  it 's all a crused privateering trick  --  clear as day . Chas . King Charles II Friend Copp  --  if you will wait till to-morrow , I 'll pay you double the sum . Copp . Captain Copp Double the sum !  --  thunder and lightning ! what do you take me for ?  --  Look ye , neighbour , to an honest tar in distress , my house and purse are open  --  to a jolly tar who wants a caper , and has no coin at hand , drink today and pay to-morrow is the word  --  but to a sharking land lubber , that hoists the colours of a gallant cruiser , to play off the tricks of a pirate , old Copp will show him his match any day . Chas . King Charles II A land lubber ? Copp . Captain Copp Ay , a land lubber . D'ye think I ca n't see through you and your shallow sailor phrases ? Who the devil are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship do you belong to ? Chas . King Charles II What ship ? why , to  --  to  --  Apart. what the deuce shall I say ? Copp .

Chas . King Charles II Apart . How shall I get out of this cursed scrape ?  --  Oh , happy thought , my watch  --  Aloud. hearkee , Captain Copp  --  if I have n't money , may be this will do as well  --  what say you to my watch as pledge ? Copp . Captain Copp Taking the watch . Let me see it  --  um  --  large diamonds . Shaking his head . Chas . King Charles II Gayly . Well  --  that 's worth your five pounds ten  --  hey ? Copp .

Was that delicate hand made to grasp so rude a weapon ? Edw . Edward Low to Mary . Do n't let him touch your hand , or you are lost . Mary . Mary Copp Drawing back . He does not look so very ferocious , neither . Fie , sir , fie ! what , steal the jewels of the crown ? Chas . King Charles II Is it , then , known already ? Mary .

Hark ! a noise in the king 's private staircase . Softly , then , softly ! Seats himself in an arm-chair at the door of the King 's chamber , and pretends to sleep . Enter Charles from flat , his dress in disorder . Chas . King Charles II Confound the city ! what a journey it is ! Edw . Edward Aside . Especially to foot passengers . Chas . King Charles II I began to think I should never find the palace . Sitting down . Phew ! I shall not forget this night in a hurry . Forced to escape like a thief  --  to risk my neck from a window  --  hunted about the streets by that old buccaneer and his crew ! Egad ! I fancy I can hear old Copp 's voice , even now , like a huntsman giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edw . Edward Aside , and suppressing a laugh . A royal hunt , truly ! Chas . King Charles II Well , thank fortune , I am safe home at last , and seen by nobody but my confidential valet . Edw . Edward Aside . And the most discreet of pages . Chas . King Charles II Seeing Edward . So , the page already in waiting . The more I look at him , the more he reminds me of that knowing young blade who gives the pretty Mary lessons in love and music . Deuce take him ! he is exactly in the door-way of my chamber . So , so ! Lady Clara coming ! Oh , then , all 's over ! Retires up a little . Enter Lady Clara , R. , and goes to Edward , L. Lady C. Lady Clara What ! asleep at this hour , Edward ? Edw . Edward I beg your pardon , my lady  --  I am waiting his majesty 's rising . Removes chairs . Lady C.

I wish I may die if I know how to turn the matter off . Lady C. Lady Clara I ask your majesty 's pardon ; but really , I can not help laughing  --  So odd a dress ! Chas . King Charles II Affecting an unembarrassed air . What ! it amuses you , ha ! ha ! My regular morning dress , I assure you . I have taken a whim for gardening lately , and every morning , by day-light , I am on the terrace , planting , transplanting , and training . Oh ! you should see how busy I am , particularly among the roses . Lady C. Lady Clara I have no doubt your majesty has an eye for every fresh one that blows . But how quiet you have been in these pursuits ! Chas . King Charles II One does not want all the world to know of one 's caprices . Lady C. Lady Clara How can your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How happy the nation whose sovereign has a taste so pure and simple . Chas . King Charles II But what has procured me the pleasure of seeing your ladyship so early . Lady C. Lady Clara The queen , sire , knowing how deeply you were immersed in affairs of state last night  --  Chas . King Charles II Why , yes , in truth , I had a busy night of it . Lady C. Lady Clara She sent me to enquire how your majesty had slept . Chas . King Charles II Very restless  --  very restless  --  I tumbled and tossed about sadly . Lady C. Lady Clara Ah ! why does not your majesty take more care of yourself ? You devote yourself too much to your people . This night-work will be too much for you . Chas . King Charles II Why , yes , if it were often as severe as last night . Lady C. Lady Clara Indeed , your majesty must give up these midnight labours to your ministers . Chas . King Charles II Apart . To my ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see old Clarendon and Ormond hob-a-nobbing with uncle Copp , struggling for kisses with Mary , and scouring the lanes of Wapping at full speed . Aloud . Well , my Lady Clara , have you anything further to communicate ? Lady C. Lady Clara Might I presume , I have a favour to request of your majesty . An author , in whose cause I take a warm interest , has offended a person high in power , and is threatened with a prosecution . Chas . King Charles II The blockhead ! let him write against me only , and they 'll never trouble him . Lady C. Lady Clara His pardon depends upon your majesty  --  would you but deign to sign it ? Chas . King Charles II Taking paper . Lady Clara , you look amazingly well this morning  --  I can refuse you nothing . Signs the paper . And now to make my toilette . Crosses , L.  --  Aside . Safe at last ! she suspects nothing . Exit , L. Lady C. Lady Clara Smiling . He thinks he has deceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they will impose upon us easy , simple , knowing women ! To Edward . A person from the city , with a young girl , desires to speak with his majesty  --  you will permit them to await him here . I will myself conduct them . Exit . Edw . Edward Alone . This should be Captain Copp ; in his blunt honesty , he determined to bring the watch himself to the king . But why his niece ? No doubt , to let her have a sight of the palace . Here they come , sure enough , Now for another puzzle about my physiognomy . Retires up a little , L. S. E. Enter Copp and Mary , at the back-door flat , the two Beefeaters oppose their entrance . Copp . Captain Copp Oddsfish ! I never knew such a piece of work to get into a house before . If that good-looking gentlewoman had not seen us from the window , and taken our part , hang me if I do n't think they would have turned us adrift . Edw . Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plot . Retires . L. U. E. Mary . Mary Copp What beautiful rooms ! Copp . Captain Copp Gingerbread finery ! I would not change the bar-room of the grand Admiral for the best of them . But what a bother to give a watch back to the right owner ! Why , there 's no finding the king in his own house . Now , for my part , I always stand on the threshold , and if any one comes , there 's my hand . Tip us your bone , says I , and make yourself welcome . That 's what I call acting like a king of good fellows . Mary . Mary Copp Oh , uncle , I have always heard say that the king is very kind and affable ; and , I dare say , when you hand him back his watch , he will behave with generosity . Copp . Captain Copp Generosity ! Why , dost think , girl , I 'd take a reward ? No , no ! They say Charley 's not overstocked with the shiners : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may do the civil thing  --  he may ask us to stay , and take pot-luck , perhaps . Mary . Mary Copp Pot-luck , uncle ! Copp . Captain Copp Ay , in a friendly way , d'ye see ? And I do n't care if I did , if it were only to see how royalty messed But where the deuce is the king to be found ? Oh ! yonder is a fine gimcrack young gentleman , who , perhaps , can tell us  --  I 'll hail him . Yo-ho ! messmate ! Exit , hallooing after Edward , L. S. E. Mary . Mary Copp What a beautiful place this is ! But , without content , grandeur is not to be envied . The humble and the good , may be as happy in a cottage as a palace . AIR .

You come to speak to his majesty ? Mary . Mary Copp Yes , sir , we come  --  Apart . Dear uncle , those features  --  how my heart beats ! Copp . Captain Copp Supporting her . Why , what ails thee , my girl ? Edw . Edward Is anything the matter with the young lady ? Let me assist her ? Copp . Captain Copp Thank'ee , thank'ee , Putting up his elbow , young gentleman . But , by your leave , if you please . Mary . Mary Copp Did you ever see such a resemblance , uncle ? Copp . Captain Copp Looking at Edward . Oddsfish ! he is like , indeed ! But it ca n't be him ! Mary . Mary Copp I like Mr. Georgini 's face better  --  it is more animated . Copp . Captain Copp Do n't talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he took a ring of that land-pirate ? And then to disappear so suddenly . Mary . Mary Copp How can you suspect him , uncle ? The most honourable , the most upright ! I dare say he only took it to keep it for the right owner . Edw . Edward Apart . Dear , confiding Mary ! Copp . Captain Copp That ring should not have remained in his hand a single moment . It may bring suspicion on my house  --  on my character . Fire and fury ! if I catch him  --  Mary . Mary Copp No swearing in the king 's palace . Copp . Captain Copp That 's true ; I should not swear . But , that old Captain Copp , whom everybody knows to be honest , should have such tricks played in his house . Thunder and lightning ! Mary . Mary Copp My dear uncle ! Copp . Captain Copp Well , well , true , no swearing . But what keeps the king so long ? Edw . Edward I think I hear him . Step into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captain Copp Ah ! the same that I saw at the window  --  very well . But I say , Mister , do n't keep me waiting . Just hint to the king , that I 've no time to lose . Tell him there 's a launch at Wapping to-day  --  busy times at the Grand Admiral . Mary . Mary Copp Let us retire , uncle . I dare say we shall be sent for in good time . Copp . Captain Copp Very well , very well . But do think of the Grand Admiral  --  all aback for want of me . If the king loses his watch again , the devil take me  --  Oh ! I forgot  --  I must n't swear in the king 's palace . Exit with Mary , R. Edw . Edward This will be a whimsical court presentation , truly ! His majesty 's perplexities are not yet over . Enter Charles in his riding dress , R. Chas . King Charles II Has Rochester appeared ? Edw . Edward Not yet , sire . Chas . King Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel trick he played me ? Edw . Edward Your majesty asked for Lord Rochester ; here he comes with Lady Clara . Retires up , R. Enter Rochester and Lady Clara , R. Roch . Rochester May I venture to ask if your majesty has passed a comfortable night ? Chas . King Charles II Indifferent , my lord  --  Low to him  --  Traitor ! Lady C. Lady Clara Smiling . I understood his lordship had assisted your majesty in your labours . Roch . Rochester Not throughout , my lady . An accident obliged me to leave his majesty in rather a moment of perplexity . Chas . King Charles II Angrily . Yes , his lordship left the whole weight of  --  business  --  upon my shoulders . Roch . Rochester I doubt not your majesty got through with your usual address . Chas . King Charles II Apart . Perfidious varlet ! Aloud . My lord , you will please to present yourself in my study at two o'clock . I have something particular to say to you . Roch . Rochester Deign to dispense with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments for my estate , as I mentioned yesterday . I am a great offender . It is time to exile myself from court , and turn hermit . Chas . King Charles II Harshly . I approve the project ; but will take the liberty of choosing your hermitage myself . Roch . Rochester Low to Lady Clara . The king is furious against me . Lady C. Lady Clara Courage , my lord , all will end well . Copp . Captain Copp Without . What the devil is the meaning of this ? Am I to be kept here all day ? Chas . King Charles II What uproar is that ? Lady C. Lady Clara Oh ! two persons whom I met this morning , seeking to speak with his majesty on some personal concern . As I know him to be so accessible to the people , I undertook to present them . Chas . King Charles II Just now , it is impossible . Lady C. Lady Clara I am very sorry , especially on the young girl 's account . Chas . King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady C. Lady Clara Beautiful as an angel ! Chas . King Charles II Oh ! since you take such interest in her , Lady Clara  --  To Edward ,  --  Show them in . Retires up . Enter Copp and Mary , R. Edw . Edward Preceding them . Come in  --  his majesty consents to hear you . Copp . Captain Copp I 'm taken all aback  --  my courage begins to fail me . Mary . Mary Copp What have you to fear , my dear uncle ? Keeps her eyes modestly cast down . Copp . Captain Copp Fear ! it is n't fear , look ye . But , somehow , I never fell in with a king before in all my cruisings . Chas . King Charles II Apart . Copp and his niece ! here 's a pretty rencontre . Summoning up dignity . Copp . Captain Copp Well , I suppose I must begin . Oddsfish ! I had it all settled in my head , and now , the deuce a word can I muster up . Mary . Mary Copp Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast down before . Chas . King Charles II Apart . I hope he will not recognize me . " Roch . Rochester Low to Lady Clara . Is not my niece a pretty lass ? " " Lady C. Lady Clara She is , indeed , my lord ; you may be proud of her . " Copp . Captain Copp Well , then , what I had to say is this . Low . Hey , Mary , what is it I had to say ? Mary . Mary Copp Relate simply what passed . Copp . Captain Copp Right , my girl , right . But oddsfish ! I feel so queer . I 'll be hanged if I can look him in the face . Mary . Mary Copp It would not be respectful to stare at his majesty . Keeps her eyes modestly cast down . Chas . King Charles II What is your name , my good friend ? To Copp . Copp . Captain Copp Copp , at your service ; that is to say , Copland , or Captain Copp , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , though I say it , is one of the best girls . While talking , he looks down and fumbles with his cap . Mary . Mary Copp But that 's not the point , uncle . Copp . Captain Copp Eh ! true , very true , always keep to the point , like a good helmsman . First and foremost , then , you must know , my lord  --  when I say my lord , I mean your majesty . Chas . King Charles II Apart . Egad , he 's as much puzzled as I was , to give an account of myself . Copp . Captain Copp Still looking down . In finis  --  you must know , prima , then , that I command , that is to say , I keep the Grand Admiral , as honest a tavern as your majesty would wish to set your foot in  --  none but good company ever frequent it , excepting when a rogue or so drops in , in disguise  --  last night , for instance , a couple of ' scape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! if I could only lay eyes on them again  --  I should know ' em , where-ever I saw ' em  --  one in particular had a confounded hanging look  --  a man about the height of  --  Eyeing Rochester , stops short .

Rochester 's face seems to puzzle him . Copp . Captain Copp I 'll say no more ; for the more I look  --  Low to Mary , dash my buttons , if it is n't himself . Mary . Mary Copp Hush , I entreat you  --  I will speak for you  --  Takes his place , her eyes still modestly cast down . My uncle has thought it his duty to inform your majesty , that two strangers came to his house last night , and after calling for a great deal of wine , were unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pledge , which has proved to belong to your majesty . Rochester and Lady Clara in bye-play express great delight at the manner of Mary . Copp . Captain Copp Apart , rubbing his hands . Oh ! bless her ! she talks like a book . " Roch . Rochester To Lady Clara . Does not my niece tell her little story with clearness and simplicity . " " Lady C. Lady Clara Charmingly ! she has quite won my heart . Mary . Mary Copp My uncle being an honest man , has brought the watch to your majesty . " Copp . Captain Copp Yes , by St. George , and here it is . The sharpers , to be sure , have run off with five pounds ten of my money , but that 's neither here nor there . I do n't say that , because I expect you to pay it , you know . In short , without more palaver , Crosses to Charles , and gives it , here 's the watch  --  Glancing at the King , stops short , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Low to Mary . Smite my timbers ! if it be n't the other rogue ! Mary . Mary Copp What ails you , uncle ? surely , you are losing your senses to speak thus of his majesty ! Copp . Captain Copp Low to her . Majesty , or no majesty , I 'll put my hand in the fire o n't he 's the other . Chas . King Charles II The watch is certainly mine . Lady C. Lady Clara Your majesty 's ? Smiling significantly at Rochester . Roch . Rochester Affecting astonishment . Your majesty 's watch ! Chas . King Charles II Even so ; and I might have lost it , but for this man 's honesty . I shall be more on my guard in future . Looking sternly at Rochester . Mary . Mary Copp Looking at Charles and Rochester . The voice and the face are astonishingly alike . But it is impossible .

Your majesty will not be angry with my little fool of a niece . The two strangers might be very worthy people : many a man has a gallows look , and is an honest fellow for all that . The truth is , they were a brace of merry wags . Besides , if I had known for certain , I would n't for the world  --  ha ! ha !  --  because , d'ye see  --  honour bright  --  mum ! Turning to Mary . Come , I think I 've got you pretty well out of this scrape , hey ? Lady C. Lady Clara I am of your opinion , Captain Copp . They were two sad madcaps . Chas . King Charles II They merit harsher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already punished , the other shall be presently . Makes a sign to Edward , who brings forward a chair , C. Captain Copp , I am aware of all that passed at your house . Sits . Copp . Captain Copp Ah ! your majesty knows , that he who cracks a joke must not complain if he should chance to pinch his fingers . Chas . King Charles II True , Captain . But was there not question of one Rochester ? Copp . Captain Copp Aside . Zounds ! that 's his friend . This is bringing one to close quarters . Why , craving your majesty 's pardon , I did let slip some hard truths about him . Roch . Rochester And do you know him of whom you spoke so bluntly ? Copp . Captain Copp Not I , thank heaven ! But I only said what everybody says ; and what everybody says , you know , must be true . Chas . King Charles II Spoken like an oracle ; and did not you say that this pretty lass was his niece ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll stick to that , proof in hand . Make a reverence , Mary , and no thanks to Rochester for the relationship . Chas . King Charles II I will take care that he shall make a suitable provision for his niece , or provide her an honourable husband . Roch . Rochester I can assure your majesty , you only anticipated his intentions . Copp . Captain Copp Avast there ! I do n't give up my girl . Roch . Rochester But you will choose a match suited to her noble family ? Copp . Captain Copp I 'll choose for her an honest man ; but no ranticumscout companion to suit that Earl of Rochester you talk of  --  Chuckling and winking . To tell the truth between friends , and all in confidence , I had a match in my eye , a young music-master . Nay , do n't blush , girl , I knew there was a sneaking kindness in the case . Chas . King Charles II I oppose that match . That young man received a ring last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to seek the owner . Mary involuntarily springs forward to defend Edward against the charge , which Lady Clara and Rochester observe and smile at . Copp . Captain Copp Oddsfish ! that 's true enough ; he has absconded with the ring . Mary . Mary Copp Earnestly . I am a witness that the ring was freely given , and I 'll pledge my life that he will bring it back . " Lady C. Lady Clara Aside to Rochester . Your niece is a brave girl ; but I see she has no longer a heart . " Edw . Edward Advancing . He only waited a suitable moment to return it to your majesty . Kneels and presents it . Chas . King Charles II How ! Edward !  --  The resemblance is no longer a wonder . Copp . Captain Copp What , little crotchet and quaver ! Aha ! ha ! ha ! there 's witchcraft in all this . Mary . Mary Copp Oh , heavens ! Georgini a gentleman ! But my heart knew it . Copp and Mary go up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain , Lady Clara , to attempt concealment . Behold the heroes of the adventure . Rises  --  Edward removes chairs . Lady C. Lady Clara Pardon me , sire , I knew it all along  --  I was in the plot . Chas . King Charles II How ? Lady C. Lady Clara Her majesty , the queen , was at the head of it . If the Earl be guilty , it is we who induced him , and should undergo the punishment . Chas . King Charles II I understand the whole . But the treachery or this Earl I can not forgive . He shall not obtain my pardon . Lady C. Lady Clara Producing a paper . It is already obtained . Your majesty , over merciful , has signed it . Chas . King Charles II What ! he , too , is the author for whom you have interested yourself . Ha ! ha ! ha ! fairly taken in at all points . Rochester , thou hast conquered . Rochester kneels  --  Charles and Lady Clara retire up  --  Copp and Mary come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning ! this man Rochester ! come along , girl , come along ! Roch . Rochester Footnote : 1Kb Hold , Captain Copp . That I am Rochester , ' t is true  --  a wild fellow , no doubt , since every body says so . But there is one crime that I will not take to my charge , for ' t is a sin against beauty  --  I am not the Rochester who deserted the pretty Mary : he was my predecessor , and is dead . Copp . Captain Copp Dead ! gone to his long home ! Well , may Heaven deal kindlier with him , than he did with this little girl . Chas . King Charles II What say you , Captain Copp ? What say you , my Lord of Rochester ? Must we not find a husband for our niece ? Copp . Captain Copp Fair and softly , your majesty  --  craving your majesty 's pardon , I ca n't give up my right over my little girl . This lord is an uncle  --  I ca n't gainsay it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , I have bred her , and fed her , and been her uncle all her life , have n't I , Mary ? Chas . King Charles II You are right , Captain  --  you alone ought to dispose of her . But I hope to propose a match that shall please all parties . What think you of my page  --  the music-master , who brought back the ring ? Copp . Captain Copp Your majesty has fathomed my own wishes . Roch . Rochester And mine . Edw . Edward And mine . Approaching Mary . Mary . Mary Copp And  --  Extending her hand  --  and mine . Copp . Captain Copp So , here we are , all safe in port , after last night 's squall . Oddsfish ! I feel so merry , my girl 's provided for  --  I have nothing now to care for  --  I 'll keep open house at the Grand Admiral  --  I 'll set all my liquor a-tap  --  I 'll drown all Wapping in wine and strong beer  --  I 'll have an illumination  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll sing , " In the time of the Rump "  --  Mary runs down and stops him .

Putting it on her finger . And now , Beckoning all the characters to the front with an air of mystery , let me particularly enjoin on all present , the most profound secresy in regard to our whimsical adventures at Wapping .
