txt SOME will have it , that all philosophy is vain ; and that the time bestowed upon it , in our colleges and elsewhere , is only wasted , or worse than wasted , in the pursuit of a phantom that can never be reached , while it leads us away continually from the proper use of life . What men need in this world , we are told , is not speculation , but an active apprehension of the living realities with which they are immediately surrounded , and the proper practical use of these for the ends of their own existence . The world is a fact , broadly and palpably spread out before our senses ; and our life is a fact , which we - are required to turn to right account , by making the best of it for ourselves and others , in the circumstances in which we may happen to be placed . Why , then , should we occupy ourselves with things that *ie wholly beyond the sphere of our actual existehce , and that can only serve to disqualify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The sense of the world is sufficiently clear of itself for such as are disposed to take things just as they are , without troubling their heads about what they are pleased to call its inward spiriti*al constitution and design . We have had ample experiment besides of the vanity of philosophy , in the past history of its own achievements . The world has been philosophizing since the days of Pythagoras at least , and from a still t*arlier date , and yet to what has it come in the end ? Has its philosophy made it any wiser or better ? Has it accomplished any solid gain whatever for the human race ? Is the world improved in any respect by the long exploded systems of Greece , by the profound lucubrations of the schoolmen in the middle ages , or by the vast upheavings of thought which have had place since the days of Immanuel Kant , in the modem metaphysics of Germany ? Is it not , in fact , a history of contradictions and eonfusions , from beginning to end-one system continually surmounting another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its turn ? It will be time enough to challenge our respect for philosophy , when philosophy shall have come to some proper understanding , in the first place , of her own mind and meaning . When she shall have become once mistress of herself-  --  a house no longer divided against itself , the very cavern of 2Eolus where all pent-up minds are struggling perpetually in fierce conflict-it will be time enough to think of proclaiming her mistress of the world . Till then , let her be remanded to her proper dwelling place in the clouds , the land of far-off shadows and dreams . The world has too much serious business on hand , to be interrupted by her pretensions , and may reasonably say , in the language of Nehemiah to Sanballat and Geshem the Arabian of old : " I am doing a great work , so that I can not come - down ; why should the work cease , whilst I leave it and come down to you ? " All this is very comfortable doctrine , of course , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly , to think for themselves , while they have just as little wish or will to be bound by the thinking of others . Agrarianism , indeed , we may call it , of the most truly democratic order ; for is it not something more to level thus the aristocracy of mind , than it is to bring down simply the aristocracy of birth or fortune ? Is it not a species of self-exaltation , particularly soothing to the sense we commonly have of our own importance , to be able in this way to compare ourselves so favorably with what has generally been countea the highest order of the world 's intellect , and the true nobility of its life ? The man who can say of all philosophy , It is mere wind , must needs feel himself in this respect somewhat superior to the great minds which , in different ages , have counted it worthy of their attention and study . It is much , surely , 1848. 143 // for any one to have the thought clearly present in his own consciousness : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ar*istotle was a fool ; all the old Greek philosophers were fools ; the seraphic , irrefragable doctors of the school divinity , Thomas Aquinas , Bonaventura , Duns Scotus , the whole of them together , were fools ; and the same character belongs most eminently to the modern German thinkers , Kant , Fichte , Schelling , Hegel , and all who think it worth while to waste any time upon their speculations : but I am wise ; for I have sense enough to know that all*hilosophy is nonsense , and that the less the world is troubled with it the better . My life is more rational , and likely to be of far more account at last , than theirs . " This , we say , is comfortable ; and it is not much wonder , perhaps , that philosophy should be in bad credit with so many persons , when so fair a premium in this way is made to rest on unthinking ignorance and sloth . And then , the case becomes still worse , of course , when the prejudice of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in favor of the same conclusion . It is bad enough , we are told , that philosophy should pretend to interfere with the actual world , in its common life , abstracting men 's minds from its practical realities , and amusing them with its own theoretic dreams ; but when the evil is made to reach over , in the same form , to the sphere of religion and faith , it is something still more difficult to be endured . And is there not in fact an original , necessary opposition between revelation and philosophy ? Is not faith the simple contrary of speculation ? Is it not written , " Let no man spoil you through philosophy ; " plainly implying that we should have nothing to do with it , in the business of Christianity ? And is not the history of the church from the beginning full of instruction and warning , in the same direction ? Have not all corruptions and heresies sprung from philosophy , undertaking to rule and set aside the simple doctrine of God 's word ? Witness the flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors of Origen and his school ; tfie scholastic subtleties of the Aristotelian theology , at a still later period ; and above all , the rationalistic , pantheistic systems , to which the modern German philosophy has given birth . Philosophy and infidelity are found to have , in all ages , a close inward affinity for each other . The first may be considered the elder sister , if not in fact the proper natural mother of the second . That state of the church accordingly is-to be accounted the most prosperous , in which religion is as little as possible the subject of speculation ; and the man who meddles least with the contents of his faith , in the way of inward thought and reflection , is likely to show himself the best Christian , and make his way most successfully to heaven . But now , in opposition to all such popular cant ,  --  that can hardly be said for the most part to understand its own meaning ,  - -  it is at once an ample reply to say , that philosophy belongs to the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it therefore without the greatest violence and wrong . For what is it at last , more or less than the endeavor to know ourselves and the world , and the form in which , at any given time , this knowledge reflects itself in our consciousness ? And can it be a question at all , whether it be proper and right for us to se'ek the knowledge of ourselves in this way ? It lies in the idea of humanity itself , that it should comprehend within itself such a mode of existence , just as it necessarily includes also the life of art or the law of social , or political organization . The question whether philosophy is to be tolerated and approved , is precisely like the question whether we should approve and tolerate government or art . These are all so many several spheres only of our human existence itself , which are necessary to make it true and complete , and which can not be sundered from it , without overthrowing , at the same time , its essential constitution . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come to have the right of being comprehended in the organic structure of the world ; their right is as old as the world itself , and must stand as long as man and nature shall be found to endure . If any number of men , for instance , in vast world-convention assembled , should pretend to sit in judgment on the right and title of the fine arts , music , sculpture , poetry and the rest , to retain their place in the world , and at last 144 Feb. ; // proceed in form to legislate them out of it , as useless , fantastic , and injurious to religion ; to what would such legislation amount in the end , more than to expose the impotence and folly of the congress from which it might spring ? The fine arts might say to such a convention : " What have we to do with thee , vain , wretched apparition of an hour ! Is the nature of man to be thus made or unmade , at thy puny pleasure ? Our authority is broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And can it be any more reasonable , I would ask , to think of legislating philosophy out of the world or out of the church , in any similar way ? Philosophy is no subject for human arbitrament and legislation , in such magisterial form . The question of its being tolerated and allowed , is not just like the question whether we shall have , or not , a tariff or a national bank . It asks no permission of ours , to exercise its appointed functions in the vast world-process of man 's history ; it has exercised them through all ages thus far , and it will continue to exercise them , no doubt , to the end of time , in virtue of its own indefeasible right to be comprehended in this process , as an original necessary part of its constitution . Philosophy is the form , simply , in which all Science is required at last to l*ecome complete . It is not , as sometimes supposed , one among the sciences only , in the way in which this may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematics ; it is emphatically the science of science itself  --  the form in which science comes to master i18 own nature , in the way of conscious self-apprehension and self-possession . It belongs to the very conception of knowledge , that however distributed into manifold departments and spheres , it should nevertheless be at the last the power of a single universal life . All science is organic , and falls back finally upon the unity of self-consciousness as its centre and ground . This is , however , only to say that it comes to its true general end in the form of philosophy , which is for this very reason the mistress and mother of all sound knowledge in every other view . What can be more irrational , then , and absurd , than to cry out against philosophy as something unprofitable and vain ? It were just as reasonable surely to cry out against science in any of its subordinate departments ; as some , indeed , most consistent in their fanaticism , have at times pretended to do , in blind homage to a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a blind religion . All science has its chaotic disorders and revolutions , its sources of danger and its liabilities to corruption and abuse . But what then ? Must we cease to think and inquire , in order that we may become truly wise ? Shall we extinguish the torch of knowledge , that we may have power in the dark to fancy ourselves secure from harm ? To do so were only to *ommit violent wrong upon our human nature itself . Man was made for science ; he needs it , not as a means simply to something else , but as a constituent , we may say , in the substance of his own being . But his relation to science , in this view , is his relation at the same time to philosophy ; for , as we have just seen , science can have no reality , except as it includes in itself a reference , at least to philosophy , as that in which alone it can become complete . Man then is formed for philosophy , a truly as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it properly , we should see and feel that to undervalue and despise the first , is as little rational as it is to undervalue and despise the second . Philosophy is not a factitious interest , artificially and arbitrarily associated with our life , which we may retain or put away from us altogether at our own pleasure ; it is the perfection of our intelligence itself , the necessary summit of self-consciousness , towards which all the lines of knowledge struggle from the start , and in which only they are made to reach at last their ultima*e and full sense . What has now been said , does not imply of course that all men are called to be philosophers , and to exercise the functions of philosophy on their own account . When we say of art , that it forms an original constituent sphere of our general human life , we do not mean certainly that every individual is required to be a painter , or musician , or poet , or all of these together , in order that he may fulfil his proper destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the worid is something far more comprehensive and profound than the life of any one man , or any ten thousand men 1848. // included in its course . Humanity has its measure in the whole , and not in the separate parts of which the whole is composed . The perfection of the individual does not consist in his being all that the general idea of human life requires , but in this , that he shall truly fill his own place in an organism , which is complete for the purposes that belong to it as a whole . In this sense we say , that art is a necessary constituent of humanity , though few comparatively may be fitted as organs to exercise the functions for which it calls : these functions belong to the organic constitution of our life , as a whole , and for the use of the whole ; and where they are not acknowledged or fulfilled , the life itself must be regarded as , to the same extent , mutilated and shorn of its true sense . So in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all men , individually and separately taken ; but they are necessary at all times to Man as an organic whole . The great fact of humanity , the process of the world 's life , can not go forward at all without their presence . It may be enough for the mass of men perhaps to be borne along by the spirit of the age to which they belong , without any clear insight into its constitution and course ; but this is not enough for the age itself . Through organs proper for the purpose , it ought to come if possible to a clear understanding of its own spirit and will , so as to be self-conscious and not blind . As we have already said , however , this self-consciousness is philosophy ; and towards it at least all human life must continually struggle , so far as it is vigorous and sound . Nay , a bad life must rest in some consciousness too , often , to be sure , very dark , of its own meaning and tendency ; *nd so far this also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , whether men consider it or not , go ever hand in hand together . It is perfectly ridiculous , therefore , to think or speak of the world as having power to accomplish its history without philosophy ; as much so , as though we should dream that society might exist without government . It would be indeed something most strange and unaccountaIde , that the human mind should have shown such an inveterate propensity through all ages to speculate in this way , in spite of all discouragement and seemingly bad success , if there had been no reason for it other than its own vagrant curiosity or lawless self-will . The world has never been without its philosophy , as far back as we find it exhibiting any signs whatever of a moral or intellectual life . Christianity wrought no change in it , with regard to this point . Many in modern times have charged the early Church with unfaithfulness to her Master , in permitting the great truths of the Gospel to become a subject of school speculation ; as though it might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faith , without their being made to enter thus , with new informing power , into the actual thinking of the world as well as into its actual life . And yet is not the thinking of the world , at all times , inseparably identified with its life ; or rather , is it not the very soul through which this itself lives , the central stream that carries all forward in its own direction ? If Christianity were to be something more than a religion of blind mechanical tradition ; if it should at all make good its claim to be the absolute truth of the world , the eternal consummation of humanity itself ; it must introduce itself into the actual process of the world 's history as it stood , so as to fulfil and not destroy the original sense of it , in all its complicated parts . We might as well ask , that it should not meddle with the *sphere of politics , as that it should abjure all interest in philosophy . The early Church soon found herself compelled to speculate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regenerate its intelligence and reason . And so in all periods since , we find philosophy closely interwoven with the activity of the church under other forms , and refusing to part with its authority for the human mind , so far as this can be said to have made any historical progress at all. , The Reformers , in the sixteenth century , imagined at first , indeed , that their cause required its entire banishment from the territory of religion ; but they were soon compelled themselves to have recourse again to its aid ; and in the end , the old order of things in this direction was fully established throughout the Protestant world . How vain , in viewof all ti*is , to quarrel // with philosophy , as though it were an interest false and pernicious in its own nature . We might , with as much reason , quarrel with the waters of the Susquehannah , for making their way towards the sea . The world must think ; would not be true to itself , if it ceased tothink ; and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without moving at the same time in the channel of some philosophical system , that may represent more *r less clearly the unity of its general life . It will follow , moreover , from this view of the necessary relation in which philosophy stands to the life of the world , that it is not so entirely without rule and method in its course , as is taken for granted by the wholesale objection we are now considering . If it form an original and essential part of man 's constitution , it must have a history , comprehended in the general flow of human*history as a whole . But history implies organic unity and progress . It is just the opposite of chaos . Such onward movement , exhibiting the present always as at once the birth of the past and the womb of the future , belongs to the very conception of humanity ; as much so as it does also , that it should exist by resolution into a vast system of nations , families and individuals . Distribution in time , and distribution in space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent fact , through which the idea of man is made real . To be human , then , is to be at the same time historical , in the sense here explained . If we should say that the world is not bound together by the force , of a common life , at any given time , but is made up of nations and men confusedly thrown into one mass in an outward and mechanical way ; it would not be a greater wrong to our nature than it is made to suffer , when this life is not apprehended as a continuous process also , always different and yet always the same , extending perpetually from one generation over to another . In fact , the two conceptions can not be held asunder . There is no alternative here between CO8*O8 and chaos . To be organic at all , the world must be historical ; and its history must show itself especially in the progressive development of humanity , as a whole , towards its appointed end . This we might seem justified to assume , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no other view can we conceive of the world as carrying in itself a divine sense and meaning , so as to be the mirror truly of an idea in the mind of God . God is not the author of confusion , either in nature or history . He upholds and rules the world by plan ; and this plan takes hold of the end from the beginning , bearing all life steadily forward as a process in its own service . In this way , every sphere of our general human existence comes to its proper evolution only in the form of history ; and so we should expect to find it pre-eminently in the case of philosophy , representing , as this does , the inmost consciousness of the race itself from age to age . The idea of an absolutely stationary philosophy , mechanically at hand as something ripe and done , for the use of the world through all time , is an absurd contradiction . How could it then represent the world 's life , in its ever-flowing actual form ? Change and revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they not be but the necessary action of history itself , as it forces its way onward continually from one stage of thought and life to another ? For this process , it should be remembered , is not by uniform movement , in the same direction and under the same character . It goes by stadia or eras ; not unlike those great world-cycles which geologists undertake to describe in the primitive formation of the earth , only compressed into much narrower dimensions . Each period has , of course , its own history , including the rise and decline again of its particular life , and the breaking up of its whole constitution finally , to make room for a new spiritual organization ; and all this must necessarily be attended with some show of chaotic confusion , to the view , at least , of the su* perficial thinker ; while it is still possible that the whole may be , notwithstanding , in obedience throughout to the same great law of development and progress . Such an onward movement is found to characterize in fact the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cradle in the ancient Oriental world , down to the present time . Philosophy has its own history , capable of being studied and understood , like the history of any other sphere of human life . This may be so dark still indeed as to leave room , atmany points , 1848. 147 // for uncertainty , and controversy , and doubt . All history is open more or less to the same difficulty ; but still its general sense , and the force at least of its great leading epochs , are sufficiently clear . It is only the unphilosophical and uninquiring , who pronounce the record of the world 's life in this form , a farrago of unmeaning , disconnected opinions and dreams . In proportion as any man can be engaged to direct his own attention to the subject , in the way of earnest thought , he will feel the deep unreasonableness of this presumption . The history of mind he will se* to be something more than chaos , " without form and void . " Alas for us indeed , if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order in its outward material structure , only to make room for an interminable soul-chaos within ! It would go far at once to break the force of much of the prejudice that is entertained against philosophy , if only this idea of a historical development in the case of our world-life generally , as its necessary and proper form , were fairly familiar to our minds . We should then understand , that the very same life , in passing upwards through different stages , may be expected to show itself under different phases or aspects , without yet falling for this reason into any s'elf-contradiction ; and in this way we would ' be rescued from the narrow bigotry of measuring all past ages by our own , while at the same time we might be prepared to estimate intelligently the actual advantages of our position , in its advanced relation to the past . As the self-consciousness of the individual has different contents in childhood and riper age , and must necessarily migrate through a succession of forms in order that it may become complete ; so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world as a whole , that it too can assert its proper reality only by living itself , from age to age , upwards into new and higher forms , till the process shall become complete in the full completion of humanity itself  --  the glorious , all-harmonious millennium of creation . It does not follow , then , that a system of philosophy has been nugatory and null in its own time , because it has come to be exploded , as we say , and superseded by some fol lowing system . We have no right to declare the wisdom of Plato and Aristotle vain , and just as little to deride the speculations of the medieval schoolmen as learned nonsense , merely because their authority has long since passed away . The Greek philosophy comprehended both truth and power for the use of the world , in its own time . It entered largely into the growth and education of the human spirit . And in this way it still continues to live also , in the organic progress of human thought . The acquisitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downfall of the systems in which they may have seemed originally to inhere ; they are simply translated into the constitution of other systems , and so carried forward in the vast intellectual process to which these belong . In a deep sense we may say of all history , that it is thus a perpetual metempsychosis of the world 's life , by which it is always new and yet always the same . We may easily see , now , how little room there is for the fashionably vulgar imagination , that philosophy has little or nothing to do with the realities of actual life . There is indeed a latitude of meaning sometimes allowed to the term , especially in England and our own country , by which it is supposed to be saved from this reproach in part ; though only in such a way as to fall more clearly under the power of it beyond the bounds of such exception . In the sense to which we refer , philosophy is taken to be a scientific insight simply into the nature and force of things empirically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual world . In this way we may have a philosophy of mind , by a sort of spiritual anatomical dissection , and then*a philosophy of nature also as something altogether different ; and however it may be with the first , it can easily be shown that this last is capable of being turned to many important practical uses . Witness only the wonders that are now wrought by steam , and the brilliant , though silent , action of the electro-magxietic telegraph . Philosophy in such shape means something , and has a value that can be made tangible to the world 's common sense . It is the glory of our own age , too , in particular , that it is made to carry its salutary power into every nook and corner of our common material // existence . We have a philosophy of farming , a philosophy of manufactures , and a philosophy of trade . We make our shoes and bake our bread philosophically . We talk , with equal ease , of the philosophy of the heavens and the philosophy of a plum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the practical use of philosophy , as occupied with the laws of our own reason and will , in the same Baconian style-provided always the process be not pushed too far . The science of mind , as handled by Locke , may help us possibly to think correctly ; while the science of ethics , as unfolded in the same way by Paley , may se7r*ve to assist us occasionally in distinguishing between right and wrong . But here the concession is required to stop . For philosophy , as the science of ideas , or as it is sometimes called , the science of the absolute , which is after all the only proper sense of the term , our common system of thinking is apt to entertain no respect whatever , in the general view now noticed . It is regarded as unprofitable metaphysics , of some service possibly for dialectic practice in the schools , but of no conceivable use besides in our ordinary mundane experience . For does it not in fact profess to go beyond the bounds of this experience ; showing itself thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit to be referred to the visionary moon , than to this solid material earth we now inhabit ? Is it not , by its own confession , the science of ideas and not the science of facts ? It is in reference to such philosophy especially , that the question has been triumphantly asked : What has it done to improve the actual life of the world , from the days of Plato down to the present*. hour ? Has it ever manufactured , not a steamboat , not so much as a pin only , in the service of the world 's comfort ? Has it descended at all into contact with the real wants of man ? Has it added one luxury to his table , or coined a single dollar of new wealth for his pocket ? The whole force of this plausible representation , we say , is broken by the view we have now taken of the true nature of philosophy , and its necessary relation to the onward historical explication of the great mystery of humanity . The " chief end of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create railroa4s , and telegraphs , and great Lowell establishments , for his own comfort ; to seize the reins of nature in a merely outward way , and force her chariot wheels to move subservient to his simply physical accommodation . All this is right , indeed , in its place , and we mean not to undervalue or condemn the march of improvement in such outward form . Man is appointed to be the tamer and subduer of nature , and it is reasonable and fit that this should be brought to serve him , with absolute and universal submission . It is the proper prerogative of Mind , its grand moral vocation , we may say , in the world , thus to assert and proclaim its supremacy over Matter ; as it is the true glory of this last , again , to be ruled and filled by the self-conscious presence of the first . But this lordship , to be true and right , must be moral as well as physical , inward no less than outward ; it must be the supremacy of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potent magician of science , at whos** bidding the spirits of the vasty deep stand ready , in shape of steam , tempest and lightning , to execute his pleasure . The only true mastery over the world at last , is that by which man is brought at the same time to master himself , in the clear apprehension and spontaneous election of goodness and truth in their absolute form . This is something more than agricultural chemistry , or the rattling machinery of cotton factories and rolling mills . It is by the power of the spiritual at last , that the full sense of the world , whether as spirit or n*mture , is to be evolved , and the full triumph of humanity , as sung in the eighth psalm , carried out to its grand consummation . The chief end of man is , not to know and rule the world simply as it stands beyond his particular person , but to know and rule it in the form of reason and will , as the inmost constitution of his own life . As in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his bodily organs for mere bodily ends is in itself no argument of either strength or freedom , but can become of account only as such active power may be itself comprehended in the higher activity of the soul , moving always in obedience to its own law ; so here , also , it is nothing less than the same moral self-consciousness and self-government , that can impart either dignity or value to any dominion we may 1848. 149 // be brought to exercise over external nature , by virtue of our mere intelligence under any other form . But now this inward supremacy of mind over matter , constituting thus the self-consciousness of the world itself through the medium of the human spirit , is something which lifts us at once into the sphere of philosophy . It is emphatically at last the power of the ideal as compared with the power of the actual , the ascendency of the abs*ute , ( universal reason and universal will , ) over the force of all that is simply empirical and particular . Philosophy , we say then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not indeed upon its immediate surface , but in the very foundations of the great deep of which it consists . Away with the heresy , dishonorable to man and God alike , that this world is ruled supremely by material forces , or simply sensuous interests of any kind . In the face of Heaven , we proclaim it false ! Of all forms of power that enter into its constitution , there is none to compare with that which belongs to mind , in the form of the Idea . This is more than tempest , lightning and steam ; more than whirlwind , cataract and fire ; more than the noise of many waters , or the tumult of the people surging and roaring with passion . Not by might , nor by power , but by my Spirit , saith the Lord , shall the great purposes of this world be ultimately carried . There is nothing under heaven so omnipotent among men , as the presence of an Idea , in its true concepjion , represmiting , as it does always in fact , the inmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thundering noise that marks the progress of history , it is only here at last we communicate with its soul , and are made to understand the true motive power which actuates its wheels . Men may talk as they please about their mechanics , and politics , and tactics  --  the world is governed , when all is done , by the power of Ideas ; and the deepest thinkers , though far out of sight , it may be in the solitude of the closet , are still ever in the end , by divine right , the royal oligarchy , that preside over its affairs , and conduct them forward towards their proper end . No great revolution has ever yet occurred , that took not its birth first from the womb of an Idea . No department of our life can be advanced towards perfection , save through the presence of the same force . And shall we say , then , that philosophy , the science of the Idea , whose very province it is to bring the world to a consciousness of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we understand ourselves , or possess our own nature fully , in any respect , without its aid ? No general activity , whether in the form of thought or will , can deserve to he regarded as at all complete , that is not controlled by the light of philosophy , if not directly , at least in an indirect and circuitous way . Such being the case , we may not admit , of course , that philosophy is necessarily unfriendly to religion . We have seen already , that it has entered largely into the history of Christianity from the beginning ; though efforts have been made from time to time , with more zeal than clear knowledge , to sunder the church entirely from its connection . All such efforts have proved to be of no account thus far , and will continue to be of no account always , just because philosophy is a necessary condition of our general human life ; and to renounce the one in this absolute way , were to renounce the other also to the same extent . If Christianity be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must so adjust itself to the actual constitution of man in its previous form , or rather so take this up into its own constitution in the way of natural consummation , that nothing belonging to it of right shall he destroyed , but the whole on the contrary show itself , under a higher form , more perfect than before . No wrong to the Gospel can well be more egregious , than that by which its power is limited and restrained to a part only of the general organism of the world 's life ; while other spheres , clearly included in this from the beginning , are violently thrust out from the range of its action , as hopelessly profane , and incapable of sanctification . It is a libel on Christ , to say that his religion has nothing to do with politics , or the fine arts ; or the sciences , or common social life . It mu8t unite itself with all these , inwardly and profoundly , so as to transfigure them fully into its own image , before it shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should it deserve to be acknowledged the 150 Feb. , // universal truth of man 's life ? And so it is something monstrous also in the same way , to affirm of Christianity , that it has nothing to do with philosophy . Is ignorance then , after all , the mother of devotion ; or must the inmost walks of consciousness be barred against the approach of religion , in order to preserve this sound and pure ? Christianity claims to be the proper rightful magistracy of man 's entire nature , the power to which all belongs , and by which all requires to be occupied and ruled . It must enter then into the thinking of the world , as well as into its willing and working ; and it can not actualize itself in full , except as it is brought to reign thus , with proper symmetrical development , throughout its whole life . To say that Christianity should have no fellowship with philosophy , comes simply to this in the end , that the contents of faith are not formed to become ever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its own nature , incapable of being reflected in the consciousness of its subject under an intelligible form ; thatit is to be received and held , from first to last , in the way of mechanical outward tradition , on the ground , simply , of the foreign authority by which it comes authenticated to our confidence and trust . But is not religion the inmost life of our human being itself ; and must not the precept , Know thyself , extend to it always as the necessary issue , in which alone the knowledge for which it calls can become complete ? Strange that any should hold it man 's privilege and calling , by the indefeasible right of his intelligence itself , to penetrate the interior sense of the world around him in the way of knowledge , and yet count it little better than profane for him to think of penetrating the interior sense of his own nature , as unfolded to his consciousness in the Christian revelation . Is it not the prerogative of intellect , to be self-intelligent ? and is it possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the inmost substance of its very life , without inchiding in itself , at the same time , a capacity at Least for being made transparent to its own vision in this way ? It lies in its very conception , that it should form thus , when complete , the self-consciousness of the world , in its deepest and most comprehensive sense . This is not to make Christianity dependent on philosophy in any way , for its existence . No process of thinking , on the part of men , could ever originate or discover religion in this form ; just as little as it might be supposed to originate or discover the constitution of the natural earth and heavens . Christ , and the new creation revealed throug'h him , are not a thought simply , but a fact , such as philosop1*y has no power either to make or unmake . But this is only to say , that philosophy has no power to make or unmake the world 's life in any view . The province of philosophy is not to create truth in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the reflected consciousness of its subject . It is truth itself in the form of self-knowledge ; and in this view , there is no reason surely why Christianity should treat it as false and profane , but every reason on the contrary that it should be made welcome to the Christian sphere , as its rightful sanctuary and home . But we are pointed to actual history in proof of its pernicious power in the view now noticed . It has been from the beginning , we are told , the fruitful mother of heresies and corruptions in the ch*urch . And has it not ever shown a sort of native affinity with atheism and infidelity ? Has it not , more or less , openly proclaimed itself the enemy of Christ , from the days of Ammonius Saccas and Origen down to the days of Immanuel Kant , and from the epoch of the Critical Philosophy onward again , with . rapid development , to the culmination of this modern movement in the pantheism of Hegel ? This only shows , we may reply , that philosophy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity has not yet fully mastered the inward life of the world . But this is nothing more than we find abundantly made evident to us , in the manifestation of the world 's life also under other forms . Art , science , government , all have exhibited , in the progress of Christian history thus far , a more or less unfriendly relation to the Christian consciousness , refusing to acknowledge and accept it as the only proper form of their own being . But what then ? Shall we abjure all art , science and politics , for this reason , as necessarily unholy and profane ? Or shall we say Vhat their whole past history 184&amp; ) 151 // has been false and without - value , as not springing directly from Christ ? And why then should we entertain any such judgment in regard to philosophy , which at last is but the consciousness which enters into all these , and makes them to be what they are in fact ? It comes simply to this , when all is done , that philosophy is not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infidel position , if it assume to be in its own separate nature sufficient for the ultimate purposes of man 's life , as comprehended in Christianity , and in Christianity alone . But although philosophy be not thus the actual power of the divine fact itself , it may be said to constitute , nevertheless , the interior fundamental form of the world 's life , on which the power in question is required to make itself felt  --  the posture of humanity at any given time , in its relation to the great regenerative process by which it is thus to be transformed finally into the full image of God . In this view , philosophy is a great fact too - nothing more nor less , indeed , than the self-consciousness always of the world itself , at such stage of its historical development as it may have reached at the time ; and as such a fact , it must be respected by Christianity , in order that this may at all take hold on the vast worldprocess to which it belongs , in a real way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's life , must become philosophical , by endeavoring continually to work itself into the consciousness of the world as it stands , for the p*irpose of thus helping it forward into a form that may be found fully commensurate at last with its own divine contents . The ultimate problem , of course , is the full reconciliation of the two powers here brought into view , in such way that neither shall be allowed to do violence to the other , but both come finally to harmonious union , as form and substance in the actualization of all that is comprehended in the idea of humanity . But it lies in this conception itself , that they should continually seek each - other in the resolution also of this problem , and be more or less interwoven thrqugh all the process by which it is to be accomplished . Christianity must enter the mind of the world as it is , to secure any permanent power in its life . Philosophy , it deserves to be well remembered and earnestly laid to heart , is the only medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into triumphant contact with the actual universal life of man , as it stands , in the form either of art , or science , or political organization . An unphilosophical Christianity may be sufficient to save a multitude of individual souls for heaven , but it can never conquer the world . Admitting , too , that philosophy has its ck*ngers for Christianity as well as for life generally , it must be kept in mind that the want of philosophy is always something more full of peril still . Religion can not be made so practical as to stand in no relation whatever to intelligence and thought . It must ever rest in a theory of some kind , that will be found to rule and condition its influence upon the world . If this theory be not philosophically sound , it will be philosophically unsound and false ; and as a medium of communication with the world 's life , it will to the same extent be a barrier to the proper power of the Gospel , as appointed for its salvation . We have , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term , who affect to hold Christianity ( greatly differing at the same time , to be sure , about its true form ) directly from Christ and the Bible , without the help of any theory whatever , as the medium of its apprehension . But it needs no very deep philosophy certainly-though the case itself shows that it calls for some  --  to perceive the utter vanity , nay , profound absurdity , of every such pretension . The greatest slaves of theory , commonly , are just those who profess to have none ; only their theory includes in itself no life , but resolves itself at last into the power of blind , tyrannical , tradition . If we need to be cautioned against philosophy , we need still more perhaps at this time , at least here in America , to be cautioned against the tendency that seeks to bring all philosophy among us into discredit , and which would exclude its authority , only the more effectually to bind the yoke of its own ceremonialism upon our necks . However it may be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what is wanted among ourselves , to bring our life generally into right form , is not less philosophy than we have at present , but , if it were possible , a great deal more . There is a sad disproportion , in our general 152 Feb. , // American life , between outward activity and inward consciousness ; which implies , however , so far as it prevails , a want of full self-possession and self-control , in the case of our outward activity itself ; a want that is extensively felt already throughout the social system to which it belongs , and that may ' be expected to work itself out sooner or later , if not met with proper seasonable remedy , into the most disastrous , if not absolutely fatal , practical results . We need earnest , profound THOUGhT , born and cradled in the inmost philosophical consciousness of the age , by which to understand the problem we are called to solve as a nation , and so to turn our action to right account . Action , of course , is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our nature , not simply to mirror in itself the sense of the surrounding world , but to mould this also into its own image ; and it is only under this form , th4 it can ever possibly show itself complete . Philosophy without action , is always something helpless , and liable to disease , as we see exemplified on a large scale in the history of speculation among the modern Germans . But then , action without philosophy will be found just as little worthy to be trusted also , in the end , for the great purposes of human life . No imagination can well be more false , than to suppose that our American practical talent is sufficient of itself to accomplish all that is comprehended properly in our vocation as a people . Power , to be efficient for moral ends , must be accompanied with light . The force of mind , sundered from the inward illustration that should of right go with it always , is made to resemble , more or less , the force of mere nature , and becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mountain torrent . It may carry all before it for a time , but the action , at last , is neither rational nor free . We need not only the energy of will , which now distinguishes us above all the nations of the earth , but the clear insight of speculative reason , also* to clothe our will with its full right to be thus energetic and strong . Let our national spirit be brought to know and possess itself fully in a free way , so that the action of the nation , in all the spheres of its life , may be filled and ruled with the soul of a true self-consciousness , VOL . I. NO . II . NEW SERIES . 11 in the form of philosophy , and we shall then be prepared to fulfill indeed the high destiny that seems to be assigned to us on the part of Heaven . Such a union of ac. tion and speculation , joined with the vast resources of our outward life , and the mighty scope thrown open to us by the genius of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in due time , far beyond all the world has yet been permitted to reach , in the way of moral progress , under any other form . May we not say , indeed , that this is the very problem of problems , which our new-born America is called at this time to solve , for the universal benefit of men in all time to come ? At present , as already remarked , we are manifestly suffering through the want of speculation , and not from its excess . Action is allowed too often to overwhelm or crowd out thought . There reigns among us , indeed , a wide-spread prejudice against philosophy , in its true and proper character , which makes it difficult to secure any earnest attention to its claims in any quarter . In the mean time , besides , to make the case still worse , a false empirical scheme of thought , ( since all action must have some spiritual bottom on which to rest in this way , ) claiming to be philosophy itself , though only its wretched caricature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sides , and is now ready to resist all deeper thinking , as an invasion upon its own rights . The general character of this bastard philosophy is , that it affects to measure all things , both on earth and in heaven , by the categories of the common abstract understanding , as it stands related simply to the world of time and sense . These categories , however , being in themselves the forms or types only of things in this outward world ; and representing therefore the conditions merely of existence in space and time-something relative always and finite by the very nature of the case-become necessarily one-sided and false , the moment we attempt to carry their authority beyond these limits , and to apply them to the truths of the pure reason . This has been . triumphantly shown by Kant , in his immortal work oii the subject ; whose argument thus far , at least , can never be nullifled by the ske*ical use to which it was turned in his own hands , but only makes 1848. // it . necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should be understood , and borne in mind always , that the skepticism of Kant is not something from which we escape by falling back simply on the sensuous philosophy , once for all demolished by his gigantic criticism . As against this , his argument and the bad use he makes of it , are alike legitimate and sound . With the premises of Locke , it is not possible successfully to withstand the reasoning of David Hume ; and the reasoning of David I*ume , * brought to understand itself , and pushed out to its proper universal form , conducts us over with like necessity to the critical Idealism of Immanuel Kant . If our knowledge can have no oth , er ground on iyhich to rest , than that which is offered to us in the forms of the sensible world , as apprehended through categories of thought , simply answerable to their outward and finite nature , it ought to be clear , surely , that it can not reach , with any true force , and as knowledge , to objects that lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so , indeed , building its faith in the absolute and infinite upon deductions from the simply relative and finite . This pretension , false from the beginning , Kant has fairly and forever overturned , leaving the world , so far as that philosophy could help it , without any sure hold upon a single truth beyond the range of its present experience . And yet it is just this false and helpless system of thinking that still insists , too generally among ourselves , on its right to rule our whole life , and that is ready , alas ! on all sides , to stigmatize as transcendental nonsense , if not something still worse , every attempt that is made to go beyond itself in the way of earnest and profound speculation . The whole tendency of this philosophy is towards materialism and infidelity ; as we may see abundantly exemplified by its past history in other parts of the world , particularly in France . It may be associated , it is true , with an opposite system ; as commonly in this country , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarly its own province . But sQ far as such connection goes , it is outward only and traditional , not inward and real . The philosophy itself has no power to reach the . spiritual and supernatural , and in pretending to do so , only drags it , in fact , downward into its own sphere , so that it is in the end truly neither one nor the other . It reasons from time to eternity with vast dexterity and ease ; establishing , by strict Baconian comparison and induction , the existence of God , the immortality of the soul , and the truth ot revelation ; but it is all in such a way as turns eternity itself into time , and forces the whole invisible world to become a mere abstraction from the world of sense . The empirical understanding affects to become transcendent , ( as Kant calls it , ) and may please itself with the imagination of having actually grasped in this way the truth which lies beyond its own horizon ; but it is the illusion of one who dreams himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep : the object grasped , when all is done , belongs to the sphere of sense , and not to the sphere of spirit . This philosophy makes no room at all for ideas , in the proper sense of the term ; its ideas are all intellectual abstractions merely , that as such carry in themselves no necessary or universal force . How is it possible , that s*uch a system should have depth or strength ; that it should penetrate the interior sense of life , in any quarter ; or that it should communicate true spiritual earnestness to the general character and conduct of men , in any direction ? All the higher interests of*our nature must necessarily be made to suffer , wherever it prevails . The bad power of this system is widely exemplified among us , in our reigning indifference to philosophy itself , and our want of faith generally in the objects with which it is of right concerned . Speculati ) n and action are very commonly regarded as opposite spheres , only outwardly related to each other ; in which view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent interest , on its own account . It is either held to be of no force for actual life at all  --  the unprofitable metaphysical pugilism , merely , of the . schools , by which the world can never be made wiser or better-or else , to save it from such reproach , it is forced to quit the skies wholly , and become the mere shadowy echo of experience and " common sense , " as it is called , in the service of directly material ends . It is pursued accordingly either as a pastime 154 Feb. , // only , or as a restricted trade . Few have any faith in philosophy as the original and rightful mistress of life . Few have any firm , solid belief in the reality of ideas , as anything more than the generalizations of sense , or the wisely calculated results of common utilitarian experience . He is counted too generally to be the best philosopher , whose thinking is found to move most fully in the orbit of the common understanding , while it shows itself at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and end , and is crowned at last with the largest percentage , in the way of practical benefit and profit . The bearing of all this on our national life , is sufficiently plain in every direction . Our literature and science , our economics and politics , nay , our very ethics and divinity , are all made to suffer in the same way . They are not properly scientific . The defect is particularly obvious and worthy of notice , in our general system of education . Whatever advantages this may possess in other respects , it is characterized almost universally by a sad want of true philosophical spirit . The idea of a separate department or faculty of philosophy , as necessary to complete the conception of a university education , is almost gone from our minds . The prejudice of tradition is indeed too strong , to allow its total banishment from our colleges , in an open and formal way . Every institution feels itself bound to include in its course of studies something which it is pleased to I dignify with the title of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a sort of crowning distinction in honor of the Senior year . But the crown , alas ! is not what it ought to be , the keystone of the academic arch , that binds and supports the whole ; it is at best an outside ornament simply , of most light and airy structure , set loosely on its summit , of which , in a short time , no trace whatever is to be found . We may safely say , that the way in which philosophy is taught and studied in our colleges generally , is suited only to bring it into discredit . It stands in no organic connection with the course as a whole ; it is handled in the most mechanical and external way , as a thing of simple memory and report ; and to complete the misery , it is acknowledged only in a form which subverts its whole sense , by substituting for it a poor parody that is wholly unwoi-thy*of its name . In its own nature the most earnest of interests , it is thus metamorphosed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in such circumstances , it should appear shorn of all strength . We need not wonder , that the interest of liberal study generally , deprived in this way of its proper soul , should be made to suffer at every point . An earnest philosophy is indispensable to an earnest education , as through this again it is indispensable to all real earnestness in life.
