txt INTRODUCTION . William Kemp was a comic actor of high reputation . Like Tarlton , whom he succeeded " as wel in the fauour of her Maiesty as in the opinion and good thoughts of the generall audience , " v:1 he usually played the Clown , and was greatly applauded for his buffoonery , his extemporal wit , v:2 and his performance of the Jig. v:3 That at one time ,  --  perhaps from about 1589 to 1593 or later  --  he belonged to a Company under the management of the celebrated Edward Alleyn , is proved by the title-page of a dramavi:1 which will be afterwards cited . At a subsequent period he was a member of the Company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Servants , who played during summer at the Globe , and during winter at the Blackfriars . In 1596 , while the last-mentioned house was undergoing considerable repair and enlargement , a petition was presented to the Privy Council by the principal inhabitants of the liberty , praying that the work might proceed no further , and that theatrical exhibitions might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appears to have been successful , was presented by the Lord Chamberlain 's Servants ; and , at its commencement , the names of the chief petitioners are thus arranged :  --  Thomas Pope , Richard Burbadge , John Hemings , Augustine Phillips , William Shakespeare , William Kempe , William Slye , and Nicholas Tooley. vi:2 When Romeo and Juliet and Much ado about Nothing were originally brought upon the stage , Kemp acted Peter and Dogberry ; vi:3 and it has been supposed that in other plays of Shakespeare ,  --  in The Two Gentlemen of Verona , As you like it , Hamlet , The Second Part of Henry the Fourth , and The Merchant of Venice , he performed Launce , Touchstone , the Grave-digger , Justice Shallow , and Launcelot . On the first production of Ben Jonson 's Every Man in his Humour , a charactervii:1 was assigned to him ; and there is good reason to believe that in Every Man out of his Humour , by the same dramatist , he represented Carlo Buffone . In 1599 Kemp attracted much attention by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to refute the lying ballads put forth concerning this exploit , as to testify his gratitude for the favours he had received during his " gambols , " vii:2 he published in the following year the curious pamphlet which is now reprinted . A Nine daies wonder was thus entered in the Stationers ' Books : " 22 Aprilis 1600 " Mr. Linge Entered for his copye under the handes of Mr. Harsnet &; Mr. vid . " Man warden a booke called Kemps morris to Norwiche. vii:3 Ben Jonson alludes to this remarkable journey in Every Man out of his Humour , originally acted in 1599 , where Carlo Buffone is made to exclaim " Would I had one of Kemp 's shoes to throw after you ! " viii:1 and again in his Epigrams :  --  " or which Did dance the famous morris unto Norwich . " viii:2 So also William Rowley in the prefatory Address to a very rare tract called A Search for Money , &c.,; 1609 , 4to. :  --  " Yee haue beene either eare or eye-witnesses or both to many madde voiages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the trauell to Rome with the returne in certaine daies , the wild morrise to Norrige , " &c.; And Brathwait in Remains after Death , &c.; 1618 , 12mo. has the following lines :  --  " Vpon Kempe and his morice , with his Epitaph . " Welcome from Norwich , Kempe ! all joy to see Thy safe returne moriscoed lustily . But out , alasse , how soone 's thy morice done ! When Pipe and Taber , all thy friends be gone , And leaue thee now to dance the second part With feeble nature , not with nimble Art ; Then all thy triumphs fraught with strains of mirth Shall be cag 'd vp within a chest of earth : Shall be ? they are : th'ast danc 'd thee out of breath , And now must make thy parting dance with death . " viii:3 Towards the end of a Nine daies wonder , Kemp announces his intention of setting out shortly on a " great journey ; " ix:1 but as no record of this second feat has come down to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The date of his death has not been determined . Malone , in the uncertainty on this point , could only adduce the following passage of Dekker 's Guls Horne-booke , 1609 , from which , he says , " it may be presumed " ix:3 that Kemp was then deceased : " Tush , tush , Tarleton , Kemp , nor Singer , nor all the litter of fooles that now come drawling behinde them , neuer plaid the Clownes more naturally then the arrantest Sot of you all . " ix:4 George Chalmers , however , discovered an entry in the burial register of St. Saviour 's , Southwark  --  " 1603 , November 2d William Kempe , a man ; " ix:5 and since the name of Kemp does not occur in the license granted by King James , 19th May , 1603 , to the Lord Chamberlain 's Company ( who in consequence of that instrument were afterwards denominated his Majesty 's Servants ) there is great probability that the said entry relates to the comedian , and that he had been carried off by the plague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which exhibit Kemp in propria persona , must necessarily form a portion of the present essay . The Retvrne from Pernassvs : Or The Scourge of Simony . Publiquely acted by the Students in Saint Johns Colledge in Cambridge , 1606 , x:1 4to. furnishes the first extract : " Act 4 . Scen. 5. 3 . Enter Burbage and Kempe . " Bur . Now , Will Kempe , if we can intertaine these schollers at a low rate , it wil be well ; they haue oftentimes a good conceite in a part . " Kempe . Its true indeed , honest Dick ; but the slaues are somewhat proud , and , besides , it is a good sport , in a part to see them neuer speake in their walke but at the end of the stage , iust as though in walking with a fellow we should neuer speake but at a stile , a gate , or a ditch , where a man can go no further . I was once at a Comedie in Cambridge , and there I saw a parasite make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bur . A little teaching will mend these faults , and it may bee , besides , they will be able to pen a part . " Kemp .

Why , heres our fellow Shakespeare puts them all downe , I , xi:2 and Ben Jonson too . O that Ben Jonson is a pestilent fellow ! he brought vp Horace giuing the Poets a pill , xi:3 but our fellow Shakespeare hath giuen him a purge that made him beray his credit . " Bur . Its a shrewd fellow indeed . I wonder these schollers stay so long ; they appointed to be here presently that we might try them : oh , here they come . Enter Philomusus and Studioso . " Stud .

Well , you merry knaues , you may come to the honor of it one day : is it not better to make a foole of the world as I haue done , then to be fooled of the world as you schollers are ? But be merry , my lads : you haue happened vpon the most excellent vocation in the world for money ; they come North and South to bring it to our playhouse ; and for honours , who of more report then Dick Burbage and Will Kempe ? he is not counted a Gentleman that knowes not Dick Burbage and Wil Kempe ; there 's not a country wench that can dance Sellengers Roundxii:1 but can talke of Dick Burbage and Will Kempe .

Sir Thomas , Sir Anthony , Mr. Robert Shirley . As it is now play 'd by her Maiesties Seruants , 1607 , xiv:2 4to . Sir Anthony Shirley having been sent to Italy as ambassador from the Sophy , the following scene is supposed to take place at Venice . " Enter servant . " Ser .

" xvii:1 When , in the former of these scenes , Kemp is said to be " famous for workes in print , " I understand the ironical compliment as an allusion to his Nine daies wonder only ; for I feel assured that all the other pieces which I now proceed to notice , have been erroneously attributed to his pen . A Dvtifvl Invective , Against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Adherents , latelie executed . Together with the horrible attempts and actions of the Q. of Scottes : and the Sentence pronounced against her at Fodderingay . Newlie compiled and set foorth , in English verse : For a Newyeares gifte to all loyall English subiects , by W. Kempe . Imprinted at London by Richard Jones , dwelling at the signe of the Rose and crowne , neere Holborne bridge , 1587. 4to. ( four leaves ) is assigned to our comedian in Ritson 's Bibl . Poet . , Collier 's Hist. of Engl . Dram . Poet. xviii:1 &c.,; &c.; The writer calls it " the first fruites of his labour , " and dedicates it " To the right honorable my very good Lord , George Barne , L. Maior of the Cittie of London . " It opens thus : " What madnes hath so mazd mens minds , that they can not forsee The wretched ends of catiues vile , which work by treacherie , To ouerthrowe the blessed state of happie common wealth , Or to depriue their soueraigne prince of her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawes were clearlie out of minde , If feare of death ( by Princes lawes ) might not their dueties binde , If vtter ruine of the Realme , and spoile of guiltlesse blood , Might not suffice to stay the rage of traitors cruell moode , Yet might they well consider howe treasons come to nought , But alwaies worke their ouerthrowe by whom they first were wrought , " &c.; Towards the end , the loyalty of the author becomes so extravagant , that in a prayer for Queen Elizabeth , he exclaims :  --  " Prolong her daies we pray thee , Lord , and if it be thy will , Let vs not ouerliue her raigne , but let vs haue her still ! " As the comedian expressly declares that the Nine daies wonder was the " first Pamphlet that euer Will Kemp offred to the Presse , " xix:1 there can be no doubt that this Dvtiful Invective was written by some other individual of the name ; perhaps by the William Kempe who published in the following year a book entitled The Education of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a schoolmaster at Plymouth. xix:2 During the earlier period of the English stage , after the play was concluded , the audience were commonly entertained by a Jig . As no piece of that kind is extant , we are unable to ascertain its nature with precision ; but it appears to have been a ludicrous metrical composition , either spoken or sung by the Clown , and occasionally accompanied by dancing and playing on the pipe and tabor . More persons than one were sometimes employed in a jig ; and there is reason to believe that the performance was of considerable length , occupying even the space of an hour. xx:1 The following entries are given verbatim from the Stationers ' Books : " 28 December 1591 " Thomas Gosson Entred for his copie under thand of Mr Watkins , the Thirde and last vid. " parte of Kempes Iigge , soe yt apperteyne not to anie other .

" betwixt a souldior and a Miser and Sym the clown. xxi:2 These entries are quoted ( imperfectly ) by several antiquarian writers who have enumerated the comedian 's " works ; " but his own express declaration , which has alreadyxxi:3 removed the Dvtiful Invective from the list , can only be evaded , in the present case , by weakly arguing  --  that he did not consider a Jig as a pamphlet , or that the preceding entries relate to pieces which had been conveyed to the printer without his permission . My belief is that the Jigs in question were composed by regular dramatists , and that they were called " Kemp 's " merely because he had rendered them popular by his acting , and probably by flashes of extemporal wit . He tells us that he had " spent his life in mad Jiggesxxi:4 " ; and to one of those many entertainments Marston alludes in The Scovrge of Villanie , 1599 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You shall commaund him ; faith , you haue his hart Even capring in your fist . A hall , a hall , Roome for the spheres ! the orbes celestiall Will daunce Kempes Jigge. " xxii:1 I may also remark , that , if Kemp had been a practised jig-maker , he would hardly have required the assistance of a friend to furnish him with verses for the Nine daies wonder. xxii:2 A most pleasant and merie new Comedie , Intituled , A Knacke to knowe a Knaue . Newlie set foorth , as it hath sundrie tymes bene played by Ed . Allen and his Companie .

Jones , 7th January of the preceding year .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of it which the title-page distinguishes as " Kemps applauded Merrimentes of the men of Goteham " is comprehended in the following scene : " Enter mad men of Goteham , to wit , a Miller , a Cobler , and a Smith .

Exeunt omnes " xxiv:1 Like the pieces already noticed , " Kemps applauded Merrimentes of the men of Goteham " have been inserted in the catalogue of his " works . " xxiv:2 But surely the words of the title-page mean nothing more than ' merriments in which Kemp had been applauded ; ' and since it is not easy to imagine that the scene , as preserved in the printed copy , could have been received with any unusual degree of approbation even by the rudest audience , the probability is , that he enlivened his part , xxv:1 not only by his ever-welcome buffoonery , but also by sundry speeches of extemporal humour : see a passage in The Travailes of The three English Brothers , cited at p. xv . There can be no doubt that Kemp figured in other " merrimentes " besides those " of the men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times : " But , " says Nash to Gabriel Harvey , " by the meanes of his Greene 's death thou art depriued of the remedie in lawe which thou intendedst to haue had against him for calling thy Father Ropemaker .

Nihil pro nihilo , none in law ; what it will doe vpon the stage I can not tell , for there a man maye make action besides his part , when he hath nothing at all to say : and if there , it is but a clownish action that it will beare ; for what can bee made of a Ropemaker more than a Clowne ?

Wherein euery dayes journey is pleasantly set downe , to satisfie his friends the truth against all lying Ballad-makers ; what he did , how hee was welcome , and by whome entertained . * * * * * The first daies iourney , being the first Munday in cleane Lent , from the right honorable the Lord Mayors of London . The first mundaye in Lent , the close morning promising a cleere day , ( attended on by Thomas Slye3:10 my Taberer , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ouerseer , that I should take no other ease but my prescribed order ) my selfe , thats I , otherwise called Caualiero Kemp , head-master of Morrice-dauncers , high Head-borough of heighs , and onely tricker of your Trill-lilles and best bel-shangles3:15 betweene Sion and mount Surrey , 3:1 began frolickly to foote it from the right honorable the Lord Mayors of London towards the right worshipfull ( and truely bountifull ) Master Mayors of Norwich . My setting forward was somewhat before seauen in the morning ; my Taberer stroke up merrily ; and as fast as kinde peoples thronging together would giue mee leaue , thorow London I leapt . By the way many good olde people , and diuers others of yonger yeers , of meere kindnes gaue me bowd sixepences and grotes , blessing me with their harty prayers and God-speedes . Being past White-chappell , and hauing left faire London with all that North-east Suburb before named , multitudes of Londoners left not me : but eyther to keepe a custome which many holde , that Mile-end is no walke without a recreation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loue they beare toward me , or perhappes to make themselves merry if I should chance ( as many thought ) to giue over my Morrice within a Mile of Mile-end ; how euer , many a thousand brought me to Bow ; where I rested a while from dancing , but had small rest with those that would haue vrg 'd me to drinking . But , I warrant you , Will Kemp was wise enough : to their ful cups , kinde thanks was my returne , with Gentlemanlike protestations , as " Truely , sir , I dare not , " " It stands not with the congruity of my health . " Congruitie , said I ? how came that strange language in my mouth ? I thinke scarcely that it is any Christen worde , and yet it may be a good worde for ought I knowe , though I neuer made it , nor doe verye well understand it ; yet I am sure I have bought it at the word-mongers at as deare a rate as I could haue had a whole 100 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meane now to be more concise , and stand upon eeuener bases ; but I must neither stand nor sit , the Tabrer strikes alarum . Tickle it , good Tom , Ile follow thee . Farwell , Bowe ; haue ouer the bridge , where I heard say honest Conscience was once drownd : its pittye if it were so ; but thats no matter belonging to our Morrice , lets now along to Stratford Langton . Many good fellows being there met , and knowing how well I loued the sporte , had prepared a Beare-bayting ; but so unreasonable were the multitudes of people , that I could only heare the Beare roare and the dogges howle ; therefore forward I went with my hey-de-gaies4:30 to Ilford , where I againe rested , and was by the people of the towne and countrey there-about very very wel welcomed , being offred carowses in the great spoon , 4:1 one whole draught being able at that time to haue drawne my little wit drye ; but being afrayde of the olde Prouerbe ( He had need of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soberly gaue my boone Companyons the slip . From Ilford , by Moone-shine , I set forward , dauncing within a quarter of a myle of Romford ; where , in the highway , two strong Iades ( hauing belike some great quarrell to me vnknowne ) were beating and byting either of other ; and such through Gods help was my good hap , that I escaped their hoofes , both being raysed with their fore feete ouer my head , like two Smithes ouer an Anuyle . There being the end of my first dayes Morrice , a kinde Gentleman of London lighting from his horse , would haue no nay but I should leap into his saddle . To be plaine with ye , I was not proud , but kindly tooke his kindlyer offer , chiefely thereto vrg 'd by my wearines ; so I rid to my Inne at Romford . In that towne , to giue rest to my well-labour 'd limbes , I continued two dayes , being much beholding to the townsmen for their loue , but more to the Londoners that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more kindnes then I was willing to accept . The second dayes journey , beeing Thursday of the first weeke . Thursday being Market day at Burnt-wood , Tom Slye was earlyer up then the Lark , and sounded merrily the Morrice : I rowsed my selfe , and returned from Romford to the place wher I tooke horse the first night , dauncing that quarter of a myle backe againe thorow Romford , and so merily to Burnt-wood . Yet , now I remember it well , I had no great cause of mirth , for at Romford townes end I strained my hip , and for a time indured exceeding paine ; but being loath to trouble a Surgeon , I held on , finding remedy by labour that had hurt mee , for it came in a turne , and so in my daunce I turned it out of my seruice againe . The multitudes were so great at my comming to Burntwood , that I had much a doe ( though I made many intreaties and staies ) to get passage to my Inne . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of their companions followed mee from London ( as many better disposed persons did ) : but these two dy-doppers6:9 gaue out when they were apprehended , that they had laid wagers and betted about my journey ; wherupon the Officers bringing them to my Inne , I iustly denyed their acquaintance , sauing that I remembred one of them to be a noted Cut-purse , such a one as we tye to a poast on our stage , for all people to wonder at , when at a play they are taken pilfring6:13 . This fellow , and his half-brother , being found with the deed , were sent to Iayle : their other two consorts had the charity of the towne , and after a dance of Trenchmore6:18 at the whipping crosse , they were sent backe to London , where I am afraide there are too many of their occupation . To bee short , I thought myselfe well rid of foure such followers , and I wish hartily that the whole world were cleer of such companions6:22 . Hauing rested well at Burntwood , the Moone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the euening I tript it to Ingerstone , stealing away from those numbers of people that followed mee ; yet doe I what I could , I had about fiftie in the company , some of London , the other of the Country thereabout , that would needs , when they heard my Taber , trudge after me through thicke and thin . The third dayes journey , being Friday of the first weeke . On Friday morning I set forward towardes Chelmsford , not hauing past two hundred , being the least company that I had in the day-time betweene London and that place . Onward I went , thus easily followed , till I come to Witford-bridge , where a number of country people , and many Gentlemen and Gentlewomen were gathered together to see mee . Sir Thomas Mildmay , standing at his Parke pale7:7 , receiued gently a payre of garters of me ; gloues , points7:9 , and garters , being my ordinary marchandize , that I put out to venter for performance of my merry voyage7:9 . So much a doe I had to passe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an houre ere I could recouer my Inne gate , where I was faine to locke my selfe in my Chamber , and pacifie them with wordes out of a window insteed of deeds : to deale plainely , I was so weary , that I could dance no more . The next morning I footed it three myle of my way toward Braintree , but returned backe againe to Chelmsford , where I lay that Satterday and the next Sunday . The good cheere and kinde welcome I had at Chelmsford was much more than I was willing to entertaine ; for my onely desire was to refraine drinke and be temperate in my dyet . At Chelmsford , a Mayde not passing foureteene yeares of age , dwelling with one Sudley , my kinde friend , made request to her Master and Dame that she might daunce the Morrice with me in a great large roome . They being intreated , I was soone wonne to fit her with bels7:26 ; besides she would haue the olde fashion , with napking on her armes7:26 ; and to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but then being ready to lye downe I left her off ; but thus much in her praise , I would haue challenged the strongest man in Chelmsford , and amongst many I thinke few would haue done so much . The fourth dayes journey , beeing Munday of the second weeke . On Munday morning , very early , I rid the 3 myles that I daunst the satterday before ; where alighting , my Taberer strucke up , and lightly I tript forward ; but I had the heauiest way that euer mad Morrice-dancer trod ; yet , With hey and ho , through thicke and thin , The hobby horse quite forgotten8:8 , I follow 'd , as I did begin , Although the way were rotten . This foule way I could finde no ease in , thicke woods being on eyther side the lane ; the lane likewise being full of deep holes , sometimes I skipt vp to the waste ; but it is an old Prouerb , that it is a little comfort to the miserable to haue companions , and amidst this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident . It was the custome of honest Country fellows , my vnknowne friends , upon hearing of my Pype ( which might well be heard in a still morning or euening a myle ) , to get vp and beare mee company a little way . In this foule way two pretty plaine youthes watcht me , and with their kindnes somewhat hindred me . One , a fine light fellow , would be still before me , the other euer at my heeles . At length , comming to a broad plash8:23 of water and mud , which could not be auoyded , I fetcht a rise , yet fell in ouer the anckles at the further end . My youth that follow 'd me tooke his iump , and stuck fast in the midst , crying out to his companion , " Come , George , call yee this dauncing ? Ile goe no further , " for , indeede hee could goe no further , till his fellow was faine to wade and help him out . I could not chuse but lough to see howe like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and they faintly bad God speed me , saying if I daunst that durtie way this seauen yeares againe , they would neuer daunce after me . Well , with much a doo I got unto Braintree by noone , tarried there Munday night and the next day ; onely I daunst three miles on Tewsday , to ease my Wednesdaies journey . If I should deny that I was welcome at Braintree , I should slander an honest crew of kind men , among whome I far 'd well , slept well , and was euery way well usde . The fift dayes journey , being Wednesday of the second weeke . Taking aduantage of my 3 miles that I had daunst ye day before , this wednesday morning I tript it to Sudbury ; whether came to see a very kinde Gentleman , Master Foskew , that had before trauailed a foote from London to Barwick , who , giuing me good counsaile to obserue temperate dyet for my health , and other aduise to bee carefull of my company , besides his liberall entertainment , departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this towne of Sudbury there came a lusty , tall fellow , a butcher by his profession , that would in a Morrice keepe mee company to Bury : I being glad of his friendly offer , gaue him thankes , and forward wee did set ; but ere euer wee had measur 'd halfe a mile of our way , he gaue me ouer in the plain field , protesting , that if he might get a 100 pound , he would not hold out with me ; for indeed my pace in dauncing is not ordinary . As he and I were parting , a lusty Country lasse being among the people , cal 'd him faint hearted lout , saying , " If I had begun to daunce , I would haue held out one myle though it had cost my life . " At which wordes many laughed . " Nay , " saith she , " if the Dauncer will lend me a leash of his belles , Ile venter to treade one mile with him my selfe . " I lookt vpon her , saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beheld her ready to tucke vp her russet petticoate ; I fitted her with bels , which she merrily taking , garnisht her thicke short legs , and with a smooth brow bad the Tabrer begin . The Drum strucke ; forward marcht I with my merry Maydemarian , who shooke her fat sides , and footed it merrily to Melfoord , being a long myle . There parting with her , I gaue her ( besides her skinfull of drinke ) an English crowne to buy more drinke ; for , good wench , she was in a pittious heate : my kindnes she requited with dropping some dozen of short courtsies , and bidding God blesse the Dauncer . I bad her adieu ; and to giue her her due , she had a good eare , daunst truely , and wee parted friendly . But ere I part with her , a good fellow , my friend , hauin writ an odde Rime of her , I will make bolde to set it downe . A Country Lasse , browne as a berry , Blith of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sides well larded , Euery bone with fat flesh guarded , Meeting merry Kemp by chaunce , Was Marrian in his Morrice daunce . Her stump legs with bels were garnisht , Her browne browes with sweating varnisht ; Her browne hips , when she was lag To win her ground , went swig a swag ; Which to see all that came after Were repleate with mirthfull laughter . Yet she thumpt it on her way With a sportly hey de gay10:27 : At a mile her daunce she ended , Kindly paide and well commended . At Melford diuers Gentlemen met mee , who brought me to one Master Colts , a very kinde and worshipfull Gentleman , where I had vnexpected entertainment till the Satterday . From whose house , hauing hope somewhat to amend my way to Bury , I determined to goe by Clare , but I found it to be both farther and fouler . The sixt dayes journey , being Satterday of the second weeke . From Wednesday night til Satterday hauing bin very troublesome but much more welcome to master Colts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accompanied with many Gentlemen a myle of my way . Which myle master Colts his foole would needs daunce with me , and had his desire , where leauing me , two fooles parted faire in a foule way ; I keeping on my course to Clare , where I a while rested , and then cheerefully set forward to Bury . Passing from Clare towards Bury , I was inuited to the house of a very bountifull widdow , whose husband during his life was a Yeoman of that Countrie ; dying rich no doubt , as might well appeare , by the riches and plentie that abounded in euery corner of the house . She is called the widdow Eueret . At her house were met aboue thirty Gentlemen . Such , and so plentifull variety of good fare I haue very sildome seene in any Commoners house . Her behauiour being very modest and freendly , argued her bringing vp not to be rude . She was a woman of good presence , and , if a foole may iudge , of no smal discretion . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Satterday in the afternoone , at what time the right Honorable the Lord Chiefe Justice11:25 entred at an other gate of the towne . The wondring and regardles multitude making his honor cleere way , left the streetes where he past to gape at me ; the throng of them being so great that poore Will Kemp was seauen times stayed ere hee could recouer his Inne . By reason of the great snow that then fell , I stayd at Bury from Satterday in the second week of my setting foorth til Thursday night the next weeke following . The seauenth dayes journey , being Friday of the third weeke . Vpon Fryday morning I set on towardes Thetford , dauncing that tenne mile in three houres ; for I left Bury somewhat after seauen in the morning , and was at Thetford somewhat after ten that same forenoone . But , indeed , considering how I had been booted the other iourneys before , and that all this way , or the most of it , was ouer a heath , it was no great wonder ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tride the vse of his legs to out-run the Constable : so light was my heeles , that I counted the ten mile no better than a leape . At my entrance into Thetford the people came in great numbers to see mee ; for there were many there , being Size time . The noble Gentleman , Sir Edwin Rich12:13 , gaue me entertainment in such bountifull and liberal sort , during my continuance there Satterday and Sunday , that I want fitte words to expresse the least part of his worthy vsage of my vnworthines ; and to conclude liberally as hee had begun and continued , at my departure on Munday his worship gaue me fiue pound . The eyght dayes journey , being Munday of the fourth weeke . On Munday morning I daunst to Rockland ere I rested , and comming to my Inne , where the Hoast was a very boone companion , I desired to see him ; but in no case he would be spoken with till he had shifted himselfe from his working dayes sute . Being armed at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacke shooes shining and made straght with copper buckles of the best , his garters in the fashion , and euery garment fitting Corremsquandam ( to use his owne word ) , hee enters the Hall , with his bonnet in his hand , began to crye out : " O Kemp , deere Master Kemp ! you are euen as welcome as  --  as  --  as  --  , " and so stammering he began to study for a fit comparison , and , I thanke him , at last he fitted me ; for saith he , " thou art euen as welcome as the Queenes best grey-hound . " After this dogged yet well-meaning salutation , the Carrowses were called in ; and my friendly Hoast of Rockland began withall this , blessing13:5 the houre vppon his knees , that any of the Queenes Maiesties well-willers or friends would vouchsafe to come within his house ; as if neuer any such had been within his doores before . I tooke his good meaning , and gaue him great thankes for his kindenesse ; and hauing rested mee well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest Hoast of Rockland would needs be my guide : but , good true fat-belly , he had not followed mee two fieldes , but he lyes all along , and cryes after me to come backe and speake with him . I fulfild his request : and comming to him , " Dauncer , " quoth hee , " if thou daunce a Gods name , God speede thee ! I can not follow thee a foote farther ; but adieu , good dauncer ; God speed thee , if thou daunce a Gods name ! " I , hauing haste of my way , and he being able to keep no way , there wee parted . Farewell he : he was a kinde good fellow , a true Troyan ; and if euer be my lucke to meete him at more leasure , Ile make him full amendes with a Cup full of Canarie . But nowe I am a little better aduis 'd , wee must not thus let my madde Hoast passe ; for my friend , late mentioned before , that made the odde rime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such as it is , He bluntly set downe . He was a man13:26 not ouer spare ; In his eyebals dwelt no care . " Anon , anon , " and " Welcome13:28 , friend , " Were the most words he vsde to spend , Saue sometime he would sit and tell What wonders once in Bullayne fell13:31 , Closing each Period of his tale With a full cup of Nut-browne Ale . Turwin and Turneys siedge were hot14:1 , Yet all my Hoast remembers not : Kets field14:3 and Muscleborough14:3 fray Were battles fought but yesterday . " O , ' t was a goodly matter then To see your sword and buckler men ! They would lye heere , and here and there , But I would meete them euery where : And now a man is but a pricke ; A boy , arm 'd with a poating sticke14:10 , Will dare to challenge Cutting Dicke14:11 .

Saint Martin send him merry mates , To enter at his hostree gates ! For a blither lad than he Can not an Inkeeper be . Well , once againe farewell mine Hoast at Rockland . After all these farewels , I am sure to Hingham I found a foule way , as before I had done from Thetford to Rockland . Yet , besides the deep way , I was much hindred by the desire people had to see me . For euen as our Shop-keepers will hayle and pull a man with " Lack ye ? what do you lack , Gentlemen ?

The ninth dayes journey , being Wednesday of the second weeke . The next morning I left Hingham , not staying till I came to Barford-bridge , fiue young men running all the way with me , for otherwise my pace was not for footemen . From Barford bridge I daunst to Norwich ; but comming within sight of the Citty , perceiuing so great a multitude and throng of people still crowding more and more about me , mistrusting it would be a let15:15 to my determined expedition and pleasurable humour , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as my best skill and industry of my long trauelled sinewes could affoord them ) , I was aduised , and so tooke ease by that aduise , to stay my Morrice a little about Saint Giles his gate , where I tooke my gelding , and so rid into the Citty , procrastinating my merry Morrice daunce through the Citty till better opportunitie . Being come into the Citty , Master Roger Wiler the Maior15:23 , and sundry other of his worshipfull Brethren , sent for me ; who perceiuing howe I intended not to daunce into the Cittye that nyght , and being well satisfied with the reasons , they allotted me time enough not to daunce in till Satterday after ; to the end that diuers knights and Gentlemen , together with their wiues and children ( who had beene many dayes before deceyued with expectation of my comming ) , might nowe haue sufficient warning accordingly by satterday following . In the meane space , and during my still continuaunce in the Cittye afterwardes , they not onely very courteously offered to beare mine owne charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common charges : the Mayor and many of the Aldermen often times besides inuited vs priuately to theyr seuerall houses . To make a short end of this tedious description of my entertainment ; Satterday no sooner came but I returned without the Citty through Saint Giles his gate , and beganne my Morrice where I left at that gate , but I entred in at Saint Stephens gate , where one Thomas Gilbert in name of all the rest of the Cittizens gaue me a friendly and exceeding kind welcome ; which I haue no reason to omit , vnlesse I would condemne my selfe of ingratitude , partlye for the priuate affection of the writer towardes me , as also for the generall loue and fauour I found in them from the highest to the lowest , the richest as the poorest .

G. Passing the gate , Wifflers17:1 ( such Officers as were appointed by the Mayor ) to make me way through the throng of the people which prest so mightily vpon me , with great labour I got thorow that narrow preaze17:4 into the open market place ; where on the crosse , ready prepared , stood the Citty Waytes , which not a little refreshed my wearines with toyling thorow so narrow a lane as the people left me : such Waytes ( under Benedicite be it spoken ) fewe Citties in our Realme haue the like , none better ; who , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vyoll and Violin , theyr voices be admirable , euerie one of them able to serue in any Cathedrall Church in Christendoome for Quiristers . Passing by the Market place , the presse still increasing by the number of boyes , girles , men and women , thronging more and more before me to see the end ; it was the mischaunce of a homely maide , that , belike , was but newly crept into the fashion of long wasted peticotes tyde with points17:17 , and had , as it seemed , but one point tyed before , and comming vnluckily in my way , as I was fetching a leape , it fell out that I set my foote on her skirts : the point eyther breaking or stretching , off fell her peticoate from her waste , but as chance was , thogh hir smock were course , it was cleanely ; yet the poore wench was so ashamed , the rather for that she could hardly recouer her coate againe from vnruly boies , that looking before like one that had the greene sicknesse , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sorry for her , but on I went towards the Maiors , and deceiued the people by leaping ouer the church-yard wall at S. Johns , getting so into M. Mayors gates a neerer way ; but at last I found it the further way about , being forced on the Tewsday following to renew my former daunce , because George Sprat , my ouer-seer , hauing lost me in the throng , would not be deposed that I had daunst it , since he saw me not ; and I must confesse I did not wel , for the Cittizens had caused all the turne-pikes to be taken vp on Satterday that I might not bee hindred . But now I returne againe to my Jump , the measure of which is to be seene in the Guild-hall at Norwich , 18:2 where my buskins , that I then wore and daunst in from London thither , stand equally deuided , nailde on the wall . The plenty of good cheere at the Mayors , his bounty and kinde vsage , together with the general welcomes of his worshipful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gentlewomen , so much exceeded my expectation , as I adiudg 'd my selfe most bound to them all . The Maior gaue me fiue pound in Elizabeth angels18:10 ; which Maior ( faire Madame , to whom I too presumptuously dedicate my idle paces ) is a man18:11 worthy of a singuler and impartiall admiration , if our criticke humorous mindes could as prodigally conceiue as he deserues , for his chast life , liberality , and temperance in possessing worldly benefits . He liues vnmarried , and childlesse ; neuer purrchased house nor land , the house he dwels in this yeere being but hyred : he liues vpon marchandies , being a Marchant venturer . If our marchants and gentlemen wold take example by this man , Gentlemen would not sell their lands to become banckrout Marchants , nor Marchants liue in the possessions of youth-beguiled gentlemen , who cast themselves out of their parents heritages for a few out-cast commodities18:22 . But , wit , whither wilt thou ? 18:22 What hath Morrice tripping Will to do with that ? it keeps not time wt his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my legs leaue to end my Morrice , or , that being ended , my hands leaue to perfect this worthlesse poore tottered18:26 volume . Pardon me , Madame , that I am thus tedious ; I can not chuse but commend sacred liberality , which makes poore wretches partakers of all comfortable benefits : besides the loue and fauour already repeated , M. Weild the mayor18:30 gaue me 40. s. yeerely during my life , making me a free man of the marchant venterers . This is the substance of al my journey ; therefore let no man beleeue , how euer before by lying ballets and rumors they haue bin abused , yt either waies were laid open for me , or that I deliuered gifts to her Maiesty . Its good being merry , my masters , but in a meane , and al my mirths , ( meane though they be ) haue bin and euer shal be imploi 'd to the delight of my royal Mistris ; whose sacred name ought not to be remembred among such ribald rimes as these late thin-breecht lying Balletsingers haue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shew what profit I haue made by my Morrice . True it is I put out some money to haue threefold gaine at my returne19:8 : some that loue me , regard my paines , and respect their promise , haue sent home the treble worth ; some other at the first sight haue paide me , if I came to seek them ; others I can not see , nor wil they willingly be found , and these are the greater number . If they had al usd me wel , or al ill , I would haue boldly set downe the true sum of my smal gain or losse ; but I wil haue patience , some few daies longer : at ye end of which time , if any be behinde , I wil draw a cattalogue of al their names I ventur 'd with ; those yt haue shewne themselues honest men , I wil set before them this Caracter , H. for honesty ; before the other Bench-whistlers19:19 shal stand K. for ketlers and keistrels19:19 , that wil driue a good companion without need in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall haue no such neede . If I haue , your Honourable protection shall thus far defend your poore seruant , that he may , being a plain man , call a spade a spade . Thus fearing your Ladyship is wearier with reading this toy then I was in all my merry trauaile , I craue pardon ; and conclude this first Pamphlet that euer Will Kemp offred to the Presse , being thereunto prest on the one side by the pittifull papers , pasted on euery poast , of that which was neither so nor so , and on the other side vrg 'd thereto in duety to expresse with thankefulnes the kind entertainment I found . Your honors poore servant , W. K. Kemps humble request to the impudent generation of Ballad-makers and their coherents ; that it would please their rascalities to pitty his paines in the great journey he pretends20:3 , and not fill the country with lyes of his neuer done actes , as they did in his late Morrice to Norwich . To the tune of Thomas Delonies Epitaph . My notable Shakerags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Title of my supplication ; but for your better vnderstandings , for that I know you to be a sort20:9 of witles beetle-heads that can understand nothing but what is knockt into your scalpes , These are by these presentes to certifie vnto your block-headships , that I , William Kemp , whom you had neer hand rent in sunder with your vnreasonable rimes , am shortly , God willing , to set forward as merily as I may ; whether I my selfe know not . Wherefore , by the way , I would wish ye , imploy not your little wits in certifying the world that I am gone to Rome , Jerusalem , Venice , or any other place at your idle appoint . I knowe the best of ye , by the lyes ye writ of me , got not the price of a good hat to couer your brainles heads : if any of ye had come to me , my bounty should haue exceeded the best of your good masters the Ballad-buiers , I wold haue apparrelled your dry pates in party coloured bonnets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown 'd ye with cox-combs . I haue made a priuie search what priuate Jigmonger20:24 of your jolly number hath been the Author of these abhominable ballets written of me . I was told it was the great ballet-maker T. D. , alias Tho . Deloney , Chronicler of the memorable lines of the 6. yeomen of the west , Jack of Newbery , the Gentle-craft20:26 , and such like honest men , omitted by Stow , Hollinshead , Grafton , Hal , froysart , and the rest of those wel deseruing writers ; but I was giuen since to vnderstand your late generall Tho. dyed poorely , as ye all must do , and was honestly buried , which is much to bee doubted of some of you . The quest of inquiry finding him by death acquited of the Inditement , I was let to wit yt another Lord of litle wit , one whose imployment for the Pageant was vtterly spent , he being knowne to be Eldertons immediate heyre21:7 , was vehemently suspected ; but after due inquisition was made , he was at that time knowne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite giuen ouer the mistery21:11 . Still the search continuing , I met a proper vpright youth , onely for a little stooping in the shoulders , all hart to the heele , a penny Poet , whose first making21:14 was the miserable stolne story of Macdoel , or Macdobeth21:15 , or Macsomewhat , for I am sure a Mac it was , though I neuer had the maw to see it ; and hee tolde me there was a fat filthy ballet-maker , that should haue once been his Journeyman to the trade , who liu 'd about the towne , and ten to one but he had thus terribly abused me and my Taberer , for that he was able to do such a thing in print . A shrewd presumption ! I found him about the bankside21:21 , sitting at a play ; I desired to speake with him , had him to a Tauerne , charg 'd a pipe with Tobacco , and then laid this terrible accusation to his charge . He swels presently , like one of the foure windes ; the violence of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heate of his wrath drunke dry two bowlefuls of Rhenish wine . At length hauing power to speake , " Name my accuser , " saith he , " or I defye thee , Kemp , at the quart staffe . " I told him ; and all his anger turned to laughter , swearing it did him good to haue ill words of a hoddy doddy21:29 , a habber de hoy21:30 , a chicken , a squib , a squall21:30 , one that hath not wit enough to make a ballet , that , by Pol and Aedipol , would Pol his father , Derick21:32 his dad , doe anie thing , how ill so euer , to please his apish humor . I hardly beleeued this youth that I tooke to be gracious had bin so graceles ; but I heard afterwards his mother in law was eye and eare witnes of his fathers abuse by this blessed childe on a publique stage , in a merry Hoast of an Innes part . Yet all this while could not I finde out the true ballet-maker , till by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a booke in Latine , called Mundus Furiosus22:6 , printed at Cullen , written by one of the vildest and arrantest lying Cullians22:7 that euer writ booke , his name Jansonius , who , taking vpon him to write an abstract of all the turbulent actions that had beene lately attempted or performed in Christendome , like an vnchristian wretch , writes onely by report , partially , and scoffingly of such whose pages shooes hee was vnworthy to wipe , for indeed he is now dead : farewell he ! euery dog must haue a day . But see the luck o n't : this beggerly lying busie-bodies name brought out the Ballad-maker22:13 , and , it was generally confirmd , it was his kinsman : he confesses himselfe guilty , let any man looke on his face ; if there be not so redde a colour that all the sope in the towne will not washe white , let me be turned to a Whiting as I passe betweene Douer and Callis . Well , God forgiue thee , honest fellow , I see thou hast grace in thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these beastly ballets , make not good wenches Prophetesses , for litle or no profit , nor for a sixe-penny matter reuiue not a poore fellowes fault thats hanged for his offence ; it may be thy owne destiny one day ; prethee be good to them . Call vp thy olde Melpomene , whose straubery quill may write the bloody lines of the blew Lady , and the Prince of the burning crowne ; a better subiect , I can tell ye , than your Knight of the Red Crosse . So , farewel , and crosse me no more , I prethee , with thy rabble of bald rimes , least at my returne I set a crosse on thy forehead that all men may know thee for a foole . WILLIAM KEMP .

It seems unlikely that the Queen should have had two maids of honour called Fitton ; and yet we can hardly suppose that Kemp mistook the Christian name of his patroness .

In 1596 , had he not eluded the search of the Mayor of London , he would have been punished for writing " a certain Ballad , containing a Complaint of great Want and Scarcity of Corn within the Realm ... bringing in the Queen speaking with her People Dialogue-wise , in very fond and undecent sort , " &c.,; Stow 's Survey , B. v. 333. ed. 1720 , where he is described as " an idle Fellow , and one noted with the like Spirit in printing a Book for the Silk Weavers , wherein was found some such like foolish and disorderly matter .

Thomas of Reading , or the sixe worthie Yeomen of the West , is noticed in the present passage as a well-known work , and was dramatized in 1601 ( Malone 's Shakespeare , by Boswell , iii . 325-6 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 99 ) , but no impression has been discovered earlier than the fourth , 1612 , 4to : this tale is reprinted in Thoms 's Early Prose Rom. i . Of The pleasant Historie of John Winchcomb , in his younguer yeares called Jack of Newbery , the famous and worthy Clothier of England ; declaring his life and loue , together with his charitable deeds and great Hospitalitie , &c.,; the earliest edition extant is the eighth , 1619 , 4to : its entry in the Stationers ' Books stands thus : " 7 Maii 1596 . " Tho . Millington Entered for his copie a book called Jack of Newbery So vid.

During a long life he figured in various capacities ,  --  as a player , an apprentice to Allde the printer , a retainer of the Earl of Oxford , a Messenger of her Majesty 's Chamber , Poet to the City , dramatist , writer in verse and prose , and draper . He also excited considerable attention , and drew much trouble on himself , by his efforts in detecting the treasonable practices of the Jesuits . According to the inscription on his monument in the church of St. Stephen , Coleman Street , he died in his 80th year , August 10th 1633 .

Jonson 's Works , vi . 328 ) . Though Kemp declares here that his " imployment for the pageant was utterly spent , " yet Anthony furnished the city shows for 1605 , 1611 , and ( in spite of an attack made on him by Middleton in 1613  --  see my ed. of Middleton 's Works , v. 219 , note ) , for 1614 , 1615 , and 1616 . Except a " Song of Robin Hood and his Huntesmen " in Metropolis Coronata , I am not aware that any of Munday 's ballads are extant  --  unless indeed the " ditties " in The Banquet of daintie Conceits may be regarded as such ; but there is no doubt that they were numerous , and hence , in the present passage , he is termed the " immediate heyre " of William Elderton . This personage ,  --  who is said to have been , at different periods of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players , and an attorney in the Sheriff 's Court , London ,  --  obtained great notoriety by his ballads .
