PREFACE . This Drama was sketched during a residence of several years in the West Indies , where the action is supposed to take place . Making allowance for poetic embellishment , it is , except in one circumstance , founded on facts connected with individual history . The piece , having been imagined , and even traced out , at least twenty years ago , such as it is now presented to the public , has no relation to the sentiments on the subject of slavery , that , of late , have excited such interest in our republic . My design in the selection of this subject was , when I commenced this drama , and still is , to exhibit the influence that Evangelical Christianity might exercise over all classes of society , from the highest station of arrogant affluence , to the lowest stage of degraded poverty . It may be necessary to state , that many of the Planters in the French Islands are from the ex-nobility of that nation , and , with their titles , preserve an aristocratical stateliness , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The circumstance of exercising unlimited control over so many abject dependents , together with a total want of even the semblance of religious principle , renders them exceedingly despotic . In these Islands , neither the sanctity nor the rest of the Sabbath is observed ; but on that day the slaves usually work in the grounds allotted them as their own provision gardens , or sell their available merchandise . On some plantations , the indolent are obliged , even by stripes , thus to labor for themselves . They are taught nothing of the duties springing from Christianity , although some of the ceremonies of Catholicism are observed by the slaves . These poor degraded people , as may well be supposed , are superstitious and often very corrupt . Those who are from Africa , sometimes mingle their Fetish or heathen customs with false notions of the Christian religion . Hence the use of charms and poison with a blind reverence of what they esteem supernatural power in some impostor among them . This person is commonly an artful , intelligent negro man or woman , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent , for gain , malice , or revenge . The practice of administering poison to the most valuable slaves on an estate , as well as to the cattle , is not uncommon , and the punishment which succeeds is often terribly cruel . The suspected are not unfrequently tortured to extort confession . Cases of this kind fell , most painfully , under my own observation . The instigator to this mischief was sometimes the most favored slave . Zamba , who is represented so passionate , tender , and elevated , is a character nevertheless true to nature . In those Islands , native Africans are sometimes seen , beautiful in person , proud in bearing , delicate in tenderness , and of surprising acuteness of intellect . One such , of princely rank , I knew , from the Mendi country . The belief expressed by Zamba , of meeting after death the spirit of his wife upon the waters , and their return to their own country , is a Mendian superstition ; suicide is ofttimes its consequence . That Nature has her noblemen among every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even in the most degraded rank ,  --  the rank of the slave ,  --  is sometimes found a soul more free and noble than many a one inhabiting the form of royalty . St. Cloud was the slave and valet of a rich planter , when the French Revolution overthrew the rank , and confiscated the property , of the rich and high-born in the territories of France . In this , one of the richest of its Islands , the slaves , declared free by the Convention , were embodied in the army , and many fine estates were apportioned among them . St. Cloud , who was a brave and fine fellow , received a commission in the army and a plantation ; while his aged master was stripped both of rank and property , and left , without a family , in a most destitute and pitiable condition . St. Cloud came to his assistance , allotted to him from his own means a pension as long as he lived ; and even , it is said , bestowed upon his poor and feeble master , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of his slavery to render ,  --  the service of a valet . St. Cloud was personally known to me as a most respectable planter . The Insurrection , upon which the plot of this Dramatic Poem is founded , occurred many years ago in the Island of Martinique . A providential discovery on the eve of the intended massacre , saved the inhabitants of a populous city from sudden destruction . Ambition in two master spirits , one a Haytian negro , the other a free mulatto , nearly resulted in a catastrophe , the thought of which , filled those who must have been its victims , with horror . During the reign of Louis the Eighteenth , the period of the supposed action of this Drama , Romanism having revived in France , intolerance of the Protestant faith was renewed . The idea , therefore , of a missionary being at that time established in one of its Islands , is entirely fictitious . Could this however have been true , no doubt the treatment he might have received from many of the planters , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal was at that period made from proper authority , in the City of New York , to sound them on the subject of a mission from a society there , and this answer was returned by one of the best educated and freest from sectarian prejudice , " God forbid that the American Republic should here disseminate its religious and political opinions ! We can not admit them . " In this sentiment , perhaps worldly policy had even a greater share than papacy itself . Each proprietor , being in effect a petty sovereign , exercised , on his own domain , a power uncontrolled by the civil government , even over the lives of his slaves : it was for this cause they dreaded the influence of our liberal principles , and not on account of their own religious sentiments . Few of the higher classes professed any better religion than that of Voltaire , but from many minds Evangelical Christianity drew forth high approval . " Mother , " said a planter in my hearing , to his parent , " you have the same ten commandments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go from mass to the card table , and spend the remainder of the day in amusement ? They act consistently with their profession when they keep the whole day sacredly , you Catholics do not . I make no profession , and do as I please . " But even in those dark habitations of cruelty , there are souls that would receive the Word of Truth , were it presented to them , as the hungry would receive bread . Louise Soubiese , La bonne Louise , as she was called , was a free mulatto woman . Having received from me a French Testament , she came , some time after , with the expression of her thanks . " Ah , " said she , " how I desire the whole Bible ! My son , " she added , " says it must be a Divine Book , for since he has read it , he dares no longer indulge in the passions and actions he formerly thought right . He fears the judgements of God . " She said the ladies De L  --  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could scarce obtain a sight of it , and ended by expressing her ardent desire to procure the Word of God entire . Poor Louise ! I can not refrain from giving my testimony to worth rarely met with , in any land , or among people of any color . Sincerely did I lament , that I had not a spare copy of the Bible in the tongue she understood ; all I carried having been distributed . Affecting instances of this thirst for the Water of Life might be mentioned ; may heavenly showers soon fall upon this barren and desolate region ! Having occasionally , through the solicitation of friends , published short portions of this Poem , though not in dramatic form , I am encouraged , from their successful reception , to offer to the public the entire Drama . THE AUTHOR . Philadelphia , May 1 , 1842 . DRAMATIS PERSON . The Count de Nouville , a Planter . Augustus , Count Clermont , Ward of De Nouville . Mr. Lawton , a Protestant Missionary . Zamba , an African Prince , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mulatto in the service of the Baroness of Belfont . Baroness of Belfont , aunt of Augustus . Zelia , daughter of Count De Nouville . Nora , attendant on Zelia . Servants , Slaves , &c.; SCENE laid in an Island of the West Indies . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. Seashore : a declivity extending to the shore , covered with trees and flowering shrubs . A large and low mansion appears on the summit of the hill , a cottage below it , near the sea . Sunrise . ZELIA Zelia ( descending the hill ) . How fresh and calm is nature at this hour ! Covered with gems of morn , the opening buds Send forth their fragrant incense to young day . A golden cloud hangs o'er the azure flood , Unruffled by the breeze . Glorious the light That sudden bursts upon the deep dark wave ! Now a molten mirror . Flashing it strikes From peak to peak of yonder mountain , clad In the fleece of heaven . The looms of Tyre , drapery So rich , ne'er gave to couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See round yon mountain 's lofty brow The varying clouds at play ; Of every changing hue and shape Tinged by the orb of day . Upon that mountain 's sunny side Sweets fling their odors free ; From spicy grove , from citron bower , And fragrant orange tree . Though on yon mountain 's sunny side Glow gems of beauty rare , Yet bondage rolls a bitter tide , And woe is nurtured there . O , then , in my sweet humble vale , With virtue I would live , Contented with the simple joys Nature and freedom give . That vale was childhood 's peaceful home : Where in tranquillity I passed the cloudless morn of life , With hope ,  --  most joyously ! But now old ocean 's stormy flood Divides that vale from me , And memory alone doth make Its home , sweet vale , in thee ! To meditation precious is the prime Of morning ; shaking off slumber , With cares and griefs , that yester eve oppressed , The soul awakes to vigorous exertion . A blessed hour it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , every look , And with the tone obsequious , ask my will . Alas ! I scarce dare think , lest they descry The secret motions of a heart , that finds , With none , the sympathy it seeks . This balmy breath of heaven refreshes not The fevered sense , when spirit is not free . Yon bright beams , shining on ocean , earth , and sky , Light not the darkened soul ; scarce through the eye Give joy , when bondage holds with golden links The form unwilling . Nor yet can truth Enter a guest , when prejudice draws bolt Upon the noble intellect . All here Wear the chain , on body or on mind . How wanders thought ! leading me back to pains From which I fled :  --  hangs a dark drapery o'er The cheerful morn , and drives devotion far . Then let me hasten . In yonder humble cottage I perchance May find the good I seek . Grant it , Father In Heaven ! May thy servant be messenger Of peace unto this troubled breast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isle ! Chance ! say I ? Pardon , O God ! it was thy Providence . ( Exit toward the cottage . ) SCENE II . Cottage near the beach . Mr. Lawton in front , with a book . He rises from his seat , under a tree , to meet Zelia , who is advancing . MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Welcome , Lady , to this lonely dwelling . ZELIA . Zelia If on your private hour my presence brings Intrusion , let me retire . MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton I pray you nay , My Lady . Something of import would you ; Else , one young and happy had not sought out The dwelling of a poor recluse . Fear not To speak your wishes : He whom I serve , Better approves the deed of charity , Than many prayers . ZELIA . Zelia My boldness pardon In the cause which urged timidity . Report , some days agone , in whispers ran Among the menial train , that line our hall : It said , that in a lonely spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking with tongue Of foreign accent , words and prayers , such as Their ears had never learned . Often he sought , Within their wretched huts , the sick and old , With words of comfort ; kneeled on the hard earth Beside the couch , that misery with its impress Had enstamped ,  --  MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Pray hold thee , Lady ! ZELIA . Zelia Nay ,  --  more ,  --  ' T was whispered with mysterious air , as strange , That not a prayer this pious man addressed Unto Mary ,  --  Virgin ,  --  mother of God ! MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Heaven forbid , that on my tongue blasphemy Should rest . Lady , my faith is Protestant . ZELIA . Zelia Of this , I doubted not , when yester eve , In the poor hut of old Justine , your prayer I heard . Joy leaped within my heart at sound Of supplication , in simplicity , Offered with faith to Him , who stoops from Heaven To hear without a saintly medium , The sinning creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , am Protestant . MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Now , God be praised ! ZELIA . Zelia Amen , my reverend friend . MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Yet , ' mid this joy , My heart misgives me , and I tremble too : For virtue is in peril , fair young maid , Where pleasure tempts , and Truth Divine is scorned . ZELIA . Zelia This do I know , therefore it is I seek Your presence in my need . Against myself , Timid and weak , protection I have sought . Aid unto such , God sends his ministers , A visible support to those , whose faith Is still too weak to grasp the invisible . MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton ( with emotion ) . Lady excuse the feeling I can not hide . Thought backward turns , and brings to my review Images of the past . To me , thou seemst The child , lovely and loved ,  --  my only one ,  --  Torn from these widowed arms , by early death . The lost seems found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bestow The sweet name of daughter . MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton O righteous Heaven ! I recognise the Hand that struck my joys . As by the lightning scathed ; each leaf and branch Lay prostrate ; and the wind passed mightily Over the naked , unresisting trunk . But now , transplanted to another soil , And watered by the genial dews of Grace , Fair fruits of Paradise bloom on these boughs . To do thy will , O God , here  --  here am I : Direct the way . ZELIA Zelia ( with anxiety ) . Alas , how can I thus Have moved the hidden fountain , in that breast , Of grief so bitter ! I pray forgiveness For inadvertent fault ; no harm was meant . MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Forgive thee ! rather bless ; most sweet is it , Young maiden , to be sought and honored With such confidence . But strange thy words , Hard to divine ; how , in such early youth , The faith thy fathers call heretical , Be that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zelia Strange tale it is , which yet has not been told To any here ; but I would speak it now , Else my poor heart would burst . MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Speak then , daughter , And believe that you may trust the servant Of Him you also serve . ZELIA . Zelia Almost in infancy , e'er yet the mind Could prize a father 's care or mother 's love , To famed Columbia 's shore my parents sent Me , their sole child . In careful hands was placed Their dearest treasure ; and so willed Heaven , That under the same friendly roof I found The heir of Clermont 's noble house , Augustus , The dear companion of my childhood 's sports , Son of my father 's friend . In foreign land , Where every tongue , but his alone , was strange , Where we together grew , read the same books , And where in softer hours we talked of home , The same dear home : what wonder then  --  MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A friendship , lasting as the love of life , And dearer , was thus commenced : believe me , This confidence is safe within my breast . ZELIA . Zelia This heart , oppressed with grief and fear , can feel The value of such kindness . To proceed ; The beloved guardians of our early years , Were worthy of the trust . Gifted for earth , Adorned with every grace to fit for heaven , Were Whaley and his gentle wife . Childless , on us their hoard of love bestowed . But not alone our present good they sought ; The Gospel 's holy precepts , faithfully Instilled into our minds , sacred we held . When Reason scanned the creed of Romish faith , And beams of Heaven 's own Light burst o'er the page Of Truth Divine , our doubts removed : casting Aside doctrines our fathers held , we two Opposed , in heart and principle , What we accounted error in our kindred . Affection then became a sacred bond : Each shared the other 's hopes and fears ; our joys And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of deep anxiety and gloom . Bitter the grief When mandate came for my return alone : Leave him , who next to Heaven was dear ! I came ; My native land then saw , and felt with joy Drops of paternal love bedew my cheek . My mother 's tomb was all of her I found . ' T is pain to speak the rest . MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Fear nothing , Lady , Let me know all . ZELIA . Zelia Unused to the vain show , That makes the sum of worldly happiness , I find myself a stranger , though at home . The idol of a father 's fondest love , The mistress absolute of bowing slaves , I am myself a captive , not unlike The deity enchained in ancient Tyre Fast to the feet of Hercules , lest he Escape his worshippers . Jewels most rare Cover a breast that sorrow makes its home . In sinful paths my feet are often led . I plead in vain , a father 's gathering frown Presses with fear and grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare lift a prayer . Offend my God ! O , what a mortal grief ! Like some frail bark , tossed on the raging wave , Compass and rudder lost ,  --  thus with my soul . Friend I have none ; for he who would have stayed My sliding steps is far , O , far away . MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Not so : there 's One with wakeful eye looks on ; Who does , for good , events most adverse turn . Within their bounds He locks the mighty waves : Holds with his hand the driving hurricane , And draws the bolts of Death . This wondrous might Is coupled with a Love as wondrous . The meanest creature formed by His hand , Is object of His care . The little bird , The tiny insect , sporting on the breath Of lightest zephyr , even the reptile , Object of our disgust , He guards and feeds . The sunbeams glad the eyes , and the breeze cools The fevered senses , of the veriest wretch That walks the earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall He , whose mercies Reach even the vile , forget his children ; Leave them in their need ? Rather the mother Shall forget her babe : she may , in frailty Of our nature ; but His love is changeless As the Throne eternal ! ZELIA . Zelia These words , good Sir , Lighten in part the load of heavy thought . Still I doubt : can Love Omnipotent , Perfect , consist with trials , various And great as mine ? MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Virtue in circumstance Is often placed to try it and refine . Thus precious things of earth are purified : Cast in the furnace , the Refiner sees His image in the brightening gold ; but know , That not a moment longer than it needs For the complete impression , will He leave It there . ZELIA . Zelia My fearful heart trembles , while It rejoices . Should I fail !  --  MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton O , fear not : Tempted to stray , thy refuge is in God ; For aid thou ' rt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the wayward thought . Treading with fearless step the narrow path , Thorny though it be , and at the entrance Dark ,  --  sweet flowers grow there , and light , at first A twilight beam ,  --  The Sun of Righteousness Rising , will cast his splendors o'er the way , Lightening thy pathway to the perfect day . ZELIA . Zelia Helpless and timid , too long have I strayed . Unto your cot , my steps were led by Him , Who keeps his eye upon the little flock , That follow where He leads . Help thus He gives My inexperience ;  --  and your reward ,  --  His love , and smile approving . ( Exit Zelia . ) MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Blest reward ! For this , my country , wealth , and friends were left , And trusting to the treacherous deep my life , I sought in foreign solitude a home , Here , where the glowing sun pours on our race Disease and death . His smile , who gave command , " Go preach to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  a world for it , how small the price ! ( Exit into the cottage . ) SCENE III . Saloon in the house of the Count De Nouville : Count De Nouville and Baroness of Belfont . BARONESS . Baroness of Belfont Good friend , forbear ! inflame not thus your blood . Anger , in this our burning clime , dries up The vital current ; ' T is most unwholesome And laborious exercise of spirit . Pleasure has rights , a gallant court she holds In these soft bowers . Perpetual summer sheds Perpetual sweets . The cooling mid-day breeze Invites us to repose , the evening hour To banquet , song , and dance . COUNT . The Count de Nouville Lady , of joy Speak not to me , whose life wears out in care . Time was , when banquet , dance , and song Were welcome , as golden hours winged with bliss . But now vexation lengthens out the day , And chases slumber from the night . My wealth I hold in hazard :  --  slaves in mutiny :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zelia ! Impossible ! so loving , gentle , good ! COUNT . The Count de Nouville Would she were perverse ! I should know my course . But with her gentle nature , how can mine Be harsh and uncomplying ? Yes , my friend , ' T is subject of regret , that I e'er sent Such early youth from the parental home . A father truly can desire no more Of outward charm than I in Zelia find . My whitening locks admonish the discharge Of passions , ruling in my manhood 's noon ; Bidding me look for happiness to her Whose infancy gave but a passing joy . But grief seems seated in my daughter 's breast , I look in vain for sportive gayety : Nor song , nor dance , doth charm her . Firm , yet mild , The mirth of youth repels she : it would seem Sorrow hath borrowed for her pleasure 's robe . The day of rest , our gayest festival , Sacred with her to God and solitude ,  --  With prayer she wearies out the lonely hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence to the festal board , the jest , The laugh , no welcome from her meet ; reproof Is seated in her speaking eye , whence steals , Beneath the downcast lid , the precious dew . For this did I consign her to the care Of strangers , whose mistaken fancies , warping Her tender mind , gave to my loving arms A melancholy girl ,  --  a devotee ? BARONESS . Baroness of Belfont Calm , calm thee , Count ! ' t is childhood 's prejudice , Which better knowledge soon will wear away . Leave her to me , her school shall be the world , And I the teacher , in the dear delights Of life . COUNT . The Count de Nouville Your friendship , Lady , of my youth the joy , Comes now to be the solace of my age . Gladly I 'd hail the hour , that shall unite My house to that of Clermont , consummate The marriage of your nephew with my child . Augustus , methinks , should hasten his return , Lately apprized of this our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven grant The foolish girl , by sullenness , draw not From him disgust . Wealth , broad and solid , thus Shall flow around them . ( Enter a servant , in haste . ) SERVANT . Servant My lord , your presence In the outer hall , they wait . Six oxen , Of the finest breed , are dead , and the slaves , So choice , from Guinea 's coast , just purchased , Are seized with dying agonies . COUNT . The Count de Nouville Villains ! And bloodhounds ! thus to gorge themselves with life . Lady , I will have vengeance . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE IV . A negro cabin , shaded by plantain trees . ZAMBA Zamba ( in front , walking in agitation ) . The hour draws nigh , the hour of vengeance comes ! Vengeance , too long delayed , so much desired . Ha ! hated foe ! this hand shall childless write Thy haughty house . From me , thou didst tear The last , most loved , the only one that fate Had left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solace of thy age !  --  thy daughter ! I laugh thee now to scorn !  --  thy Zelia dies ! ( Pauses .  --  Continues , in a softened tone . ) Zelia , the gentle one !  --  Zelia ! Can I , Whose soul was soft as woman 's , do this deed ? Dissolving nature gushes from my eyes , At the free sports of happy infancy :  --  The tottering step of age makes me a child ! In spirit then I rove along the streams That roll their golden sands to Afric 's coast . Again , beneath the lofty palmetto , Recline luxurious , upon the mat , A mother 's hand has wrought . The joyous voices of my infant brothers , Ring strangely in my ears ! and she !  --  O , she ! Amaba ! Ha ! Amaba ,  --  where art thou ? Thou , in whose smile my soul did sun itself . How blessed was I , when twilight 's curtain veiled The beams of sultry day , with footsteps swift , Scarce leaving their impression on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my love ! Joy dancing in my breast , as thy accents Gave welcome greeting : then the lively dance , And song , and mirth , and converse unrestrained , Gave wings to time . O , happy , happy hours ! ( Strong emotion . ) And when returned from warfare with my foes , Not princely honors could on me bestow Such triumph as when thee with spoils I decked . Thy beauty shone , encircled by the bands Of ivory and gold , my hand had torn From necks of captive kings . ( Pauses . ) Prince ! Conqueror ! Lover ! has this been ? ( The sound of a horn is heard , he starts . ) Fool , fool ! I waken From the dream , which makes me weak and craven . That sound proclaims that I am prince no longer , But a mean slave ! called by its blast to toil For my worst foe ! O ! is there not a bolt , Launched by the thunder , that can reach his heart ? Harder than rocks , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freighted with living men , Whose shrieks they heed not ! harder is his heart , Who sported with my anguish , with the tears , Of her , he tore from me !  --  my wife ! Amaba ! ( He strikes his brow with clenched hands . ) ( In a low , bitter tone . ) With him , I too will sport , heed not his love , But mock his anguish and his bitter tears , When , pale and cold , he views the lifeless form Of his own child , his last , beloved one ; And when he faltering asks , who did the deed ? I 'll shout reply ,  --  Amaba 's spirit sent The bowl of death to Zelia !  --  this , to you !  --  Driving my dagger 's point deep in his heart , Then turn it on myself !  --  ALPHONSE , Alphonse ( who enters unseen , during the latter part of the soliloquy ) .

' T is not for vengeance only that I burn , For power hath charms sweeter than vengeance , far . The glorious day now bursts upon my sight , Which to the kingly Haytian rival gives . That day shall see a diadem circling This royal brow . Then , Zamba , thou , my friend , Shalt next the throne hold princely rank . ( Pauses . ) ( Surprised . ) How now ! Doth joy not swell the soul of Zamba ? why So sad ? all is not lost ! ZAMBA . Zamba Lost to Zamba ! Birth made me prince , fortune has made me slave .

( Aloud . ) My Zamba , Speak ! doubt not the sympathy that longs To make your woes its own . ZAMBA . Zamba Brief my sad tale . On Benin 's coast , there , where the mighty Niger Divides its waters through a hundred channels , With cooling and with fertile influence ; There was I chief . A band of daring warriors Obeyed my voice , and followed me to fight Against a hostile herd of fierce Ashantes , Descending on our hamlets ; these repelling , In the hot chase , too far we wandered ; We were surrounded and made prisoners . Then , when night closed upon that fatal day , We saw , while raging in our bonds , from far , The flame consume our dwellings : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the racked sense . It was the death-cry of our aged parents , And little children . The morrow 's dawn Brought throngs of captured people . Mothers , in prime Of womanhood , stood with their sons and daughters , Active youths , and comely maidens : these , A weeping train , followed the victor 's steps . In this sad group there stood my heart 's own idol , My dear Amaba ! who but one short moon Had blessed me with her love . As frighted bird Darts to its nest , so rushed she to my arms . Encircled thus she stood , and heedless seemed Of the hard fate that waited her and me . She cared not , while side by side we walked , Whither her footsteps tended . Alas , ' T was to the cruel sea they bore us , Grave of the helpless ! pathway to despair ! ALPHONSE .

These to chastise , And to avenge my race , now nerves this hand , Arming in virtue 's cause . ZAMBA . Zamba Nay , Alphonse , Such are subtleties of argument Above my understanding . Call you it Virtue , to fill with discontent , envy , And hate , those simple ones , whose sad estate Is servitude ? Your love of gain , of power , Will it not make them doubly slaves ?  --  then where Your virtue ? ALPHONSE . Alphonse ( Aside . ) Now may the spirit of evil Afflict me , if this I leave unpunished .

Slavery is not the ill I would avenge , Though galling is its chain . O worse ! far worse ! But thou shalt hear the tale of villany , That drinks up all my blood ! ALPHONSE . Alphonse Go on . I listen . ZAMBA . Zamba Sold to the white , Amaba shared my fate . As faded from the sight our native land , The bond uniting us , still stronger grew . Rank , honor , home , and freedom , she to me ; I , all on earth to her . Such tenderness And truth , they pitied ,  --  barbarians pitied , And would not separate .

Dragging through years of woe the maddening hope To wreak upon the head of Count De Nouville , Tyrant licentious , the woes he heaped on mine . Amaba ! this time has come ! Zamba now Hastes to meet rejoicing , on the briny wave , Thy spirit , sated with the sacrifice His hand has made . Then again on wings Of love to Benin 's burning shore , there bathe In lucid streams , and rest in fragrant bowers Our unchained souls , to separate no more . I come ! Amaba ! ALPHONSE .

Of human kind he hates but one , while I Hate all : born of mingled blood , to no one Race belong ; over them all I ' d triumph . My father white , even in his grave I curse him !

The Count de Nouville Daughter , too long has lenity been used , The ruin grows more wide . Our flocks and herds Already are the prey of miscreants , Who now destroy each other . Can I look Tamely on destruction as it hovers Over our wealth ; ourselves ? Child , who can say Whether this mischief stop short of our lives ? Perchance these wretches may presume upon , What cowardice they count in us , and lay Their treacherous hands upon our very persons . They shall be made to feel with whom they dare To trifle .

COUNT . The Count de Nouville The scourge shall Search them out ; make them confess ,  --  ZELIA . Zelia And think you Severity can open hearts ? force truth Upon the lips ? rather will it close up The heart to good , open the lips to lies , And accusation false of one another . COUNT . The Count de Nouville That can not be ; in vice , they are all alike . To punish all , far short the mark we fall not , Some guilt we always hit . Daughter , you see Not all the blackness of this race , their hearts Are darker than their faces ! ZELIA . Zelia Ah father , It is in our human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem darker . Search round the globe , is there upon its face Being more wretched than the slave , deprived Of country , kindred , liberty and hope ; Unused to toil ,  --  until , in stranger land , His eye reluctant sees the dawn , calling To fruitless labor ? COUNT . The Count de Nouville Now , out , I say , Upon such reasoning ! Was man not doomed , By the brow 's sweat , his daily bread to gain ? ZELIA . Zelia True , father , the command rests on us all , Yet all do not thus toil : we who are masters Enjoy in seeming idleness our bread ; Perchance , they who without reward , labor For us , may feel aggrieved . COUNT . The Count de Nouville Sophistry , child , I perceive thou'st learnt in yon Republic .

Zelia This may be so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain ; And hence the bitterness , with which the slave , Who is not all a slave , being in spirit Freed by Truth Divine , regards his master . COUNT . The Count de Nouville Thou art a foolish child : all men are slaves , In some guise or other ; some to their own Ignoble natures ; others to outward forms Of fashion , pomp , religion , civil law . A king ,  --  what but a master ? and we , The slaves to furnish out his lodging , food , Attire , and equipage , with regal state . And law ,  --  what is it but a decent fetter Put on society ? all men are slaves That wear it . And priestcraft ,  --  what ? ZELIA . Zelia Nay , father , Dearest father ! do not yourself a harm .

Good cabins , clothes , and food , and time for sports , Have these ungrateful villains . ( In anger . ) What ! ho , there ! Who waits ? I lose temper , daughter ; you rouse My wrath by such arguments : answer not ; Too much I 've heard already . ( Servant enters . ) Did my lord call ? COUNT .

How few there are that ask ,  --  " Who is my neighbour ? " And fewer still , like the Samaritan , Pour oil into his wounds . O my father ! No heart of stone is thine .

In youth 's fair spring , pleasure puts forth its buds ; Cull them , sweet maid , e'er faded is their bloom ; Their fragrance wasted on the passing breeze . ZELIA . Zelia Lady , think you that pleasure is the end And object sole of this our mortal life ? BARONESS . Baroness of Belfont What other end ?  --  Woman is formed for it . To youth , is lent the charm of novelty : Its magic wand , to every changing scene Enchantment gives ; this fairy season love Is in his prime . Beauty his arrows wings With lilies , roses , violets , emblems Of woman , youthful , lovely , graceful , sweet ; Empress and victor in the world of love . When time , most unsuspected , steals away The rosy hours of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid , more intense . Ease spreads its downy couch , and luxury , Substantial , varying , endless joys unfolds . ZELIA . Zelia Your picture , lady , is not yet complete : Comes there no evening to this sunny day No winter to this fruitful year ? BARONESS . Baroness of Belfont Pleasure , The goddess of each soft delight , excludes From her domain both night and age : Nature in courtly ministry , the skies , With a dark drapery veils , shutting out day , Ofttimes offensive to the softened sense : Art then with lustre hangs the fairy court Of fashion , its radiance more enchanting Than the brightest beam of sunlight . And thus When age to beauty gives the withering touch , Art quick undoes the mischief , repairing With skill divine the form and lineaments ; Bids roses bloom upon the faded cheek With deeper glow , and on the sallowed brow Lilies more fair expand . This magic court , Zelia , invites your presence . Youth , beauty , Fortune , love , to you the sceptre give . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zelia Yes , Lady , yes ! A good there is , more highly prized by me . Far sweeter than the fragrant morn of youth , Brighter than rose blooming upon the cheek Of Beauty , dearer than first sigh of Love , Than Fortune 's golden gifts more precious Is Heaven 's approving smile . Disease or age Must pale the brightest cheek : falsehood or death Wither the rose of love : than fair one 's whim Fortune more fickle still , takes back the gifts She once conferred . Think you the world will smile On us ? Ah , lady , no ! This paradise Blackened with tempest , will to desert turn , All wild and desolate : the heart in vain Seek its lost joys , and clasp the fiend , despair . But Heaven can smooth the thorny couch of care , Can still the throb which rends the aching breast , Will smile , should fortune , friendship , love , all frown , And give to death , man 's most terrific foe , An angel 's form , beaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crave .

I must now away , For numerous guests to-morrow crown my board , My people wait for orders . May I hope That you , young friend , will grace the festive scene ? ZELIA . Zelia To-morrow is the christian 's holy day , The sacred hours I dare not give to mirth ,  --  They all to Heaven belong . COUNT The Count de Nouville ( who had entered unseen ) .

Would you To a cloister ,  --  there to whine and pray ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisy herd , who arrogate , Each for himself , the right to judge , tearing The mitre from his Holiness ? Hear , me , And obey . I command thee , child , to leave Religious matters to the priesthood ; such Is their business ; yours , to please your father . Woman should have no thought , no will , but how To charm . It ill befits her tender frame And feeble mind , to enter in the lists With man , and wrangle for opinions . O , Much do I lament my own misjudgment . Better hadst thou been ignorant , even Of the elements of letters , than thus Acquire , ' mong low republicans , the art To set a father at defiance . ( With softened expression , ) Well , Let it pass ; seek now to merit the love Of him , thy future husband . Clermont 's lord Returns , and thee I destine for his bride .

Augustus comes , such was the dream I had . COUNT . The Count de Nouville What say'st thou , sweet ? speak to me my beloved ! ZELIA Zelia ( timidly ) . Didst thou , dear father , speak of young Clermont ; Or was it but a dream ? COUNT . The Count de Nouville No dream was it , I spoke of him , and every hour we wait His presence .

ZELIA . Zelia Who ? Him ! repel Augustus ? COUNT . The Count de Nouville Enough , my child . That smile , that tear , that eye and cheek tell tales .

Seashore ; a slope covered with orange and mango trees . Ship in the offing at anchor . Sunset . AUGUSTUS Augustus ( advancing ) . Hail , native Isle ! upon thy fruitful soil All-bounteous Nature lavishes her charms . How beautiful art thou ! though but a speck In this fair creation of the Great Being , Whose hand made all , and made all fair and good .

In royal state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turf of richer dye , more varied hues , Than gorgeous tapestry , pressed by the foot Of Eastern beauty on her bridal day . At early dawn , when the cool breezes play O'er silvery waves , among the forest oaks , A ruby curtain veiling half the sky , Rolls back apace , until the glorious sun A flood of light sheds over mountain top , Turret and spire . And now at closing day , When lowing flocks return to seek the fold , And birds chirp out an evening song of praise ; The orb descending shows a broader disk , Quenching his light in floods of molten gold ; While the full moon , now veiled in snowy fleece , Now riding in unclouded lustre , calms And refreshes , by her silver ray , both Wearied sense and soul . Most beautiful , ye hills , and vales , and woods ! Sweet flowers , and gentle birds , and insects bright ! Perfuming the fields , singing in groves , sporting In sunbeams , how I love ye all ! Thou Ocean too ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . All things In this material world are fair to him , Who , with the heart 's deep gratitude , receives Them as the bounteous gifts of Love supreme .

Waters ! ye flow for nought ; and lights of heaven ! Useless your fires , if man were not ! Still lives he not for you . That hand , Which felled the forests of a thousand years , Erected cities with an hundred gates , And ploughed the waves that battle with the skies ; That hand shall rest as nerveless as yon clod . The eye , that drank in beauty and explored The page of wisdom , reached the starry world , Shall close for ever its admiring gaze . The form that holds dominion o'er thee ,  --  Earth !

Lo ! the hour of setting day . Come , let us to the ocean 's side , To watch the parting , lingering ray Fade softly o'er the swelling tide . There we ' ll pour our evening hymn , While forest , field , and flood grow dim . Now , the sun has sunk to rest Upon his fleecy bed of gold , Each little warbler seeks its nest , And flocks now hasten to the fold . Come ! this is the hour to pray , Our Father seek , at closing day . See the dusky mantle fall O'er the bright flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That covers beauty in the grave . Let us make our prayer to Him , Whose brighter glories ne'er grow dim .

Here we ' ll sing our evening hymn To the bright star of Bethlehem . Nora , good Nora ! Thou who didst nurse me in my infant years , Well do I remember thy kind care , scarce Exceeded by a mother 's . With her own , Thy image , as I saw thee then , ever Is blended . Over thee , my kind old nurse , I much rejoice , that Heaven should thus extend Its mercy . Hope scarcely whispered it , though On wings of love to Mercy 's Throne , I bore Thee in my daily prayer ; and now , angels look With joy upon the grace poured in thy heart When age has blanched thy head .

Zamba Rather curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ease my thoughts and nerve my arm . Coward Blood rushes back on this heart at sight of thee .

( He pauses . ) Ill was I once , Suffering from pain and want ; no friend to care For Zamba . With temples throbbing , burning With fever and tormenting thirst , life Was too bitter : still I clung to it . Then Came the angel mercy in her shape ; yes , Zelia brought help and comfort , gave me life . Have I then grown a monster ?  --  Ha !

Disappointed hope to grief gave Place when it departed ; for you escaped My gaze and took me unawares . True is it , That help is nearest when hope is farthest . AUGUSTUS .

BARONESS . Baroness of Belfont A stranger , say you , And he unattended at this late hour ? Olinde , when will you cease these idle tales ? Not long since you stunned me with the ' count Of some poor starving and disgusting wretch , Who craved from me assistance . Another Comes ; some poor adventurer on foot .

Time was ,  --  why talk of time ? Since time has brushed but lightly o'er these charms , Nor dimmed their lustre : so says my glass : ( Looking at herself in a mirror , )  --  then Small cause for such chagrin ; an accident Of light esteem , had not Zelia , in my mind , Waked doubts of the future .

Small comfort . Philosophers do say that death is sleep Which lasts for ever ; this like I better ; But the thought is dreary . Sleep for ever ! Why , on such conditions , is life given ? O fate ! most cruel , inexorable , That placed me here . Fate ! what ! who ! where is fate ? I am sore bewildered .

Good friends , dear friends ! Much I pity you ; myself I pity too . The rich man sleeps , we wake to toil ; And when he rises from his couch of ease , Some hours have passed , since from the flinty bed , Our limbs , weary with short repose , have risen . On our bare heads the sun falls vertical , And shelter none we find from wind and storm .

( Murmurs among the slaves . ) Murmur not , good friends ; Why should we ? this is trifling : we were made To serve the white man ; we must be patient And submissive . True , scorn is hard to bear , But scorn will hurt us not . Would it were food ! Then might we have withal our mouths to fill ! Of this no need to speak , food does not lack ; Coarse it is true , but suffices hunger . Why then complain ? What to you is it That the dainty stomach of the white man Craves daintier nourishment ? Has he not gold To satisfy his wants ? Be content , my friends ; Why should ye murmur ? SLAVES . Slaves We would our rights ; This gold is ours , fruit of our own labor . ALPHONSE .

I tell ye , to complain ye have no cause ; But cause ye may have ! Manhood can bear , age Can not ; and ye are growing old ; labor Will then be hard , and perchance like Canda ,  --  Yes , like old Canda ; know ye poor Canda ? SLAVES . Slaves The aged one ? We know her : what of her ? ALPHONSE . Alphonse Within my hut I sat at yester eve , A trembling voice I heard , " Give me some food , " It said .

To white man 's land I came alone . There ' s none To care for Canda !

Baroness of Belfont Wherefore the gloom that like incubus sits So heavy at my heart ; vainly I sought By the sweet strains that never failed to charm , In the enchanting measure of the dance , In the smooth , racy jest , and merry laugh Of cavalier and dame , to drive away The melancholy fiend . ' T is vain ! The thought With added force returns : One there exists To whom I must account . My feast , this day , Zelia refused to grace ; sacred command She plead . Divine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide from the admiring gaze , Such charms as hers . My nephew , too , displeasure On his brow , took hasty leave , when revelry Commenced with joyous song . How can this be ? It is unnatural in such young years To  --  Ha ! Zelia and my nephew ! ( Enter Augustus and Zelia . ) ZELIA . Zelia 1 8 I come , Dear Lady , to pray you excuse , for what May seem you ill . Not in discourtesy Did I , this day , decline the honor of Your feast ; but my heart has other customs Learned . AUGUSTUS . Augustus I , too , dear aunt , crave pardon . BARONESS . Baroness of Belfont Nephew , Methinks you might have spared offence : to me Small matter , for my mind is sad : yet much I marvel , that you can forego the life Pleasure holds out to youth . AUGUSTUS . Augustus Ah , dearest aunt ! Have you not travell 'd the enchanted ground , Rifled the sweets of pleasure , drank of her cup Circean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at core armed with cruel points Footnote : 1Kb That wound the taster ? And the nectarous draught , Has it not bitter in its sediment ? BARONESS . Baroness of Belfont I would , Augustus , I could answer nay : I can not ! But perchance it is in wealth Thou seekest bliss ? if so , to add to thine I have such store might satisfy the wish Of Croesus . Thou art my heir , content thee . AUGUSTUS . Augustus Riches ' t is true possess their value ; but how much ? Can they buy friendship for the lonely heart ; Or bring they comfort in affliction 's hour ? Do they pluck anguish from the couch of pain ; Or will they draw the sting from sharp remorse ? Can they bribe death for one short hour of life ? Ah ! can they purchase Heaven ? BARONESS . Baroness of Belfont They can not : Yet is not earth without its good . If gold Be trash , and riches do take wing , still fame Is solid , good and lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must give bliss . AUGUSTUS . Augustus Let Beauty speak . Its bloom and fragrance rare Fade in the sun and waste upon the breeze , And time , the pilferer , leaves it not a charm . Beauty that 's past , like sear and faded flowers , Is gone : the hearts it gained , will fly to charms Newer and brighter , Let the illustrious , Proclaim their victories . O'er midnight lamps They 've toiled , in tented fields they ' ve bled , and found The good they sought ; but what is it ? listen : Vanity and vexation are inscribed On all : fools have done as much as we , and Praise is but breath , passing like summer breeze , Rippling the ocean but to toss a straw , The next hour ' t is still , and the straw moves not Thus with fame . Shall we cater then for joys Of sense , with them to feed the mind ? seeking Its high ambition to content , with praise Of mortals ; persuade the noble Reason That dust is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whither go , With the fond yearning of the unsated soul ? How satisfy the longing of the heart , That sought for happiness from every breeze Or gleam of sunshine , calling it good , Substantial good ? I sought it from the world And in myself , but vainly sought : where then Shall I seek happiness ? ZELIA . Zelia In God alone , the source Of good , we find the spring of joy unfailing . ( Exeunt . ) SCENE III . Path to the seashore , shaded with vines and flowering shrubs . Augustus and Zelia . ZELIA . Zelia Happiness ! Earth is full of it ; so light within me Sits my spirit , I seem to move on air : Mere words , a vehicle for thought too heavy . AUGUSTUS . Augustus Add to them wings of music , dearest ; And while the path we thread to the cottage Of pious Lawton , it will calm thy thought Love , to pour it out in song . ZELIA . Zelia Willingly , If thus it please thee . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buds , That perfume the softening gale ; And sweet to rove where the summer floods Wind through the leafy vale : There with the friend we love , to stray , While watching the gentle swell Of the silvery wave , and list to the lay Of the evening bird , as she sings farewell To the gorgeous sovereign of day . And pleasant the sound of the hallowed bell , That tells of the hour of prayer ; And pleasant the sound of the organ 's deep swell And the hymn as it bursts on the ear . But sweeter far with the friend we love , Away from the busy world to rove , And walk to the house of prayer ; We feel that our Father , who hears from above , With blessing will meet us there . AUGUSTUS . Augustus True , dearest ; Friendship 's the balm of life , the honied drop By mercy mingled in the cup of woe ; When wealth and beauty pass , and the world 's smile Passes with them , does friendship follow too ? Not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart in sorrow 's hour . The world too joyous , flies the couch of pain ; Friendship is there , to pillow on its breast The aching head . Such friend to me , thou ' lt be My Zelia ! and I , such friend to thee . ( Sings . ) Should old Time , with heavy pace , Wear furrows in thy lovely face , Brushing away its bloom and grace , Grief nigh thee , Earth fly thee , Still love 's immortal smile , Time can not chase . ( Both Zelia , Augustus sing . ) Then by the stream of life borne down , In other 's bliss , ourselves we crown ; Pass lightly by the world 's cold frown , Side by side May we glide , ' Scaping all storms , safe to the port of rest . SCENE IV . Seashore ; Cottage , negroes outside , in the attitude of worship ; among them in Zamba , in deep attention . Mr Lawton standing at the porch . Augustus and Zelia , at a little distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stands , in meek humility ; Lifting up holy hands with fervent prayer , Prayer for the sinful , sorrowful , and weak . AUGUSTUS . Augustus Ah , what a prayer was that ! it seemed as Heaven Drew near to earth , and God was there to hear . And was he not ? sure from his dwelling-place High in the heavens , he looks on man below , And listens when his servants plead . Their tears He gathers up , sending down showers of grace , To water seed they sow in sadness here . Listen we to the message . ( They approach the porch . ) MR . LAWTON Mr. Lawton ( speaks to the slaves ) . My children ! Hear the words from Heaven , speaking good-will . Burdened are ye ? Sweet rest to you they bring ; Rest in your God from sorrow , guilt , despair . Hungry are ye ? Here is the bread of life . Thirsty ? A spring from the fount eternal , Sends out pure water ; drink , and live for ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasure unfailing ; more than the whole store From old Golconda 's mine : the pearl of price , More precious than the product , all amassed Of ocean in its twice ten thousand caves . Enslaved are ye ? the jubilee is come , The price is paid ; return ye ransomed ones . Do bitter sorrows press around the heart ? Come , then , and cast them at the feet of Him , Who bore our sorrows and who shares our griefs . No friend have you ? He is a friend unfailing ; Brother is not so near , mother so kind . No home ? Look then away from earth , see , far Beyond the confines of this narrow world , Higher than yonder stars and the pure sky , A dwelling is prepared , in which the light Of our own sun would be but darkness ; for It is lighted by the smile of Him , who , In light unconceived , doth dwell .

Angels weep thus o'er sinning men . MR . LAWTON Mr. Lawton ( continues ) . Fear not , ye little flock ; your father wills A kingdom to bestow : Soon shall your labors cease ; The fight of faith be won , the crown bestowed . Your mansion is prepared ; a few more tears , A few more sighs , your Saviour calls you home ; Press on , look upwards , and obtain the prize ! ( Hymn sung by a chorus of voices . Chorus ) How beautiful upon the mountains Are the beams of rising day ; How sweet the gush of bubbling fountains , In the thirsty traveller 's way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace ! And sweeter far than gushing fountains Are the messages of grace . To the mind , in darkness straying , Bright the light of Truth appears ; Upon the heart , where sorrow 's preying , How the Gospel 's comfort cheers . To the tempted and forsaken Sweet it is bright Hope to bring ; To the soul by guilt o'ertaken Doubly sweet of Grace to sing . ( The negroes with reverence salute Mr. Lawton and retire . Augustus and Zelia Augustus , Zelia advance towards the cottage and meet them . They speak in kind and cheerful tone to the slaves . ) Good evening , friends , good evening to you all : Glad are we to see ye . ZAMBA Zamba ( aside ) . Wretched Zamba ! Friend , say they ?

Thanks for the Gospel too And for this holy man . But more than all Thanks for the blessed Saviour : for sinners Like us he died . May we love God , and man , Work faithfully , and when we die ascend To Heaven ! ( Exeunt slaves , ascending the hill . Zamba retires among the trees and falls on his knees . ) ZELIA . Zelia My heart , Augustus , is now full of joy ; Another drop would make it overflow . O ! that the Lady Belfont might discover The only source of joy , and taste the stream Flowing from this Fount : Love to God , and To our neighbour Love .

( Mr. Lawton , approaching from the cottage , meets Augustus and Zelia . ) MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton Lady , good eve ; permit My welcome of the Lord Clermont , with thanks For this attendance on our worship . AUGUSTUS . Augustus Thanks Would I pay to you , revered and worthy Sir , For care upon these ignorant men bestowed , More wretched made through ignorance and sin Than by their servitude . I hail the day Auspicious , which to minds benighted , brings The light of Truth , and to those enslaved Redemption : distant or near ' t is bright . Beams Of celestial glory alone outshine Its radiance . Then , sin restrained , woe in A fearful deluge shall cease o'er men to sweep .

Augustus , thou ! and Zelia ! in discourse Most treasonable , with a low dastard , Who , with base intent to undermine The fealty of our people , has landed In this Isle ; not openly , but in treacherous Privacy , has footing gained . Dark hints I have just heard , of insurrection , and , Questioning the faithful servitor of The Lady Belfont , from Alphonse , I heard Of nightly haunts of slaves , within this hut , Inhabited by this mischievous man ! ( To Mr. Lawton . ) Whence came you , and by what authority Are you here ? MR . LAWTON . Mr. Lawton My lord , as fitly might I question by what right you such demand Make of me .

Holla there ; guards ! I 'll teach this man devout , that e'er he thus Practise his subtile arts , a grant he show From other power . AUGUSTUS Augustus ( to the guards ) . Hold ! at your peril , hold ! Dare not to lay unhallowed hand on him , Who comes ambassador from the High Court , Which soon must try , both you , and me , and all .

The Count de Nouville Peace , peace , rash youth ! The vengeance of the Church May on your head be brought for heresy . Vain is your boast of power ; for you depend In person and possessions yet on me . Your father 's friend will pass as though unheard , The warmth of wild enthusiasm : stir not Then my wrath . AUGUSTUS . Augustus My father 's friend I most duly honor ; still more , in him Beholding the parent of my Zelia , By him permitted to call mine , thus he My father . These dear ties justly claim My gratitude , my duty , love : but the debt I owe unto my Saviour , God , cancel They not ; annul not to Him allegiance , Nor constrain me in his cause my interest To disown , and on his name to suffer Such foul reproach .

Welcome are these bonds ; I receive them With joy , as tokens of the honor , which On me is conferred : counted worthy To suffer in the cause dearer to me Than life .

My heart says not : then am I unjust . This Can I acknowledge ? confess myself at fault ! O , that were mean . How can I bow to man ? Yet am I not amenable to One Above me ? I feel it so . Already The sting I bear within me on myself Turns , piercing my very soul . Is this all ?
