txt On the 4th , it was announced in New York , that " an office for this necessary business xviii doubtless be put under proper regulations by the Continental Congress , and no more be permitted to return to the rapacious hands of unauthorized intruders since it would be the most contemptible pusillanimity to suffer a revenue to he raised from our property to defray the expense of cutting our throats , " and that " Mr. William Goddard , who has been a great sufferer , with many others , by the maipractices of an illegal holder of this office , " was on a journey to the eastward to put the business in train to be laid before Congress . Congress established the American Continental post-office in July 26 , 1775 ; and thus superseded all the private mails . Congress then resolved , " That the communication of intelligence with frequency and dispatch , from one part to another of this extensive continent , is essentially requisite to its safety . That is the corner stone of our American post-office , and not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event , to support itself . The old " Articles of Confederation " gave to Congress " the sole and exclusive power " to establish mails . The fact that the words " sole and exclusive " were left out of the new constitution in 1787 , is conclusive to show that it was not intended to conner an odious and oppressive monopoly upon the government . They had had enough of such a system under the crown . Depend upon it , unless the reasonable wishes of the pOol ) le are met by Congress , the means will be found of establishing cheap mails on all the productive routes in the country . THOUGHTS ON THE RICHES OF THE NATURAL WORLD . THE diligent student of Nature , particularly in the departments of Chemistry and Natural Philosophy , will feel , as he advances , a constantly increasing conviction of these three great truths : first , that the world we inhabit is stored with riches far beyond what is generally known or conceived of ; secondly , that the world was made for man ; and thirdly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many in contra* distinction to the few . In the present paper , we propose to offer a few observations on the Riches of the Natural World as exhibited in the powers , in the productions , and in the embellishments of the physical creation . Few of our race , it is believed , are aware how noble and beautiful a heritage our Creator has prepared for us-what great and diversified offices the powers of na ture stand ready to perform at our bidding-how multiplied are the productions of the natural world , and what a variety of purposes they are severally capable of servingand what costly ornaments the Divine Architect has employed to decorate this fair workmanship of his hands , the great temple of nature . Nor is the student of nature himself always fully sensible of the extent of her treasures . Each one , for the most part , confines his views to some corn r or limited portion of the structure , unconscious of the riches that are stored , with no less profusion , in every other part of the vast edifice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he has chanced to select as the field of his own study , that he can hardly imagine that other fields , unexplored by him , are equally filled // with riches and beauty . This , indeed , seems the more incredible to him , because the farther he advances , the more impressed he is with the belief that his own department of nature is the peculiar favorite of heaven , since the more he explores the more exhaustless appears the mine . To each one his own art or science seems more admirable , in proportion as his attainments in it grow higher and higher . Thus the charms of music seem most exhaustless to such proficients as Handel and Mozart ; the flower most beautiful to the botanist ; the gem most precious to the mineralogist ; the bird most into resting to the ornithologist ; cart h , sea , and air , to the natural philosopher ; the starry heavens to the astronomer . But it is only *ihen the powers and the prod uciions of the natural world are surveyed in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any adequate idea can be formed of the riches of the natural world at large . In estimating the treasures of the vegetable kingdom , for example , how many different views of it must he taken , before its value to man can he fully comprehended . Botafly , which describes and classifies the ninety thousand different species of plants ; Physiology , which investigates the laws of vegetable life Chemistry , which explores the hidden elements , and discloses the nature and composition of all vegetable products ; Architecture , At*riculture , and Gardening , each in their several departments ; Political Economy , which investigates the relations this kingdom of nature bears to the sustenance and comfort of the human race ; and finally Taste , which contemplates this part of creation in respect to the images it forms of the beautiful and sublime : all these different sciences and arts must be contemplated , in their respective relations to the vegetable kingdom , before any just conception can be formed of the vastness of its treasures . Indeed , when we consider how boundless is the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited nature of our intellectual powers , and the brevity of our lives , we feel that , before we can rise to the full comprehension of the " Riches of the Natural World , " we must be endowed with a nobler nature , and clothed with immortality . Then shalt we see and hear and know , Alt we desired or wished below . Such a view of creation has , we believe , been adequately taken only by spiritual beings , as when " the morning stars* sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy . " But we feel impressed with the solemn thought , that God only has seen even this lower world in the fullness of its treasures ; that it formed a part ( perhaps but an infinitesimal part ) of that first comprehensive view which he took of his new creation , when he saw every thing I/tat he had made , an ( l pronoun9ed it " very good . " He looked abroad upon the earth and heavens : then , first , the mountains and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the field clapped their hands . With what emotions did the Infinite Mind survey his works , and , for the first time , contemplate the great machine of the Universe ! It is not irreverent to suppose that He first surveyed it , not only in its external forms of beauty and grandeur , but also in the laws which govern its operations , or regulate its motions . Under the control of chemical principles which He had ordained , vapors are beginning to ascend and gather on high in majestic clouds to water the earth with showers-springs are gushing from a thousand fountains-rivers commencing their long circuits to the sea , and the sea rolling its waves . Even the dark recesses of the earth were not hidden ; but ere Geology had disclosed its wonders , the deep foundations of the earth in their appointed // order , the records of mighty revolutions in the chaotic period , and glittering stores of mineral wealth , passed in this grand review before the Omniscient eye . Atomic laws were just beginning to exert their sway over the particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and diamonds and precious stones to send forth their streams of light . Meanwhile , the laws of organw nature were commencing their appropriate functions-seeds germinating-buds swelling-flowers expanding and exhaling their perfumes  --  and forests beginning to wave . Animals in all their varied tribes are walking on the earth , or flying in the air , or swimming in the floods . Finally , the great Creator lifts his view to the heavens , and beholds the great machine of the Universe commencing its sublime movements-planets and suns just starting on their circuits , some measuring their periods by days , some by years , and some by countless ages-all presenting to the Infinite Mind the purest harmony . rpo imitate Jehovah , as one might humbly and reverently presume to do , in such a comprehensive review of his great creation , would require the united powers of the philosop her , the poet , and the Christian . None but the philosopher deeply read in the mysteries of natural science , and able to grasp the laws of the natural world ; none but the poet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the beautiful realms of nature ; none but the Christian whose heart swells with gratitude as lie recognizes , in both the law 's and the embellishments of the physical world , the language of love ; none but he who unites , in enlarged proportions , qualifications so exalted , could ever hope successfully to take the grand review . The illustrious Humboldt , who is attempting a sketch of the natural world , and has already in his " Cosmos " executed some parts of the portraiture with consummate skill , will , we fear , finally fail of giving the highest possible finish to his great picture , by uniting in his own person only the first two of these qualifications , without even any recognition of the Creator . But though a survey of creation like that which God himself first took of his works , would be necessary in order to the full comprehension of the " riches of the natural world , " yet even in our present imperfect state , we may form some faint conceptions , at least , of these treasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the physical creation . The great powers of nature , namely , attraction , heat , light , electricity , and magnetism , display their riches in the energy of their action , in their adaptation to the condition of man , and in the numerous purposes which they are severally capable of fulfilling . First , the forces by which the phenomena of the physical world are controlled , are endued with astonishing energy . Examples of this are seen in the expansion and contraction of bodies on heating and cooling ; in the congelation of water ; in the shrinking of ropes by capillary attraction ; in the circulation of vegetable and animal fluids ; in the sudden expansion of elastic bodies ; in the velocity of light and electricity ; and in the effects of gravity at the surface of the earth , or of universal gravitation among the heavenly bodies . The hardest rocks are split to a great depth by kindling a fire on the top , and , when the surface is red hot , dashing on buckets of cold water . The unequal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top to bottom . A few years since , a large public building in the city of Paris , was found to be in danger of falling , in consequence of its opposite walls having lost their parallelism , so that the upper portions // were slowly but constantly receding from each other . To arrest the danger , small holes were drilled through the walls , in which were inserted iron wires extending horizontally between the opposite waIls , and protruding through them on the outside . To one end was attached a nut closing upon the outside of the wall , while the other end was fixed into a screw to which a corresponding nut was attached . All things being thus arranged , lamps were suspended from the wires , which thus became heated , and of course expanded in length . While in this state , the nuts were turned upon the projecting screws , close to the wall . The lamps being now extinguished , the wires contracted to their original length , and with so much force as to draw the massive walls to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it freezes , is known by many familiar examples . In an experiment in which this force was made to burst a metallic ball , it was estimated at more than twenty-seven thousand pounds . The enlargement of volume is ascribed to the crystalline arrangement which the parti. des assume in congelation , and the force exerted is , therefore , merely that which accompanies crystallization . Capillary attraction also affords many instances of the energy with which even the humbler powers of nature act . There was an obelisk of vast weight at Rome lying on the ground , which it was required to raise and place upon a pedestal . Appropriate machinery with ropes were employed , by means of which the mass was lifted from the ground ; but the ropes having stretched , it could not be swung clear of the pedestal . The labor of numerous hands for many days seemed to have availed nothing , when , by a fortunate suggestion , the ropes were wet , and contracted with so much force as to lift the obelisk to the full height required . Millstones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for the purpose , wedges of willow wood , and exposing them to the damp air of night . By the moisture wJ*iich they imbibe by capillary attraction , they swell with such force as to cleave off the huge blocks of stone . The force with which the sap of trees circulates , is sometimes prodigious . Many years ago Dr. Hales measured this force , by causing it to act against a column of quicksilver , and found it capable of supporting a column thirty-two and a half inches in height , exceeding therefore the pressure of the atmosphere , being more than sixteen pounds upon every square inch . But the foregot n g are feeble manifestations of the energy of the powers of nature , compared with those exhibited by heat , both directly and through the medium of elastic fluids . It is calculated by engineers that there is virtue in a bushel of coals properly consumed to raise , a foot high , seventy million pounds weight . Sir John Herschel sets forth the energy of this force by several striking illustrations . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Blanc , is only equivalent to that afforded by the combustion of two pounds of coal ; that the celebrated Menai bridge in Wales , which consisted of a mass of iron not less than four millions of pounds in weight , and was suspended at a medium height of one hundred and twenty feet above the sea , could he lifted to its place by the force generated by only seven bushels of coals ; that the great pyramid of Egypt , which covers eleven acres of ground , and is estimated to weigh more than twelve thousand millions of pounds , required to raise it a power no greater than is contained in six hundred and thirty chaldrons of coal , a quantity consumed in some founderies in a week . The violence with which gun powder explodes , is only an instance // of the energy of the force of repulsion , by which elastic fluids seek to expand . Count Rumford has estimated that twenty-eight grains of powder , which he confined in a cylindrical space that it just filled , exerted a force in tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strain of four hundred thousand pounds . Yet , astonishing as are these examples of the energies of the powers of nature , the chemist in his laboratory evolves expansive compounds immensely more violent , and whose force is wholly immeasurable . Light , electricity , and magnetism , manifest wonderful energy in the velocity of their motions . How indistinct is our usual conception of the speed of light , when we reflect that it would dart across the Atlantic ocean in the sixty-fourth part of a second , and , in the fifth part of a second , would circumnavigate the globe ! Yet the velocity of electricity is still greater . According to a beautiful series of experiments of Prof. Wheatstone , published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1834 , the electric fluid in passing through a conducting wire from one side of a charged jar to the other , hc*s a velocity exceeding 576,000 miles in a second of time . Gravity , however , surpasses all other natural forces in the grandeur of its exhibitions of mechanical power . Although the amount of gravity contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but an infinitessimal part of that which the earth can put forth , yet the momentum with which this instrument descends , affords a glimpse of the power it represents . But we are most familiar with the exhibitions of gravity in bodies descending inclined planes , as in the avalanche and the cataract . An attempt has recently been made by Mr. Z. Allen to estimate the mechanical power exerted by the Falls of Niagara . He comes to the conclusion , that " the motive power of the Cataract of Niagara , exceeds by nearly forty fold all the mechanical force of water and steam power , rendered available in Great Britain , for the purpose of imparting motion to the machinery that suffices to perform the manufacturing labors for a large portion of the inhabitants of the world , including also the power applied for transporting these products by steamboats and steam cars , and steam ships of war , to the remotest seas . Indeed it appears probable that the law of gravity , as established by the Creator , puts forth in this single water-fall more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the artificial machinery of the habitable glohe. " * Yet , how inconsiderable is the exhibition of power manifested in the Cataract of NiaQara , compared with that of the same force as it resides in the sun , and causes the planets to revolve around it as a centre . If we could conceive of a giant of such strength as to be able , when standing on a small island in the ocean , and holding upon a rope attached , at the farther end , to the bow of a ship of war under full sail , to draw the ship from its course and cause it to turn around the island , the powers of the giant would seem miraculous ; yet , by a force exerted on the planets in a somewhat similar way , the sun turns them from the straight courses in which they tend to move , and coml ) els them to revolve around him . Here , instead of a ship of war , are *vorlds , some of which vastly outweigh the earth ; and worlds , moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeding , in some instances , sixty times the greatest velocity of a cannon ball . But of little avail , for the purposes of man , would be the fact that the powers of nature act with such immense energy , if they were incapable of being ap // propriated by him to his own use in just such portions as his exigencies require . Therefore , Secondly , the powers of nature display their riches , by their adaptation to the condition of man . The property of elasticity , for example , we may employ either in the delicate hair-spring of a watch , or in the force of gunpowder to blow up a ship of war . Heat we may appropriate to use , throughout an immense range of temperature ; employing it , at one time , on the domestic hearth to impart a gentle warmth to the air we breathe ; at another , at a higher degree , to boil water and prepare our food ; and we may successively ascend the scale , until we fuse metals , and dissipate in vapor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may use a single degree of heat to impart a softness to the air of a room , or we may employ nearly twenty thousand degrees to melt platina . Yet the manageableness of this power , is not so conspicuous when applied directly to bodies , as when employed in the form of steam . So unlimited is the range of force in the elasticity which heat imparts to steam , that , by its aid , man with almost equal ease , draws out a thread finer than a gossamer , and conducts a thousand tons of merchandise on a railway , or a mighty ship across the ocean . The power which man may borrow from these great forces of nature by appropriating them to his use , is finely illustrated in the magnetic telegraph . Here is a single property ,  --  namely , the property of metallic substances to conduct the electric fluid nearly instantaneously , - which lay for several centuries a barren fact . It **ight , indeed , have been anticipated , by a sound analogy , that so remarkable a property as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made to achieve for him things equally re VOL . VJ. markable ; * but still the knowledge of this property remained entirely unproductive , until , at quite a ceent period , the obvious thought cam up that electricity might , by means of this property , heco ne the vehicle of intelligence , and convey it with the speed of lightning . Already bus this obscure property of electricity , but yesterday a barren fact in Natu.al Philosophy , changed the face of society , nor can human sagacity divine all the changes which it is destined to effect in the affairs of this wo4ld . Even during the short time the mugnetic telegraph has been in operation , what xvondrous changes it has produced Intelligence of every kind , political , commercial , personal , and scientific , is borne not on the " wings of the wind , " but on the wings of lightning . News of elections , of revolutions , of the operations of war and the negotiations of peace , of every new measure of government , of every judicial decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eacth with the velocity of light . During the recent convention at Philadelphia for nominating a candidate for President of the United States , intelligence of the fin ' 1 ballot reached New Haven ic.r Pittsburg , Cleaveland and Buffalo , in a few minutes after the result was announced ! Nor is commercial intelligence exceeded by political in celerity ; but notices of departures and arrivals , of changes in foreign markets , the price current for the day of merchandise and stocks , flow from the great metropolis in a manner resembling , but * lYhenever a singnhr and remarkat ) le property is observed in any substance , natural or artifiejal , it may be inferred that extraordinary effects wilt one day be performed with it . Thus It night safely have been asserted that a substance so elastic , *o tough , so impervious to air and water , as India Rubber , was never intended by Providence merely to rub out pencit marks , which was the principal use to which it was devoted until within a short period . // greatly exceeding in velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the heart through all the arteries . Orders for merchandise , and receipts of money , are sent from remote parts of the Union to the Atlantic cities , or in the opposite direction , with equal speed . At Hudson , in Ohio , at half past three o'clock , in the afternoon , full intelligence is received of all the transactions of business , and of all iraportaut events that have transpired in the city of New York up to three o'clock . At all places westward of the metropolis , differing in longitude a degree or more , news is received at an earlier hour of the day than that at which it is transmitted ; so completely has man , by this appropriation of one of the great powers of nature , learned to outrun the diurnal revolution of the earth . At St. Louis , the time of the day at which intelligence is received from New York may be earlier than that at which the message is dispatched , by a whole hour ; so that news sent from the metropolis at three may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A singular aid may be afforded to commerce and navigation by the power of the electric telegraph to herald the approach of storms . " In the Atlantic ports of the United States , ( says Mr. Redfield , ) the approach of a gale , when the storm is yet on the Gulf of Mexico , or in the southern or western states , ma ybe made known by means of the electric telegraph . This will enable the merchant to avoid exposing his vessel to a furious gale soon after leaving her port . By awaiting the arrival of the storm , and promptly putting to sea with its closing winds , a good offing and rapid progress will be secured by the voyager. ' ** Personal and domestic intelligence is carried with the like astounding results . A lady of Springfield re * Amer . Jour . Science , Nov. , 1846. cently received a message from Hartford at twenty minutes after ten o'clock , A.M. , five minutes after the order was given at Hartford , desiring her presence in that city , the distance being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars and arrived at Hartford at ten minutes after eleven o'clock , only fiftyfive minutes from the time the request was first communicated at the telegraph office . Nor do the results of the telegraph appear less promising or remarkable in relation to the purposes of science . This instrument affords one of the best methods of finding the diJJ'ere cc of longitude between two places . Any signals made between two distant places at the same moment of absolute time , will lead to a knowledge of the difference of local times between the two places at that moment , and thus ( allowing a degree for every four minutes ) the difference of longitude becomes known . The magnetic telegraph by transmitting such signals instantaneously , affords a peculiarly convenient and accurate method of accomplishing this object . During the year 1847 , Mr. S. C. Walker , of the Coast Survey , arranged a plan for determining , by this method , the difference of longitude between Washinuton City , Philadelphia , and New York . The observations were skilfully conducted , at the foregoing places respectively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result showed that this method of finding the difference of longitude , would compare with the most accurate method hitherto discovered . Many phenomena of nature are of transient duration , and in order to simultaneous observations of those in different places , nothing can be conceived of more fortunate than the electric telegraph , by which notice of the occurences may , within a few minutes , be communicated to astronomers over a whole contineat . Had the news that the great // Comet of 1843 was shining , as it did with portentous brightness , near the sun at noonday , been heralded by the telegraph through the United States , instead of the startling sight being confined to three or four individuals capable of taking accurate observations upon it , hundreds of astronomers might have enjoyed the exciting spectacle , and recorded the movements of the wonderful stranger . Professor Loomis , in the investigation of the phenomena and progress of a great storm that traversed a large part of the United States , sought by very numerous inquiries , involving a laborious correspondence , to ascertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , throughout all parts of the Union at the same time , by which important and interesting conclusions are drawn respecting the laws of storms . It is easy to see how happily the electric telegraph might be employed , to convey to a common focus , information respecting these and other meteorological phenomena . The foregoing examples of the practical uses to man of electricity ,  - -  uses developed in the infancy of the invention of the electric telegraph ,  - -  are to be regarded only as an earnest of what this power is destined to achieve for man ; and they furnish but one among a thousand instances of the fertility of a single property of one of the great powers of nature . Thirdly , the powers of nature display their riches by the numerous purposes which they are severally capable of fulfilling . This characteristic also holds * , ood with respect to many of the productions of the natural world , a few of which are so fertile in useful properties and applications , as to seem the favorites of nature . The four substances selected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fire , air , earth , and water , afford , severally , happy examples of the riches of the natural world , in the vast number of ways in which they serve the happiness or comfort of the human family . It is , indeed , one mark by which the gifts of nature are distinguished from the works of art , that the former usually serve a vast many different purposes , while the latter are for the most part limited to a single purpose . An artist expects nothing else of a watch than accurately to give the time of day , nor any thing more of the telescope than to afford an improved view of the heavenly bodies . But not so with the works of nature : they are seldom limited to a single useful purpose , and even where a single object seems to have been in view as the chief end , so many subordinate and incidental ends are carried along in its train , that these sometimes almost surpass in utility the main design . Thus the air is so intimately associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to cease to breathe is to die ; yet how numerous and diversified are the other purposes which the atmosphere fulfils It conveys to plants as well as animals their nourishment and life ; it tempers the heat of summer with its breezes ; it binds down all fluids and prevents their passing suddenly into the state of vapor ; it supports the clouds , distils the dew , and waters the earth with showers ; it multiplies the light of the sun and diffuses it over earth and sky ; it feeds our fires , turns our machines , wafts our ships , and conveys to the ear all the sentiments of language and all the melodies of music ; and , finally , furnishes a medium through which the numerous feathered tribes may reach their aerial habitations , or perform their joyous evolutions , or take their distant journeys through the skies . The element of earth , composing as it does the fabric of the globe , seems intended , in its main design , to furnish a resting place for man // and his works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface , or a shelter for such as dwell in its caverns ; and a mechanical support and a medium of sustenance to trees and plants . But , to multiply its incidental benefits , here the earth rises in cool mountains , there it sinks in fertile vales , and there it spreads in luxuriant plains . The beautiful and sublime are profusely scattered over its broken surface , while beneath repose exhaustless quarries of granite , and free-stone , and marble ; mines of iron and coal , of salt and gypsum ; veins of lead and tin , of silver and gold ; and scattered treasures of the ruby , and emerald , and sapphire , and diamond . But such general statements as we have hitherto made , can never convey so full an impression of the riches of the natural world , as the complete acalysis of some one of the productions of nature , exhibited in all its useful properties , and relations . Let us then descend from generalities , and take a more minute and comprehensive view of the resources of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; contemplating this substance , successively , in its.Natural History , its Chemical , its P ysiological , and its Mechanical properties and relations . 1 . Natural History contemplates things as presented to the eye by nature herself ; and the Natu*al History of Water , comprehends , first , its external characters as exhibited in the different forms of oceans , lakes , rivers , springs , and atmospheric vapor ; and , secondly , the circulatory system , by which it is made to revolve in an endless round from the sea to the land , and back again from the land to the sea . The ocean has an average depth of about five miles , * and covers full three fourths of the globe . * Philosophers differ in their estimates of the depths of the ocean . According to La Place its arcra*a depth is no inure The animal tribes that live in the sea , have , therefore , a far more ample domain than those which inhabit the land . Fishes occupy the ocean to the depth of six hundred feet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacious than those animals that tenant the surface of the earth . Whales , and a few other aquatic animals , occasionally plunge much deeper into the abyss than the limit here assigned . Before we reflect on the riches of the ocean , we are apt to think of the " wide waste of waters " as an unfruitful desert ; but when we come to view the important offices it fulfills in the economy of nature , and see what treasures it conceals in its deep recesses , and what facilities it affords for intercourse between the nations of the earth , we no longer look upon this part of creation as furnishing an exception to the general riches of the natural world . So important is the part which the ocean perfo ms in the circulatory system of waters , that this perhaps may be regarded as its chief end , while all the other useful purposes it serves , may be considered as merely incidental . In the early periods of society , two things seemed mysterious-why the sea was not full , and why the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only return to the sea the water they had previously borrowed from it . It was first raised in vapor from the wide expc nse , boine by winds over the land , arid supplied to it under the forms of dew , rain , and snow . The rivers than five miles , although , from the phenomen of the tides , he infers that the Atlantic , in the central parts , is nine miles deep . The deepest soundings hitherto 1115 ( 10 , were instituted by Capt . Ross , in the middle of the South Atlantic , ( Lat. j50 S. , Long . 230 W. ) where no bottom was found at the depth of 27,600 feet , or more than five miles . In other places , apparently in mid-ocean , bottom has been reached at depths varying from 12,000 to 18,000 feet. - ( Wilkes , in Am . Jour . Science , Jan. 1848. ) // run down to the sea loaded with impurities , but in the returning system all things are directed towards restoring the water to perfect purity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sweet fountains . As it rises from the sea by the process of natural evaporation , it leaves behind the salt and every foreign substance ; but as it is liable again to imbibe impurities from the atmosl ) here , it is subjected to a thorough filtration as it penetrates the upper strata of the earth ( which are of a texture admirably adapted to this purpose ) and returns to its pristine state divested of every unwholsome property . When the earth is frozen , and can no longer cleanse the water by filtration , the drops of rain crystallize in the form of snow , and thus attain a similar purity . Beneath the sand and gravel that compose the upper surface of the earth , and furnish a medium so suitable for the purpose of filtration , there is usually found , at a moderate depth , a stratum of clay which arrests the ( lescent of the water , and renders it easily accessible by man . But sometimes this is wantin* , , and the water collects in reservoirs at great depths in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally be reached by Artesian wells , some of which have been opened to the depth of more than * , OOO feet ; and thus , in nearly every place on the habitable surface of the globe , man has it in his power to supply himself with an element so essential to his happiness , in a state of perfect purity . When collected in these deep reservoirs , being under strong pressure , it imbibes and retains a larger quantity than usual of atmospheric air , or carbonic acid , the escape of which , when the water is drawn to the surface , imparts to it that sparkling quality , which is so inspiring in the waters drawn from these salubrious fountains . Sometimes the springs that issue from these deep reservoirs , bring up intelligence of the heat of the interior 9f the earth , or become impregnated with saline and gaseous substances , and gush forth in thermal springs and lifegiving fountains . Rivers , in their main design , seem destined merely for returning to the sea the waters that were before raised from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and replenished the internal reservoirs ; but , in consonance with the general analogies of nature already explained , they are made to accomplish many other benevolent purposes they impart fertility as they run ; they wind their way through devious courses , both to retard the velocity of their descent , and more widely to spread their blessings over green meadows and flowery vales ; they open a way into the heart of every country for vessels and steamboats ; and , at every step of their progress , they offer to the feeble arm of man the aid of their vast mechanical power . If rivers open a way into the heart of every country , so the ocean opens a vast high way to all parts of the earth , and unites all nations in the bands of commerce , giving to each country the choicest productions , natural or artificial , of mind or matter , of every other . Nor is it alone in view of the circulatory system of waters , or as the medium of commercial intercourse , that the ocean contributes its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we reflect how many articles of convenience or luxury , and how large a part of the food of man , are derived from the ocean , we shall find that its own inherent treasures are immense . The Natural history of water affords so many illustrations of its uses , that we seem to require no further developments of the riches that lie folded up in this wonderful element ; but we have only just begun to unveil its treasures , and hasten therefore , to contemplate , // of water in respect to the elements of which it is composed , and to the changes of nature which it is capable of producing in all other substances , or of receiving from them . In its composition water is rernarkable , being constituted solely of oxygen and hydrogen , the two most important simple bodies known to Chemistry , oxygen being the great supporter of combustion , the vital principle of the air in respiration , and the most general acidifier ; being present in greater or less proportion , in nearly every compound , whether in the mineral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen constituting either wholly or in part almost all combustible bodies ; * while the two elements , uniting in various proportions , form in conjunction with pure charcoal ( carbon ) the greater part of the material of all vegetables . Since water consists of two elements , of which one is the most combustible of bodies , and the other the great agent which sustains combustion , the idea has long been entertained , that water itself may be so treated that its elements shall no longer so act as to neutralize each other 's properties , but shall severally exert their individual properties and thus become fuel . Nor are there wanting experiments which favor this idea , and encourage the hope , that , when the forests are consumed and the mines of coal exhausted , there may be found in water itself a store-house of fuel , adequate to the utmost wants of man . Not only do the elements of water , individually , perform most extensive and important functions in the economy of nature , but water itself , in its own capacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant an agent in all the changes * Since oxygen is contained in almost atl bodies , its presence in water may appear little remarkable ; but it constitutes so large a proportion of this body , that water seems ibe original source or fountain bead of oxygen . effected in the processes both of natore and art , that it is no wonder if some of the ancient philosophers , particularly the disciples of Thales , held water to be the primordial element , out of which all things were formed . In every process of fermentation , by which substances undergo successive change of nature , until they finally return to their ultimate elements ; in all spontaneous decompositions ; in short , in all chemical processes , involving a large proportion of the operations of the arts , the presence of water is wholly indispensable . Water is of all fluids ( with the exception , perhaps , of the gastric liquor ) the most general solvent ; and its agencies , dependent on this property , are exceedingly numerous and important . In consequence of this power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of division as to allow them to enter freely into combination with each other , and hence solution becomes an essential preliminary in almost every case of chemical composition and decomposition , and in by far the greater number of cases , water is the solvent employed . By this , water becomes so esseatial in the preparation of our food ; by this it takes up nourishment from the soil and conveys it through the delicate organs of plants ; and by this it acts as a universal detergent , cleansing everything , and discharging all impurities that may soil the person or the clothing of man , and then by the process of evaporation and filtration as explained when speaking of the " circulatory system , " restoring itself again to perfect purity . Few things appear more admirable to the student of nature , than the discrimination which water exhibits in the different degrees of solvent power it exerts upon different substances , dissolving just so much only as the perfect economy of nature in each case demands , but still leaving it to man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to act with greater energy . The different states which this substance assumes , appearing at different times , under the forms of water , ice , snow , and vapor , render it the chief agent in controlling the temperature of the air , and in confining its range to such narrow limits , which however could not be transcended without the destruction of every living thing . In the fusion of platina we raise a heat of nearly 20,000 degrees , and by the galvanic deflagrator , and the oxy-hydrogen blow-pipe , we may produce a temperature immeasurably higher than this . Also , in the process for the solidification of carbonic acid , chemists reach a degree of cold equal to 174 degrees below zero . So immense then , is the range of temperature of which heat is susceptible . Yet nature most studiously confines the heat of the surface of the globe within the narrow limits of less than 200 degrees , from the lowest to the highest temperature ever exhibited by the atmosphere . The principal guards which Providence has set to defend us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easily destroy us on either side , are the different states which water is made to assume at different temperatures . When ice melts it absorbs and renders latent 140 degrees of heat and when water is converted into vapor , it absorbs in like manner nearly 1000 degrees of heat . In each case , the heat combines with the solid or liquid to form the water or the vapor respectively , but does not raise its temperature in the least . hence the melting of ice or snow , and the evaporation of water , are severally cooling processes . On the other hand , when vapor is condensed , or returns to the state of water , the 1000 degrees of beat in vapor , and the 140 degrees in ice and snow , are given out , and thus condensation and congelation become heating processes . Now , to see how these principles so apply in nature , as to obviate the dangers to which animal and vegetable life are exposed from excesses of heat and cold , suppose on the return of autumnal frosts we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) from 700 to 3Q0 within a few hours . When it has reached this point , its further descent is retarded , and it is usually soon brought to a stand ; and the whole severity of winter is required in order to reduce it only a few degrees lower . But what prevents the temperature from continuing to sink as rapidly as it begun , and occasioning a sudden and destructive frost ? As soon as the cold begins to grow severe and threatening , water instantly changes its state from a fluid to a solid , giving out its latent heat to the atmosphere , and thus preventing the farther increase of cold . On the other hand , suppose a very hot day in summer is passing over us , and the thermometer rises rapidly to 900 . We feel that the heat is approaching a dangerous excess , but some cause usually arrests it at this point , and in our climate , the utmost fury of a summer 's sun hardly suffices to carry the heat a few degrees higher . That cause is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of vapor , so large a quantity of sensible heat , withdraws from the atmosphere that portion which would otherwise accumulate to a danger* ous degree . Water , therefore , stands as a sentinel on either hand , to guard all living things from the region of death that lies just beyond the narrow precincts to which the entire range of atmospheric temperature is confined . Water serves also a similar purpose in the form of snow . When , as the wintry sun no longer affords heat from without , and it becomes essential to the preservation of the vegetable kingdom , that the heat of the earth should be prevented from escaping , // then the drops of rain crystallize in the form of snow , which invests the earth with a downy covering , increasing , like the furs of animals , in thickness and fineness , in proportion as we advance nearer the pole . Beneath this warm mantle , delicate plants repose in perfect security , *vbile the most hitter frosts are raging without and the rivers , lakes , and seas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thick covering of snow , are kept so warm , even in the polar regions , as to afford a safe and happy dwelling place for the numerous tribes of aquatic animals , which inhabit their waters . But our limits forbid us to pursue farther the chemical agencies , and we proceed to consider , - 3 . The PHYSIOLOGICAL properties of Water. - Chemistry respects matter without life ; Physiology , living matter , and hence takes cognizance of those properties and relations of water , which appertain to the vegetable and animal kingdoms . Every one is witness how essential water is to the vegetable xvorld ; even the most careless observer of nature , sees how plants flourish and grow under the genial influence of dew and rain , and how they wither and decay when this aliment is denied them . Chemistry and physiology teach us why the presence of water is so needful to plants and flowers , since it both supplies a large part of the material of which vegetables are composed , and dissolves other constituents of plants , and thus conveys nourishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water is no Ies* a benefactor . As a beverage , it is truly one of heaven 's choicest gifts to man and beast . With it the lower animals rest satisfied ; man attempts substitutes ; but , for the most part , to his hurt . Nature testifies her intentions by the most impressive signals , showing here , as in many other cases , the supremacy of her lawthat the exercise of any lawful pas sion or appetite , satisfies ; of any unlawful , inflames . Thus water allays , alcohol increases , thirst . As the means of preparing the food of animals , especially of man , the value of water is inestimable . Count Rumford was of opinion that water does not always act merely as a solvent , but sometimes is itself converted into food , since his soups , prepared for the poor of Bavaria , seemed to possess a greater amount of nutriment , than could he accounted for from the solid matter present . As a medicine , the virtues of water are beginning to be more generally acknowledge d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its healing powers . In the form of medicinal springs , its virtues have long been tested . Many are the subordinate offices which water performs for the animal system , in lubricating the eye , softening the organs of respiration , and , under the form of perspiration , both sensible and insensible , regulating the temperature of the body , and discharging from it many principles unfriendly to life and health . 4 . The MECHANICAL PROPERTIES of Water , alone remain to be considered . By its mobility , water secures its perfect equilibrium or level , so essential to the safety of the inhabitants of the land , and carries into perpetual execution the flat of the Almighty " Hitherto shalt thou come and no further ; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed . " By its buoyancy , water furnishes a dwelling place for all aquatic tribes , and and lays the foundation for the whole art of navigation . By its pressure , when at rest , it furnishes a most effective and convenient force as in the hydraulic press ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cataract , supplies to man an exhaustless fund of mechanical power , ready to turn his machines , and perform all his labors . Finally , in the form of steam , a mechanical power is evolved from water , the use of which has // likened man to the Genii of ancient fable . When the naturalist contemplates water under all its forms in internal reservoirs , in springs , rivers , lakes , seas , and oceans ; when he surveys the beautiful " circulatory system " by which it rises into ethereal vapor , to scatter its treasures over the vegetable and animal kingdoms , in dew , rain , and snow ; when he considers what tribes of aquatic animals it maintains ; when he sees how large and important a part it forms in the beautiful and sublime of nature , whether glistening in the dew-drop , sailing in clouds of majestic forms and various dyes , or shining in the mountain lake , and reflecting the heavens from its surface , or winding through fertile valleys in graceful streams , or thundering in cataracts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of all these relations to Natural History , the naturalist feels that the world of waters is all his own . But the chemist is no less sure that water was created for him , when he looks at its remarkable composition , constituted , as it is , tf two such important elements as oxygen and hydrogen ; when he contemplates its endless affinities , its powers as a solvent , and its capacity of assuming the different states of solid , liquid , and mriform , and thus regulating the temperature of the globe , and guarding it against dangerous excesses of heat and cold ; and when , in short , he sees how all the chemical arts require the aid of water as indispensable at every step in their multiform operations . The physiologist asserts his claim to water , as affording to plants their most essential aliment , that on which depend their full development , their perfect growth , and the beauty and fragrance of their flowers ; and as siJpplying to animals their beverage , and to man , especially , the menstruum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his life-giving fountains . At last , the mechanical p hilasop ) 1er claims water to turn his machinery , to bear his ships , and to roll his cars . The ocean wave and the cataract are his , by the vast force they put forth ; and the gushing fountain and flowing river are his , by the mechanical laws which they illustrate ; and , finalty , water is his by the wonde ful powers of steam , which it folds within it , the greatest of all auxiliaries to the feeble physical powers of man . The lover of universal nature , with a more enlarged vision , emprehends in his view the relation of water to all these different departments ,  --  - to Natural J-Istory , toChemistry , to Physiology , and to Mechanical Philosophy , and he , only , it is that duly estimates the treasures that lie buried beneath it . After such an examination of the " riches of the natural world " as iilustrated both , by the powers and the productions of nature , we are prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton , the world was made for man ,  - -  an inquiry which we hope to resum in a future number.
