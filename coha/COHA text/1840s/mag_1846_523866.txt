txt THE " American Review " was established , in the city of New York , in the early part of the year 1844 , by George H. Colton , and was successfully carried forward , under his superintendence , until the close of 1847 . After the last number of the sixth volume had been made up , and was ready to go to press , Mr. Colton was seized with typhus fever , which terminated his life on the first of December , 1847 . It is seldom that the death of one so young has power to awaken so sad and mournful an interest in so large a number of minds . It is rare indeed , that death extinguishes so much life , quenches a hope so ardent and aspiring , and breaks in upon plans so enthusiastically cherished . Among those most in*-timately acquainted with the operations of his mind , this feeling , in connection with the news of his death , was the predominant one-that death , in this instance , had subdued a most unwonted energy , blasted a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pursued with a sleepless activity . More than a year has now passed since this event occurred . The feelings which were first awakened by the report of his death have been softened ; and it seems a very suitable time to attempt a briefSes* timate of his character and literary genius . It is not our purpose to write what might be called a biography . We are not in possession of the requisite materials . A simple sketch , embracing only the most prominent outlines of his life , will be given , preparatory to a brief analysis of his moral and literary character . George Hooker Colton , son of Rev. George Colton , was born on the 27th of October , 1818 , at Westford , Otsego Co. , in the State of New York . We have little information touching the incidents of his early life . In the year 1833 , or in the following // year , he came to New Haven , to pursue his studies preparatory to entering college , under the care of his brother , Rev. John 0 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hopkins Grammar School , and afterward tutor in the college . It was during his residence in New Haven , previous to his entering college , that he became , as was believed , the subject of that great spiritual change which marks the commencement of the Christian life . Accordingly he was received to communion in the College Church . He entered the Freshman class in Yale College , in the summer of 1836 , being then 18 years of age . His standing throughout his college course was high ; and he graduated in 1840 , one of the three first scholars of his class . Though thorough and exact in all his studies , he was particularly at home in the languages ; and his fondness for the Greek amounted almost to a passion . During the latter part of his collegiate life , he gave much attention to writing , and even then began to be known and recognized as a poet . On the day of his graduation , he gave a poem , which excited at the time considerable interest . Immediately after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Hartford , as a teacher . The business of teaching , however , was somewhat irksome to him , and as a consequence , he had no great success in it . In the fall of 1840 , while he was living in Hartford , General Harrison was elected President of the United States . Mr. Colton , about this time , conceived the plan of writing a narrative poem , which should embody some of the stirring incidents of Harrison 's life while engaged in war with the Indian tribes on the frontier . The design was to bring out this poem at once , so that it should be ready for the public at the time of Harrison 's Inauguration . But the original plan was extended , and the poem was not published until the spring of 1842 , about a year after Harrison 's death . This poem he called " Tecumseh , or the West thirty years since . " It consisted of nine Cantos , written in octo-syllabic lines , with Spenserian stanzas at the beginning of each Canto . Though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vigorous and flowing style , it greatly needs compression , and longer labor . After the publication of ' Tecumseh , ' Mr. Colton for some time made his residence in New Haven , where he was employed in preparing a course of lectures upon the North American Indians . In writing Tecumseh , ' he had accumulated a large stock of information touching the languages , manners and traditions of some of the principal Indian tribes , and he embodied these materials in four or five lectures , which he delivered in several places , during the latter part of 1842 and the year 1843 . These lectures are perhaps among the best specimens of Mr. Colton 's prose writing . They were not in all respects adapted to a l ) oplilar audience , but they contained many passages of great beauty , and were throughout characterized by a refined and philosophical spirit . // During the year 1844 , he formed the plan of establishing the *C American Review , " in the city of New York , and began its first volume with the year 1845 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they feared that he might become deeply involved in the attempt . But when he had once fairly settled it in his mind that he would make the experiment , he entered upon the work with a most industrious energy . He interested large numbers of the leading Whigs throughout the Union in the enterprise . He called in to his aid some of the best literary talent in the country . The band of writers on whom he depended included many minds of great vigor . In short , his enterprise was entirely successful-successful beyond aught that his most sanguine friends had dared to hope . To his " Review , " Mr. Colton devoted the last three years of his life , and spared no pains to make it thoroughly good . It was with him a darling enterprise ; and he seems to have inspired his writers with his own enthusiasm . The " Review " contains many vigorous articles from his own pen . Its literary character throughout was high . Of its political character it is sufficient I*o say , that it was earnestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was perhaps too exclusively a party organ . It is the peculiarity of such " Reviews , " as well as of a large proportion of our party newspapers , that the very terms of their existence preclude the idea of any great moral power . The " Whig Review " must be the organ of the national Whig party , and it must most carefully abstain from the discussion of all questions of a sectional nature , and confine itself entirely to those topics in which all are essentially agreed , and which therefore little need to be discussed . Mr. Colton 's connection with this " Review " closed just at the time when a crisis in the history of the Whig party was coming on , and when a demand would be made for something positive in reference to the great questions of the day . In what we shall now say , we shall not attempt to decide whether the " Whig Review " has met the demand which was made upon it , or not : for we have not followed its subsequent course closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we wish to speak of a principle , which is applicable not only to this " Review , " but to all newspapers , and to all agencies for acting upon public opinion . It is manifest to every intelligent mind that a large proportion of our public journals maintain only a stupid existence ; simply because the great questions of right , of truth , and integrity , are never entertained , or are made entirely subordinate to merely party considerations . We call this a stupid existence . It is stupid not only in reference to the ends set before the mind for attainment ; but stupid if regarded in no other light than that of mere expediency . The journal that will discuss in a frank , fearless , upright way the great question of right and justice-that will go // where duty calls , deaf to the suggestions of party-has the best chance , after all , of a vigorous , honorable , long-lived existence . The conservatism which has no higher aim than to keep alive empty names and forms , and to distribute offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cause , is unworthy of any one who wishes to be a man . And whoever conducts a public journal on the principle of such a conservatism , however he may be flattered and caressed by men as sordid as himself , can not but be conscious of the secret contempt of those whose good opinion would be of most value to him . The only true conservatism is that which aims not blindly to keep things as they are or as they used to be , but to uphold and guard , without surrender or compromise , the ancient  --  the eternal interests of truth and justice . It is mortifying to think how much energy is expended upon many of our newspapers for ends that are utterly trifling - what an immense stir and activity are kept up to secure objects which , soberly regarded , are contemptible . And when here and there we see a political journal that is blessed with a conscience , and that rises above narrow partisan considerations to contend for the truth and the right , and to commit itself freely and manfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering and comforting in the sight . We say then that from the first the " American Review , " as an organ of political power , was too exclusively a party organ . Not that there was any thing strange in the establishment of a " Review " upon such a basis . It is what would be called a natural basis . And at the time when this " Review " was started , it would have been quite contrary to existing fashions-perhaps beyond the pale of existing possibilities  --  to have founded it upon any other basis . Nevertheless the man who works through such a vehicle must of necessity submit to lay down some portion of his individual manhood . However , in the whole management of this " Review , " Mr. Colton displayed great taste and skill , and an uncommon energy . Politics , after all , held but a subordinate part in the scheme . Literature claimed the first place . At the time of his death , the " Review " was regarded as established upon a firm foundation , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1844 , agreeably to invitation , Mr. Qolton delivered a poem before the Phi Beta Kappa Society in Yale Cob lege , at the annual Commencement . An exercise of this sort , coming after a long oration , at a late hour , on a hot summer evening , and in a crowded house , can not be duly appreciated . From parts of this poem which we have since heard repeated , we have no doubt that it will bear close reading , arid will be found pervaded throughout by taste , delicacy , and refined thought . In attempting to speak of Mr. Colton 's character , we are sensible of a difficulty . We have hardly room for a full and complete // analysis ; while we do not wish to treat the matter superficially . His character was of such a kind , that when thoroughly understood and fully opened to the view , it appears in all respects better than when partially concealed . Persons accidentally brought into contact with him , and judging him by the ordinary rules of conduct which prevail in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of the man . He had very little concealment ; and was at no trouble to hide those thoughts and feelings , which most men carefully keep under cover ; consequently when he had once developed these traits of character , the stranger might suppose that this was only the beginning of the end , whereas it was the man , seen as fully perhaps in this respect as he would ever after be seen . He was ambitious and self-confident ; and these qualities were perfectly manifest , even upon a very slight acquaintance ; he could not conceal them ; he had no art to hide them ; and men who have little charity for such weaknesses , would be likely to judge him harshly , especially those men who are unacquainted with the student 's life , and with the eccentricities which seclusion and study are very apt to produce . In all his undertakings he was over-sanguine , and gave little heed to those suggestions which were designed to cool his ardor and abate his expectations . But this sanguine spirit was after all the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never could have effected what he did in the establishment of his " Review . " He was daunted by no difficulties ; he was checked by no insinuations ; he pushed forward with a strong conviction that he could effect his purpose , and he did effect it . He was too improvident aud unconcerned with regard to his pecuniary affairs . With no intention of doing any one an injury , there was , at one period of his life , danger that he would fail to meet his obligations . But all this was safely passed ; and by his success in his " Review , " he was enabled not only to clear away his debts , and assist his younger brothers in their education , but also to leave behind him property to no inconsiderable amount . Those to whom his memory is dear were deeply gratified at this condition of his affairs at the time of his death . But making full allowance for all these faults , and they were faults , open and manifest at first sight , we come at last to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companionable ,  --  full of sprightliness and vivacity ,  --  *deeply imbued with the literary spirit ,  --  abundantly furnished with anecdotes and instances ,  --  keen and quick-witted ; and every way fitted to bear a delightful part in the companionship of an evening hour . Though he was strongly ambitious and deeply engrossed in his own plans , those who knew him best will bear witness that his ambition did not stand in the way of a generous judgnient of other men . It was not the ordinary habit of his mind to regard the success of others with a jealous suspicion , as if it // stood in the way of his own . He felt that there was room enough in the world for himself and others too ; and how much better , how much nobler is this than that sly , covert , designing ambition , which keeps a mask upon the outside , and works perpetually in the dark . To those who thus came near him , and were made familiar with all the workings of his mind , it was comparatively easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much beside that was generous and amiable-so much in which one could find true satisfactiou and delight . In his religions character there was something defective . While those who knew him well can easily believe that his religious experience was genuine , it is not to be denied that his character as a religions man , suffered in those pursuits to which he was so eagerly devoted . It is in his favor that his life seems to have been kept free from every immorality in the midst of great and pressing temptations-that he lived in the practice of all the social virtues , and retained to the day of his death an unsullied purity . Still he failed to exhibit those evidences of a hearty interest in the things of religion which his friends could have desired to see . He was immersed in the world , and too eagerly bent upon the attainment of ends merely literary . He suffered himself to be carried out of that circle of associations most favorable to the cultivation of piety . And while we estimate his character with that charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have evidence that his heart was savingly acquainted with divine truth , we can not but regard his example as a warning to those young professors of religion who may be about to enter , or who have entered , upon the perilous career of a merely literary life . There is no temptation to neglect the cultivation of the heart , more seductive than that which comes from the intellect . Intellectual pleasures are in themselves so pure , and so far elevated above the pleasures of sense , that a life of intellect seems kindred almost to a life of holiness . And yet the two things are widely dissimilar ; and every Christian who gives himself to literary pursuits as the business of his life , ought to feel that he is to encounter temptations of the most subtle and ensnaring kind . We have already devoted more space to this part of the subject than we had intended . We take leave , then , of this topid with the remark which was made in the beginning , that Mr. Colton 's character stands better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His faults were open , living , exposed to every observer ; but there was in him a genuine nobleness , which attracted the heart toward him , and made his companionship desirable . We come now to speak of his intellectual and literary character . From his early years , he manifested a strong inclination to literary pursuits . During the latter part of his college life , he was actively // engaged as a writer for the Yale Literary Magazine , a college periodical , edited and conducted entirely by undergraduate students . The volumes of this work for the years 1839 and 40 contain many articles from his pen , both in poetry and prose . This Magazine was commenced in the spring of 1836 , just before Mr. Colton entered college . His brother , Horace Colton , who was at that time a member of the Junior Class , and whose literary talents were of a high order , was one of the chief agents in originating the Magazine , and in carrying it forward through the first stages of its existence . Horace Colton wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Greek Anthology , " which were regarded at the time as some of the choicest articles of the work . They were translations of delicate little fragments culled from the Greek poets , interspersed with suggestions and reflections by the translator . This series of articles , which had been dropt when Horace Colton left college , George , during his Junior year , renewed . Allusion has already been made to his passionate fondness for the Greek . As an illustration of his college writing , we will take a piece of translation from one of these articles on " Greek Anthology , " which was made during his Junior year . The passage translated is from the " Antigone " of Sophocles . It is that passage in the chorus where the poet breaks into a rhapsody upon the busy , inventive , all-grasping character of man . " 0 , many things through earth 's wide span , Of might and fear we find , But nothing mightier than man With his all-grasping mind . He goeth , with the stormy blast , Beyond the grey old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With huge and heaving motion : And her supremest deity , From whom he draws his impious birth , The deathless and unwearied earth , He wasteth aye incessantly , Year by year , With the harnessed steed and the busy share , Turning the turf with anxious care . Wild roamers of the wilderness , That ne'er his milder power confess , And foolish tenants of the air , That perils past so soon forget , He lureth to his wily snare ; And flings his skillful woven net , Around the finny tribe , that be Far rangers of the deep , green sea . Who can the thousand dark wiles scan Of his vast mind-inventive man ! The wild beast in his forest haunt , Must own him for his lord : // The desert steed , no dangers daunt With fiery hoof and flying mane , And mouth unworn by bit or rein , Must feel the lash and cord : And to the neck-encirling yoke , The untamed mountain-bull be broke . Yea ! him , his mighty mind bath taught To pour the soul 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Across the heart 's responsive chords , By eloquence and wisdom 's weight " To govern and to guide the state . " To summbr 's heat , and winter 's blast , And arrowy rain descending fast , His form is never bared : His soul no apprehension chills , For all the future*s crowning ills , His heart is still prepared ! Life 's countless evils he can flee , That all so hopeless seem to be : He only may not save his breath , And shun the icy hand of death ! * After Mr. Colton left college , he was strongly inclined to a life of literature . With all its hazards and uncertainties , he could not bring his mind seriously to contemplate any other kind of life . And though his works are scattered ,  --  though they exist in no such shape as to make upon the public the impression of what he was , and what he did ; he has left behind him many specimens of choice and elegant writing , both in prose and verse . Yet , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of actual performance . All that he has done serves to indicate the power of doing something greater and better , had his life been spared . His mind was exuberant-exceedingly rich in imagination , and with a touch of youthful extravagance . It was a mind of such a cast that time would work no other than a most beneficial change upon it . Without taking away any of its riches , the lapse of years would gradually curb and chasten it , and bring its operations more within the limits of a severe and critical taste . At the time of his death , he was fast approaching that period of life , when the mind which has been kept under discipline and in vigorous exercise , begins to take on its full manly strength  --  to despise its earlier performances , and Th act with an instinctive perception of what is tasteful and correct . There are minds of a premature and unhealthy development , which come almost at once to this completeness and finish-and their later performances , so far from being improvements upon their earlier ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing unhealthy in Mr. Colton 's mental developments . On the other hand there was an overflowing vigor , a more than natural energy which needed the subduing influence of time . There was no reason to fear that any danger would come from severity // of discipline and hard exercise . None but the best results were to be expected from this kind of experience . Instead of attempting to go over the whole field of Mr. Colton 's writings , we propose to draw from a single source , a few illustrations of his literary taste and skill . There is one poetic fragment of his which we presume is little known to the public , but which reveals a poetic power of no common order . The first conception of this piece was formed while he was in college , and the first draft of it was published in the " Yale Literary Magazine . " But about the time of starting the " American Review , " he re-wrote the piece and greatly improved it . It was published in the second Number of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own account of the manner in which the piece originated . " Mr. Tennyson , in a poem exquisitely wrought in many of its parts , entitled the Palace of Art , ' has represented the final and utter loathing brought over a soul , who , building herself a splendid structure , adorned with every thing grand and beautiful in nature , and stored with all forms of knowledge and art , had shut herself in from God and men , to a solitary contemplation of these fair things , and to a still life of intellectual pride , forever feeding upon itself . In the following poem , written several years since , something of the same moral is involved-that neither natural beauty in all objects of the universe , nor the highest knowledge , which is the growth and manifestation of intellectual beauty , is sufficient to satisfy an immortal mind . Yet thousands , unhappily always the brightest-minded among men , have made this fatal error-lived in a sole realm of unbounded riches , and died miserably poor . " It may be added , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure and conduct , so entirely different-that this piece was written before the Palace of Art ' was published in this country , and before the writer had ever seen it . " Those who are familiar with the poems of Tennyson , and who have observed the choice and subtle vein of philosophy which pervades every part of them , and who have admired his " Palace of Art , " as one of the very finest of specimens of his peculiar style ; can not but be struck with the fact , that a young man , an undergraduate , should have hit upon essentially the same idea . A suspicion may rest upon the mind , that after all Mr. Colton caught this idea from the poem of Tennyson . But the time when the piece was first published , was some three years before the poems of Tennyson were brought out in this country , and though he rewrote it at a later day and republished it , the conception was the same , as any one may see , by examining the piece in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisite and delicately philosophical , and the draft of it , as published in the " American Review , " is a very choice and elegant specimen of poetry . We have not room to give a full analysis of this poem . The being who attempts to satisfy himself in a life of simple beauty and intellectual enjoyment , separate from all moral qualities and exercises , is personified under the name of " Er // doiph . " Persisting in his search after the " Beautiful , " he first summons to his relief the " Spirit of the ocean , " and unfolds the objects and aims of his existence . We make one or two extracts as examples of the fine molding which characterizes the poem . ERD oLrH. - " From the cradle My love was in the Beautiful , adored Till adoration had in me become Essential and familiar . Nature first My early friend , my dear and earnest mother , Leading me hourly through her wondrous reign , Filled the deep urn of joy till it ran o'er . Boyhood on infancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deeper sense Th ' infinitude of her wild mysteries ; Her whispers were my teachings , stirring more My soul in lonely haunts than loud-mouthed trump , The serried soldiers on the front of battle . I had no life , but as I lived in her : And she did seem to make all hues and forms , All sounds , all seasons , for my own delight . The gliding spring , with low and winning voice , Bearing young leaves and flowers : the strong-soul 'd summer , Glowing with life , watching the ancient skies , By woods and mighty waters ; autumn slow , Tranquilly walking through the faded treesHis still pale empire : and the world of white , When winter came and o'er the mountains high Hung his cold robe , alike had charms for me .

So moulded was she , and her mind had strength Beyond her equals . But with her to love Was native as a plant that comes with springSuddenly comes and never blooms but once ! And destiny the slave of chance , Made me to her-what matters it ! she died , As dies the wind-flower with excess of light , And trembled into darkness !

" A smile from that eternal face , Which hath forever shone , The universe my dwelling place , Through all my power is known . Where'er I glance the stars put on Their beauty and their pride , And fresh-lit worlds , where I have gone , Shine brightly side by side . " The orb , where mortals have their birth , I 've made to please their eye ; I 've robed in living green the earth , In varied hues the sky ; I give the trees their lordly growth , The plants their lowly grace , And deck with gay and many dyes The Ether 's airy race .

But most in woman 's virgin face- " On the whole , we think it can not he questioned that Mr. Col.* ton 's literary talents were of a very high order . We had intended to point out some of the more conspicuous of the articles from his pen in the " American Review . " But we have already extended this sketch beyond the limits which we had prescribed . One of the best specimens of his poetry may be found in the " Democratic Review " for the year 1842 . ( Vol . XI , p. 496. ) *Jt is a piece of blank verse , upon which he bestowed no little labor , and which was xvrought to a high degree of perfection . Mr. Colton was taken away at the early age of 29 , but he had lived a life of great activity , and the impression which he had made upon many minds will not be easily effaced . At his death there were many mourners outside of the circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character , he had bound many hearts to himself in a strong and abiding friendship.
