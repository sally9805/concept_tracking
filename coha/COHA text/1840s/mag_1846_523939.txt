txt THE misfortune of those deprived of hearing and speech requires no reflection to awaken sympathy . There has even been , in times past , a tendency to exaggerate the depth and the hopelessness of their calamity . Within a comparatively recent period , and through the successful accomplishment of their education , the prejudice which long consigned them to neglect , has given Ilace to a more genial sympathy , to an interest higher than mere compassion , and * ) leasing rather than painful . The condition of the deaf mute uneducated , needs not the aid of exaggeration to make it appear indeed deplorable . It is not , that he is cut off from the pleasures proper to the sense of hearing-that nature with her thousand voices is silent to him -- that for him there is no voice of man or woman , no sound in childhood 's mirth , none of those expressive tones which awaken responding vibrations upon the chords of emotion ; that he knows nothing of the melody of song or the harmony of verse-nor even , that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social intercourse . His calamity strikes deeper , as affecting his intellectual and moral being . Having capacities of soul , not inferior to those of other men , but deprived of the instrument of communication which they employ , he is , as a consequence of this isolation , hound to a condition of perpetual infancy-with the germs of intellect and elevated feeling unquickened ; with no share of the inheritance we receive in the history and the accumulated wisdom of the past , in the results of ages of mental progress , handed down in a language of words ; without the assistance which a cultivated language renders in aiding and developing thought ; with knowledge limited to the range of his vision , and con- fined to the visible surface of what he sees ; science and religion having for him no existence ; the rites of worship and many customs and institutions of society to him a mystery ; not merely the revelations of Christian truth , but the existence of God , of the soul , and of a future beyond the grave , absolutely unknown-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be , of a Christian family The education of deaf mutes is a subject , of the first importance to at least one in every two thousandf of the*population of these United States ; of deep concern to their friends , and to every friend of humanity . It is also full of interest for the curious and the philosophic inquirer . It is highly important in its re* lations to the science of mind , the philosophy of language , and the subject of education in general . The means are not wanting for an experimental basis of inquiry . Since the opening of the school at Paris by the Abb6 de l'Ep*e , in 1760 , the foundation of the institution at Leipsic , under Heinicke , in 1778 , and the commencement of instruction , in Edinburgh , by Braidwood , in 1764 , which led to the establishment of the London Institution in 1792 , there have sprung from these beginnings , more than one hundred and sixty schools and institutions now existing in Europe , and ten in the United States . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asylum at Hartford , through the agency atid under the direction of the Rev. Thomas H. Gallaudet , opened in 1817 . During the two centuries pre. - ceding this period , several pioneers in this work appeared , in difl*rent countries and at different times , who taught a few deaf mutes with success . The most noted are , Peter Ponce , a Spanish Benedictine monk who died in 1584 , and who has the credit of being the earliest successful educator of ( leaf mutes ; John Paul Bonet , who flourished in Spain not many years later ; Dr. John Wallis , of Oxford , in England ; and John Conrad Amman , a * The Twenty-Ninth Report of the Directors of the American Asylum , at Hartford , for the Education and Instruction uf the Deaf and Dumb ; and Mr. Weld 's Report , &amp;c .

In later times , the subject has employed able pens , and given birth to many and voluminous productions , particularly in France and Germany . It engaged the earnest and long-continued attention , and the profoundest study , of such a mind as that of the late Baron Degerando , whose work in two octavo volumes , entitled Dc 1 Education des Sourd-muets de Naissance , will probably long retain its place , as the great repository of facts and principles in relation to the subject . The voluminous pamphlets named at the head of this article , comprise documents , which form an addition , not only of especial immediate interest , but of great permanent value , to the literature of this subject . The Hon. Horace Mann , Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination of European educational institutions , represented the schools for deaf mutes in Prussia , Saxony and Holland , as " decidedly superior to those in the United States ; " because there , " incredible as it may seem , they are taught to speak with the lips and tongue , " while here , the deaf mute , " as soon as he passes out of the circle of those who understand the language of signs , is as helpless and hopeless as ever . " Mr. Mann had been well known as an able , eloquent and efficient promoter of common school education , and his opinion , thus put forth and zealously defended , could not be withoutinfluence . The ignorance of the general subject , and particularly of the mode of instruction here prevailing , apparent upon the face of these statements , and the manifest marks of hasty and superficial observation , of an unquestioning , eager credulity , and of an exaggerating imagination , were indeed such as could be easily exposed ; as was immediately and effectually done , in an article in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two modes of instruction had also been in practice , and been the subject of ardent controversy , from the earliest establishment of schools for deaf mutes . The one introduced here from France , by Mr. Gallaudet , had been preferred , only after thorough inquiry into the merits of the other . Yet it was desirable , for the general advancement of the cause , as well as for the satisfaction of the public mind , that an extensive personal examination of European schools for deaf mutes , should be made by one or more competent persons . This has now been done , hy two gentlemen-Lewis Weld , Esq. , Principal of the American Asylum at Hartford , and the Rev. George E. Day , once a Professor in the New York Institution for the Deaf and Dumb-under commissions from these institutions respectively ; and their reports occupy the greater portion of the pamphlets named above . In addition to the indispensable qualifications of an acquaintance with deaf mutes , with their mental and physical characteristics , their natural language of signs , and with the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a familiar knowledge of the German tongue , and Mr. Weld enjoyed the best assistance to make up for the want of this advantage . They each devoted several months wholly to the object ; proceeding separately , and thus giving to the results greater value ; and favored , with scarcely an exception , with every desirable facility at the schools they visited . The attention of both was directed particularly to the German schools . Mr. Day 's observations were mostly confined to these . Mr. Weld visited also Belgium and Holland , and took time for a thorough examination of the principal schools in Great Britain and France . Mr. Day has produced a complete , well-digested , and most able view of the subject of deaf mute instruction in Germany , derived from published writings as well as his own observations . An excellent guide to the various points of inquiry , had been furnished him in the Letter of Instructions by Mr. Peet , then Principal , now President , of the New York Institution . Mr. Weld , following more of the journalizing method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , the results of his judicious inquiries ; his conclusions deriving weight from his high character and long experience as an instructor . Both made it their aim to report facts bearing upon the general subject , and especially upon the question in relation to articulation , sufficient in number and variety , and in particularity of detail , to enable the reader to draw conclusions for himself . In this they have fully succeeded , and with such evidence of careful and thorough observation , skillful experiment , and candid and fair inquiry on their part , as is in the highest degree satisfactory . We propose to direct our // attention to the question which chiefly engaged their investigations , viz. : What is the method to he preferred in the education of deaf mutes ? This question involves the choice of an instrument , or instruments , of communication , as a substitute for hearing and speech acquired through hearing . Those which have hitherto been devised or employed , are the followino* 1 . Natural signs ; by which we mean the language of imitative action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally led by gradual steps to improve . In those schools in which it receives cultivation , it is found in a degree of perfection very far removed from the primitive rudeness it exhibits among uneducated mutes . As improved , it becomes in a degree conventional , chiefly by processes of abbreviation and of symbolical usage , and hy the introduction of a very few purely arbitrary signs ; without , however , losing its essential character as a natural language significant in itself . 2 . Methodical . also called systematic , signs ; an instrument artificially constructed upon the basis of natural signs , to he used for dictating and also for translating written language verbatim . In its elements , it consists chiefly of natural signs , with grammatical signs for the different modifications of words radically the same , and is designed to correspond throughout , both in terminology and construction , with the language which the deaf mute is to he taught by its aid , each word being denoted either by a single sign , or an appropriate combination of signs . This method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection by his successor , Sicard. 3 . Written lang ge ; to give a knowledge of which must obviously be , in every system of deaf mute education , an object of primary importance . 4 . The manual alphabet , the finger alphabet , or dactylology , as it is variously called ; consisting of alphabetic characters , formed by different positions of the hand and fingers , by which words are represented according to the usual orthography . Of this there are two varieties : the two-handed alphabet , used in Great Britain , and that made with one hand , generally adopted elsewhere . 5 . Reading on the lips ; a method of understanding the speech of others , through motions of the lips and other vocal organs , perceived by sight . These visible motions are called , by Degerando , the labial alphabet . 6 . Articulation ; or speech mechanically acquired , by having the attention of the learner directed to motions , positions and vibrations of the vocal organs , and to peculiar impulses of certain sounds upon the air . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral alphabet , as embracing elements which have no place at all in the labial alphabet , and as being recognized by the deaf mute through the sense of feeling , while the other is addressed to the eye . In addition to these six distinct means of communication , more or less use is generally made of pictures and models in elementary instruction ; in the system adopted in some schools , they hold a prominent place . Three other instruments are to be named , which have heen favorite projects with some teachers ; neither , however , has been found generally useful in any shape yet devised . They are syllabic dactylology , or a shorbhand manual alphabet , for the end of rapid communication ; a sy tem of stenography for the deaf and dumb , which should correspond to a syllabic dactylology ; and mimograph'y , a method of hieroglyphic or picture writing , for reducing to writing the language of natural signs . Of these instruments , articulation and reading on the lips have been the first to suggest themselves as the means of imparting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . In the earlier period of the art they were invariably employed . They were adopted as a fundamental means , and indeed , as the chief aim of instruction , by Heinicke , who had derived from Amman the most absurd and exaggerated notions of the absolute dependence of thought itself upon the living voice ; and their use has remained to the present time a characteristic of the German schools . In Great Britain , th' same method was adopted by Braidwood ; but for the last thirty years has been gradually falling into disuse . At the London Institution alone , articulation and reading on the lips are taught , professe*lly that is , to all the pupils ; in some other schools to a portion only , and in others are wholly discarded . In France , a system fundamentally different was introduced by De l'Epée . It started in his mind with the philosophical principle , that to no one class of signs is confined the privilege of immediately representing thought , that the connection // 600 between words and ideas is wholly conventional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with spoken words . In the vernacular pantomime of the deaf and dumb , he found already provided a medium for explaining or translating written language . This language of action he undertook to cultivate and to methodize , so as to fit it more perfectly for this use . His error in depending too much upon his artificial system of methodical signs , has been since corrected . Natural signs , used for the development of mind , the communication of knowledge , and for the explanation of written language , and cultivated so as to be adequate to these ends , form the essential characteristic of the method derived from De l'Epde , and now in use in all the schools in France and many in other parts of Europe , and all in the United States . Methodical signs have even been formally discarded at the Royal Institution , where the system originated , but the advantage of their judicious use is insisted on by eminent teachers in this country and elsewhere . There is no institution for deaf mutes , not even in Germany , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of instruction , but they exist in various states of development , and everywhere imperfect in comparison with schools on the French system . In some of the latter , on the other hand , articulation is a collateral branch of instruction for a portion of the pupils , and was even taught successfully by the Abb6 de l'Ep*e himself . The manual alphabet is discarded in the German schools , with two or three exceptions , as interfering with the use of oral language . Elsewhere it is in universal use . The variety of actual , and the still greater variety of liossible , combinations of these instruments , each admitting different modes of use , and in some instances , one presenting advantages incompatible in a greater or less degree with those offered by another , makes it impossible to determine by actual trial , and difficult to determine without trial , the precise mode of instruction which is preferable to every other , rendering the question , in short , not a little complicated . In considering them separately , the point to be settled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication . To what extent , then , are articulation and reading on the lips attainable May , by deaf mutes , so as to be available in use ? It is absolutely necessary here to distinguish the different classes of those ranked as deaf mutes , determined by the degree of their deafness , and also the period of its commencement . It is not generally understood that a degree of deafness , which , occurring in adult life , is regarded as no more than a quite serious inconvenience-requiring that the voice of a person speaking be somewhat louder than usual , in order to be understood-would , if existing from birth or early infancy , interfere essentially with the acquisition of language , and without great pains on the part of friends , leave the child to fall into the class of those regarded as deaf mutes , with a knowledge of language limited to a few words and short phrases , and the ability to articulate these but imperiectly . This will not appear wonderful when we consider , that to adults thus partially deaf , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much of it absolutely inaudible , and even when understood , is often imperfectly and but partially heard . From this to absolute deafness , there is , among deaf mutes , every intermediate grade . There are also cases in which the sensibility of the auditory nerve is wholly or nearly unimpaired , and the deafness is the result of something out of order in the apparatus for conveying vibrations of the air to the nerve . The individual can hear his own voice , or any sound-as that of a tuning-fork , for instance , or the tick of a watch-conveyed by contact with the bones of the head , with , it may be , perfect distinctness , while external sounds are yet for the most part inaudible ; and has an essential advantage for regulating the voice , and gaining a correct and an agreeable articulation , and especially for retaining purity and propriety of speech when once acquired . Hearing of this description may exist without being easily detected . Again , deafness-with constant deprivation of speech , total or partial , so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various ages , from birth to as late in some cases as eight years . Even when total deafness occurs at a much later period , the speech will be greatly impaired , without diligent cultivation , and in a degree , even with the utmost pains to preserve it , may , in some instances , be almost wholly lost . It is obvious that , where speech is // 8till retained in part , there is a foundation for its further improvement ; and so far as lost , the revival of a power once possessed is a different task from ne*vly imparting the same . Of instances favorable in these respects , there are more or less in all institutions for deaf mutes , and enough for the purpose of exhibition where articulation is taught . In any apparent case of success in the acquisition of spoken language by a deaf mute , the ascertainment of the fact on these points is absolutely essential to the formation of any conclusion of value . From information derived from carefully prepared statistical tables , * it will he sufficiently correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-half of the whole number of deaf mutes are such from birth ; half of the remainder , or three-quarters of the whole , from a period under two years of age , and eleventwelfths under five years . Of three-quarters of the whole , then , few could have made a beginning , and none more than barely a beginning in learning to speak ; of the others , deaf from under the age of five years , a large part would be in the same predicament . Few of these do , in fact , retain any considerable knowledge of speech . The same is true , even , of a considerable portion of the remaining twelfth of the whole . We have thus only a small fraction retaining much knowledge of speech . Of the different degrees of partial deafness , we have no statistical statements ; but we know , that the proportion of those who can distinguish articulate sounds at all by the ear is very small . Besides those having an advantage in these respects , there are rare instances of those , deaf from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination and force of mind , combined with uncommon command over the muscular organs , which will enable them to pass far beyond the limits of possibility for their companions of only average powers . In reviewing the facts in evidence , let us take first those rare instances in which a degree of success is reached , far transcending that ordinarily realized , even by the best portion of those instructed in oral language . Mr. Weld mentions ( p. 42 ) the case of a gentleman in London , " of superior talents , who had been a teacher for six years , and had previously had the advantage of the best instruction for ten years , " besides the constant and devoted attention of an intelligent female relative . Mr. W. says : " He spoke more agreeably than any congenitally deaf person I had before seen , though still his voice was not a pleasant one . I could understand more than half he said , in common conversation , readily ; but the other half was often unintelligible . He could also understand me , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater extent ; yet there was frequent need of resorting to signs , dactylology , or writing , and we soon by tacit consent used one or the other of these means of communication , more than speech . " He met in London , also , a lady , deaf likewise from birth , but who had enjoyed still greater advantages-all indeed that abundant wealth and parental affection could furnish-who used only articulation and reading on the lips in her ordinary intercourse with others . Her voice , however , was very unnatural and disagreeable . " These two , " he says , " were by far the best examples of the use and the understanding of articulation , among the really deaf and dumb from birth , that I met with where the English language was spoken . " Mr. Day gives much the same account of the first of these cases , *p. 92 , t note ) ; and says also , ( p. 177 ) , that he met in Germany with " a few instances in which pupils born deaf , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but in every such case , it appeared , on inquiry , that extraordinary advantages had been enjoyed , as in the exatuples above mentioned . Such advantages are , however , not always attended with even this degree of sticcess . Mr. Weld met a gentleman , who had been fourteen years a pupil of the London Institution , one of the most celebrated articulating schools in the world , and had enjoyed the best advitatages at home . He was a barrister by profession , being employed as chamber counsel , and in the management *td settlement of estates , and had rnade* extraordinary attainments in general knowledge , having more or less acquaintance with sixteen languages . Yet his ability to articulate was so imperfect , that he spoke but little in his interviews with Mr. Weld , the attempt being evidently * See particularl the Twenty-Eighth I*eport of the American Asylum . f We use the N*ew York edition , and not the one printed for the Assembly . VOL. 111. - NO . V. 33 // embarrassing ; and they both preferred to conduct the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those not born deaf , Mr. Weld mentions ( p. 91 ) a person , who lost hearing at the age of a year and a half , and who had been for twenty years contiected , as pupil and teacher , with the institution at Leipsic . " In this case there was an ability to articulate and to read on the lips , which was valuable to the possessor , in an unusual degree , and an amount of general knowledge which fitted him for agreeable intercourse with society , and made him a useful and happy man . " Another case of this general kind , was that of a young lady , an assistant teacher at Cologne , who spoke , wrote , read and taught well , as I understood . But she lost hearing at six years of age , and therefore did not owe all her knowledge of language , or of other things , by any means , to the instructions of the institution . These were extraordinary and very interesting cases , the only ones I recollect , of deaf mutes being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with several others who were superior in their acquisitions , and almost always so , I think ; in the circumstances under which they had been enabled to make them , especially some one or two among the pupils of almost every school . " The case of Habermans , so often mentioned , was of this kind . He became deaf at the age of four orfive years , and had previously learned to speak well . Mr. Weld also saw a gentleman at Paris , and a lady at Geneva , of whom he gives the following account ( p. 70 ) : " Neither was a deaf mute from birth . The one became so between four and five years of age , and the other at six . Both were educated in Paris ; both had enjoyed the advantages of much private instruction ; both were highly intelligent , and in their intercourse with their familiar friends and daily associates , used oral language principally ; resorting , however , to dactylology , signs or writing , to a greater or less extent , when holding intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of teaching those f. , *. : articulate and to read on the lips of others , who became deaf in childhood . " Mr. Weld was introduced to several individuals , who had been educated at a British school in which articulation is taught to a portion of the pupils . Three of these were able to articulate well ; they could read on the lips but little . One had lost hearing at twelve years of age , another at five , and the third was born with imperfect hearing which he still retained . Two of these , at least , had enjoyed more than usual advantages of instruction . What is the average success in acquiring articulation , realized by the more successful portion of the pupils in the German schools , we learn from the following statements of Mr. Day . " A considerable number of those who lost the power of hearing after three years of age , so far as they have fallen under my own observation , are able to a good degree , to make themselves understood . Their articulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is imperfect , and more or less unnatural ; it is necessary for them to make considerable use of pantomimic signs , and now and then to resort to writing , but still tha power of speaking they actually possess , provided it can be retained , must be admitted to possess a certain degree of value . " ( p. 173 . ) " On the whole , then , it may be said , that those pupils in the German schools who succeed to any considerable degree in speaking , were either already to some extent in possession of spoken language before they lost the power of hearing , or are only partially deaf , or in addition to extraordinary aptitude for learning , have received a degree of attention , very far beyond what it is possible to devote to most of the deaf and dumb . Without affirming that all the pupils who belong to these classes , are favorable specimens of what can be done in articulation , I feel safe in expressing the opinion , that a considerable number would be able to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily associate . In a very few instances , the attainment might be somewhat greater ; but as a general rule , this is the farthest limit ever reached , in return for the time employed , and effort expended , in teaching articulation , in the German institutions for the deaf and dumb . " ( p. 177 . ) What proportion do those thus successfa ) hear to the whole ? Says Mr. Day ( p. 178 ) : " Of those , to whom , in consequence of peculiarly favorable circumstances , articulation promises to be of use , and of whom success , in the modified sense just explained , can be predicated , the proportion may be one.fifth . " Of the London Institution , he says ( p. 92 ) : " According to a very intelligent gentleman who had been ten years connected with that institution , not one-fourth can be taught to speak . " Of another school in Great Britain , " whose present venerable head has held that situation more than thirty years , " says Mr. Weld ( p. *9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ten now receive any instruction of this kind . Formerly , articulation was // taught , or attempted to be taught , to all the pupils of the school . *** But though his success was fair , he considered that he could spend his time to much greater profit in giving them knowledge , ' and therefore made the change above mentioned . He said also , that though a portion of them retained articulation tolerably after leaving him , many do not . Their friends often can not understand them well , if at all , and hence their attempts are relinquished . " From the description , we infer that the school at Edinburgh is here referred to , and that Mr. Kinniburgh is the gentleman whose testimony is given . How far can the great majority of the deaf and dumb succeed in acquiring articulation ? In the German schools , according to Mr. Day , ( p. 178 , ) " about onetenth of the whole can make no proficiency whatever , " and deducting the onefifth , or two-tenths , already mentioned as more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass , though diffi*ring somewhat in their attainments , yet only able , as a general thing , to make themselves understood in the articulation of frequently repeated sentences , and single words , and to whom this limited acquisition can be of very little worth . " A German teacher made to Mr. Day the following admission , ( p. 168 , ) " The deaf mute will and must , after his dismission from school , communicate with those ahout him* in a great measure , by means of signs ; now , if we can furnish him with words which he can drop in to explain his meaning , all is accomplished which we can reasonably expect . " Says Mr. Weld ( p. 53 ) : " The time and labor spent on the subject of articulation in certain of the schools , are productive of little real benefit . Though I met with many who had been trained to attempt it , I scarcely found one , except those under peculiar circumstances , as previously mentioned , to whom it was of special value , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some school , who looked upon the subject with favor . By such persons it was considered as almost worthless , if not disgusting . " To read well on the lips , requires such a rare power of rapid and accurate per . ception , and depends so much UI ) Ofl uncommon quickness of apprehension , joined to a thorough and familiar acquaintance with language , in order to guess the whole from a part ; * that it is absolutely beyond the reach of most . In the words of an eminent German teacher , " As for reading on the lips , it is for the most part an affair of good luck . " The teachers of the German schools , in addressing their pupils orally , find it necessary to keep up a running accompaniment of pantomimic signs . The following is from Mr. Day ( p. 182 ) : " On an average , about one-third of the most advanced class , with the aid of the signs employed by the teacher , and the frequent repetition made use of , appear to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to lose a consider . able part ; while the remainder only seize the most common words , and are obviously much of the time at a loss as to what is going on . It will be remembered that this is a general estimate , and in some cases would not be sufficiently favorable . " If the results in some of the schools on the German plan , seem more favorable than this , it is to he ascribed to the fact that those schools are to a great extent select-pupils being chosen for admission , with reference to their aptness for the peculiar kind of instruction to be given them , or afterwards dismissed for the want of it . Thus , as appears from Mr. Weld 's Report , ( p. 88 , ) at the institution at Zurich , from one-fourth to one-third only of the applicants are selected , while one-fifth of all admitted , and of late years one-third , have been dismissed for incapacity . From the school at Richen , near Basle , almost onethird , and from that at Pfortsheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onefifth have been dismissed on the same ground . Something like this is true , says Mr. Weld , of many of the German schools , and to an extent , of the London Institution , while in the school at Paris and those in this country , not over one in fifty is dismissed as incapable . That the Germans , with their skill and science , should succeed in enabling some of their pupils who became deaf at six , eight , or twelve years of age , to articulate passably and to read well on the liJ ) 5 , certainly need not surprise us , when we have among ourselves persons The motions of speech are to such an extent invisible , or else similar to each other , differing also in different persons , that deaf mutes never become able , in ordinary discourse , to do more than make out a few of the words and guess at the remainder . " This " says Mr. Day , ( p. 187 , ) " was distinctly told me by the most accomplished reader on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf from childhood , who by their own private efforts , assisted only by members of their families , have made equal , or superior , attainments in these accomplishments , as well as in general knowledge . We could name a lady in Connecticut , totally deaf from the age of twelve years , who retains her speech almost perfectly , with some unpleasantness of tone , and rarely , if ever fails ; to understand what is spoken to her in a somewhat slow and distinct manner , and has a knowledge of language and an extent of general information superior to the majority of well-educated women . She can even do what , Mr. Day says , is not pretended of any deaf mute in Germany , that is , understand a discourse from the pulpit . This , a few years since , she could always do in the case of her own pastor , and give a correct and full account of the discourse afterwards . We may name also , John R. Burnet of New Jersey , entirely deaf from the age of eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1835 , as the author of " Tales of the Deaf and Dumb , with Miscellaneous Poems , " and has contributed able articles to some of our leading Reviews ; and whose abilities as a writer of prose or verse are of a superior order . He can also speak , indistinctly indeed , but so as to be readily intelligible to hisfamiliar acquaintances ; without , however , any power of reading on the lips . James Nack , of New York , deaf from about the same age , produced a volume of well written poetry ji* 1827 , and retains , if we are not mistaken , the power of speech in a similar degree . We know a young lady , deaf from the age of five years , who has a good education , obtained partly at one of our institutions and partly at home ; and has retamed articulation and acquired the power of reading on the lips , so as to converse , with some of her friends , chiefly in this way . The reader is , by this time , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the German schools are led to favor us with such exaggerated reports.t An eminent Prussian instructor remarks , in a note to Mr. Weld , ( p. 71 , ) " There are certain teachers who do not protest against the illusions of visitors , unacquainted with the subject , who judge only in consequence of the presentation of some excelling pupils . " Such visitors also mistake certain common expressions easily learned , and set exercises familiar to the pupils , for fair specimens of their general attainments . Their excited imaginations deceive them . " I can hardly forbear smiling , " said a distinguished German teacher to Mr. Day , ( p. 164 , ) " when hearing the remarks of the visitors to the school , especially if they have witnessed nothing of the kind before . It is not uncommon for them to exclaim , Why ! he speaks ! I hear him myself ! ' and to be so far carried away by the novelty of the thing , as to form the most exaggerated notions . " To persist in setting up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now before us , must be deemed an affront to the understanding of the public . An incident took place at the meeting of the American Institute of Instructioxi last summer , at Hartford , which shows how liable even educated and scientific That persons in this condition should he able to write poetry , as well as prose , is not sur ' prising . The notions of accent , quantity and rhythm remain , after all reminiscences of sound are lost ; they may attach themseWes to the mere movement of the organs of speech , and other characteristics of verse be perceived by the same means . The articulation of persons born deaf is never so perfect as to be adequate to any thing of the kind . In France there have appeared one or two good writers of poetry , deaf from childhood , hut educated as deaf mutes . We have , however , in New York , a writer of poetry profoundly deaf from birth-an absolutely solitary instance of the kind , as we believe . We refer to John Carlin , a young artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miniature painter-two or three of whose poetical lucubrations have appeared in the New York Commercial Advertiser , He knows nothing even of articulation , and has no perception whatever of the effect of rhythm or rhyme , yet can construct both correctly . His verse is wholly a mechanical and artificial work , as respects the production of the external form , though informed with the genuine spirit of poetry , and not deficient in smoothness to the ear . He has acquired this talent as the result of some instruction and much study . t Some of these stories were happily hit off , in a paragraph in the " Radii "  --  a highly respectable newspaper , printed and edited by a deaf mute , at Fort Plain , in this State -- by alluding to the wonderful cork leg , celebrated in song , made by an artist in Rotierdam , whose powers so far outstripped those of the natural member , that it could never be stopped or overtaken . Nothing could be more exactly parallel . A remark made by Dugald Stewart , who gave a decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of place : " To teach the dumb to speak , ( although , in fact , entitled to rank only a little higher than the art of training starlings and parrots , ) will always appear to the multitude a far more wonderful feat of ingenuity , than to unfnld silently he latent capacities of the understanding . " // men are to pass without inquiry the most essential points in cases submitted for their investigation . A boy was introduced by Mr. Mann , represented as a deaf mute who had been instructed by his father . And , truly , he could articulate well , and had also an uncommon ability to read on the lips . Certainly , there may be something in Mr. Mann 's assertions respecting the German schools - was the general conviction . At the afternoon session , however , a gentleman connected with the American Asylum begged leave to call up the lad again ; when it was demonstrated that the boy could hear , and understand perfectly , with no aid rota the eyes , what was spoken in a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better he could once hear , we are not informed , but he had unquestionably obtained his knowledge of speech and of language by the ear . How far and how easily is the lang ge of action available , as a means of communication for deaf mutes ? Many persons are sceptical as to the capabilities of such a language for expressing more than what is palpable to sense , or what pertains to the most common uses of life . But the most refined and artificial tongues grow from beginnings like this ; the most purely intellectual ideas ever formed byth* mind of man , or that have even floated in the dreams of the transcendentalist , find their expression in terms which , in their origin , denoted a purely physical phenomenon . Why then may not a language of action , having the same ground , be inherently capable of a similar develop-ment ? The lowest stage in which the language of action may be viewed , embraces the pointing out of objects in sight , the natural expression of real emotion , and the indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In these forms no one can be at a loss hQw to make use of it . A step higher is taken by personating an individual and describing his actions by imitative signs . In doing this , other persons and things also to which these acts bear a relation , will at the same time be indicated , and may thus , by mere implication , be set before the imagination with as much distinctness as if portrayed with the minutest accuracy . You can not represent a person as milking a cow , or driving a yoke of oxen , without calling to mind these animals . By the simple action of casting a fishing-line , you present to view the rod , the line and the water ; and by other acts , you may picture the bait , the hook , the fish , the bank , or the boat ; the more extended and minute the pantomime , the more in number and the more specific will be the objects implied . By skillfully imitating a coachman on his box , as he manages the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the idea of the reins , the whip , the coach and the horses , but you may show whether he has four ot two in hand , and even the rate at which he travels , the kind of road he passes over , and the freaks of the animals . In such imitative action , periods of time may be indicated , by the skillful introduction of actions appropriate to particular times , as night , morning , noon , evening , the Sabbath , winter or summer . By proceeding from a known starting point , the actual time of real occurrences may be communicated . A person returning from an excursion , would commence with his departure , and mark the subsequent intervals of time . Animals may also , to an extent , be personated in pantomime . In this shape the language of action has been cultivated as a fine art , and used for popular amusement , and is universally and readily intelligible. * The deaf mute not only makes abundant use of such pantomimic action , which is pantomime , properly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pictures objects by other means . The sign-language of deaf mutes exhibits , however , a wide departure from pure pantomime or mere pictorial representation . In addition to their direct 1 ' The art of pantomime , it is well known , was carried to great perfection by the ancients . We have it on the authority of Lucian , that a king from the borders of the Euxine , seeing a pantomime perform at Rome , beg , ed him of Nero , to be used as an interpreter with the nations in his neighborhood at home . As every schoolboy knows , it was a matter of strife between Roscius and Cicero , which could best express an idea , the one by gestures or the other in words . The language of signs has been much used by many tribes of American Indians . Parties from some of these tribes have found themselves quite at home , when visiting a school of deaf mutes . Not mere pantomime , but even symbolical signs , strikingly similar , and in some mnstances the same with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Indians . // use , it establishes from these as elements , distinct signs appropriated to particular objects , qualities and phenomena , and thus becomes a language of terms combined in propositions-is not merely capable of representing a succession of scenes to the imagination , but becomes an instrument adequate to the expression of ideas in various fbrms , as in the artificial languages of speech . Such it is , in different degrees of perfection , even as originated and used by the uneducated deaf mute . We shall describe it as it exists in institutions in this country . Of sensible qualities and attributes , form , size and position are either marked or pointed out in the air ; or the arms , hands and fingers , one or all , are so adjusted , as themselves to represent the form , position , and sometimes also the size of the objects described . Motions of various kinds are represented through the same means . In a similar manner are denoted the relations of objects , in respect to situation , if at rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the two hands , or a finger or a thumb of each , are expressed the ideas denoted by such words as on , in , with , near , between , around , under , together , meet , separate , follow , approach . Number , definita or indefinite , is represented by the fingers ; and with one hand alone , by a simple method of distinguishing units , tens , hundreds , &amp;c. , sums to any amount may be expressed with ease and rapidity . Colors are denoted by referring to some object , ( as the lip for red , ) or by signs somewhat arbitrary . Weight , hardness and softness , fineness and coarseness of particles or of fabric , roughness and smoothness , degrees of consistency , viscidity , &amp;c. , are expressed by peculiarity of action in handling a body having any of these qualities ; fluidity by the action of pouring , or by representing the flowing or waving motion of fluids . An individual of a species or class is designated , either by a detailed enumeration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply . The latter is the method natural even to the uninstructed deaf mute , and as the language becomes improved and fixed , is adopted for all common objects ; detail being still admissible as occasion or fancy may demand , and much used in the early stages of instruction . The various sorts of external objects , animate or inanimate , the productions of nature or art , are described , not only by peculiarities of form , motion , and other sensible properties , but by the most common actions connected with their production or use , or otherwise related to , and implying them . Animals are in most cases personated ; the individual who makes the sign , representing their peculiarities of form or appendage-as horns , ears , neck , whiskers , beard , wings , bill , mane , claws , tusk trunk &amp;c. - upon the corresponding part of his own person ; he also generally imitating , to a greater or less extent , the peculiar actions of the animal . The sign for a dog , however , is made by patting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the act of catching a fly denotes this species . Bread is indicated by the action of cutting a loaf , and butter by that of spreading upon the bread ; milk by that of milking , and hay of mowing ; an egg by showing how one is opened , and a watch by seeming to apply one to the ear . The manner in which a cluster of currants is taken into the mouth , that of projecting the stone of a cherry , and that of snapping a watermelon , denote these fruits . The fingers are so moved as to imitate the flickering of flame ; or again , they picture falling drops of rain , or flakes of snow . The two hands are united in the shape of a boat , and moved in imitation of its motion ; or they are applied to each other and opened and shut like a book . If there is occasion to guard against a mistake of the object intended , for the quality , act or appendage , by which it is mainly denoted , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action made use of-this is easily done by some rude representation of its form or size , or the addition of some other distinctive sign . In passing from the external world to the world of consciousness , we find the language of action equally , and to some extent peculiarly , natural , rich and expressive . The most expressive language of emotion is visible in action , attitude , and play of feature , in the agitation of the frame and the changing hue of the countenance . What volumes does the eye speak ? The lips , though mute , maybe eloquent . The minutest shade of emotion may be picture ed forth to the eye , beyond the power of words , and even tones of voice , to express . The capabilities of the language of action here , will be questioned by none . Rightly to appreciate the indirect service rendered by this element , in every part of the sign-language , requires not only a familiar knowledge , but a carefui study of the language itself . Emotions // and passions are , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions characteristic , but also by other signs , descriptive of their physical concomitants-as the quick beating of the heart in joy , the stirring up of the blood in anger , the suffusion of the face from shame . Conventional signs are established by selecting some striking point of one or the other kind . The capacity of this language for representing the operations of the intellect , in great variety and with great distinctness and expressiveness , will not be so obvious . It may best be shown , by describing , however inadequately , a few signs for ideas of this class . To learn is , in the sign language , to gather up something and put it into the forehead ; to remember , is to hold something there ; to forget , is to let something fall out of the same receptacle of thought ; to invent , or originate mentally , is expressed by pushing the finger upward upon the forehead , signit*ing that the thought springs up there ; to understand , by striking or pressing the point of the finger upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , by gently touching and pressing the forehead with a confident air ; to intend , to aim at , to refer to , embracing also the idea of the word for , by projecting the point of the linger from the forehead , as if toward an object ; for fixed thought , the finger is held upon the forehead with an appropriate air and attitude ; It is moved about the forehead to denote thinking about something , or thinking somewhat discursively . The general sign for judge , is made by representing the scales of a balance , by circles formed with the thumb and forefinger of each hand ; and is of extensive use in expressing modifications of this general idea , as compare , deliberate , determine , criticise , &amp;c. - in deliberation , there is a hesitating air and a wavering of the scale ; in judgment positive , the scales are fixed and the air confident ; in determination , the judging is finished , ( cut off , ) and there is an air of will and decision . Hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forwar ( l with an air of pleased expectation ; trust , by grasping one hand and resting on it with the other ; trouble of every sort , objective or subjective , by a sign descriptive of confusion and entanglement before one , or in the mind . As thought and feeling can not be directly depicted to the eye ; they are of necessity designated , either by their accompanying outward expression , or bodily affection of some sort ; the actions connected with them ; the occasions which awaken them ; or their resemblance , real or imagined , to something external and sensible . The application of words to ideas of this class , is founded on these principles , traceable in their etymology , or apparent in their obviously figurative use . Signs , by attaching themselves more to the outward expression , and by always introducing this as one element , come nearer to an exhibition of the internal state itself , atid present it with far more vividness , and often with more definiteness and accuracy ; and thus furnish a vehicle for eloquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic communication , upon the intellectual and moral faculties . Extensive use is made of figurative or symbolical modes of expression for other ideas . Jiideed , the signs for sensible objects bear a close relation to those figures of speech , in which the whole is represented by a part , or an object by something connected with it-as when sail stands for ship , or whip means coachman . It is chiefly by the use of figures founded on resemblance or analogy , that our languages of words are enriched , and acquire copiousness , and at the same time precision . The sign-language also employs synthols of this description , naturally and abundantly ; but to a somewhat less extent , in consequence of its power of more direct expression ; it also wants the occasions and facilities for the use of metaphor , which result from the artificial structure of language , the employment of the abstract noun especially . The following are a few of the signs of frequent use in a metaphorical sense . The sign for fall , ( made by letting the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfiture , and failure of every kind . The sign for silence , ( made by pressing the forefinger or the thumb upon the lips , ) expresses , as differently modified and combined , stillness and quiet of every kind , peace , humility , meekness , patience , passivity in general , secrecy , &amp;c . Physical cleankness represents moral purity , as it does also neatness , grace , elegance , refinement , and ideal perfection . Air or breath denotes spirit , literal straightness , moral rectitude . Just and unjust are figured by the even and the uneven scales . To pardon is literally to wipe off . The sign for show , ( made by holding up the palm of one // hand , and pointing to it , ) has many figurative applications . That for being bound , ( made by placing the wrists across , as if tied witha cord , ) denotes slavery , confinement of every kind , habit , engagement , business , necessity , obligation of every sort ; the opposite ideas of freedom , escape , release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if breaking loose . In signs , as in words , metaphorical terms become proper by usage . Their figurative origin is , however , not so often lost sight of as in Words ; yet there is seldom danger of confounding the figurative with the literal meaning . Not only the connection gives the clue , as in words , but there is the aid of a suitable accompanying expression , of combination with other signs , and of variations in the form of the same radical sign ; and many signs founded in analogy , differ so widely from any used in a literal sense , that they can hardly in strictness be called metaphorical . Instances of the latter are those for mental operations , which are based upon analogies of motion . The sign for event , or happen , expresses , as nearly as anything , a sudden upturning , but has a form peculiar to itself . Truth , and the opposite , are represented by carrying the finger , with a straight-forward , or a sideways or crooked motion , from the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , in a straight or a crooked line , along the open palm of the other . A sign for being interested , or pleased with , is made by a single motion , signifying a drawing or leading of the heart . This flexibility of signs  --  the facility with which they are varied in form , as differently applied , and often in combination blended into one-is a beautiful feature of the language , and is a resource for variety of expression and speciality and definiteness of signification to an unlimited extent . In the principles already stated lie the methods for denoting the oecupations , offices , and relations of mankind , and acts of a general or complex description , which can not be directly or fully imitated ; but for these and other classes of signs our limits forbid detail . All the usual divisions of time , with its different modes and relations , have distinct and established signs ; the divisions and the time of day being indicated chiefly by signs having reference to a clock or to the course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or apparent revolutions of the sun , and weeks , months , and years having other appropriate signs . Future time is indicated by a forward motion of the hand ; time past , by throwing the hand backward ; and present , by presenting both hands horizontally in front . The signs for sleep , for one , two , or more , and for past or future time , are so combined as by a single brief motion to express the idea of yesterday , or to-morrow , or of two or more days past or hence . Before and after , while , since , till , late , quick , slow , soon , &amp;c. , have signs founded on the idea of motion along the track of time , from behind forward . Repeated circles represent always , and with the negation of beginning or end , eternity . Grammatical distinctions can not be said to have an existence in the natural language of action . There are indeed signs for the different parts of speech and their modifications , which are of use in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , an essential part of " methodical signs . " Signs may be divided , according to signification simply , into those for objects , qualities , relations , and acts or events ; actions into those necessarily transitive and those not so . There are also signs which correspond in their use to conjunctions and adverbs ; but there are no peculiarities of form or inflection to mark these classes , or to distinguish the agent from the act , an action or event from a habit , quality or condition , the subjective from the objective , the abstract from the concrete , &amp;c . Explanatory signs are added , however , for this purpose , when needed , and also to indicate time , mode , and agency or passivity ; and present indeed something approaching to auxiliaries and inflections in speech . The syntax of the sign-language-the principles by which signs are connected in discourse-is wholly unartificial . The general principles which regulate the order ' are . that those most nearly related be in the closest proximity , and that the subject be followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which predicate something of it . The predicate may be accompanied with an air or a sign of affirmation , or of negation , or of uncertainty , which will answer to the copula of a logical proposition . Little use is made of the affirmative expression , however , in continued narration or description ; the several particulars being merely represented as if pictured . The sign-language may be considered as nearly in the condition of certain spoken languages , which have no verb to be . When there is an object on which the subject acts , or to which it bears a rela // tion , the construction varies according to the exigency . Most frequently , the nature or circumstances of the case show which is the subject , and which the object . It is , of course , the cat that devours the mouse ; it is the wounded and disabled man who is carried . When the natural relation is reversed , or no clue is found in the nature of the case , it is not difficult to indicate the meaning correctly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most successfully pictured . One is , to have a strict regard to the relative position and location of subject and object . Or , both the agent and the recipi ? nt of an action may be personated in turn . Having represented the stripling in the act of hurling the stone from the sling , we may immediately act the part of the giant receiving the blow on his forehead , and falling to the ground . So , a horse may be shown in the act of kicking , and a man as receiving and feeling the effect of the blow . Another method , like this , but more artificial , yet altogether common , is to use the sign for give in the figurative sense of agency or causation , or that for first , or both at once ; and on the other hand , the sign for receive , or some other denoting passivity . These auxiliary signs answer the end of an active and a passive voice . The signs for some actions , however , mark this distinction by a change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , from the person , and reversed for the passive . There is nothing in the language of signs corresponding to the tenses of verbs . The time of an action or event is generally indicated at the outset , definitely or indefinitely ; it being once fixed , the narration may proceed , events in succession being simply represented , and time reckoned from the starting point . We are not , however , confined to the direct order , but may at any point refer to other events , at any distance of time previous . As the relation of events gives them an actual presence to the imagination , each one of a series narrated becomes in turn present ; and the interval-between this and the one next succeeding , is hence represented by the sign of futurity . Thus this sign becomes a connective between successive events , when separated by any appreciable interval ; the relation between two , successive events past , being in fact the same as that between the present and the future . There is here a remarkable cor respondence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Genesis , literally translated , reads thus " In beginning created God as to the heavens and the earth . And the earth was formless and waste , and darkness upon face of abyss , and spirit of God moving upon face of the waters . And will say God , be light , and will be light . And will see God as to the light , that good , " &amp;e. * This usage prevails in all the narrative parts of the Hebrew Scriptures . lt still forms a qu*estio vexata for grammarians ; one theory that has been advanced for its explanation , is confirmed by the comparison now made . This is only one instance among many , in which this language of nature may throw light upon the studies of the philologist . It is well known to those acquainted with the Hebrew , that it has but two forms of tense , and that the past ( so called ) is extensively used for future time , as well as the future for past . This also may be explained , by considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action simply , and without relation to time at all-just as it is pictured by an imitative sign  --  the relation of time intended being determined by the connection , or by circumstances . Thus the first of Genesis would read : In the beginning create , instead of created . Modifications corresponding to the potential , subjunctive , and imperative moods , are indicated , sometimes or partly by an accompanying expression of feeling , and further by auxiliaries consisting of distinctive signs for the modifying ideas . By both these means also , are expressed the relations between the members of conditional , disjunctive and - causal propositions . A causal proposition is sometimes put in the form of the question why ? and the answer because . There are also signs for the ideas expressed by the other conjunctions . Indication upon the fingers-serves instead of and . Little use is made of anything correspondingto personal pronouns of the third person , or relatives . Yet their end can be answered , by fixing and referring to the location of objects , or by indicating them respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The several pronominal adjectives have in general corresponding signs . A very marked and important differ it is not uncommon for deaf mutes in their first attempts at composition , to be misled by the idiom of the sign-language into a use of words precisely like the Hebrew , as it reads thus translated , and to write a story throughout in this same style . // ence between signs and a refined language of words , is the want of anything in the former corresponding to the abstract noun . Yet such propositions as these : God gives health and happiness ; idleness leads to l ) OVertY ; Wisdom is better than strength ; Murder is worse than theft ; Revenge is wicked ; and others may be , and often are of choice , expressed in the abstract form in the colloquial usage of deaf mutes . But strength is not distinguished in the form of the sign , from strong , or theft from steal , and sp universally . Hence , and from the want of an artificial syntax , but limited use is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a less variety of metaphorical dress . The tropical use of the prepositions , in connection with this form of speech-without which we rarely move a step in words-has nothing similar in signs . The advantages of the abstract noun in discourse , are by no means indispensable . They are simply , variety of expression ; elevation and grace of style , from the figurative drapery it naturally wears ; and especially brevity and neatness , and this partly in consequence of the convenience with which it fits into the framework of artificial language . There are no ideas for the expression of which abstract terms are indispensable . There is nothing existent in nature , or conceivable in thought , but individual objects , and their qualities , phenomena and relations . Every possible proposition in abstract terms , by however many steps their meaning may seem removed from the world of individual things , really expresses something of which individuals are the subject ; and so far as the nature of things or the nature of language is concerned , can be expressed in terms descriptive of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less general than the abstract , and will require no less of the mental faculty of generalization or abstraction to comprehend it . The term man requires this as much as manhood ; good , as much as goodness . The abstract . noun is not a product of the reasoning faculty , but rather of the poetical-aside from its mere convenience . It is the result of a tendency to individualize , rather than to analyze ; though some analysis necessaly precedes the individualizing of an attribute . " Every language , " says Cousin , " is at once an analyst and a poet ; it makes abstractions and it realizes them . " The abstract noun has its ground in a figure of thought , which , if not always personification , is yet closely allied to it . Though this form has , through its conciseness , advantages for scientific purposes , yet it often betrays into error . A proposition in the abstract form , can be apprehended at all , only by going back in thought to the concrete reality . A man who neglects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a logician , at least a sophist ; but can be no philosopher , or sound thinker , or safe reasoner . In the sign.language , general propositions can be ' exl ) ressed in the concrete form as perfectly as particular ones , and sometimes also in the abstract . Also the comparison involved in a metaphor , may in signs be drawn out in detail , as a simile , when it can not be conveyed in the concise metaphorical form . We see that this language is by no means confined to the sensible or the special . The difficulty which words present to the deaf mute , results not so frequently from their wide generality of meaning , as from that complexity and speciality by which the general sense is limited . That ideas may be expressed in languages employed and cultivated for ages , by mature and gifted minds , for scientific , imaginative , and a great variety of practical purposes , which can not be rendered into the sign-language of the deaf and dumb , in its present state , without much circumlocution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most true . But it is also true , that if we take any two languages , particularly of nations differing essentially-one , for instance , a commercial , and the other a philosophic people-we shall find a difference and a difficulty of the same general nature . No two languages correspond , in all respects . The language of signs has its peculiar advantages . Not only is it picturesque and expressive , but it can indicate shades and niceties of meaning , beyond the power of words . The classical scholar may boast his two particles of negation in Greek ; but not only have we signs , distinct in form , corresponding to *u and * but many more varieties , to an extent to which no language of words can make an approach . Written language , supposing the deaf mute to have learned to use and understand it , is of course an available means of communication with all who know how to write legibly and spell correctly . The deaf mute is sorely puzzled by the incorrect orthography he often meets with , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written language he has the key to mental treasures , inexhaustible and always accessible , in books ; and may find in them an invaluable compensation for those social enjoyments and advantages , of which he is necessarily in a measure deprived . That course of instruction which will put the deaf mute most completely in possession of this instrument , may , without hesitation , be pronounced the best . Tire manual alp/rabet is available to the deaf mute , for communication with all who know how to spell correctly , and who will devote an hour or two to the acquisition of the character . It may , by means of practice , be used with great rapiditygreater than that of writing , and exceeding any but the rarest attainments in articulation and reading on the lips . It may , especially the one-handed alphabet , be used in a great variety of circumstances , where writing is impossible or inconvenient . It admits of emphasis and accompanying expression ; and is of constant use , intermixed with natural signs . it is perfectly distinct , and may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ; which is not the case with the labial alphabet . It may also be felt in the dark . We are now to consider these several instruments , as to their use in imparting the knowledge of a language of words ; and for the purpose of general mental and moral cultivation , in the hands of the teacher ; as instruments of thought and of mental improvement on the part of the deaf mute ; and as furnishing him a medium of intercourse with society at large ; and then to indicate that combination and use of them , which in our judgment is to be preferred in the education of deaf mutes . The matter is more or less complicated , in reference even to any one of these ends , and becomes still more so when we bring them all into view . We may lay down three distinct methods , or rather theories of method , for the education of deaf mutes , which will cover the whole ground . One relies upon the language of action , to give a knowledge both of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anotherrejecting signs of action , or restricting them to the narrowest possible limitsdepends upon the constant use of words by writing or the manual alphabet , as the true way to acquire language-as in accordance with the manner in which nature teaches hearing children to learn it in the spoken form-employing , of course , the aid of definition and of explanation by means of words already acquired , as far as practicable and desirable . A third resorts to articulation and reading on the lips , as still more in accordance with nature ; depending , like the preceding , mainly upon use to instill the meaning of language ; and aiming to furnish a readier means of communication with the mass of mankind , and a form of language more manageable for the mind of the deaf mute himself . These methods , thus distinct in theory , are , however , in l ) ractice nowhere distinct ; hut exist in every variety of combination , and also with important subordinate modifications in each . In reference to the acquisition of language , it will aid our inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn their mother tongue . They are introduced to it , always through natural signs . Objects are designated by pointing to them . The qualities and acts , which the child first learns to call and to recognize by name , are indicated in great part by gesture and expression of countenance , together with tones of voice . The most important means of all , is however , the observed connection between actions , facts and occurrences , and the language used to express them . After a sufficient foundation has been - laid , the meaning of words may be inferred front their connection with others , or be taught by direct explanation . Practice in the use of language must be added , to give the learner a command of it himself . The method which would rely mainly upon the actual use of words , in the forms of writing and the manual alphabet , depends on principles virtually the same , but employed at great disadvanlage . To the success , or even the trial , of this . method , it is absolutely essential , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium of colloquial intercourse for the pupils of an institutionthat words may be caught by new comers from their more advanced companions , so as to be available for the explanations of the school room . But the inferiority would be immense , not only to the living voice , but to signs of action , in rapidity , ease of apprehension , convenience , and expressiveness ; and again , and as a consequence , there would be adopted an elliptical and irregular use of language , which would form a J ) eculiar dialect . It is indeed most true , that nothing but putting language into actual service , will lead to a firm grasp and an elThctive // wielding of the instrument , and skill in its management . There is nothing like being forced by stern necessity to the constant use of a particular mode of communication , to give it a firm adhesion to the mind . But with instruments slow and cumbrous like these , if command qwq // not exist in the German , Italian and some other tongues . What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction in a language of words ? From the simplicity of their form , and their lightness and rapidity of execution , they are easily employed and readily perceived , and remembered without labor ; while they are , for the most part , so naturally representative , that their meaning is perceived without explanation at all , or , once understood , is never forgotten . So far as precision in their use is given by instruction , it is done with no loss of time , but in the very act of teaching words . By this medium , the meaning and force of words and the laws of their combination , can be explained at once ; and in many cases , if skillfully done , the knowlege thus imparted will be nearly complete and accurate from the outset ; whereas , by the mere process of observing the occasions of words and expressions , their meaning would generally not unfold itself , till after many repetitions ; would be established correctly only through the repeated relinquishment of mistaken assumptions ; sometimes after long groping in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be only partially seized , and be but a dim and uncertain thing in the mind . Signs often shed immediate light upon what would otherwise either remain absolute darkness and chaos , or be long waiting the gradual dawning of day . Signs are , however , merely a staff to assist along those steps , which the deaf and the hearing must alike take in the acquisition of language ; to leap or to fly being as impossible in the case , as to pass from one point of space to another without traversing the interval , or to support the upper part of a structure without the lower . To have a correct translation of a passage in a foreign tongue even , is by no means to have a knowledge of so much of the language as the passage embodies ; while the genius of'the signlanguage differs so essentially from that of a language of words , that the acquisition of the latter , by the help of the former , is altogether a different task from that of learning a foreign language by means of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The process must indeed be essentially the same , as in the acquisition by the hearing child of his mother tongue itself . Signs , used as they should be by the instructor , supply tbe place of the actual presence of things , by representhg them to the imagination ; and with two advantages : one , that by the multiplication of examples and illustrations , the experience which , in the use of language in real lite , would be scattered over a long period , can be concentrated upon a point ; the other , that this method admits of a regular and systematic procedure , in which one acquisition shall prepare the way for another . By proceeding thus , and engaging the pupil constantly in the alternate processes of translating words into signs and signs into words , language may be rapidly and thoroughly inwrought into his mind , in its twofold use , for communication actively , and reception passively . Again , signs are a means of rapidly enlarging the circle of the pupil 's ideas , and the bounds of his knowledge ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go before their expression or apprehension in language , the advantage here is immense . They also awaken and give a spring to all the mental faculties ; they give that kind of interest to the exercises of the school-room , which the mind of childhood especially needs , making what would otherwise be an intolerable drudgery , a pleasant occupation ; by this means , the powers are more energetically and actively employed upon both the mechanical , and the more prop* erly intellectual , labor of the acquisition of language . Cut off , as the deaf mute necessarily is , from the living voice , with the music and the eloquence of its tones , it would seem cruel to deprive him of that agreeable and expressive substitute which nature puts in his power , and to chain him down to a language literally dead to him . It is true there is a tendency on the part of the pupil to be misled by the peculiar idiom of the sign-language-a point demanding skill and care in the teacher . Signs mislead by intervening between words and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , again , a tendency for signs to he indulged , when words might be employed mor&amp; to the advantage of the pupil . They are such a convenient staff , that the support must be judiciously and timely withdrawn , or the learner will never be able to go alone . The use of signs , on the other hand , in their improved condition , accustoms the pupil to the free and familiar use of a real language , embracing terms general and figurative ; and thus , as far as it goes , forms an excellent preparation for the // ready apprehension of a language of words . After what has been said , there can hardly be a question which of these methods is preferable as a means of general mental and moral cultivation . If a medium of communication , which is rapid and full of natural eloquence , is for this purpose preferable to one that is slow and unimpressive ; if one which brings the mind of the teacher into close contact and intimate sympathy with that of the pupil , is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's length , there can be no hesitation in our choice . The " winged words , " which , when fully plumed and unimpeded , convey intelligence with such rapidity , can be for the deaf mute but lame and halting couriers ; let him enjoy that suhstitute by which the living thought itself , in its simplicity and freshness , leaps forth from every limb and feature ; let him enjoy this means , by which his knowledge can be extended , his mind opened , his heart touched , and his character moulded ; by which he can be taught his duties and his destiny , his relations to his fellowbeings , to his God , and to another world ; by which the teacher can reach the individual mind to such advantage , or , by well-timed and eloquent strokes , can sway numbers in a body , infuse into them one thought and one feeling , and in religious worship , lead their hearts , in a united , though speechless , offering of devotion to their Maker . These advantages can be realized long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and also with that portion of the pupils , who from age , or want of the requisite capacity or application , fail of making respectable attainments in artificial language . The spectator who may witness , while instruction is imparted , the attention , eager though not painful , the kindling eye , the light of intelligence overspreading the features , the answering nod or smile , the shake of the head , or the sudden hurst of recognition ; and during devotional exercises , the fixed and reverent attention ; or in conversation , the rapid and animated interchange of thought , and the keen encounter of wit that may be seen to be going on , though its purport be undiscovered ; can not doubt , that a medium is here employed , by which an easy and unobstructed passage is opened from mind to mind , In the German schools , which discard signs for instruction in language , and even discourage ttieir cultivation and their use as a means of communication , pantomimic exercises , having for their object the general development and awakening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course , a regular branch of school instruction . The benefit is of course realized imperfectly , and at a disadvantage , and with expense of time , while in the French and American schools , it is gained incidentally and constantly , and much more completely . The influence of language upon thought , has been a subject of much philosophical speculation ; its importance can hardly be overrated ; and in the present case it deserves careful attention . The vernacular language of deaf mutes , which is in reality used by them everywhere , and generally more or less through life , can not but have an important influence on their mode of thinking . The effect will remain , even supposing it superseded by another instrument of thought . Its use , together with their ignorance in early life of the ordinary means of communication , leads to the cultivation and tends to the continued ascendency of the faculties dependent on ocular perception ; promotes quickness and accuracy of observation , distinctness of conception , and strength of memory for particulars . These powers , cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation for the right use of the reasoning and reflective faculties , whose development in the natural order is subsequent . Again , in the sign-language of the deaf mute , ideas are not distorted from their natural shape by being arrayed in an artificial garb . Words have not the opportunity to mislead -- themselves to take the place of ideas , and cheat the mind with a semblance of thought , or to be a vehicle for vague and obscure notions . The medium of exchange which he uses in the commerce of mind , has not its original stamp of thought worn off by use , so that its value is uncertain ; nor does it consist of a sometimes worthless representative in place of the genuine metal . The teacher who pursues such a course as to lead into exercise the reflective faculties , will , before even the merest rudiments of artificial language have been acquired , be often startled with proofs of thought , which will convince him that the cultivated language of signs is quite adequate to the development of these powers . An instructor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when a young girl , not advanced // beyond a very imperfect knowledge of the simplest style of language , suddenly started the inquiry , how angels could in that case fly to the earth ; showing no little reflection thus to understand and apply , and perhaps to have observed for herself , the fact of the agency of air in flying . To satisfy the inquiry , the teacher had not merely to remind her of a truth familiar to her , that angels are spiritual beings , but also to explain that this spiritual nature might , by the power of God , appear in a visible form . All this was readily apprehended ; and further inquiries were put , as to the nature of such an assumed appearance , which showed a keen and reflecting mind , and might not be easy to answer even with the help of words . As signs will , at all events , be used to a great extent by deaf mutes , it seems important , as concerns their influence upon thought , that they should be improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in language , the proper method of explaining the meaning of words and the laws of construction , by means of signs , leads directly to the exercise of generalization and analysis , and to the apprehension and the application of general principles , to the extent of the pupil 's capacity ; and is far more favorable to mental cultivation , than an irregular or even a somewhat systematic manner of learning language hy use alone . The deaf mute is not floated along at ease , upon a stream of audible words , through the regions of thought , hut has to trudge on foot ; and in following the track of words , such as they are to him , has to go through many turnings and windings , which make him well acquainted with the domain . Though the deaf mute rarely advances so far as not to associate some sign with nearly or quite every word he uses or reads , yet he may do this , without depending on the sign for the meaning of the word . It is highly desirable , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with words , and run in that channel by which books are accessible , and communication opened with the world . Words articulated , consisting , for the deaf mute , only of characters seen or felt , have none of the advantages which may belong to a language of sound , for gliding in easily , and adhering firmly in memory , and intertwining itself with processes of thought , and forming a pliantand manageable instrument for the mind . But written language presents some advantages Bducation of the Deaf and Dumb . 515 even over audible speech , for easy , rapid , and correct apprehension . The visible form of words represented to the mind of the deaf mute , may he for him an available instrument of thought . For the purpose of intercourse with society at large , the attainments of the deal mute in oral language are not only imperfect at first , but are often lo*t after leaving school . On this point Mr. Day was at great pains to examine for himself , and gives the particulars at length , ( pp. 199-205 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf mute , as he goes away from the institution , and mixes with the world , " gradually speaks less , and attempts less frequently to understand what others say , becomes more and more discouraged , and after a few years , for want of sufficient practice and corrections , his artificial speaking becomes only the relic of his former acquisition . " He gives ( pp. 205 , 206 , ) the testimony of Germans of the highest character , including that of eminent teachers of deaf mutes , to the ex-* ceeding imperfection and the trifling value of these attainments in most cases , and says , ( J. 167 , ) " While I have met some who maintained the contrary , the more common testimony given by professors , clergymen , and gentlemen in other professions is , " We can not understand them. ** Reading on the lips is possible only within a short distance , generally from two to five feet , and with a front view , of course with a good light ; and the speaking must be slower and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation in a mixed company , or addressed to a third person is for the most part out of the question . The unnatural articulation of deaf mutes is generally so painful , as to be not only an objection to it , hut an actual bar to , its use . The deaf mute taught on a different plan will find signs available to a greater or less extent with those with whonVhe has constant intercourse ; while the manual alphabet can be easily acquired , and writing he can use with most persons in this country . As these different methods of instruction offer advantages in a greater or less degree incompatible , it becomes difficult to decide precisely what combination of them will secure the greatest advantage on the whole . That it is not expedient to instruct the great majority ofdeaf mutes in articulation and reading on the lips , is beyond question ; the advantage to be realized being slight , and the disadvantage // immense in the time consumed , and attention diverted from other things , by a mere mechanical exercise . The considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two other methods , as best for all the ends of instruction . An improved system of natural signs should be brought into full play , as more serviceable and consuming less time than one more imperfect . To this should be joined constant practice in the use of words . As fast as acquired , words should , to a great extent , supersede signs for almost every purpose . This , with pains on the part of the teacher , may be accomplished ; as , notwithstandino* the seductions offered by signs , the pupil will feel a pride and a gratification in theability to use and understand words . Such is the general plan pursued in the French and American Institutions ; the defects of the German and English schools being the want of an improved system and proper use of signs , and in all of the former , the waste of much precious tune in fruitless attempts to teach oral language . Other objections to the German method are , the greater number of teachers , and the greater length of time required in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early an age to learn a mechanical employment for maintenance in after life , and too early as respects intellectual instruction . The contrast between the German and American schools , in moral and religious training , is most striking , and the deficiency in the former is one for which no other advantage can compensate . The conducting of devotional and religious exercises in the natural language of the deaf mute-introduced by Mr. Gallaudet ; whose name , as the father of deaf-mute instruction in this country , should ever be held in grateful remembrance-has been followed by the most happy results . The results in respect to language and general attainments , with the exception of arithmetic , are altogether in our favor . The method of instruction by signs , has in this country , and also in France , become more practical and direct , and less metaphysical and circuitous , than as employed by the Abb6 Sicard . If our instructors have perhaps still depended too much upon signs , and have not sufficiently insisted on putting words into frequent use on real occasions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the consequent development of the sign-language , a point has been gained which can never be lost . They have never doubted , that there were a few among their pupils , who might be instructed in oral language with benefit ; in the institutions at Hartford and New York , the experiment is now making , to ascertain how much can be accomplished in this way , in connection with the ordinary course of instruction , which even for these pupils should by no means be given up . The friends of the deaf mute have the evidence , not only that our system is on the whole the best , but that our instructors will spare no pains to give it every improvement of which it shall appear susceptible , and which the liberality of their patrons shall put within their power . The course of instruction has , heretofbre , been in general too much limited as to time . Printed books adapted for the use of deaf mutes under instruction , have been greatly wanted . The work of supplying this deficiency has been ably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , *and its completion will , we trust , not long remain to be desired . The union of schools for deaf mutes with those for theblind , has been advocated by some in this country . We learn from these Reports , that the experiment has been fully tried in Europe , and with results decidedly unfavorable to the plan . There are many points of interest in relation to this subject , and embraced in these documents , which we have been obliged to pass by . The reader who desires can easily obtain the pamphlets . The Twenty-Seventh Report of the New York Institution is also just issued , containing some excellent directions upon a matter of great importance ,  --  the training of deaf-mute children at home , before their entrance into an institution . The friends of the deaf mute , and the public at large , are much indebted to the authors of these Reports and to those who commissioned them . The existence of institutions of benevolence like these , is justly esteemed one of the brightest features of our times . Let no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sphere of the instructor of deaf-mutes is limited , the benefits conferred are , to the subjects of them , imineasurable and priceless . His work is arduous ; so far as faithful and well-directed , his efforts should be encouraged by the interest and approbation of the public.
