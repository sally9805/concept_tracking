txt WHENCE iS our literature to be formed ? What are the elements which must enter into its composition ?  --  and what shall be its charter ? Cut off in a great measure from those associations which act with such power upon the European mind-passing yet through the infancy of our national existenceliving under an organization , that exhibits none of the pomp and show of the old monarchies-from what sources can we draw life and nourishment for an elegant national lite-rature ? To the man of science , a new world like this opens a most inviting field . To him the ground is desirable , chiefly because - it is new and unexplored . It is his to search for the traces of ancient organic life , to unlock the deep treasuries of the earth , to discover and arrange the plants , that have been growing here in solitude from age to age ; in a word , to classify and systematize all things , which fall within the domain of science . But for the poet , who lingers most fondly among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is barren and forbidding . He seeks the materials for his delicate fabric , where man has left the traces of his works . Hence it is , that countries which bear upon their faces the impress of old wars , which are filled with broken and scattered relics , whence he may read the stories of strife , and suffering , and human sorrow-these are the regions that seem best suited to the purposes of the poet . Let it not be deemed idle , that we attempt to reason on a theme like this . The mind as well as matter , is subject to law ; and from our large experience of the past , we are enabled to determine the motives which influence it , and the course it will pursue . If we attend to the origin of the European literatures , and observe the manner in which they have grown up , we shall find that the mind is led almost unconsciously into this creative action , by the contemplation of the past . The states of Europe stretch far back in their history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , from elements originally chaotic . They have risen to their present greatness , through continual struggle , and turmoil , and confusion . They have passed through forms of organization , eminently fitted to awaken human energy , and stimulate to bold deeds . And when at length they began to emerge from these tumultuous scenes , and a milder spirit pervaded them-when men had time to sit down in silence and muse on life and its concerns , what so natural , as to turn the thoughts back , and survey the tumults that were passed ? It is delightful , amid the stillness of after years , thus to contemplate the struggles that are ended  --  to hear in fancy the noise of battles which have long been closed . Moreover , in Europe , as in every old land , the memorials which meet us at every step , naturally lead the mind backward amid the stir of earlier times . The castoff armor of old generations , still hangs in her dwellings or rests beneath her soil . rrhe peaceful husbandman strikes upon them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions still linger about her ruined castles . Hence , from the first dawn of European literature , the mind has been employed in reproducing this ancient life , giving it a new ex * Tecumseh , or the West thirty years since ; a poem , by GEoRex H. COLTON . New York , Wiley &amp; Putnam. // istence in the pages of poetry and romance . We see then how age fits a country for the contemplation of the poet . He delights in a land that has been long trodden by men , that has become renowned for valor and generosity , and is strewn with the ruins of old systems . It can not be denied , that a national literature originates in this reverence and romantic love for that which has gone before us . Every one at all familiar with English literature , especially in its earlier stages , must have remarked how entirely it is concerned with things of a former age  --  the storming of castles , the romantic love and adventures of some wandering knight , the fierce contentions of clan with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiends ; in short , every thing that belongs to chivalrous life . The institution of chivalry , with all its rich and romantic associations , forms the magnificent background for European literature . It stands in relation to the present , like those great mountainous realms of northern Asia , whence issue a thousand streams to water and fertilize the distant and sunny plains below . With these introductory views , we are prepared to turn to our own land and inquire , what have we here ? What materials has time consecrated and made ready to our hands ? Many have surveyed the field and cried , " it is all barren . " We are to take our position on the heights of the present , and overlook the past . We are to remember , that our view is not to be bounded by the narrow limits of two hundred years . We are to stretch back as far as we can follow thet footsteps of men . Every thing that appertains to this western continent , has a dear and intense interest to us . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left , every monument of ancient civilization and power , every instrument of war or of peace , that lies buried beneath our soil-these are our property-these are our memorials . The ruins of old cities now sleeping in the silent forests of Central America , the venerable mounds scattered along our western rivers , covering the bones of departed nations , the remnants of temples and palaces , rising here and there through the wide regions of the south-in a word , every thing vast and shadowy , associated with the movements of men in these western climes-all these unite to form the background of American literature .. No one can survey this field with a full appreciation of its extent , and not confess that it is grand and inspiring . Had our fathers found this land an uninhabited wilderness , had there been no stir or sound of life through all this wide domain , nor a trace of any former existence , it would still have been a field for poetry . The idea of a great land lying undisturbed for thousands of years , passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up through the long lapse of years , falling down piecemeal , and mouldering again to earth-mighty rivers moving along from age to age , bearing upon their bosoms the spoils of the wilderness - all this would have moved upon an imacrinative mind and given birth to a new order of poetry . But we are not left with this alone . As the artist when he paints a landscape always shows us a form , on some rising ground , gazing upon the beauty of the scene below , so here we have the additional interest of the spectator . The whole becomes associajed in our minds , with the hopes and fears , the joys and sorrows of of our mortal life . The inquiry instinctively rises in the mind , what was transpiring here during all the commotions of the eastern world ? What was agitating the human bo // som here , while battles were fought , and kingdoms were rising and falling in the East ? It is useless to urge against all this , that the race which inhabited these lands were no part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , that they dwelt in miserable wigw ams , and lived like the beasts of prey around them . It matters not that we were originally of *nother race . We have become associated with all who ever inhabited this western world . A man can not find an arrow-head in his fields , but he must needs stop and think of it a little , and carry it home to his friends . It is a kind of standing tradition to him . It tells him a story of strange life , and of wild deeds , which he always delights to hear . If he chance in his peaceful occupation to strike upon some depository of the ancient dead , it acts upon his mind like some new and wonderful history . He can never leave talking of it . No mind is so stupid under such circumstances , as not to feel in some degree the poetry and romance of the past . There is no doubt , that these aboriginal tribes were savage and ferocious . But this matters not . Through the misty curtain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we discern only the fair and beautiful . It is by this happy operation of nature , that the past becomes so dear to us-that the momones that come flocking to the mind from its silent depths , are as sweet as our anticipations of the future . Bad as the mind may be , it is a high argument for its native glory , that it thus instinctively separates the evil from the good , and stores up within itself only those beautiful memories , which are the patterns of a perfect state ; Who can think of an Indian a thousand years ago , sitting by the banks of the Mississippi , or wandering through a moonlit forest , without a certain charm and sense of delight ? But it may be asked , how is all this to be turned to any account ? Will any one dare to lay the foundation of a poem back amid these shadowy scenes ? Will any one be so bold as to break loose from all the influences of civilized life , and weave his plot of purely Indian elements ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men are always faithless in matters of this kind . They survey a field like this , but they have no eye to discern its beauty , or its uses . It appears de*-olate and waste . Suddenly , the magician strikes the soil . He raises before us forms of beauty and power , of which we had never dreamed - yet we discern in a moment that they belong there , that they are the natural occupants of the places , and that they have only been concealed from our view . The old comparison of the statuary suits our purpose . He discerns the form he is after , while the marble is yet in the quarry . He opens the earth , clears off the mass around , and there he finds the statue just as he saw it in his dream . The poet has this discerning eye . He sees forms which other men can not see , till he has disclosed them . It is impossible to specify all the ways in which the past history of this country may furnish themes for poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abstract way of its resources . It is not necessary , that we ourselves should be the magicians that can raise these forms . From what we know of the growth of literature among the different nations of the world , by watching the phenomena of its progress , we are enabled to judge of the resources which a land presents for a polite literature . There is much . in the character of the Indian , that is poetical . We find in him none of the effeminate softness of the Asiatic , or the vulgar savageness of the islanders of the Pacific . His character , it is true , is distorted ; but much that is noble // is still impressed upon it . J-Je nour. ishes with sleepless care , some of the better elements of human nature . his mind is ennobled and enlarged by the contemplation of the Great Spirit , and by the expectation of that more perfect state , into which he is to be ushered after death . His heart is susceptible to love , and pity , and gratitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which shall represent the great peculiarities of the Indian character , without feeling that we are in the ' presence of a lofty and commanding personage . We behold them moreover a fa . ding race , year by year shrinking back farther into the hiding-places of the wilderness , as the star of civilization travels towards the west . We have far more reason to love them , than they us . When we leave out of view the more savage features of their character , and dwell only upon the pure and lovely-when we reflect upon the workings of that lofty faith , which is ever present in the hearts of these children of the forest-we can feel fhat we have far more sympathy with their inner life , than we may have supposed . The Indian character too is shadowy and obscure . We have to wait a long time , before those heroes that figure in the open world , and whose acts are recorded in books , become sufficiently romantic for the uses of the poet . But the forest itself throws a sufficient veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet , without the aid of time . Two hundred years will not suffice to throw such a curtain around the heroes of the Revolution , as the shades of the wilderness are ever spreading over its inhabitnuts . The point in the history of our country , which at present seems most fit for the poet , is that transition state , when the European and the Indian are brought side by side , each revealing the character of the other , in new and stronger proportions . This was a time too of doubt and danger and suspense  --  a time of fierce strife and bold adventure . Both parties are obscured in a measure , by the shadows of a wilderness life . As time moves on , the acts of our regular history will become interesting and romantic themes , though at present they are too gross and material . When however a nation has arrived at a certain point in its upward progress , and a pure and elevated tone of thought begins to prevail , a change gradually comes over its literature , which at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself with the contemplation of mere physical facts and historical phenomena . It seeks to hold converse with the deeper mysteries of our nature ; it explores the inner chambers of the soul , where thought resides . Let not this be deemed visionary , or without some meaning , in its application to ourselves . rhough our nation is young in years , we are old in this maturity of mind , and advancement of thought . In this matter we stand side by side with England , and for confirmation of what we have said above , we may refer to the work that is now going on there . What is the poetry of Wordsworth and his contemporaries , but an exemplification of this clear and intellectual spirit ? It is the poetry of a contemplative age , framed for men who have turned aside from the hot pursuits of war and vain ambition . It is almost unnecessary to point out the bearing of this argument upon ourselves . As the literature of England has already passed in a measure from the contemplation of mere historical phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not as a member of a l ) articular nation , but as a thinking , reasoning being , formed for happiness and immortality ; so we , pos. sessing the same elevated feelings , have less need of those materials on which the poets of an earlier age have labored . In short , we are // disposed to think that the great outcry that has been raised against this country , in these particulars , is in a measure unmeaning . We confess as yet little has been done , and it was perhaps natural that it should be so . And yet the American mind has not been altogether idle , nor have we so great reason for shame as many of our own and foreign writers have been disposed to think . Among the fugitive poems that have appeared during the last twenty years , we have many that shine as gems in our infant literature , and that have not been surpassed by any which have been put forth in England during the same period . We have seen no specimens of English blank verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ease and gracefulness of flow , and in beauty and strength of diction , can rank above some that have appeared on this side of the water . In lyric poetry our literature is rich . Few finer things have ever been composed , than some of those little morsels of song that are now circulating among us . But it is the fate of this kind of poetry , that it does not receive its due honor . It is too fragmentary . The mind is confused by the multiplicity of objects . As in some large and beautiful garden , we are hurried from flower to flower , until the mind becomes distracted amid the variety , and we retain only a general impression of beauty , without remembering distinctly the forms in which it was embodied . Hence it is that a nation seldom gains any reputation for literature from these fragmentary productions alone . The cultivation and taste necessary to originate them , are not duly appeciated . It is not until they group themselves around some larger and bolder work , that their position and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself arrest and hold the attention of men . 1-lence a few great poems , scattered along the line of a nation 's literature , serve as resting places for the memory , whence it may survey the field around . The appearance of the poem whose title heads our article , is an event of no small impQrtance in our literary history . No poem of equal length has for a long time appeared among us ; and we are confident that no American poem , at all corresponding to this in extent , has ever appeared , bearing in itself so much life and energy , and such earnest of success . We may say in general , it is modeled after the poems of Scott , though it contains nine instead of six cantos . The time occupied by the poem is long , much longer than is common in poems of this class . Scott 's " Marmion " fills a period of about forty days . The " Lady of the Lake " covers only the space of six days , while the " Lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and nights . The poem before us spreads over an extent of about two years . But when we mark the unity of the plan , and reflect too that this plan in its great outline is not fictitious but historical , we do not see how the time could well have been shortened . In a smaller space it would have been necessary either to have set at work a train of operations without following them to their legitimate results , or to have described results without showing their causes . On the whole the time seems to have been necessarily chosen as it was . If any one is disposed to object to this feature of the poem , let him reflect ow undesirable it was to the author-how gladly he would have had it otherwise , could he have done so without a sacrifice . It is no easy task to spread the incidents of a poem like this over the space of two years , so as to leave no wide and barren intervals . There is another reason for this length of time , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the wilderness , where all movements must be // comparatively slow . The actors are at first far apart . The tribes that are to be hound together by the eloquence of Tecumseh , are living in places widely remote from each other . Time is requisite that plans may be matured , and that the influences that are to act in the closing scenes , may be drawn towards a center and combined . We have no cause to regret that the time was thus extended . This circumstance has afforded opportunity for rich and varied description . We have the wilderness in all its seasons-its winter gloom , its springing beauty , its summer glory , and its autumnal decay . We have the savage before us in all the circumstances of his life-threading the primeval forests in a night of darkness and storm-sleeping alone by the great lake under the clear full moon , with no noise save the ceaseless stir of waters  --  or musing among the falling leaves in the dreamy Indian summer . To us , these glances into old forests , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slumbering in their unbroken solitude , are among the best features of the poem . We would most gladly , ( did space permit , ) give , an abstract of the entire noem . But we must content ourselves with a brief analysis of the first canto . Yet from this , some idea may be gained of the fineness of plot , and the beauty and variety of incident , that mark the whole . The scene opens on an autumnal day . An Indian warrior is standing upon the banks of the Ohio , with three scalps hanging in his belt . He draws back under the shade of trees , and lies concealed until the evening . Then launching a light canoe , he leads into it a grief-worn captive girl . Two others enter with him-one a younger brother of the warrior , the other a villainous white . We leave them dropping down the Ohio in the quiet moonlight . The poem then goes back in an episode to a time anterior to its commencement , and describes the early dwelling place of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pleasant banks of the Connecticut . Moray , a youth of Scottish descent , dwelt near her , arid grew up with her in love . De Vere , a polished knave , seeks to supplant him in his hopes , but is scorned and rejected , and vows revenge . By reverses of fortune , to which De Vere is accessory , Mary 's father is stripped of his possessions . Joining a band of pioneers , he seeks the far West , and settles in a beautiful spot upon the banks of the Miami . Her home , her forest life , her thoughts of Moray and of love , are all finely described . Moray remains for a season at his home , but his thoughts are with Mary in the West . He takes the dress of a hunter , and plunges into the forest , passes by the Catskill mountains , traverses the Mohawk , hears the roar of Niagara , till at length he stands in sight of the cottage of Mary . It is silent and solitary . He enters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the belt of the warrior . We return again to the boat upon the Ohio . The captive girl , worn with grief and toil , is sleeping . Ooloora , the brother of the warrior , of kind and generous heart , bends over her , and sings to soothe her slumbers . Suddenly a shot is heard from the rocky shore , and Ooloora leaps wildly , and falls dead in the stream . Kenhatawa , the warrior , is on the point of slaying the captive Mary *in revenge . De , Vere intercedes , and stays his hand . We leave them still passing down the Ohio , cautiously creeping under the shade of the rocks . Such is the outline of the first canto ; and we have no fear that it will not commend itself to the read er . The moonlight scene on the Ohio will linger long in many minds . We shall only glance at some of the more important points , spread along // through the remainder of the poem . In the second canto , we have the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motley Indian camp , the meeting of Mary and Moray in the camp , 1'loray 's running for his life , and the prairie on fire . The third canto shows us Tecumseh standing by his father 's grave , in a lone spot upon the Mississippi . Thence he sets out upon his tour . He passes among the tribes dwelling upon the Missouri and its tributary streams , turns south and crosses the Mississippi , visits the nations on the Gulf and along the rivers flowing into it , re* turns and crosses the great river again at a lower point , pushes up along the base of the Rocky Mountains , and among the Black Hills , crosses the Mississippi again near its source , and reaches Lake Superior in the spring . Wearied , he rests himself by night upon its rocky shore , and in that unbroken solitude the seenes of his past life rise before him in dreams . In the fourth canto we have the battle of the Wabash . It opens with an eulogy on Harrison , in eight Spenserian verses . Moray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following winter in the hut of a settler . This is desciThed in the fifth canto . In the same we have the beginning of the wanderings of Mo ray , in company with Owaola , in search of Mary , and the courting scene of Tecumseh and Omena . In the sixth we follow Moray and Owaola through the forests and across the Lake . In this canto , we find the story of the broken-hearted captive girl . The seventh carries us up to the region lying north of Lake Superior , where Moray and Owaola spend the second winter . Nearly a year and a half have now passed since the opening of the poem , and events are verging towards the close . The eighth canto contains the battle of Erie . The ninth embraces the Indian council , the parting of Moray from Tecumseh and Ownola , the last meeting of Tecumseh and Omena , the battle of the Thames , where Tecumseh fell , the death of De Vere , and the meeting of Moray and Mary . We stand at last by the lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not un . dertake an examination of the indP vidual portions of this plot . Whatever minor defects there may be in it , no one can deny that its general structure is admirable . Whoever has tried the labor of invention , knows how difficult it is to take a subject like this in its chaotic state , and fashion it into order and perfect consistency . Questions might be raised , and probably will be , upon th' propriety of bringing the heroine into the battle of Erie , or of forcing Tecumseh to make so great a sacrifice as he did , to save the life of Moray . It may well be urged in favor of the latter , that it shows the abiding strength of an Indian 's gratitude . Moray had saved the life of Omena , whom Tecumseh loved . But as Moray need not have been brought into such difficulties by any thing inherent in the original plan , we incline to the opinion , that this scene should have been omitted . The verse is mainly octosyllabic , gliding occasionally into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine effect upon the ear . When the feelings become enlivened by some pleasing and happy narration , the rapid and dancing motion of the anapest seems exactly suited to their expression . We love to feel ourselves borne along as upon wings . On the other hand , when the feelings become saddened by the previous story , the more slow and solemn movement of the pentameter meets us agreeably . A fine instance of this latter change occurs in the sixth book , after the mournful tale of the captive girl . It fills the ear like some sweet , low voice of consolation in the house of mourning . A few Spenserian verses // open each canto , and the whole is diversified with songs . There are fewer weak lines in the book than we might have expected , considering the youth and inexperience of the author , and yet they are not unfrequent . Some one has well remarked that " the faults of this hook are such as belong to a young writer , while the excellencies are those of but few older ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subject of a sentence is oftentimes so wrapped up in the body of it , that we are at loss where to find it . In some cases too the presence of a tame and commonplace word in a line , degrades and stupefies the whole . But to those who are disposed to judge harshly of the poem for reasons like these , we think it may safely be said , that there canno.t be found in it a line so weak as some that occur in Marmion , whose author has been regarded as the great master of this verse . Adopting , moreover , that charitable style of criticism , which judges of a book by its merits , rather than its defects , as we judge of men after their death , we are but little disposed to linger among these faults , when there is so much around us that is pure and excellent . In the main then , the versification is easy , flowing , and withal spirited and stirring . But it is time that we turn to the book itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poem . The description of Moray and Mary , in their early homes , when the world looked sweet before them , has a fine passage-their thoughts of God and the infinite . " That wondrous world within , their being , Watched by that Life , unseen , all-seeing , The mind , that can nor sleep nor die , Became unto their souls instead A deeper mystery and a dread ; And feelings , infinite and lone , Stirred their still spirits with a tone Like harpings of eternity , Till they became each unto each , As two that on the ocean 's beach , All lonely , hear the mighty roar Of waters rolling evermore , A.nd feel their minds , their beings one . Around them earth-heaven , God , a hove ; Their thoughts were pure , their souls were love ; And Nature with continual voice , Whispered their hearts , rejoice ! rejoice ! ' The whole episode , from which we have made this extract , has a most happy effect upon the reader . It adds a powerful interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through these scenes of danger , toil , and grief , have once lived this quiet , happy life , dreaming only of happiness and rest . We have before this alluded to the beautiful picture presented to the mind in the moonlight scene on the Ohio-the canoe gliding quietly along under the full moon , between high rocky shores . The first canto closes with these lines . " Warned by the shot thus hostile sent From that primeval battlement , They hastened where the opposing side Flung deeper shadows o'er the tide . The moon sank down : yet hour by hour , As drawn by some invisible power , Through the dim stillness on they sped , Like fabled spirits of the dead , In shadow borne , and silence lone Along the lake of Acheron. " // This last simile can not fail to charm the whole poem , is to be found in the a classical ear . It has a finished second canto , in the picture of the elegance . Indian camp . It lies before us so One of the finest specimens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quiet , life-like description in could paint it . " Around the forest-lords were seenSome , old , with grave and guarded mien , High converse holding in the shadeSome idly on the green turf laidTheir dusky wives , from birth the while Inured to care and silent toil , Prepared the venison 's savory food , And yellow corn , io sullen mood , Or sweetly to their infants sung , So light in wicker baskets swung Among the breeze-rocked boughsWhile sat beneath the green leaves fading , Young maids , their chcquered baskets braiding , Whose merry laugh or silvery call Oft ran most strange and musical ; Whose glancing black eyes often stole rro view the worshipped of their soul : And ever in th ' invisible breeze , Waved solemnly those tall old trees , And fleecy clouds , above the prairies flying , Led the light shadows , chasing , chased , and dying . qwq tent . It is difficult , among so many honor of harrison . " The storm swept by , and Peace , with soft fair fingers , Folded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty lingers , the chief reposed beneath the evening star . Calm was the life he led , till , near and far , The breath of millions bore his name along , Through praise , and censure , and continual jar : But lo ! the Capitol 's rejoicing throng ! And envoys from all lands approach with greeting tongue There are few things in the poet 's art , that require more care , and taste , and nice adjustment , than the fashioning of a Spenserian verse . But when well done , nothing has a finer effect upon the ear . Beattie , in his preface to the " Minstrel , " says , " To those who may be disposed to ask , what could induce me to write in so difficult a measure , I can only answer , that it pleases my ear , and seems from its Gothic structure and original , to bear some relation to the subject and spirit of the poem . It admits both simplicity and magnificence of sound and of language , beyond any other stanza that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six poems in our language , of any considerable note , in this measure . It is so difficult , that it has been avoided . If we attend to its construction , we shall find that every verse should be but the expansion of a single thought . The little argument goes on evolving and evolving itself , until the last line , long and stately , brings out the grand conclusion . We are inclined to think that the author has // failed more in this part of his work , than in any other . There is oftentimes a break , a transition in the thought , that affects us painfully . We are not aware that any poet , with the exception of Byron , ever attempted to make this stanza give utterance to broken , violent , and abrupt thought , with any great success . And even in his hands , there is something unnatural in it . If we notice this stanza in the " Faery Queen , " we shall find the thought opening quietly in the beginning , and stretching peacefully along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level meadow , with no ripple to break the evenness of its flow . The author , however , has left us the proof that he is competent for the work . Half of the Spenserian verses are good . The one which we have selected is well woven and beautiful . There are many hearts in our land that can feel the beauty and force of the following passage . " The noble , dauntless pioneers Journeying afar new homes to raise In the lone woods , with toil and tears , Meeting with faith the coming years , Theirs be the highest meed of praise He , who with cost , and care , and toil , Hath reared the vast enduring pile ; He , who bath crossed the Ocean 's foam , Strange lands for science 's sake to roam He , who in danger and in death Ilath faced the spear , the cannon 's breath , Or borne the dungeon and the chain , His country 's rights to save or gain ; He , who amid the storms of state Hath swayed the trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1'he scorn of hatred , sold or boughtAre such not glorious ?

" Last of thy race ! I will not weep This loss the sorest , Though sweet the love and passing deep , To me thou borest ! No ! sleep , since all thy kindred sleep , Child of the forest , And I will lay thee here , where ceaselessly To soothe thy rest blue waters murmur by .

The war-song of Tecumseh , in the last canto , breathes the true Indian spirit . In fact , the songs are all more or less marked in this respect . We shall close this part of our subject , by reference to the scene in the last canto , where Omena sits alone in the forest , in the hazy season of Indian summer , awaiting the approach of Tecumseh . It is one of those beautiful and finished pieces of description , that give a charm to the book . " Within a wood extending wide , By Thames 's steeply winding side , There sat upon a fallen tree , Grown green through ages silently , An Indian girl . The gradual change Making all things , n ost sweetly strange , lied come again . The autumn sun Half up his morning journey shone With conscious lustre , calm and still ; By dell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded trees in grief As various as their clouded leaf . " We give only the opening of the passage , but we can not commend the whole of it too highly . It ranks among the very highest order of descriptive poetry . In this situation , Tecumseh meets her , and they have their k'st sad interview . It was a fine fancy of the author , to leave his reader by the lonely tomb of Tecumseh . After journeying so long through the wilderness-following the hero through so many scenes of danger and adventure , it acts like a talisman upon the mind , to stand thus by his solitary grave , embosomed with trees .

Nor was it an indifference to literary merit , which rendered us so apathetic on this occasion . Had we been favored with such an opportunity of being introduced to the illustrious author of Waverley , we should have embraced it with eagerness , and have considered ourselves honored in the interview . Had we been informed that our own honored irving was stopping for the night so near us , we should have hastened to tender him our respects , and have felt a pride in exchanging salutations with one who is the ornament of American literature . We had always conceded to Mr. Dickens much merit , as a writer of a certain sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rendering to him the admiration due to genius , but we felt that his literary reputation was insufficient to overbalance that moral obliquity , which made it inconsistent with our self-respect , to be particularly respectful towards him . We were , nevertheless , interested in observing the reception which he met with from our countrymen ; and on the whole , it accorded well with our expectations . There were men of learning and honorable distinction , who , willing for a. seas on to overlook his faults , and eager perhaps to give him a favorable impression of American manners and hospi. tality , made him their guest , and entertained him with marked kindness and attention . Others , of a more thoughtful and cautious temper , stood aloof from the movement that would make Boz , like Lafayette , the nation 's guest , feeling that the ordinary attention paid to strangers might suffice for a man with no other distinction than what he had attained as a writer of droll sketches and stories of low life . It soon became apparent , however , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of theaters , halls , and other like scenes of moral culture and innocent amusement , the lovers of wine , cards and billiards - gentlemen par excellence-manifested a peculiar interest in Mr. Dickens , and were disposed to claim him as their own . Accordingly , the Gotharnites would allow the lordly distinction of seeing the British lion to none , who could not pay ten dollars for the privilege . They converted the theater , which had long rendered " a beggarly account of empty boxes , " into one vast saloon , brilliantly illuminated , decorated with illustrations from the writings of Boz , and crowded with the beauty and fashion , the foppery and coquetry of the city , where , amid the voluptuous swell of music , the giddy dance , and the splendid banquet , Mr. Dickens was introduced to American society . Whether he was satisfied with this specimen of native manners , or whether he was less flattered by such a reception , than he would have been by the quiet attentions of literary men , we are not informed ; hut immediately afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretext for declining other invitations to similar entertainments . Whatever may have been his opinion of the mode adopted by the New Yorkers to tender him their respects , there were not a few , who inferred from the personal appearance of " Charles Dickens , Esq. , " and his apparent anxiety to be esteemed a man of fashion and to mingle in the scenes of fashionable life , that no other mode could have been selected more in harmony with his character and feelings . And here we can not resist the temptation to turn aside for a moment , to give our readers a brief account of the origin and education of this same " Charles Dickens , Esq. ; " and this we do , for the more particular edification of his " numerous friends " in this country , who were eager to pay their respects to him , under the impression , that he was an English gentleman , who had good humoredly spent his leisure moments , in rambling along the lower walks of life in quest of amusement for the higher classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back far enough ; to ascertain whether any of his ancestors fought by the side of William the Conqueror , at Hastings , or followed the lion-hearted Richard to Palestine . We have not learned , whether some Dickens of the olden time , was with the chivalry of England , at Cressy , or at Agincourt . Nor have we been able to determine the connection between the house of Dickens , and the Percys , the Howards , or the Russells . All that we can say is , that , according to the best accounts , the father of our hero was , or is , connected with the London press , getting a decent living by gathering or inventing accidents and anecdotes for the newspapers ; and that , accordingly , " Charles Dickens , Esq . " was educated to the profession of a police reporter . It was in this humble , though honest calling , that he became so familiar with courts and prisons , Bow Street and St. Giles ' . Here too was developed that peculiar talent for caricaturing , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercised to advantage , he wrote and published various humorous sketches , till at length he came before the world as the author of Pickwick . The " Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club " had a rapid sale , and Mr. Dickens soon found himself , with an increasing popularity , in the enjoyment of an ample income . All this we , as Americans , regard as more respectable than any mere pedigree , running back even to the Conquest . But Mr. Dickens , unable to bear this sudden turn of fortune with the equanimity that ought // ever to characterize the nohility of genius , puts on airs as if he be longed by birth and breeding , to those higher classes which constitute the " Corinthian capital " of English society . Mistaken effort ! It is not by wearing white kid gloves on a railroad and steamboat journey in a New England February-it is not by being unable to understand the possibility of a gentleman 's dining earlier than the latest possible hour-it is not by the most punctilious observance of the arbitrary conventionalities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , querulous disposition in respect to accommodations at an inn , or on board ship-that true good breeding is infallibly known . Yet the reading of this book , as well as some Boziana ' which have come to our knowledge from other sources , incline us to the opinion , that Mr. Dickens has mistaken such things as these for the surest indications of a fine gentleman , or perhaps for the very quality of gentility itself . Sometimes we have even queried , whether his studied cool contempt for religion in every form-the scorn which he so obtrusively expresses for the low practice of total abstinence from intoxicating drinks  --  and the sympathy which he seems to have with those who have no interest in the miseries and vices of the poor , except as matters of governmental regulation , or picturesque objects of contemplation , do not also enter into his idea of a high . bred gentleman . It often fares with pretenders to high b*eeding , as with pretenders to godliness ; they know something traditionally about " the form , " but " the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus , while they make an ostentations and perhaps troublesome display of the former , they can not but expose themselves by their manifest deficiencies in respect to the latter . And here , as we find ourselves tending to a somewhat philosophic mood , we may take occasion to observe that the reception which any foreigner of note meets with among us , is to some extent , a mirror of his own character . The class of society with which he becomes acquainted , the character of his admirers , and the marks of distinction with which they favor him , are so many indications of the manner in which he has impressed himself upon the public mind . How different , probably , have been the impressions made on the mind of Lord Morpeth , by his visit to America , from those received by Mr. Dickens ; and that mainly for the reason that the truly gentlemanly demeanor and the unsullied reputation of the former , introduced him into circles in which the latter was not at all at home . If the illustrious Brougham or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how different would be their opinions of American society and institutions , from those of the Marryatts and the Trollopes . Those travelem s * ho have attempted to describe American manners , have often succeeded in describing the manners only of that particular class of society to which they have been able to gain admission ; or of that particular class which their habits and their intellectual and moral sympathies enabled them to understand . And the best mode of reforming American manners , which some of these writers could adopt , would be to reform their own manners , and then return and view themselves in a mirror into which they were before unable to lock . Whether Mr. Dickens was acquainted with the principle just stated , and felt that it would hardly be complimentary to himself to speak of those who in some instances were forward to welcome him , we can not say ; but for some reason he has deemed it expedient to make no al // lusion to them whatever . He simply remarks at the close of his Notes " I have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to influence me in what I have written ; for in either case , I should have offered but a sorry acknowledgment , compared with that I hear within my breast , towards those partial readers of my former hooks , across the waters , who met me with an open hand , and not with one that closed upon an iron muzzle . " - But we can not persuade ourselves that this is all the notice which hc intends to take of his reception here ; and when these catch-penny Notes shall have had their run , and the more formal stories of American society shall make their appearance , then may his beloved transatlantic friends be furnished with pleasing reminiscences , and " pietLlres to matcL " I-Ic will not be so ungrateful as to deny those who took such pains to render themselves conspicuous , the privilege of appearing in print . They are engraven on his heart , and Cruikshank will soon lie called in to copy and preserve the likeness . We have been greatly disappointed in the perusal of these " American Notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects in our social organization , which might be hit off to advantage by a masterhand ; and we had hoped that Mr. Dickens ' keen perception of the ludicrous , would be exercised at our present expense , though for our ultimate profit . We should have thanked him for a humorous exhibition of our weak points of national character ; but he seems either to have failed to apprehend them , or to have felt an unwonted reserve in making his " police reports . " These Notes are barren of incident and anecdote , deficient in wit , and meagre even in respect to the most ordinary kind of information . They give no just conception of the physical aspect of the country of which they treat ; much less do they introduce the reader to the homes and firesides of its inhabitants . Nor could any thing better have been expected , since Mr. Dickens merely skimmed over the country , seldom remaining longer in a place than to learn its name , to acquaint himself with the facilities for eating , drinicina , and sleeping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few particulars respecting its public buildings and institutions , and to inquire with a professional feeling , concerning its alms-houses , its prisons , and its purlicus of low vice and wretchedness . The little information to be gleaned from these two volumes , with few exceptions , mvrht be *tin much more * , . ed advantageously from the map and gazetteer . The perusal of them has served chiefly to lower our estimate of the man , and to fill us with contempt for such a compound of egotism , coxcombry , and cockneyism . We shall follow him in his tour , as far as patience will allow us , and then take some brief notice of the other productions of his pen . rrhe first two chapters of these Notes , descriptive of the departure and passage out , are , on the whole , rather entertaining , and exhibit more of that pleasantry which has hitherto characterized the productions of the author , than any of the succeeding chapters ; though even here he sometimes fails in his attempts at wit . His description of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligible , whatever may be thought of the taste of a writer who can expatiate on such a theme . He represents the anguish which he suffered , " when recommended to eat any thing , as second only to that which is said to be endured , by the apparently drowned , in the process of restoration to life ; " and truly his sufferings must have been intense , if we may believe that even during the short space of their continuance , he // " drank brandy and water with unspeakable disgust . " lie could have mentioned no more decisive symptom of a disordered stomach , than this aversion to what we soon discover to be his favorite beverage , inasmuch as when on shore his " disgust " was confined wholly to the last named ingredient of that delectable compound . The state of " universal indifference " into which the patient is sometimes brought , is thus pleasantly described . Nothing would have surprised me . If , in the momentary illumination of any ray of intelligence that may have come upon me in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a scarlet coat and bell , had come into that little kennel before roe , broad awake in broad day , and apologizing for being damp through walking in the sea , had handed me a letter directed to myself in familiar characters , I am certain I should not have felt one atom of astonishment : I should have been perfectly satisfied . If Neptune himself had walked in , with a toasted shark on his trident , I should have looked upon the event as one of the very commonest every-day occurrences . " Yet here we can not fail to notice the imitation of Charles Lamband , by the way , Dickens is eminently an imitator-who graphically describes the indifference which he felt on recovering from a severe cold in the head , by saying that if any one should tell him that the world would be destroyed to-morrow , and furnish him with satisfactory evidence of the truth of the assertion , he could only answer , Will it ? " The paragraph succeeding the one just quoted , describes a scene which may be explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been swallowed with such " unspeakable disgust . " " Once-once-I found myself on deck . I do n't know how I got there , or what possessed me to go there , but there I was ; and completely dressed too , with a huge pea-coat on , and a pair of boots such as no weak man in his senses could ever have got into . I found myself standing , when a gleam of consciousness came upon me , holding on to something . I do n't know what . I think it was the boatswain : or it may have been the pump or possibly the cow . I ca n't say how long I had been there ; whether a day or a minute . I recollect trying to think about something ( about any thing in the whole wide world , I was not particular ) without the smallest effect . I could not even make out which was the sea , and which was the sky ; for the horizon seemed drunk , and was flying wildly about , in all directions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lazy gentleman standing before me , nautically clad in a suit of shaggy blue , with an oil-skin hat . But I was too imbecile , although 1 knew it to be he , to separate him from his dress ; and tried to call him , I remember , Pilot . After another interval of total unconsciousness , I found he had gone , and recognized another figure in its place . It seemed to wave and fluctuate before me as though 1 saw it reflected in all unsteady looking-glass ; but I knew it for the captain ; and such was the cheerful influence of his face , that I tried to smile ; yes , even then I tried to smile . " I saw by his gestures that he addressed me ; but it was a long time beibre I could make out that he remonstrated against my standing up to my knees in water-as I was ; of course I do n't know why . I tried to thank him , but could n't . I could only point to my boots  --  or wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plaintive voice , " Cork soles : " at the same time endeavoring , I am told , to sit down in the pool . Finding that I was quite insensible , and for the time a maniac , he humanely conducted me below . " All this description may be summed up in a few words . The illustrious Boz was as drunk as a pipera result not of sea-sickness , but of the sovereign remedy for an inward bruise , ' hom*opathic in its nature , but not homo*opathic in the doses-on which he had relied for prevention or for cure . We shall make but one extract more from these introductory chapters ; but it may serve to acquaint the readers more fully with the character of our author , the elucidation of which we shall have continually in view . Witness the occupations of this literary gentleman during his passage across the waters . " The captain being gone , we compose ourselves to read , if the place be light // enough ; and if not , we doze and talk alternately . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a steaming dish of baked potatoes , and another of roasted apples and plates of pig 's face , cold ham , salt beef ; or perhaps a srooking mess of rare hot collops . We fall to upon these dainties ; eat as much as we can-we have great appetites now-and are as long as possible about it . If the fire will burn ( it will sometimes ) we are pretty cheerful , if it wo n't , we all remark to each other that it 's very cold , rub our hands , cover ourselves with coats and cloaks , and lie down again to doze , talk , and read , ( provided as aforesaid , ) until dinner time . At five , another hell rings , and the stewardess reappears with another dish of potatoes-boiled , this timeand store of hot meat of various kinds : not forgetting the roast pi* , to he taken medicinally . We sit down at table aaain ( rather more cheerfelly than before ) : prolong the meal with rather a mouldy dessert of apples , grapes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . The bottles and glasses are still upon the table , and the oranges and so forth are rolling about according to their fancy and the ship 's way , when the doctor comes down , by special nightly invitation , to join our evening rubber : immediately 00 whose arrival we make a party at whist , and as it is a rough niaht and the cards will not lie on the cloth , we put the tricks in our pockets as we take them . At whist we remain with exemplary gravity ( deducting a short time for tea and toast ) until eleven o'clock , or thereabouts ; when the captain comes down again , in a son - wester hat tied under his chin , and a pilot coat ; mnakin* the ground wet where he stands . " By this time the card-playing is over , and the bottles and glasses are again upon the table ; and afner an hour 's pleasant conversation about the ship , the passengers , and things in general , the captain ( who never goes to bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat collar for the deck again ; shakes hands all round ; and goes laughing out into the weather as merrily as to a birth-day party . " After a somewhat boisterous passage of eighteen days , Mr. Dickens arrived at Boston on Saturday , the 22d of January , 1842 , a day to he hereafter noted in every edition of the American Almanac . Mr. Dickens acknowledges with pleasure the excellence of our custom-house regulations , and the gentlemanly deportment of its officers ; contrasting very happily with the meddlesome and insulting officiousness of those in his own country and on the Continent . He deserves credit in this as in other instances , for giving praise where it is due , even in little things . His first day in Boston was the Sabbath . Modestly declining a score of invitations to church , for want of " any change of clothes , " he strolled abroad in his humble , unsanctifled attire , to view the city . He seems to have been greatly amused with its " light , unsubstantial " appearance , as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite by which he was surrounded , and the iron balconies that frown over the dark receding portals of stone . He was altogether amazed in walking the streets of a modern and growing city , not to find in every structure the solidity and grandeur of an Egyptian pyramid . The explanation of which is , that he missed the dense , dark atmosphere of London , and the vast cloud of smoke from bituminous coal , which hides the pure light of heaven from the natives of Cockaigne , and covers every thing with sooty statns . So to a man who had never been out of Pittsburg , Boston might seem as white , and airy , and unsubstantial , as it seemed to our author . His first impressions of the city are thus described . " When I got into the streets upon this Sunday morning , the air was so clear , the houses were so bright and gay ; the signboards were painted in such gaudy colors ; the gilded letters were so very eolden the bricks were so very red , the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so very green , the knobs arid plates upon the street-doors so marvellously bright and twinkling ; and all so slight and unsubstantial in appearance-that every thoroughfare in the city looked exactly like a scene in a pantomime. it rarely happens in the business streets that a tradesman , if I may venture to call any body a tradesman where every body is a merchant , resides above his store ; so that many occupations are often carried on in one house , and the whole flout is covered with boards and inscriptions . As I walked along , I kept glancing up at these boards , confidently ex- // pecting to see a few of them change into something ; and I never turned a corner soddenly without looking out for the clown and pantaloon , who , I had no doubt , were hiding in a doorway or behind some pillar close at hand . As to Harlequin and Columbine , I discovered immediately that they lodged ( they are always looking after lodgings in a pantomime ) at a very small clock-maker 's , one story high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various symbols and devices , alroost covering the whole front , had a great ( hal hanging out  --  to be jumped through of ' course . " Now there is no doubt that all this appeared to Charles Dickens , Esq . to be very witty indeed ; and after he had written it he probably read it many times aloud , picturing to himself a nation convulsed with laughter at every word . Yet we must confess that , as we were so apathetic in the proximity of Mr. Dickens , so now we are so obtuse that we can not discover the wit of this exceedingly funny description . It has moved us only to a sort of commiseration for the writer . It reminds us of that scene described in the Pickwick Papers , where Mr. Stiggins , being thoroughly warmed with apple-toddy , clambers up the ladder to the temperance meeting in the loft , and looking round upon the audience with swimming eyes , expresses it as his decided conviction , that " the meeting is drunk . " The truth is , that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sea-sickness , or at least of the remedy which he drank with such " unspeakable disgust , " and in the confusion of his ideas he altogether mistook the harlequin . On the whole , however , he acknowledges that Boston is " a beautiful city . " He speaks favorably of " the intellectual refinement and superiority " of the inhabitants , which he refers mainly , perhaps too much , " to the quiet influence of the university of Cambridge ; " though it is unquestionably true that both the intellectual and moral influence of such an institution is always widely felt through the surrounding reoion a - He speaks favorably of the American collegiate system , especially in respect to its liberal and practical nature ; though nothing is more evident than that he knows very little on the subject . Mr. Dickens remained longer , we believe , in Boston than in any other city , and perhans received more attention from literary men there than any where else . That " Dickens dinner " was a great affair in its day-it seemed - almost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Bunker Hill monument . All sorts of the distinguished men of Boston and its vicinity , " judges , generals , legislators " - old Hartford Convention federalists , and locofoco philosophers of the newest schoolUnitarian preachers , and orthodox professors of theology-united in paying such homage to the author of Oliver Twist as was never paid to the author of Paradise Lost . Tue President of the Senate of Massachusetts brought all his own wit to honor the occasion , besides cramming himself beforehand with the printed wit of Mr. Dickens . The President of Harvard University , with all his years and all his laurels , came down from his academic dignity , to honor the author of the Pickwick Papers . Some of those gentlemen would probably be very willing now to forget the adulation which they bestowed on the author of " American Notes for General Circulation . " Mr. Dickens justly praises the " public institutions and charities " of Boston and its vicinity , and generally of the United States . We have respected him for the sympathy manifested in his writings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his stories might not be without advantage in directing the attention of certain classes in Great Britain toward the starving thousands around them . As his descriptions of our // charitable institutions were probably intended principally for his English readers , and as the little which he says of each is generally well said , we shall dismiss them with a recommendation to his own countrymen . A single observation , however , made in this connection , on the subject of prison discipline , is worthy of a passing notice . It is in reference to the modern improvements in the internal structure , arrangements and occupations of our prisons . " A visitor requires to reason and reflect a little , before the sight of a number of men engaged in ordinary labor , such as he is accustomed to out of doors , will impress him half so strongly as the contemplation of the same persons in the same place and garb would , if they were occupied in sortie task , marked and degraded every where as belonging only to felons in jails . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first to persuade myself that I was really in a jail : a place oP ignominious punishment and endurance . And to this hour I very much question whether the humane boast that it is not like one , has its root in the true wisdom ophy of the matter . " or philosMuch as we disapprove of any thing approaching cruelty in the treatment of those whom the law has condemned to be shut out from the pale of human society , we have long been of the opinion that there is danger of making the prison too comfortable a place , if not even desiralile for those who hardly have a home , and thus lessening the dread of the penalty and its restraining influence . How far these improvements are to he attributed to a mercenary and how far to a philanthropic spirit-how far they are wise and how far truly benevolent , we do not here pretend to determine . We only make the suggestion , that kindness to criminals may be carried so far as to impair the majesty of law by weakening its penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The tone of society in Boston , " says Mr. D. , " is one of perfect politeness , courtesy and good breeding . " And the same may be said of most of the principal towns of New England , though Mr. Dickens had no opportunity of becoming acquainted with the fact . The ladies , however , do not appear to have found any special favor in his sight , though he could hardly have been expected to institute any comparison between them and his own countrywomen . We believe it is an admitted fact that the American ladies excel the English in beauty in their youth , but that their beauty sooner fades ; and our belles might advantageously exchange a little of their fairness of complexion , for the rosy hue of health which is the reward of frequent and vigorous exercise in the open air . The comments of Mr. Dickens on the education and religious character of the ladies of Boston we shall not stop to notice , believing that they will be duly considered by those who having been privileged with his society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own religious sentiments , as he incidentally expresses them , are deserving of a more particular attention . " In the kind of provincial life which prevails in cities such as this , the pulpit has great influence . The peculiar province of the pulpit in New England , ( always excepting the Unitarian ministry , ) would appear to be the denouncement of all innocent and rational amusements . To the church , the chapel , and the lecture-room , the ladies resort in crowds . Whcrever religion is resorted to , as a strong drink , and as an escape Irom the dull monotonous rotind of home , those of its ministers who pepper the hiahest will he the surest to please . They who strew the eternal path with the greatest amount of brimstone , arid who most ruthlessly tread down the flowers and leaves th't grow by the wayside , will be voted the most righteous ; and they who enlarge with the greatest pertinacity on the difficulty of getting into heaven , will be considered by all true believers certain of going there ; though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conclusion is arrived at . " " The fruits of the earth have their growth in corruption . Out of the rottenness of these things , there has sprung up in Boston a sect of philosophers known as // Transcendentalists . On inquiring what this appellation might be supposed to signify , I was given to understand that whatever was unintelligible would be certainly transcendental . Not deriving much comfort from this elucidation , I pursued the inquiry still farther , and found that the Transcendentalists are followers of my friend Mr. Carlyle , or , I should rather say , of a follower of his , Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson . This gentleman has written a volume of essays , in which , among much that is dreamy and fanciful , ( if he will pardon me for saying so , ) there is much more that is true and manly , honest and bold . Transcend entalism has its occasional vagaries , ( what school has not ? ) hut it has aood healthful qualities in spite of them ; not least amoc* the number , a hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the million varieties of her everlasting wardrobe . And , therefore , if I were a Bostonian , I think I would be a Transcendentalist . " This charming criticism upon the general tone of preaching in Boston , is from the pen of a man who spent two whole Sabbaths in the city , the first of which was occupied in strollin0 through the streets rneditating devoutly upon " Harlequins and Columbines ; " and the second partly we suppose in the sante edifying manner ; and partly in listening to the Rev. Mr. Taylor , the far-famed " sailor-preacher , " whose chapel was probably sought by It r . D. with the expectation of finding in its novelty some source of " innocent and rational amusement " appropriate to the Lord 's day . Who does not perceive at a glance that such a criticism is not the result of personal observation ? that it is the embodiment of hints picked up in the barroom , or perhaps in some resp*ctable and fashionable coterie , in which however , orthodoxy finds no more favor than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We do not envy the " Unitarian ministry " the distinction of never denouncing such " innocent and rational amusements , " as theatrical entertainments , balls , cards and dice . We do not contest with them the honor of strewing the path to heaven with leaves and flowers , so that Mr. Dickens , et id omne genus , can tread it pleasantly and securely , walking , reeling or dancing , at their option ; on the other hand we congratulate thetn on a compliment paid with such delicacy and propriety , and coming from a quarter so distinguished . Yet we can not refrain from asking the discerning public what must be the moral impression of the writings of a man who avows such sentiments as have now been quoted ? What streams must issue from such a fountain ? It seems that the pulpit denunciation of innocent and rational amusements is not wholly ineffectual , since Mr. Dickens has occasion to lament that although " there are two theaters in Boston , of good size and construction , they are sadly in want of patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the city is given in the following words . " The usual dinner-hour is two o'clock . A dinner party takes place at five ; and at an evemna party , they seldom sup later than eleven ; so that it goes hard but one gets home , even from a rout , by midnight . I never could find out any difference between a party at Boston and a party in London , savin* that at the former place all assemblies are held at inure rational hours ; that the conversation may possibly 1 ) 0 a little louder and more cheerful ; that a guest is usually expected to ascend to the very top of the house to take his cloak off ; that he is cortain to see at every dinner , an unusual mount of poultry on the table ; and at every supper , at least two mighty bowls of hot stewed oysters , in any one of which a half-grown Duke of Clarence might be smothered easily . " I'here are two theaters in Boston , of good size and construction , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to them , sit , as of right , in the front rows of the boxes . " There is no smoking-room in any hotel , and there was none consequently in ours ; but the bar is a large room with a stone floor , arid there the people stand and smoke , and lounge about , all the evening ; droppin* in and out as the humor takes them . There too the stranger is initiated into the mysteries of gin-sling , cocktail , sangaree , mnint-inlep , sherrycobbler , timber-doodle , and other rare drinks . The house is full of boarders , both married and single , many of whom I P ' - P ' // sleep upon the premises , and contract by the week for their board and lodging ; the charge for which diminishes as they go nearer the sky to roost . A public table is laid in a very handsome hall for breakfast , and for dinner , and for supper . The party sitting down together to these meals will vary in number from one to two hundred ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the day is proclaimed by an awful gong , which shakes the very window frames , as it reverberates through the house , and horribly disturbs nervous foreigners . There is an ordinary for ladies , and an ordinary for gentlemen . " If the gongs have such an effect on foreigners , ' we advise that they he sent hack to China , where they are much needed for that purpose . Before taking his final leave of Boston and its vicinity , Mr. Dickens made a brief visit to Lowell , with which he seems to have been highly gratified . And every American may well be proud of the condition and character of operatives in the manufactories here , when compared with those of the same class in England . the British manufacturing system has hitherto been one vast system of oppression and wrong . The author of the " Glory and Shame of England , " has depicted its deformities in vivid colors ; and after every possible abatement is made in view of the prejudice or exaggeration of the writer , it is still to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We trust that the superiority of our system , as briefly delineated by Mr. Dickens , may arrest the attention of the philanthropic in that country . After speaking of the neat , cheerful , and healthy appearance of the " factory girls , " the cleanliness and decorum prevalent in their boarding- houses , and even in the rooms of the manufactories , he proceeds as follows . " I am now going to state three facts , which will startle a large class of readers on this side of the Atlantic , very much . " Firstly , there is a joint-stock piano in a great many of the boarding-houses . Secondly , nearly all these young ladies subscribe to circulating libraries . Thirdly , they have got up among themselves a periodical , called THE LOWELL OFFER Vol. 1 . 10 INC , a repository of original articles , written exclusively by females actively employed in the mills-which is duly printed , published , and sold ; and whereof I brought away from Lowell four hundred good solid pages , which I have read from beginning to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these facts , will exclaim , with one voice , How very preposterous ! ' On my deferentially inquiring why , they will answer , These things are above their station . ' In reply to that objection , I would beg to ask what their station is . " It is their station to work . And they do work . They labor in these mills , up . on an average , twelve hours a day , which is unquestionably work , and pretty tight work too . Perhaps it is above their station to indulge in such amusements , on any terms . Are we quite sure that we in England have not formed our ideas of the station ' of working people , from accustoming ourselves to the contemplation of that class as they are , and not as they might be ? " In this trip to Lowell , Mr. Dickens took his first ride on an American railroad ; and sadly does he complain of the " shabby omnibuses , " in which he was jolted along . We commend his observations on this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let the directors of the railroads see to this matter before Mr. Dickens comes again . Our author writes quite like himself , in his description of railroad travelling . " There is a great deal of jolting , a great deal of noise , a great deal of wall , not much window , a locomotive engine , a shriek and a bell . " There are many provisions for the comfort and safety of travelers , which we might wisely adopt from our English cousins ; and we rejoice to see that the law is imposing its penalties upon those steamboat and railroad companies , by the carelessness of whose agents human life is so often endangered and sacrificed . The returns of the railroad companies in England , from 1832 to 1839 , show that more than forty millions of passengers were carried over the roads in that period , and that during the same period only ten persons , ( or one in four millions , ) were killed // by accident , of whom but four , ( or one in ten millions , ) were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is vastly greater . Mr. Dickens left Boston on the 5th of February , for Worcester , in company with Governor Davis , with whom he spent the Sabbath . Here he was again entertained with the new and unsubstantial appearance of every thing which he saw . On Monday morning he pursued his journey by the way of Springfield to Hartford . He was much amused with the little boat which conveyed him down the Connecticut , not being aware probably that the river is not navigable for a boat of larger size . Mr. Dickens remained in Hat tford four days , but his description of the place is condensed into a single paragraph . " The town is beautifully situated in a basin of green hills ; the soil is rich , well wooded , and carefully improved . it is the seat of the local legislature of Connecticut , which sage body enacted , in bygone times , the renowned code of Blue Laws , ' in virtue whereof ; among other enlightened provisions , any citizen who could ha proved to have kissed his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stocks . Too much of the old Puritan spirit exists in these parts to the present hour ; but its influence has not tended , that I know , to make the people less hard in their bargains , or snorO equal in their dealings . As I never heard of its working that effect any where else , I infer that it never will hare . Indeed , I am accustomed , with reference to great professions and severe faces , to judge of the " oods of the other world pretty much as I judge of the goods of this ; and whenever I see a dealer in such commodities with too areat a display of them in his window , I doubt the quality of the article within . " This little paragraph , which most readers perhaps will pass over without attention , contains several items worthy of special notice . In the first place , it revives the old and ridiculous story of the " Blue Laws " of Connecticut . We suppose that Mr. Dickens believes that such a code really existed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ignorance . It is time , however , that the American public , and especially the New England public , fully understood that no such code as the Blue Laws are represented to have been , ever existed in either of the colonies of Connecticut . Those who are not already convinced that this oft-repeated story is a sheer fabrication , may be enlightened by the perusal of Prof Kingsley 's Historical Discourse , especially notes G and N , pp. 83 , 104 . It owes its origin to one Dr. Samuel Peters , who , " at the commencement of the revolutionary war , was an Episcopal missionary at Hebron , in Connecticut . As he was very actsve in asserting the royal claims , he became obnoxious to the patriots of the day . He was threatened by a mob ; though it is believed , no personal violence was done him . About 1774 , he went to England , highly exasperated against his country , and especially against his native state , Connecticut . He employed himself while the war continued , in reviling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without his name , what he called , A general History of Connecticut , from its first settlement under George Fenwick , Esq. , to its latest period of amity with Great Britain , including a description of the country , and many curious and interesting anecdotes . ' " This history abounded in misrepresentatten and falsehood ; yet it had sufficient influence to give currency to the report which reached Mr. Dickens ' ears in Hartford . Mr. Dickens laments , that " too much of the old Puritan spirit exists in Connecticut to the present hour . " rj7here is greater cause for lamentation , that so little of what was upright and heroic in the Puritan spirit prevails among the present generation . If the love of law and order , of virtue and freedom-if good government , sound morals , // liberal education , and pure religion , are the fruits of this spirit , then let it every where prevail . But Mr. Dickens was specially grieved by the prevalence of that penurious spirit , which he regards as its concomitant . He laments , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to make the people less hard in their bargains , or more equal in their dealings . " Now how did Mr. Dickens , whose visit to the United States was prompted no less by mercenary motives than by vanity-how did this frank , generous-minded man , receive such an impression of the parsimony of the good people of Hartford ? Was it from the facts , that they invited him to visit their city , sent a committee to escort him from Springfield , entertained him for four days at the first hotel , gave him a sumptuous public dinner , opened every place of interest and amusement to his inspection , and all without subjecting him to the expense of a single farthing ? Or were all these smart and witty things , about " Blue Laws , " " hypocrisy , " " Puritan cant , " and " hard bargains " whispered into the ear of Mr. Dickens , by the committee who had him in charge , or by some other worthy citizens of Hartford , who , finding themselves suddenly exalted to the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands with the author of Pickwick , felt under a necessity of ridiculing their own city , in order that they might appear more liberal or more facetious in his eyes ? We strongly incline to the latter opinion ; for Mr. Dickens ' personal opportunities of becoming acquainted with the characteristics of the people of Hartford , were about equal to those which he en loyed for observing the style of preaching prevalent in Boston . We suspect that in both cases , there was some prompter behind the curtain . At New Haven , which might have furnished some attractions to a gen tleman of literary pretensions , Mr. Dickens spent but a single night , and almost all that he remembers about his visit there , is , that lie " put up at the best inn. ** From New Haven he proceeded to New York , where , as we have already intimated , he was received in a most appropriate manner at the theater . His description of the city as usual is meagre , conveying to the stranger no adequate idea , in fact no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise , its hum of business , its bustle and parade of fashion . These things of course , would not attract the particular attention of one familiar with London , but they are deserving of at least a passing notice . New York , however , appeared to Mr. Dickens more like a solitude than a Babel . But how quiet the streets are ! " he exclaims . " Are there no itinerant bands ; no wind or stringed instrnmen*s ? No , not one . By day , are there no punches , fantoccinis , dancinr-dous , jugglers , conjurers , orchestrians , or even barrel-organs ? No , not one . Yes , I remember one . One barrel-organ and a dancingmonkey-sportive by nature , but fast fading into a dish , lumpisb monkey , of the utilitarian school . Bev rsothin* lively ; no , not so - ond that , white as a mouse in a twirling cage . " In fact , Mr. Dickens is ready to die of ennui ! What would he give now for one peep at " Mrs. Jarley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old friends , " Messrs . Codhag and Short , " with a sight of their worn-out " Punch ! " Pity for him , that New York has no such dignified " amusements " to entertain her elite and literary visitors from abroad . We presume , however , that Mr. Dickens found something answering to the name of " Punch " in some of those " pleasant retreats , " in which he sought a momentary refuge , allured by the illuminated signs , " oysters in every style . " At length , with an eye to his profession , and to the money to be realized from some American // tales of ' pauperism and crime , he finds his way to the " Tombs , " where he makes himself acquainted with the keepers and the cells , and with the details of the mode in which the punishment of death is inflicted . Afterwards , with the same object in view , no doubt , he visits the infamous Five Points , which region of filth and vice and crime , he enters under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass in the streets daily without suspecting their official character , hut whom our police reporter , long familiar with Bow Street , Seven Dials , and St. Giles 's , would have recognized had he met them in the Great Desert . What scenes he witnessed at midnight in these abodes of misery and sin , we shall probably learn more fully from the tales of fun and woe , which will embellish the " new work , by Boz , " to be published in monthly numbers , beginning in the present month . He favors us with only one scene , which seems to have afforded him unspeakable delight . It was a negro dance in a low and filthy cellar , performed at his particular request . After describing , though in somewhat unfavorable terms , " the different public institutions on Long Island , " Mr. Dickens concludes his notice of New York , as follows : " There are three theatres . Two of them , the Park and the Bowery , are large , elegant and handsome buildings , and are , I grieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympic , is a tiny show-hox for vaudevilles and hurlesques . It is singularly well-conducted hy Mr. Mitchell , a comic actor of great quiet humor and originality , who is well renemhered and esteemed hy London playgoers . I am happy to report of this deserving gentleman , that his henches are usually well filled , and that his theater rings with merriment every night . I had almost forgotten a small summer theater , called Nihlos , with gardens and open air amusements attached ; hut I believe it is not exempt from the general depression under which theatrical property , or what is humorously called hy that name , unfortunately labors . " The country round New York is surpassingly and exquisitely picturesque . The climate , as I have already intimated , is somewhat of the warmest . What it would he , without the sea hreezes which come from its beautiful hay in the evening time , I will not throw myself or my readers into a fever hy inquiring . * tone of the best society in this city , is like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a greater infusion of the mercantile spirit , hut generally polished and refined , and always most hospitahle . The houses and tablcs are elegant ; the hours later and more rakish ; and there is , perhaps , a greater spirit of contention in reference to appe* rances , and the display of we'ith and costly living . The ladies are singularly beautiful . " The title of the next chapter is " Philadelphia , and its solitary prison . " It might with propriety be inverted , for about one tenth part of the chapter is devoted to a description of the city , and the remaining nine tenths , to meditations and soliloquies in the Eastern Penitentiary . We have never read a book , professing to give an account of any country , which , in respect to its natural features , its towns and cities , its manners and customs , its social , civil , and religious institutioris-in short , in respect to every thing about which the reader wishes to receive information , or at least , to ascertain the opinions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . We should hardly have thought it possible for so many pages of " Notes on America " to be written , and so little to be said in them which is of the least importance to the reader . The experiment , however , has been successfully made , and Mr. Dickens has proved himself to be utterly incompetent to write any thing which does not savor strongly of his former occupation . In jails and almshouses , amid scenes of vice and crime , he is perfectly at home , and often paints with a master 's hand . He is more graphic and eloquent in describing the habits of the pigs that roam through the streets of New York , than in portraying the // more elevated manners and refined amusements of the Gothamites themselves . From Philadelphia , Mr. Dickens proceeded to Baltimore and Washington . In the former city his stay was brief . He simply enumerates its various public buildings in a single sentence , and then occupies four or five paragraphs in delineating " two curious cases " which were brought under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found the only hotel which afforded him perfect comfort and satisfaction , though there were many approximations to his beau ideal in other places . " The most comfortable of all the hotels of which I had any experience in the United States , and they were not a few , is Barnum 's , in that city ; where the English traveler will find curtains to his bed mark this ! for the first , and probably the last time , in America ; and where he will be likely to have enough water for washing himself , which is not at all a common case . " On reading this sentence we were strongly impressed with the idea , that Mr. Dickens was a physiological phenomenon , exhibiting in his own person the remarkable properties of the opposite magnetic poles ; for , while externally he manifested a very powerful attraction for water , internally he manifested a no less decided repulsion towards it ; and we afterwards find it a ground of complaint against two or three hotels , that they had nothing but water for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington , Mr. Dickens was particularly disgusted with the exuberant use of tobacco which he witnessed on all occasions . We heartily join him in his " counterblast " against the Stygian weed ; yet we apprehend , that his practice of frequenting the bar was no less disgusting to some of his fellow travelers , than the use of tobaccn on the part of others seems to have been to him . He could not go from New Haven to New York , without " exhausting the stock of bottled beer " on board the boat , and we believe that he even found a bar on board the little steamer between Springfield and Hartford . The habits of Mr. Dickens , in this respect , as our readers have already seen , need no inconsiderable reformation . The appearance of Washington , as it strikes the eye of a Londoner , is fkcetiously described ; though on the whole , he seems to have been in something of an ill humor while visiting the Federal city . " It is sometimes called the city of Magnificent Distances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Magnificent Intentions ; for it is only on taking a bird's-eye view of it from tho top of the Capitol , that one can at all comprehend the vast designs of its projector , an aspiring French roan . Spacious avenues , that begin in nothing , and Ic A no where ; streets , mile-long , that only want houses , roads , and inhabitants public buildings that need hut a public to he complete ; and ornaments of reat thoroughfares , which only lack great thoroughfares to ornament , are its leading features . One might fancy the season over , and most of the houses rone out of town for ever with their niasters . To the admirers of* cities it is a Barmecide feast ; a pleasant field for the imagination to rove in ; a monument raised to a deceased project , with not even a legible inscription to ness . " ecord its departed great- Our traveler was not very favorably impressed with the appearance of the House of Representatives , though he gives the Senate much credit for its dignity and decorum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little exaggerated , are in the main so pungent , and have so much truth in them , that we can not refrain from expressing the wish , that they might he read and pondered , not only by the members of Congress , but by all who have any thing to do with s*nding them there . Our author of course visited the President , and was well pleased with the republican simpli // city of the various domestic arrangements at the White House . He satirizes the bustle and parade of a presentation to her Majesty , by contrasting with it the easy and unceremonious introduction to the chief magistrate of the United States . He bears his testimony likewise , to the " decorum and propriety of behavior which prevailed " at the President 's levee , even " among the miscellaneous crowd in the ball , " thus showing , that there is a tendency in republican institutions to engender the feeling of selfrespect . From Washington , Mr. Dickens proceeded to Richmond , where his stay was short , and concerning which he has recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , with the luxurious and dissipated style of living which he saw , as the reader may judge from the following reminiscences . " It was between six and seven o'clock in the evening , when we drove to the hotel ; in front of which , and on the top of the broad flight of steps leading to the door , two or three citizens were balancing themselves on rocking chairs and smoking cigars . We found it a very large and elegant establishment , and were as well entertained as travelers need desire to be . The climate being a thirsty one , there was never , at any hour of the day , a scarcity of loungers in the spacious bar , or a cessation of the mixing of cool liquors : but they were a merrier people here , and had musical instruments playing to them o ' nights , which it was a treat to hear again . " From Richmond , Mr. Dickens returned to Baltimore , whence he pursued his journey by stage to Harrisburg . There ( being moved perhaps by considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy-right law was fast vanishing away ) he went on board a canal-boat for Pittsburg , in company with numerous emtgrants for the west , and of course received no very favorable impression , either of the comforts of this mode of traveling , or of American society as exhibited in his fellow travelers . Having left Harrisburg on Friday evening , he reached Pittsburg on Monday evening by dint of traveling on the Sabbath , and remained there three days , but he has hardly a word to say about the place . There is nothing worthy of remark in his account of the jour. ney by steamboat , from Pittsburg to Cincinnati , except the dissatisfaction which he expresses , because " at dinner there was nothing to drink upon the table , but great jugs full of cold water , " whilst at the same time he complains of the scantiness of the " washing apparatus , " thus again illustrating the theory of opposite poles . With Cincinnati he was particularly pleased . While there he had the privilege of seeing a temperance convention and parade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concourse , " though he felt little sympathy in its peculiar design . His description of Louisville , his next stopping place , comprises little more than an account of its superb hotel and of the rooting of swine in the streets . Thence he proceeded to St. Louis , where he remained long enough to make the discovery , that the city owes much to the influence of the Unitarian church , " which is represented there by a gentleman of great worth and excellence . " From St. Louis , he made an excursion to the Lookiwr Glass prairie , and then retraced his steps to Cincinnati . From Cincinnati , his course was to Canada , by way of Sandusky and the lakes . A scene described at one of the towns between Cincinnati and Columbus , may have been admired by some as an illustration of the writer 's talent for caricature . We copy a part of the concluding paragraph as another illustration of his love for brandy , and his dislike of any internal application of water . // 79 " We dine soon afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink but tea and coffee . As they are both very bad , and the water is worse , I ask for brandy , but it is a temperance hotel , and spirits are not to be had for love or money . This preposterous forcing of unpleasant drinks down the reluctant throats of travelers , is not at all uncommon in America , but I never discovered that the scruples of such wincing landlords induced them to preserve any unusually nice balance between the quality of their fare , and their scale of charges : on the contrary , I rather suspected them of diminishing the one and exalting the other , by way of recompense for the loss of their profit on the sale of spirituous liquors . After all , perhaps , the plainest course for persons of such tender consciences , would be a total abstinence from taverl.keepiu* . " From Sandusky , Mr. Dickens hastened by steamboat to Buffalo , and thence to Niagara Falls , where he remained two days-spending the time however , on the Canadian side . He was not probably aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls are presented from the American bank of the river . His reflections are worth quoting , as a specimen of his descriptive powers , hut as the book itself is in the hands of millions of readers , we need only refer to it . If Mr. Dickens had not been educated to the trade of making police reports , he might have been a poet . Mr. Dickens visited Toronto , Kingston , Montreal , Quebec , and St. John 's , neither of which places is described very minutely , but all of them more at length , and apparently with far more satisfaction , than any American cities of the same or even greater importance . He is more particular in describing scenery and location , and has far less fault than usual to find with the modes of conveyance , the provisions for refreshment and cornfort , and the manners of the people . All this is quite natural . In Canada he was on British ground . From St. John 's , our traveler reentered America by way of Lake Champlain , and proceeded imme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisure before embarking for England , he made a short excursion to West Point and New Lebanon . At New Lebanon , he suffered dreadfully by the miserable accommodations of the hotel , at which he would have slept had sleep been possible . On Tuesday , the seventh of June , Mr. Dickens embarked in the packet ship George Washington , for his native land . The chapter describing the passage home is pleasantly written , and contains some important suggestions respecting the shipping of emigrants . It is followed by a chapter on slavery , embodying some facts , but lamentably deficient in argument and force . The chapter was written for the English market , and would probably have been different , had the author 's scheme for an international copyright been successful . The last chapter of the work contains some general remarks on the prominent features of American society , but none of them betray an accurate or philosophic mind . The topics discussed are some of them important , but they are dismissed with a few hasty , disconnected observations . The writer censures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American people , condemns the general character of the newspaper press , laments the prevalence of the " real " to the exclusion of the " ideal , " complains of the deficiency of the organ of wit in the American cranium , and the want of that " lightness of heart and gaiety , " which abounds in " merry old England , " discusses " the prevalence of various forms of dissent , " and the tendency of republican institutions to engender the feeling of self-respect . The latter point is illustrated by the independent air of a boot-maker , who came to take his measure as he was enjoying his " book and wine-glass , " and with // this anecdote , followed with a brief dissertation on cleanliness and health , the " circulation " of " American Notes " is suddenly stopped-the said notes being found completely below par . We regret that Mr. Dickens has published these volumes , for they bear the marks of hasty composition , evince no genius , add nothing to the author 's reputation as a writer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. It remains that , in concluding this article , we present briefly the judgment which we have formed of Mr. Dickens as a writer . These Notes are by no means a favorable specimen of the talents of the author . They are very carelessly written , and the subject affords but little scope for the exercise of his peculiar powers . Mr. Dickens is unquestionably a man of genius . He possesses in a rare degree a talent for caricaturc ; yet it seems to be almost uniformly under the control of good nature , and is seldom exercised for a malicious purpose . His mind is continually on the alert for the ludicrous ; and the faculty to which he owes his greatest success , is a faculty for making exaggerated descriptions of laughable scenes and odd characters . It may be said of him , as Dryden said of " rare Ben Jonson , " that " humor is his proper sphere . " Such a sentence , we are axvare , would assign to him no very lofty nichc in the temple of Fame . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high as thc author of the Task . Yet in conformity with this estimate of the nature and rank of our author 's genius , we are much inclined to regard the " Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club , " as his chef d'wuvre . It is to the Pickwick Papers  --  a work of mere fun , for which the epithet comic is quite too dignified  --  a work having no aim but to make the public laugh , as laughter from the pit and galleries greets the broadest kind of farce-that Mr. Dickens oxves his chief renown . In that work , every character , every scene and incident , is in perfect harmony with the whole . Mr. Pickwick and his associates , Mrs. Leo Hunter and the elite of Eatanswill , the Wellers elder and junior , Mrs. Bardwell and her boy , the scenes of the election and those of the law-suit , are all of a piece ; and it is not to be wondered at , that with the aid of Cruikshank , ( whose " illustrations " are a great help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , and have furnished so much food for unmalicious merriment . The later works of Mr. Dickens are less exclusively humorous ; in fact , they deal not unfrequently in the stern and sad realities of life . But while they thus indicate another kind of talent , and show , as is often shown , that the broadest humor and the most resistless pathos may be nearly allied , they are deficient in respect to unity in the design and harmony in the effect ; and the render feels that a certain violence is done to truth and nature . The hero of the tale is commonly selected from the lower walks of life , perhaps is taken from the parish workhouse , and in spite of the most untoward circumstances , notwithstanding the baneful influences by which he is surrounded , without instruction or sympathy , deprived of the counsel and example of judicious parents and friends , perhaps even against the vicious example of those who gave him birth , he appears to the world a model of excellence , adorned with every virtue and grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare , however , are such instances of selfguardianship and promotion in real life , in fact so contrary are they to our experience , that however deeply we may be interested in the story of such a character , we can not at the same time resist the impression // that it-is altogether unnatural . This perfect character , so serious , consistent , and virtuous , this idealized representation of all that is admirable in human nature , is surrounded continually by the most grotesque figures conceivable-by mere distortions and caricatures of humanity , extravagant in their virtues , or hideous in their deformity  --  and yet passes through life without being in the least affected by their influence . Thus in the " Old Curiosity Shop , " little Nell , whose character is almost too lovely for earth , was trained up under the influence of a poor old man-her grandfather-shattered in intellect , addicted to gambling and theft , the bosom friend and then the victim of a hideous dwarf , whose character is even more deformed than his person . The grouping of such figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them , renders the whole picture unnatural , and even painful . One character  --  the center of the picture-is drawn and colored with ideal and even supernatural beauty , while every thing else upon the canvass is laughably or hideously grotesque . There is a remarkable similarity among the late productions of Mr. Dickens , which indicates a lack of invention . Oliver Twist , Nicholas Nickleby , and even little Nell , in their origin , education , adventures , and varied fortunes , in the class of society to which they belong , the characters by which they are surrounded , the scenes of vice and temptation into which they are thrown , in their fortitude under trials , their scrupulous adherence to those moral principles which are discarded by all around them , and in *ll the essential features of their history , have many striking points of resemblance . In the two former particularly , Mr. Dickens seems to have done like those preachers who sometimes give us the same sermon on different occasions , un der different texts , and in different covers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these later works exhibit , of a better and higher kind of genius than that which wrote the Papers of the Pickwick Club . However improbable or unnatural may be the structure of the story and the grouping of the characters , each character is generally life-like and well sustained . Some characters have a highly tragical effect . That of Fagin , for example , would hardly suffer by a comparison with Shylock . Of little Nell we have already intimated an opinion . Perhaps she might be ranked with such creations of genius as Desdemona . Her devotion to her aged grandfather , when the poor insane old man was driven from his home by the rapacious Quilp ; her clinging to him in all his wanderings , as , haunted by the fear that some one was pursuing him , he hurried from one village to another ; her self-denial , to procure for him the means of subsistence ; her anxiety to keep him from the gaming table , when the sight of cards at a village inn had rekindled his old passion so fiercely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her little purse the few pence which she had hoarded to buy him bread ; the quietness with which she endures privation , hunger , cold , and the neglect of the proud ; all these , with a thousand other evidences of a soul ennobled and mature , in the most delicate , flower-like frame , endear her to the heart , and engrave her image there in lines which can not be effaced . And when , weary and worn with her wanderings , she comes to die in that quiet village , where she had just found sympathy and friends , and is buried in that old church-yard , where she had loved to wander , we can not refrain from mingling our tears with those of the village children , who weep over the fresh sod that covers her . // Occasionally we find a sentence that is an almost perfect gem of poetic tenderness and beauty . For example , when the author brings his weary wanderers to a manufacturing town , where they obtain lodgings for the nigbt in an iron foundry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where the workman shares with theirt his scanty meal , makes a bed for them from his own rough apparel , and in the morning dismisses them with a pittance and his benediction . " He gave her two old , battered , smokeencrusted penny pieces . Who knows but that they shone as brightly in the eyes of angels , as golden gifts that have been chronicled on tombs ? " Their loneliness , as they stood one evenin in a crowded thoroughfare , entire strangers , with no prospect of a meal or bed , is thus depicted . " Feeling amidst the crowd a solitude which has no parallel but in the thirst of the shipwrecked mariner , who , tost to and fro upon the billows of a mighty ocean , his red eyes blinded by looking on the water which hems him in on every side , has not one drop to cool his burning tongue . " Mr. Dickens probably values himself ; as certainly he has been complimented by some critics , on the moral tendency of his writings . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by exciting sympathy with human sufferin * , and by increasing the reader 's detestation of vice and his admiration of goodness . But after all that may be said and conceded on this point , it remains a serious question , whether any human being was ever made better by reading such books as Oliver Twist or Barnaby iRudge . Books of mere amusement-books written to be sold , and the sale of which depends exclusively on their power to amuse thoughtless minds , and to while away the tedious hours of the indolent and the frivolous , are not likely to do much towards quickening the conscience of the reader , or leading him to recognize his moral nature and his relations to his Maker . Certainly , very little of this can be expected from the writings of a man so ignorant of that tree of life , the leaves of which are for the healing of the nations , as is the author now before us . We have heard the inference drawn from his writings , and especially from some passages in these American Notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend any Unitarian church in Boston ? Is there any evidence , that he attended any church any where in the United States , save in that one instance in which he visited " Father Taylor 's " sailors ' chapel , with a single eye to his own profession as a dealer in caricatures ? A Unitarian ! Why , Miss Sedgwick is a Unitarian , yet how much loftier is the moral tone of some of her works within a few years past , than that of any thing from the pen of this author . He compliments the Unitarians indeed , as we have seen , but not on account of their having a more accurate exposition of Christianity than other men . He speaks admiringly of the Boston . Transcendentalists , and says , that if he were a Bostonian , he would he a Transcendentalist ; ' but the great glory of Transcendentalism in his view , is its " hearty disgust of cant ; ' and he names its professors , not as expounders of Christianity , but as " a sect of philosophers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dickens is , not that he embraces this or that system of latitudinarian doctrine , but that all forms and schemes of religion , Unitarian or evangelical , Popish or Protestant , Christian , Mohammedan , or Pagan , are alike to him . Is he not one of the many whom England trains , under the shadow of her old cathedrals , in a deplorable ignorance of God and of Christ ? " Disgust of cant " is the profession of his faith . And what do such // men mean by " cant ? " To them , all fear of God-all the manifestations of a devout and serious temper-all talk of sin and repentance and forgiveness for Christ 's sake , and inward renovation by the grace of God-all endeavors to live soberly , righteously , and godly in this evil world , are " cant . " As is the man , such will be , on the whole , the influence of his writings . What sort of influence then may be expected from the writings of this author , of whose character the American Notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-natured man , loving to laugh and to see others merry , and cherishing a goodnatured sympathy for those neglected and wretched classes of the population of London , with whom his early life and his professional employments have made him well acquainted . His writings , accordingly , present to us the most attractive representations of that kind of virtue , which consists of good-natured dispositions , and the most picturesque descriptions of the vices and the miseries of those who groan , and die a lingering death , under the crushing structure of the English constitution of society . Of any other virtue than that which is made up of kind and generous natural impulses-of any other virtue than that phrenological goodness , which is analyzed into large benevolence , ' well developed conscientiousness , * large adhesiveness , ' moderate veneration , ' small acquisitiveness , * small destructiveness , " and such like elements of moral characterhis writings give no lesson . Of virtue , springing from godliness as its root-of virtue , strengthened by the fear of God and by the knowledge of God 's holiness-of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil ' - no reader would ever receive any image or conception , from such books as those of Dickens . Objections have sometimes been made to this literature of alnishouses and prisons , of pauperism and roguery , as necessarily tending to corruption of taste and of morals . We do not admit the force of such objections . On the contrary , we think that philanthropy may be grateful for any fair exhibition of the vices and the better qualities , the miseries and the whole existence , of the neglected and degraded portions of society ; and especially , when the exhibition is so managed by the hand of genius , as to make all feel that natural bond of brotherhood which connects the most privileged with the most degraded . It is so , for the most part , with the writings of this author . He often displays a generous sympathy with lowly wretchedness , which is not only creditable to his heart , but touches the heart of the reader . Take , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children with those of children who are compelled to toil in English manufactories . " Even the sun-burnt faces of gipsy children , half naked though they be , suggest a drop of comfort . It is a pleasant thing to see that the sun has been there ; to know that the air and light are on them every day ; to feel that they are children and lead children 's lives ; that if their pillows be damp , it is with the dews of heaven , and not with tears ; that the limbs of their girls are free , and that they are not crippled with distortions , imposing an unnatural and horrible penance upon their sex ; that their lives are spent from day to day , at least among the waving trees , and not in the midst of dreadful engines , which make young children old before they know what childhood is , and give them the exhaustion and infirmity of age , without , like age , the privilege to die . " But as often as we indulge the hope , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in // awakening an interest for the needy , the defenseless , and the oppressed , and by making the more fortunate and privileged feel , that even the most degraded partake in the better sensibilities and generous impulses of our common nature ; we are constrained to fear , that these writings will have , on the whole , no other influence on the public mind , than to excite merriment at the expense of those who are deserving of sympathy , and disgust at those , whose deformities , sufficiently re pulsive in themselves , are exaggerated by the distorting manner in which they are held up to view . Mr. Dickens has written much that is worthy of praise ; yet , we can not but lament the extensive circulation of his works , and their evident influence on society . At least one benefit of the international copyright law which he is so anxious to secure , would be , that it would prevent the republication of many of his productions , or limit their circulation to the judicious few . MIDNIGHT . THE moon now pours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the quiet lawn ; Earth 's thronging multitudes lie hushed in dreams , Weaving their plots to vanish with the dawn . The men , who yesterday were tossed with groans , Now travel some bright region far away ; Where golden palaces , and crystal thrones , Rise noiselessly , and noiselessly decay . The lonely captive held in dread suspense , The sailor musing o'er the " rushing helm , " Are lingering yet upon the shores of sense , Like sentinels to guard this dreamy realm . I 'll muse awhile , ere yet the clarion 's larm , Shall rouse the slumbering world , and break the silent charm.
