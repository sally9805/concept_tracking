Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : LETTER TO MABEL IN THE COUNTRY . from A letter about the lions ( 1849 ) You bid me set my fancy free , Oh ! loved and lovely Mabel ! And tell you all I hear and see In this bewildering Babel . But all I see and all I 'm told , Till night , from early morn here , I would n't tell for all the gold Unfound in California . It is a very wicked world , My guileless little cousin ! I know a belle whose hair is curled With love-notes by the dozen . I know a " blue " who buys boquets , And sends them to herself , dear ; And when her friends come in , they praise The love-gifts on the shelf , dear . I know a man who writes some stuff In praise of all his books  --  You ought to see him read the puffs , And how demure he looks ! I know a critic so refined He 'll read no book he praises , Lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know a painter  --  paints , to-day , A picture deeply shaded , And cracks the surface every way , To make it " worn and faded . " To-morrow comes the connoisseur , All pomp and proud precision , " Two thousand dollars "  --  no demur  --  He buys it for a Titian ! I know a Magazine , that shows A constellation cover , Of every " star " whom Genius knows In his blue Heaven a rover : But look within and you shall catch No ray of all that glory ; The love-tale there can never match The wondrous outside story . I know a poet , pale and thin , A scintillating sinner , Who still contrives to make a din , But scarce can make a dinner . But why thus waste my Helicon , When I might fill a canto With all the tidings of the tide That sets to Sacramento . I know an editor distressed To find the " root of evil ; " I know a printer that 's " possessed , "  --  At least he " hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fun , And some for gold or glory , And all have set their hearts upon This dear Dorado story . Now fades the gorgeous East afar , They read not Lane or Pardoe ; They talk no more of Choler , But only Colorado ! For other news , not much my line In fashion 's stream can fish up : There was a concert quite divine , By brilliant Anna Bishop . The minstrel-painter , " Doric Read , " Has been a book inditing ; His glowing tints are music-tones , His words are picture-writing . And our " May-Flower , " that put to sea , With pilgrim-faith undying , Triumphantly sails into port , With all her colors flying . The first has portraits of the " blues , " Not blue since he has crowned them ; A halo all " coleur de rose , " He kindly flings around them . And all the soul he did not draw  --  And he drew out his share  --  The engraver Pease by instinct saw , And boldly called up there . His graver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And makes us all  --  however odd  --  Not as we are , but would be . And Griswold , with his taste refined , And rare discrimination , Resets in purest , richest gold , The pearls of all the nation . Like Tennyson , he gives the world His " vision of  --  blue women , " And paints them with impartial pen , And critical acumen . See the dear Child of Love and Truth , Whose genius rich , bewildering , Keeps " Rainbows " in a diamond pen , And writes them out " for children . ' And she , whose fairy godmother , Gay Fancy , came to thrill her , Who sparkled in a " Golden Ball , "  --  Our radiant " Cinderella ! " Oh ! if this little shoe should fit , Come out , you hidden princess ! And take the throne of grace and wit , Your airy verse evinces ! And Grace , the glorious girl of girls , Whose wondrous eyes are shaded So softly by those truant curls , They must not be upbraided ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dash away , uncaring ! And chant , while wildly on you speed , Your lays of " Love and daring ! " Oh ! Edith May  --  thou fair , young ' fawn ! ' Was that thine own sweet story ? Oh , Alice Lee ! change ' Night ' for ' Morn , ' Change ' Memory ' for Hope 's glory ! Sweet Welby ! in your " Sea shell " sing And weave your spirit-spell ! Dear Hewitt ! sculpture cameos , From your melodious shell ! While Embury , like a zephyr , plays The " Eolian harp "  --  how sadly ! And graceful Fanny Forester Her bird-song warbles gladly . Macdonald summons rosy June , The late , but lovely comer , And rosy June has heard the tune , For all the page is Summer ! And those young sisters of the lyre , The tender , pure and airy , They ' re sunward larks , with wings of fire , Not " chickens "  --  " Mother Carey ! " And Sigourney , upon the sea Of verse our kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , By many a lovely islet . There is a book  --  you must not read  --  Although ' t is there the spice is , A very saucy book indeed , ' T is called " New York in Slices . " This cutter up of cities gives An Epicurean dinner , And carves some " blue birds , " wings and all , Most daintily  --  the sinner ! And there 's another out by Holmes , The pet of all the Muses ; And Lowell 's too , who gaily roams , In verse , where'er he chooses . Alas ! full many a name sublime , We 've idolized in story , Stretched on the rack of Lowell 's rhyme , Has lost its olden glory . Oakes-Smith , who sweeps her Sapphic lyre , As if a seraph fanned her , From out her sybil soul of fire , Has sent a " Salamander . " ' Twill burn the critics , if they touch Its wings , with malice snarly !  --  Who would n't buy a book , with such Delicious dreams by Darley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil rare can cater For all our tastes  --  nay , all our hearts ! Illustrious illustrator ! And Lynch , on leaves that shall not fade , Has written lines immortal ,  --  On laurel leaves , that crown the maid  --  Her passport at Fame 's portal . I heard a poem , weeks ago , I only wish ' t were printed , For Genius , with its heavenly glow , Each line of beauty tinted . A graceful flower of song was it , Found in a Field , not green , But rich in golden sheaves of wit , Where one sweet Ruth may glean . You 've often heard the Taylor-bird , The muse 's " mio caro , " Whose wings have waved on Alpine heights , Oh ! daring Bajadro ! Oh ! dream another " wayside dream ! " Or sing Bavaria 's daughters , Or tell how El Canalo flew , By " Tul 's icy " waters ! But where 's the Raven , who could sing , To thrill the rudest soul once , Who higher soared , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Brave Whittier takes an eagle flight , With fervent minstrel-fire , And o'er his land , Love 's halo-light Floats proudly from his lyre . And Longfellow still nobly writes , And Emerson speaks roses ; But Halleck hymns no " Fanny " now ! And Bryant mute reposes ! Yet Hirst ! be not that " Tilt " the " last " Of all thy splendid pageants ! And Whipple  --  flourish high thy whip ! Most true of satire 's agents ! And Wallace , breathe thy glowing soul , In words of thrilling rapture ! And Eastman , dip thy dainty pen , Some lady-bird to capture ! Some on the Jewsharp torture time , And some guitars are stringing , And some the organ play sublime , Our spirits heavenward winging ; Our " Sybil " sweeps her silver lute , And H  --  a trumpet 's tuning , But P  --  ' s wild harp too long is mute , Unless some lay he 's crooning . And Willis sleeps , with silken curls Upon his lyre and laurels , While Mapleson restrings his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But stay  --  my chain of radiant names A precious gem would lack , If I should not link thine with them , Oh ! bard of Frontenac . His starry flag has Hoffman furled ? He 's writing something , I think ; He 's left the Literary World  --  That World belongs to Duyckink ! Of painters  --  Page is busy still , With his pictorial wonders ; And Huntington , with heavenly skill , Alternates paints and ponders . The prudent ones at home remain , Nor would , from tranquil bliss , go ; But fearless Osgood 's off again , To merrier San Francisco . To Fame 's rare breeze , his canvas bright No more he gives undaunted ; By canvas , touched with heaven 's own light , By wilder winds , he 's haunted ! Last Friday , our Art-Union made Its annual distribution  --  I have a lovely scene by Ball , So Hope was no illusion . The " Voyage of Life , " by gifted Cole , Was called the prize , by courtesy ; But some would rather  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Astor Place the other night , There was an uproar petty : For Mr. Fry was trying to fright Rebellious Benedetti ! What taste , what skill , what genius rare , Our manager possesses , Since all the birds of song in air Fly tamely to his jesses ! One feast Apician tempts us all , For given by a true man ' t is ; Th ' enthusiast , Giles , at Clinton Hall Reads lectures on Cervantes . The children all are " Christmas-mad , " They start at every knocking , And wonder how Old Nick will come , And when he 'll stock their stocking ! Some people call our Christmas tree And all our fun ridiculous , But here 's a heart-warm health to thee , Oh ! quaint and kind St. Nicholas ! You 'd scorn , I fear , the folly here , You  --  with your healthy nurture ; Our belles are made of  --  batting , dear , Our souls  --  of gutta-percha ! Our beaux , who should our spirits raise , Can only raise moustaches ; Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And " cut "  --  not " sticks "  --  but " dashes . " The weather ? either bawl or rout , The gods of storm begin , " All hail ! " as in Macbeth without , While I am hale within . But at my door behold a form , A gay and half insane beau ! Who brings me sunshine through the storm , My unexpected rain-beau ! And so good night , my dark-eyed sprite , My peerless , fearless Mabel ! When will you fold your wings of light In our bewildering Babel ?
