Whittier , John Greenleaf , 1807-1892 : ERECT HE STANDS . from Erect he stands ( 1844 ) " Holding the principle that a citizen , so long as a single pulsation remains , is under an obligation to exert his utmost energies in the service of his country , whether in a private or public station , my friends may rest assured that in either condition I shall stand erect , with a spirit unconquered , while life endures , ready to second their exertions in the cause of Union and Liberty . " Henry Clay . Ay ! stand erect  --  the cloud is broken ; Above thee stands the rainbow 's token ; The shadow of thy onward way Is blending into perfect day ; The slanders of the venal train Assail thy honest name in vain ; For thou art still , as thou hast been , The hope of free and patriot men . Still boasts thy lip its fiery zeal , Thy heart its joy in human weal ; Still free thy tongue to soothe or warn , Still keen its fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , The loftier for its sense of wrong ; Still first in Freedom 's cause to stand , The Champion of her favorite land . Oh ! what to thee were pomp and show , Aught that thy Country can bestow ? Her highest gifts could only take New honors for their wearer 's sake ; They could not add a wreath to thine , Nor brighter make thy glory shine : No  --  meaner ones may borrow fame ; Thine lives through every change the same . The Grecian , as he feeds his flocks In Tempe 's vale , on Morea 's rocks , Or where the gleam of bright blue waters Is caught by Scio 's white-armed daughters , While dwelling on the dubious strife Which ushered in his Nation 's life , Shall mingle in his grateful lay Bozzaris with the name of Clay . Where blush the warm skies of the South O'er Cotopaxi 's fiery mouth , And round the fallen Incas ' graves The pampa rolls its breezy waves  --  The patriot in his council-hall , The soldier at his fortress-wall , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their prayer for thee . And where our own rude valleys smile , And temple-spire and lofty pile Crown , like the fashion of a dream , The slope of every fountain-stream  --  Where Industry and Plenty meet , Twin-brothers , in the crowded street  --  Each spire and mountain upward sent Shall be thy fitting monument . Still stand erect ! our hope and trust , When law is trampled in the dust  --  When o'er our fathers ' yet green graves The war-cry of Disunion raves , And sons of those who , side by side , Smote down the Lion-banner 's pride , Are girding for fraternal strife , For blow for blow , for life for life ! Let others rob the public store , To buy their ill-used power once more  --  Shrink back from Truth , and open wide The flood-gates of Corruption 's tide ; Thou standest in thy Country 's eye , Unshrinking from its scrutiny , And asking nothing but to show How far a patriot 's zeal can go . And those whose trust is fixed on thee  --  Unbought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an idol down , They scorn alike the bribe and frown ; And , asking no reward of gold For bartered faith , for honor sold , Seek , faithful to their hearths and home , Not Csar 's weal , but that of Rome !
