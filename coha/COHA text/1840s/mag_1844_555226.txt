txt NEARLY forty years ago , the Edinburgh Review , in an article upon a very imperfect edition of Dr. Franklin 's works , then just published in London , made the following remarks : - " Nothing , we think , can show more clearly the singular want of literary enterprise or activity in the States of America , than that no one has yet been found , in that flourishing republic , to collect and publish the works of their only philosopher . It is not even very creditable to the liberal curiosity of the English public , that there should have been no complete edition of the writings of Dr. Franklin till the year 1806 . " The grounds for this reproach were partly taken away , a few years afterwards , by the publication , in London , of William Temple Franklin 's edition of his grandfather 's works , immediately republished in America , which was tolerably complete , though it still left much to be desired . Not till the appearance of the magnificent edition now before us , can this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one whom , as a patriot , statesman , philosopher , writer , and moralist , she has so much reason to honor . It was fortunate , that the task of preparing this edition , which must supersede all others , fell into the hands of so competent a person as Mr. Sparks . He has executed the work with his usual judgment , diligence , and ability , bringing together all the materials that the most extensive research , both in Europe and America , could supply , and furnishing all the information necessary to explain or illustrate the text , without obtruding himself upon the reader 's attention by discursive and useless comments . It is not often , that the patient industry requisite for the completion // of such a task is united with the extensive information , the clear judgment , and the fine taste and tact , which are needed in order to make the best use of the materials , and to put them together in the most compact and serviceable form . We find a dozen able writers with more ease than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington and Franklin . 1'vlr . Sparks has given the best years of his life to the preparation of the long series of volumes , which give the full expression of the life , character , and services of the two persons whose names shed the brightest lustre upon the annals of our young country ; and he has reaped his reward by connecting his own reputation indissolubly with theirs . He has been , in some measure , the architect of a monument to their fame , and his own name is justly inscribed with theirs upon the base . The writings of Franklin , if not of such preeminent and abiding importance for the history of the country as those of Washington , possess a more varied interest than the latter , and offer a wider theme for inquiry and comment . He was eminent in so many different departments of thought and action , and his works relate to so great a variety of topics , that an edition of them requires a great range of illustration , and leads to numerous branches of collateral research . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar difficulties . Franklin had all the generous carelessness of a great mind respecting his own reputation . He wrote and labored for particular and immediate ends , and , if these were attained , he cared comparatively little for what his contemporaries or posterity might think of his own agency in the matter . He published anonymously many pamphlets and brief essays on political topics , always to effect some special object ,  --  to correct an erroneous impression , or to make an important statement of facts ; and he showed no anxiety about collecting or claiming them afterwards . If it had not been for the zeal of a few correspondents and friends , like Benjamin Vaughan , Peter Collinson , M. Dubourg , and others , many papers of great interest would either have been lost , or never have been ascribed to him as their author . Disputes whether he was the writer of some curious essays arose in his lifetime , which he cared not to settle ; and some questions of this sort remain yet undetermined , though the investigations of Mr. Sparks // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style was remarkable for ease , grace , and humor , and many of his letters are occupied with topics of great interest ; but he seldom kept copies of them , he never demanded them back from his correspondents , and the consequence is , that a great number of them are irretrievably lost . There was ample room , therefore , for the labors of an editor , not only in supplying proper elucidations of matter that had been already published , but in retrieving from obscurity and loss many valuable documents . The researches of Mr. Sparks have been as successful , as they were laborious and extensive . Among the miscellaneous works of Franklin , he has inserted twenty-five different articles written by him , most of them quite short , which have never before been printed ; and thirty-three others , which are not contained in any previous edition of his writings . He has also published two hundred and fiftythree of Franklin 's letters , which had not before appeared in print , and a hundred and fifty-four others not included in any former edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparks , in a small volume printed in 1833 , entitled " The Familiai Letters of Benjamin Franklin . " He has also inserted , in illustration of Franklin 's own writings , many letters addressed to him by his various correspondents , most of which are entirely new to the public . Among these are letters from David Hume , Dr. Priestley , Richard Price , Sir Joseph Banks , and many distinguished Americans . Considering that Franklin 's death took place more than half a century ago , that ever since his decease so much curiosity has been felt respecting every thing which he wrote , and that several collections of his miscellaneous writings have been made by those who , from their intimate relations with him , seemed most competent to obtain all the requisite materials , it is extraordinary that Mr. Sparks should have found so much new matter for this edition . There is great satisfaction in the use of this collection of Franklin 's works , arising from the confidence which we place in the care and fidelity of the editor , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century , the life of Franklin belongs to the history of his country ; and his writings during that period , apart from their individual and intrinsic merit , have an immediate bearing on // the most important events in the annals of America . He was a prominent actor in the great struggle of the Revolution , and contributed more largely , perhaps , than any other person , to its origin , its direction , and its success . In the agitating scenes of our colonial history , which immediately preceded this great event , he was a conspicuous agent , an active and zealous supporter of the rights and interests of the Colonies . It was the work of a historian , therefore , to write his life and to edit his works . Difficult questions have come up respecting some passages in his public career , and a regard for the truth of history , no less than for the character of the individual , requires that they should be fairly and fully considered . The diligence and success with which Mr. Sparks has studied our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every page of his previous publications . We not only feel sure , therefore , that the documentary evidence brought to hear upon any point is as full and satisfactory as can he had , but the mere opinion of the editor , when not supported by direct proof , is entitled to great weight . The negative testimony of Mr. Sparks , when he says that nothing can he found to support an alleged fact , is nearly conclusive ; for we are certain that the assertion is not lightly made , and what has escaped his researches may fairly be presumed not to exist . When he declares , for instance , that no evidence can he found to substantiate the grave charges and insinuations made against Dr. Franklin by Arthur Lee and others , we deem that his assertion amounts to positive proof that the criminations were calumnious and absurd . With respect to such an affair , also , as that of the " Hutchinson letters , " as they were called , though some mystery still hangs ahont it , we are assured , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all that at present can he ascertained respecting it . If more light he hereafter thrown upon the matter , it must come from sources which as yet are not accessible . This assurance rests not only upon our knowledge of the great extent and laborious character of the editor 's re* searches , but on our respect for the soundness of his judgment , the impartiality of his views , and his conscientious devotion to the cause of historical truth , He does not write in the manner of an essayist , intent only upon rhetori* // cal display , nor with the air of a partisan , blindly defending the cause which he has hastily espoused . His taste and his principles are equally repugnant to both these methods . Patient in his investigations , cautious in assertion , and candid in summing up the results of an inquiry , he leaves the reader not only satisfied with the conclusion on which his own mind has rested , but imbued with the highest respect for the qualities of mind and heart which he has displayed in arriving at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of truth is so evidently paramount to all other considerations , nor of any inquirer who possesses higher qualificalions for attaining the truth which he seeks . The life of Dr. Franklin , which fills one of these volumes , embraces the autobiography as far as he wrote it , and a continuation up to the time of his death by Mr. Sparks . The interest of the autobiography is almost exclusively personal ; that of the continuation is chiefly historical ; and the two together give as full a view as can be desired of his private and public career . The account of the first publication of Franklin 's memoir of himself is rather curious . He began to write it in 1771 , and , when he was minister from the United States to France , he showed a copy of it to some of his friends in Paris , one of whom , M. Le Veillard , translated it into French . Soon after Franklin 's death , this translation was published at Paris , and , after a time , was retranslated by some unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfect copy thus filtered through two languages is the one which has been generally circulated and read , having passed through numerous editions . More than a quarter of a century elapsed from the time of its appearance , before the original work was published by William Temple Franklin , from his grandfather 's manuscript . i'lr . Sparks has printed the genuine copy , illustrating it by notes , and dividing it into suitable chapters for the convenience of the reader . This work is one of the most fascinating autobiographies in English literature . There is a singular charm about it , attributable in some measure to the interest of the events and the graces of the style , but in a much higher degree to the frankness , simplicity , and completeness of the exhibition of the writer 's character . It is a book both for boys and men , - an admirable picture of the pursuit of knowledge , // fame , and fortune , under difficulties , and an instructive manifestation of the workings of character , which the philosopher and the moralist need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we first read it , and returned to its perusal again and again , with an interest not at all inferior to that with which every child hangs over the well thumbed pages of the standard juvenile books . Truth gradually assumes its superiority of interest over fiction , and the man returns with fresh delight to the Life of Franklin , ** when he has ceased to care much about " Robinson Crusoe , " or " The Pilgrim 's Progress . " Yet , perhaps , the book owes something of its attractiveness to the fact , that it possesses one of the most common and pleasing attributes of fiction , - that the story is carried out with what is called poetical justice . It shows the gradual , and what we instinctively consider the natural , triumph , in the affairs of this world , of those qualities of character , which we involuntarily love and respect , over those which reason and conscience alike require us to shrink from and condemn . Jn real life , casual and adverse circumstances interrupt , modify , and pervert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have recourse to fiction in order to find events that harmonize with the conclusions of our reason and the dictates of the moral sense . Sometimes , the reality points the moral quite as impressively as the poet or the novelist would have it ; and then fact assumes the interest of fiction , and we dwell upon the incident with a pleasure which shows that it is one of rare occurrence . Usually , because our observation does not take in a range of events of sufficient extent , or because all the rewards of meritorious conduct are not of a definite and outwardly visible character , the incidents of real life seem to run counter to our expectations and our moral judgments . Franklin wrote his memoirs in the manner of an old man having a number of his grandchildren about his knees , and telling them some pleasant story in order to enforce and illustrate his affectionate inculcation of virtuous and prudent conduct . The language is simple and graphic , the mcidents are natural , and the moral is most impressively taught , though never brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that industry , temperance , and frugality lead by gradual but sure steps to the attainment of // wealth and happiness ; while indolence , carelessness , and vice bring their own punishment along with them . The lesson is trite enough , and owes all its impressive character to the skill of the narrator , the minuteness with which the incidents are related , and the conviction of ' the reader that it is a true story . The writer keeps hack nothing ; he mentions his past errors and occasional lapses from virtue with the same delightful simplicity and frankness that mark the account of ' the more honorable portions of his life . And with what admirable distinctness and discrimination are the several characters in the little narrative brought forward , and made to play their several parts ! The sketches of the able and lively , but careless and dissolute , Ralph ; the idle printer , Keimer ; the promise-breaking governor , Keith ; and the rattling and imprudent George Webb , who ran away from the University of Oxford in order to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the admirable portraits in the " Vicar of Wakefield . " Indeed , the homely air of Franklin 's narrative , and the total want of reserve in speaking of his own weaknesses and his most private concerns , often remind one strongly of the worthy vicar . The incidents connected with both his courtships and his marriage , though of quite a delicate nature , are told with perfect simplicity and fulness , and without a word of apology or comment . He shows no sensitiveness , no secret pride , no artifice , no morbid reference to self . He writes the private history not only of his actions , but of his thoughts , with as much coolness as if he were describing a merely fictitious personage . In this respect , his autobiography is without a parallel in any language . The frankness of Rousseau 's " Confessions " is all assumed ; the writer is always acting a part , and is most theatrical when he affects to be most free from artifice . The simplicity of Franklin is that of a child ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of narration , whether in fiction or in real life , has a singular charm for all readers . It is the great secret of the most successful novelists , biographers , and historians . The reader often gladly leaves the stately and gloomy pages of Tacitus , wonderful as they are for sententious philosophy and eloquent invective , to take up the homely " long stories of the simple and garrulous Herodotus . The same quality // constitutes the unsurpassed excellence of Boswell in his department . Defoe and Richardson are indebted to it almost exclusively for their brilliant success . Miss Austen , - dear Miss Austen , - who never says a brilliant thing , nor paints a perfect character , - who is neither witty , nor passionate , nor eloquent , - is still minute , homelike , and true ; and by these qualities alone , she twines about the inmost fibres of her readers ' hearts . It is not easy to say why these qualities are so attractive . One reason , perhaps , may be traced ultimately to the instinctive love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the truth . Now , the only truth is the whole truth . The complete portrait is the only faithful portrait . The only true history or biography is that which tells all . The reality of such a narrative is the only one that is attested by our own experience , which necessarily comprehends the whole of our own thoughts , motives , and actions ; the slightest and most trivial , as well as the most important . The piecemeal exhibition of another 's life finds no counterpart in our own memories , which embrace every incident in our own career . It is no more a fair portraiture of the other 's character , than a few bricks are a fair specimen of a vast edifice . The simplest minds , therefore , when they wish to create an illusion , or to convince another of a fact , heap up as many details and trivial concomitant circumstances as possible , as vouchers of their veracity , though none of them have any logical connection with the main incident . Mrs. Quickly 's comic enumeration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her is a fair instance in point . In the case of children , the illusion created in this way is perfect ; and even grown persons may confess , that , if the stor*y of Robinson Crusoe is not true , it deserves to be . Franklin 's autobiography interests us , because it tells the whole story of his life , - his good and bad qualities , his failings and errors , and even those small vices which are more humiliating to confess than great sins . He showed the strength of a great mind by keeping nothing in reserve , - by writing with a view only to the effect which his memoirs would have on the formation of the lives and characters of others , and without any regard to the opinions of posterity respecting himself . This indifference about his own reputation - one of the most striking traits of his character - is // manifested by the point at which he left the personal narrative unfinished . He traces the history of the runaway printer 's apprentice down to the time when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had even risen to the dignity of a seat in the provincial legislature . He leaves it for others to write the memoirs of the distinguished statesman and philosopher , who commanded the attention and respect of the whole civilized world . Mr. Sparks has taken up the story , and told it to the end in a clear , full , and satisfactory manner . He has not attempted to write an essay on his genius and character , for , as he rightly observes , " in the biographical sketch , and particularly in his moral essays and correspondence , will be found a better representation of his character , and of what he accomplished , than the reader could hope to derive from any other source . " Yet it may be worth while , for the sake of gaining a connected view of the genius and services of so remarkable a man , and of contemplating one or two curious questions that are naturally suggested by them , to attempt a brief sketch of the leading traits in his character . The task is a difficult one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he became distinguished , and the variety of aspects under which his life must be contemplated . Still , his character was strongly marked , and a very unskilful limner can hardly fail to catch some of its prominent and striking features . One of the great secrets of his remarkable success in life may be found in the perfect mastery which he possessed over his appetites and passions . This was acquired in part , perhaps , being a natural effect of his practical philosophy ; but a great deal must be ascribed to original constitution . That he formed , early in life , a wise and prudent plan for the regulation of his future conduct , and almost always acted upon system and principle , was not at all extraordinary . Most young persons - at least , those who have their own way to make in the world - form such plans , and lay down wise principles to govern their subsequent career . The difficulty lies in acting up to them . Franklin succeeded in acting up to his , because he was exposed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those disturbing causes , which commonly mar the execution of the wisest purposes . From the evenness of his temper , the moderation of his aims , // and the tameness of his impulses and appetites , his excellent judgment was enabled to act without bias , and the schemes which he had formed with foresight and prudence were fully carried into effect . The lower part of his nature was kept in easy subjection to the higher , and rarely rebelled against it . As a boy , or a very young man , he was as shrewd and sagacious , as wary and calculating , as he appeared long afterwards , when he had become a gray-haired diplomatist . In boyhood , he abridged his meals , or lived upon a very simple diet , that he might save money and time for books and this he did , not so much from the love of reading , for he never was a great student of books , but because he cared very little about a good dinner . He showed , also , that his curiosity was stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an exclusively vegetable diet ; and by the reformation he brought about in the London printing-office where he worked , inducing many of the workmen to follow his example in giving up the use of strong beer for water-gruel . It is worth while to mention these circumstances , though trivial , when we remember that they occurred nearly a century before any one thought of the great Temperance reformation . The coolness of his temperament was also of great service to him in life , as it enabled him to avoid angry disputes and personal difficulties . No one was ever more everely tried in these respects . He was a prominent actor in the most agitating scenes in the history of Pennsylvania , and in the long struggle which terminated in the establishment of our national independence . He was exposed to the most violent abuse from his political opponents , and to insidious and repeated attacks from those who were embarked with him in the cause , and were his colleagues in office . But his placid temper was never ruffled into passion ; he allowed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sarcasm and invective without uttering a word in reply , and often disdained to notice the most serious calumnies that were brought against him . His imperturbability on such occasions provoked his opponents to redouble their attacks , and yet he never winced nor retaliated . His political correspondence is published at great length in these volumes , and it is curious to observe how free it is from acerbity of language , and from the stains of personal abuse . We do // not mean that he was destitute of feeling ; he resented the wrongs inflicted upon his country with great warmth and earnestness . But he despised private disputes , and was able easily to avoid them , not more from principle , than from the gentleness and placidity of his nature . Every one knows the story of Wedderburn 's outrageous attack upon him before the Privy Council , in regard to the affair of the Hutchinson letters . Dr. Franklin was present , and heard it all . In his own language , " he stood there , the butt of this invective ribaldry , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impropriety and indecency of treating a public messenger in so ignominious a manner . " The following are the accounts given by Dr. Priestley and Dr. Bancroft , who were also present , of Dr. Franklin 's demeanour on this occasion . " After waiting a short time , " says Dr. Priestley , " the door of the Privy Council opened , and we entered the first ; when Mr. Burke took his stand behind the first chair next to the president , and I behind that next to his . When the business was opened , it was sufficiently evident , from the speech of Mr. Wedderburn , who was counsel for the governor , that the real object of the court was to insult Dr. Franklin . All this time , he stood in a corner of the room , not far from me , without the least apparent emotion . " Mr. Dunning , who was the leading counsel on the part of the colony , was so hoarse , that he could hardly make himself heard ; and Mr. Lee , who was the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wedderburn had a complete triumph . At the sallies of his sarcastic wit , all the members of the Council , the president himself ( Lord Gower ) not excepted , frequently laughed outright . No person belonging to the Council behaved with decent gravity , except Lord North , who , coming late , took his stand behind the chair opposite to me . " When the business was over , Dr. Franklin , irj going out , took me by the hand in a manner that indicated some feeling . I soon followed him , and , going through the anteroom , saw Mr. Wedderburn there , surrounded by a circle of his friends and admirers . Being known to him , he stepped forward , as if to speak to me ; but I turned aside , and made what haste I could out of the place . " " Dr. Franklin did not stand in a corner of the room , ' " says Dr. Bancroft ; " he stood close to the fireplace , on that side // which was at the right hand of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which , though at some distance , the members of the Privy Council were seated at a table . I obtained a place on the opposite side of the fireplace , a little further from the fire ; hut Dr. Franklin 's face was directed towards me , and I had a full , uninterrupted view of it , and his person , during the whole time in which Mr. Wedderburn spoke . The Doctor was dressed in a full dress suit of spotted Manchester velvet , and stood conspicuously erect , without the smallest movement of any part of his body . The muscles of his face had been previously composed , so as to afford a placid , tranquil expression of countenance , and he did not suffer the slightest alteration of it to ap . pear durii*g the continuance of the speech , in which he was so harshly and improperly treated . . In short , to quote the words which he employed concerning himself on another occasion , he kept his countenance as immovable as if his features had been made of wood . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in Craven Street , at an early hour on Monday morning , and , immediately after the usual salutation , he put into my hands a letter , which had just been delivered to him . It was from the postmaster.general , and informed him , that the King had no further occasion for his ( Dr. Franklin 's ) services as deputy postmaster-general in America . " It is a fact , that he , as Dr. Priestley mentions , signed the treaties of commerce and eventual alliance with France , in the clothes which he had worn at the Cockpit , when the preceding transaction occurred . It had been intended , as you may recollect , that these treaties should be signed on the evening of Thursday , the 5th of February ; and when Dr. Franklin had dressed himself for the day , I observed that he wore the suit in question ; which I thought the more extraordinary , as it had been laid aside for many months . This I noticed to Mr. Deane ; and soon after , when a messenger came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French plenipotentiary , stating that he was so unwell , from a cold , that he wished to defer coming to Paris to sign the treaties , until the next evening , I said to Mr. Deane , Let us see whether the Doctor will wear the same suit of clothes to-morrow ; if he does , I shall suspect that he is influenced by a recollection of the treatment which he received at the Cockpit . ' The morrow came , and the same clothes were again worn , and the treaties signed . After which , these clothes were laid aside , and , so far as my knowledge extends , never worn afterwards . I once intimated to Dr. Franklin the suspicion which his wearing these clothes on that occasion had excited in my mind , when he smiled , without telling me whether 39 * // it was well or ill founded . I have heard him sometimes say , that he was not insensible to injuries , but that he never put himself to any trouble or inconvenience to retaliate. " - Works , Vol. iv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his colleagues , in which Dr. Franklin was involved , while he was a commissioner at Paris , we advert now for the purpose only of quoting , in illustration of this part of our subject , Mr. Sparks 's account of the manner in which he bore their attacks . " The imputations of these gentlemen , and of some others with whom they were allied in opinions and sympathy , reiterated in letters to members of Congress , would necessarily produce a strong impression , especially as Dr. Franklin took no pains whatever to vindicate himself , or to counteract the arts of his enemies . He was not ignorant of their proceedings . The sub . stance of their letters , which the writers seemed not to desire should be kept secret , was communicated to him by his friends . Relying on his character , and conscious of the rectitude of his course , he allowed them to waste their strength in using their own weapons , and never condescended to repel their charges or explain his conduct . " It is interesting to see in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artifices they employed to injure him . In writing to the Committee of Foreign Affairs , eighteen months after Mr. Lee and Mr. Izard began their opposition , he says : Congress have wisely enjoined the ministers in Europe to agree with one another . I had always resolved to have no quarrel , and have , therefore , made it a constant rule to answer no angry , affronting , or abusive letters , of which I have received many , and long ones , from Mr. Lee and Mr. Izard , who , I understand , and see indeed by the papers , have been writing liberally , or rather , illiberally , against me , to prevent , as one of them says here , any impressions my writings against them might occasion to their prejudice ; but I have never before mentioned them in any of my letters . ' " He writes in a similar tone , whenever he has occasion to allude to the subject , which rarely occurs , except when his attention is called to it by his correspondents . At a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says to Mr. Hopkiason : As to the friends and enemies you just mention , I have hitherto , thanks to God , had plenty of the former kind ; they have been my treasure ; and it has , perhaps , been no disadvantage to // me , that I have had a few of the latter . They serve to put us upon correcting the faults we have , and avoiding those we are in danger of having . They counteract the mischiefs flattery might do us , and their malicious attacks make our friends more zealous in serving us and promoting our interest . At present , I do not know more than two such enemies that I enjoy . I deserved the enmity of the latter , because I might have avoided it by paying him a compliment , which I neglected . That of the former I owe to the people of France , who happened to respect me too much and him too little ; which I could bear , and he could not . They are unhappy , that they can not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I should be so , if my friends did not love me much more than those gentlemen can pcssibly love one another . ' * ' - Lifr , pp. 452 - 454 . Franklin 's indifference respecting his own literary and scientific reputation , to which we have already alluded , is another illustration , quite as striking as the former , of the moderation of his desires , and the firm sovereignty of his reason over his passions . He was not insensible to the progress of his fame ; far from it . He must have been more or less than man , if he had cared nothing , for instance , about the spontaneous burst of homage with which he was received at Paris , whither his reputation as a patriot and a philosopher bad preceded him . The higher circles of Parisian society at that day were fond of excitement on the arrival of a distinguished stranger , and heaped their flatteries upon him with a profusion that resembled a civic triumph , but with a grace and delicacy that were peculiarly French . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin in some points of genius and temperament , visited them at about the same period , and was received with an eagerness of respect and adulation , and a crowd of honors , which appeared fairly to bewilder him . The octogenarian Voltaire came also , after a long absence , and was greeted with an ovation so extravagant and uproarious , that it caused his death . Franklin came , and they seemed disposed to kill him also with kindness . His exterior was venerable and striking ; he was the representative of a popular cause , the patriot statesman of a new world ; and his scientific reputation was supported by one of the most brilliant discoveries of modern times . No honors were too great , no flatteries were too extravagant , for the distinguished visiter . Politicians and people of fashion , learned societies // and the mob , vied with each other in doing him homage . Pictures , busts , and prints of him were multiplied , and sold in extraordinary numbers . Medallions were made , on which his head was represented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rings . Turgot affixed to his portrait that sublime inscription , which so happily and tersely expresses his most brilliant claims to admiration and respect : - " Eripuit ccelo fulmen , sceptrumque tyrannis . " The French historian , Lacretelle , gives the following striking account of his reception and influence in France . " By the effect which Franklin produced in France , one might say that he fulfilled his mission , not with a court , but with a free people . Diplomatic etiquette did not permit him often to hold interviews with the ministers , but he associated with all the distinguished personages , who directed public opinion . Men imagined they saw in him a sage of antiquity , come back to give austere lessons and generous examples to the moderns . They personified in him the republic , of which he was the representative and the legislator . They regarded his virtues as those of his countrymen , and even judged of their physiognomy by the imposing and serene traits of his own . Happy was he , who could gain admittance to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venerable old man , it was said , joined to the demeanour of Phocion the spirit of Socrates . Courtiers were struck with his native dignity , and discovered in him the profound statesman . Young officers , impatient to signalize themselves in another hemisphere , came to interrogate him respecting the military condition of the Americans ; and , when he spoke to them with deep concern and a manly frankness of the recent defeats , which had put his country in jeopardy , this only excited in them a more ardent desire to join and assist the republican soldiers . After this picture , it would be useless to trace the history of Franklin 's negotiations with the court of France . His virtues and his renown negotiated for him ; and , before the second year of his mission had expired , no one conceived it possible to refuse fleets and an army to the compatriots of Franklin . " - * pp. 420 , 421 . Franklin received these unexpected honors with simplicity and composure , and made use of his great popularity only to further the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applause , and he knew how to value it . In his private letters , // he makes but slight allusion to the many civilities that were tendered him , and amused himself with describing the queer contrast which his long gray hairs , covered with a formidable fur cap that reached nearly down to his eyebrows , offered to the powdered heads which were grouped around him at Paris . By his tact , his good-nature , and his power of humorous and lively conversation , he preserved this extraordinary influence with all classes of the people ; and the treaty of alliance with France , which was decisive of the success of the Americans in the contest , was brought about at so early a period by no other cause so much as by the personal reputation of Franklin as the negotiator . " On the 20th of March , the American commissioners were introduced to the King at Versailles , and they took their place at court as the representatives of an independent power . A French historian , describing this ceremony , says of Franklin : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and individuals from various countries , whom curiosity had drawn together . His age , his venerable aspect , the simplicity of his dress , every thing fortunate and remarkable in the life of this American , contributed to excite public attention . The clapping of hands and other expressions of joy indicated that warmth of enthusiasm , which the French are more susceptible of than any other people , and the charm of which is enhanced to the object of it by their politeness and agreeable manners . After this audience , he crossed the court on his way to the office of the minister of foreign affairs . The multitude waited for him in the passage , and greeted him with their acclamations . He met with a similar reception wherever he appeared in Paris . ' * - Life , pp. 436 , 437 . Not less favorable to his scientific pursuits , than to his success as a diplomatist , was Franklin 's generous disregard of his own fame and standing in the eyes of the public . A lively curiosity , an eye quick at observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts and the bearings of experiments , and a mind of incessant and intense activity , were the means that enabled him to achieve so much in science . His attention was not diverted from the object of investigation by any regard for what the world might think of the importance of that object , or of his own merit in obtaining it . The necessary experiments were instituted , not in order to convince others , but to satisfy himself . The // most brilliant results at which he arrived were communicated only in private letters to a few friends , to whom he left the care of publishing them or not , as they saw fit . His theories sat loosely upon him , and he modified or abandoned them , when further observations made it necessary , without care about the charge of inconsistency , and without shame at confessing a mistake . He was never seduced , by the accidental brilliancy or novelty of one object of inquiry , to pay more attention to it than to another , apparently of a more homely character , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . He studied the means of remedying smoky chimneys with as much ardor and industry as he showed in penetrating the secrets of the clouds , and robbing the thunderbolt of its terrors . He was as much gratified by the invention of a new stove , as by that of the lightning-rod . He formed theories of the earth , and projects for cleaning and lighting the streets of Philadelphia , with equal zeal ; and having communicated the former in a private letter to a friend , and nrged upon his fellow-citizens the adoption of the latter , he dismissed both from his mind , and pursued with fresh interest a wholly diferent set of investigations . Franklin carried his disinterestedness so far , and at a period in his lifeRwhen he had as yet accumulated but a small fortune , that he refused to take out a patent for his inventions , acting on the principle , which , he says , " has always weighed with me on such occasion* ; viz. That , as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any invention of ours ; and this we should do freely and generously . " Governoi* Thomas offered him a patent for his newly invented " Pennsylvania fireplace , " or , as it was afterwards called , the " Franklin stove . " He refused it , and , giving the model to a friend in Philadelphia , wrote a pamphlet describing its advantages , and it was introduced into general use . An ironmonger in London obtained a copy of this pamphlet , and , having made some insignificant changes in the machine , took out a patent for it , and acquired a small fortune by its sale . Franklin says , that this was not the only instance of patents taken out for his inventions , " which I never contested , as having no desire of profiting by patents myself , and hating disputes . " His papers on electricity , it is said , were refused a place among the Transactions of the Royal Society of London . // We are not sure , that this was the case ; hut it is certain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he had no agency whatever in bringing them at last before the public . His friend Collinson collected them , and gave them to Cave , for publication in the " Gentleman 's iVlagazine . " It was finally decided , that they should he published separately , and Dr. Fothergill wrote the preface . An extract from this preface shows in such a striking manner Franklin 's indifference ahout the fate of these papers , the appearance of which marked one of the most important epochs in the history of modern science , that we place it before our readers . " It may be necessary to acquaint the reader , that the follow . ing observations and experiments were not drawn up with a view to their being made public , but were communicated at different times , and most of them in letters , written on various tepics , as matters only of private amusement . " But some persons , to whom they were read , and who had themselves been conversant in electrical disquisitions , were of opinion , they contained so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be doing a kind of injustice to the public , to confine them solely to the limits of a private acquaintance . " The editor was therefore prevailed upon to commit such extracts of letters and other detached pieces as were in his hands to the press , without waiting for the ingenious author 's permission so to do ; and this was done with the less hesitation , as it was apprehended the author 's engagements in other affairs would scarce afford him leisure to give the public his reflections and experiments on the subject , finished with that care and precision , of which the treatise before us shows he is alike studious and capable . " - Works , Vol. v. p. 179 . We have dwelt at some length on this forgetfulness of self , and carelessness about his own fame in the matter , when the great object in view was once obtained , as one of the remarkable traits in Franklin 's character , because it seems to us to account in some degree for the prosperity of his career , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinterestedness is not a common virtue among scholars and men of science at the present day ; and the want of it seems to be one great reason why , with such enlarged means , such general diffusion of knowledge , and such a multitude of laborers in every department , so little that is really great and useful is // accomplished . We have much of the machinery of progress . We have observatories , and scientific associations , and expeditions of discovery , and premiums , and diplomas , and the countenance of crowned heads , and the sympathy of the public . But the results are little more than a heap of rash theories and imperfectly observed facts , and a multitude of petty squabbles about the authorship of petty discoveries . The truth is. , most o&amp;the agents in the work care much more for their own reputation than they do for the interests of science ; and this complex and noisy machinery is a mere contrivance for sounding their own praise , and for catching the applause of the multitude . Admission to a learned society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way for increased effort with enlarged means . It is sought as a reward , and not as an instrument . For , after all , great discoveries are not effected on partnership principles , and jointstock companies are very inefficient laborers in the cause of science . The work must be done by individual effort , sustained and cheered only by hearty interest in the cause . Men may achieve an ephemeral reputation by labors directed with a view only to this reward ; but great truths can be discovered , promulgated , or enforced , and the boundaries of knowledge can be enlarged , only by self-sacrifice and disinterested toil . was the case in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , when the secrets of nature were explored with so much daring and success by a few illustrious men . Galileo , and Kepler , and Tycho Brahe labored alone , or comparatively alone , in a community among whom there were few to appreciate , and none to reward them . Privation and hardship , imprisonment and banishment , formed their only guerdon in their own age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame was their final reward . We now build upon a larger basis , but the work of erection goes on all the slower . The progress is by no means commensurate with the number of hands employed , or with the quantity of materials which the labor of centuries has accumulated for their use . The reward is immediate and certain ; the applause of the public is readily bestowed for small efforts and doubtful results . And the consequence is , that the workmen look only to that reward , and not to the completion of the edifice . The industry , which might be excited by difficulties , by the want // of means and of sympathy , is superseded and extinguished by the ease with which fame and fortune fall into the lap , and the whole struggle becomes a mercenary one , - a squabble between rivals for the honor of the thing , instead of a contest among workmen for superiority in the labo ' achieved . Men think less about the mode of making the discovery , than about the manner of publishing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are led to guard themselves against attack by a paltry accuracy in details , instead of a bold and comprehensive investigation of principles . A system of reciprocal pufflng is contrived , and the fellows of learned and scientific associations appear as members of what has been happily called " a mutual adulation society . " One of the latest contrivances for the advancement of science in England is a grand travelling association , holding annual festivals in different parts of the country , at which noblemen deign to preside , and grave doctors and savans lecture in crowded theatres , upon subjects of which their vast auditory hardly understand a syllable . In regard to the meagre results obtained by such machinery , we may well look back with pride upon the signal services and pure fame of the humble , self-taught , and disinterested American mechanic . The splendor of Franklin 's discoveries as an electrician has rather cast into the shade his services in other branches of science . It was long ago remarked of the former , that they were not more valuable for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method , or in what may be called the logic of discovery . The close filiation of the principles and experiments , the sagacity with which the former are inferred , and the ingenuity with which the latter are contrived , the precision of the views , and the clearness with which the processes are narrated , all supply an admirable illustration of the Baconian method reduced to practice . But as the happiest specimen of these qualities , we know not that it is so proper to refer to the " Letters on Electricity , " as to the papers on the more humble subjects of smoky chimneys , Pennsylvania fireplaces , and the theory of winds and waterspouts . A child may read and understand these , and the philosopher may recur to them for a lesson in humility of purpose , and in the true science of observation and experiment . Playfair justly remarked , that the observations on chimneys , and the mode of warming // apartments , " are infinitely more original , concise , and scientific , than those of Count Rumford " ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now almost universally reduced to practice . The same distinguished and competent critic remarked , that , in these papers , " the most ingenious and profound explanations are suggested , as if they were the most natural and obvious way of accounting for the phenomena ; and the author seems to value himself so little on his most important discoveries , that it is necessary to compare him with others , before we can form a just notion of his merits . " The great extent and diversified character of Franklin 's scientific researches afford a striking proof of the incessant activity of his mind , when we consider that he had his own way to make in the world , that he labored long as a printer , and that a large portion of his life was absorbed by political occupations . Besides the subjects already enumerated , we find papers detailing observations , experiments , and speculations , many of them very ingenious and valuable , on meteorology , improvements in navigation , the art of swimming , stilling waves by oil , the theory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments , cold produced by evaporation , the causes of the Gulf Stream , and a multitude of other topics , which he discusses with great ardor and diligence , and without the slightest pretension . Having great quickness of vision and perception , and an inquiring habit of mind , the operations of nature afforded him a constant theme for study , and the most insignificant of them elicited original thought . The frankness and humility with which he communicated his views to others arose from his neglect of all motives , except the gratification of his curiosity , and the discovery of truth . He seems to imagine , that all his correspondents are as deeply interested in these subjects as himself , and are ready to aid him by their researches . A letter from Mr. Logan , written in 1750 , before Franklin was much known , gives an amusing view of his astonishing activity of intellect . " Our Benjamin Franklin , " writes Mr. Logan , " is certainly an extraordinary man ; one of a singular good judgment , but of equal modesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for want of other employment , while he sat idle , he took it into his head to think of magical squares , in which he outdid Frenicle himself , // who published above eighty pages in folio on that subject alone . " Franklin 's own mention of these arithmetical amusements of his is quite as characteristic of another trait in his disposition : - " The magical squares , how wonderful soever they may seem , are what I can not value myself upon , but am rather ashamed to have it known I have spent any part of my timd in an employment that can not possibly be of use to myself or others . " The mass of scientific papers , on a great variety of topics , which Franklin threw off with so much ease and readiness , taking no care for their preservation , has proved a fruitful mine of hints to subsequent inquirers in the formation of their theories , and for the guidance of their researches . His pregnant observation of the fact , never before noticed , that the northeast storms along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind , together with his speculations on the cause of this phenomenon , is the basis of some of the most important discoveries of our own day in meteorology . In a recent article upon Redfield 's and Espy 's theories of storms , * we pointed out the manner in which their speculations were based upon this important fact . The science of geology can hardly be said to have been in being in Franklin 's time . Yet , as if nothing could escape his sagacity , we find , in some speculations of his respecting the theory of the earth , - which he deemed of so little importance , that he apologized to the correspondent to whom he communicated them , for allowing himself to wander in such fanciful reveries , - distinct indications of views which have since been expanded and worked up into far reaching systems , by our most eminent men of science . One instance we will place before our readers , most of whom are probably familiar with the ingenious and beautiful theory of earthquakes , that has recently been propounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The germ of this theory , we believe , may be found in the following extract from a letter of Franklin 's to the Abb6 Soulavie . He has just been speaking of his hypothesis , that the interior of the earth is filled with a dense fluid , and that , as the fluid of magnetism probably exists in all space , by its influence our globe has become a particular magnet , with its poles pointing // constantly in the same direction . He goes on to speculate as follows . " The globe being now become a perfect magnet , we are , perhaps , safe from any change of its axis . But we are still subject to the accidents on the surface , which are occasioned by a wave in the internal ponderous fluid ; and such a wave is producible by the sudden violent explosion you mention , happening from the junction of water and fire under the earth , which not only lifts the incumbent earth that is over the explosion , but , impressing with the same force the fluid under it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifting , arid thereby shaking , successively , all the countries under which it passes . I know not whether I have expressed myself so clearly , as not to get out of your sight in these reveries . If they occasion any new inquiries , and produce a better hypothesis , they will not be quite useless . " - Works , Vol. vi . pp. 446 , 447 . Franklin nowhere appears to greater advantage , or as deserving of higher praise , than in his labors as a philanthropist . The plain good sense and practical character of his schemes made it easy to carry them into effect , and he labored indefatigably for their success . He was never led astray by sentiment , nor blind enthusiasm , nor a false estimate of the comparative dignity and elevation of the plans by which any good was to be done to his fellow-men . The standard of utility was the only test that he applied to the schemes for ameliorating the condition of any portion of the human race ; and he left it to others to preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he gave his whole attention to effecting the object . No plan was too humble , no means were too laborious , if there was a reasonable prospect of accomplishing a good . He was quite as ready to suggest and execute projects for the greater convenience of his fellow-citizens in Philadelphia , - to establish , for instance , a new city watch , or a fire company , or a law for sweeping the sidewalks* - as to do his part in a society for the relief and instruction of indigent German emigrants , or in providing means of defence in the Spanish war . His adopted city owes nearly as much gratitude to him , as to its illustrious founder ; a man who , in many honorable traits of character , bore a striking resemblance to Franklin . In moral sentiment and active philanthropy , in plainness of manner and real elevation of mind , in sagacious foresight and practical wis // dom , the patriot sage of a later day loses nothing by comparison with William Penn ; while , in point of genius and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most useful and flourishing institutions which exist in Philadelphia at the present day , the city is indebted to the wisdom and benevolence of Franklin . Tf he Library Company , the Pennsylvania Hospital , and the University were projected and established by him , and owe all their subsequent success to his watchful care over their infancy . They form a splendid and enduring monument to his fame , and may alleviate the disappointment of the stranger , who finds , in the cemetery of Christ Church , that only a plain marble slab covers his grave . That no greater honors have been paid to his memory by the city which was made illustrious by his residence , and which has profited so largely by his philanthropy , must be ascribed to the fact , that , even after the lapse of almost a century , the jealousies and heartburnings created by a portion of Franklin 's political career have not yet entirely died out . Among the earlier contests which at length converged and produced the Revolution , was the division of parties in Pennsylvania between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heirs of William Penn , and the body of the inhabitants . Franklin , whose sympathies were always in favor of popular rights , took sides with the multitude , and his talents and influence had a decisive effect in the contest . He thus incurred the bitter and unremitting hostility of a large , and , in many points , a very respectable party , whose descendants have inherited a portion of their prejudices , and still look with no friendly eye upon his reputation . Without going at all into the merits of the original dispute , though our opinion is decidedly in favor of the equity of the cause which he espoused , we may still suggest , that to cherish the remains of such prejudices at the present day , in the face of Franklin 's preeminent services and exalted fame , is to do injury only to the persons whose breasts can harbour such disgraceful feelings . A monument should be erected to his memory in that city , if for no other purpose than to show , that its inhabitants have buried the recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting Franklin 's character as a moralist is more difficult than any which we have yet considered . 40* // The individuality of the man , the striking and peculiar traits of his disposition , are most clearly seen under the moral aspect of his life and writings . His " Poor Richard " is the most original and characteristic of all his productions . It supplies the key to his autobiography ; its spirit pervades all his publications ; it furnishes the explanation of his career as a patriot , a philosopher , and a philanthropist ; it was acted out through his whole life . Whatever may be thought of the doctrine it teaches , its merits and originality as a work of genius can not be denied . Few works have been more widely popular , or have been productive of such extensive and permanent effects . It was eminently calculated for the immense circulation among common readers which it almost immediately obtained . Drawn up chiefly in the form of homely proverbs , unequalled for humor , for pithy and terse expression , and for direct application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to wealth and happiness , it became the manual of every aspiring tradesman and mechanic , and the indirect means , as the maxims were repeated from mouth to mouth , of shaping the character of many who never saw it in print . The scheme of the wise man for modelling the minds and determining the destiny of a whole people , by writing its ballads rather than its laws , was surpassed by the genius of the Philadelphia printer , who made a collection of proverbs for his countrymen , and formed the national character . We include under the general nam* of " Poor Richard " the whole body of prudential maxims that first appeared in the almanac of that name , which was projected , edited , and published by Franklin for many years . Most of them were collected some time afterwards , and published separately , under the title of " The Way to Wealth " ; and this was the work which underwent so many translations in Europe , and obtained so great circulation and celebrity there . It has appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other essays on moral and religious subjects and the economy of life , it presents a full view of what may be called the Franklinian morality . The whole should be viewed in connection with that very homely scheme of moral reformation , mentioned in the autobiography , where the principal virtues and the days of the week appear arranged in the form of a multiplication table , the object being to perfect // the character by keeping an exact record of daily transgressions . There is not much sentiment or enthusiasm in such a scheme . It is plain even to coarseness ; it is humble almost to meanness . it is the essence of worldly wisdom , the bible of prudent conduct . The whole is a lesson given by a shrewd and sagacious old man , of benevolent impulses and even a warm heart , wary but upright , prudent but philanthropic , self-seeking but just ,  --  a lesson given to the young mechanics and traders among his countrymen , impressing upon them the importance of integrity , industry , sobriety , and economy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the true manual of utilitarianism ; Jeremy Bentham only borrowed and marred it . Though we may wish that it were animated with a stronger and loftier feeling , that it set forth nobler aims , that it breathed more of an earnest Christian spirit , we can not deny its admirable adaptation to the purpose which the author had in view . The motives proposed were by no means the highest , but they were effective for the classes whom they were designed to influence . The homely and good-natured tone , the playful illustrations , the clear and pointed style , and the good sense and obvious earnestness of the writer , make these essays models of popular exhortation . The mind which would pronounce them vulgar is vitiated by sickly refinement . There is nothing vulgar in the attempt , however prosecuted , to make large bodies of men more honest and intelligent , more economical , sober , and industrious . It is proper to try these essays only by an ethical standard . Whatever may have been the religious opinions of Franklin , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to give prudential advice to his countrymen . Certainly there is nothing in these essays , which is offensive to Christianity , or which directly militates with its spirit . They form a practical system of utilitarian ethics . To say that this system is vastly inferior to the morality of the gospel is not at all to the purpose ; as much as this must be admitted of every scheme of morals , in which the subject is viewed only by the light of nature and conscience . The ethical doctrines of Franklin must be compared with the speculations of Socrates and Cicero , of Hobbes and Hume , of Paley and Bentham , and not with the teachings of the Saviour . And // here it may be as well to remark of his religious belief , that it contained a recognition of all the truths of natural religion , including the doctrines of immortality and a future retribution , and , so far as we can perceive , a faith in the divine mission of the Saviour . It coincided in most respects with the opinions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not as solemn and earnest a thing with him as with many of that sect , the misfortune must be ascribed in part to the coldness of his temperament . Utility may be considered both as a test , and as a motive , or cause , in ethics . To say that all virtuous actions are also useful , and , therefore , that utility is often a very convenient critenon whereby to distinguish right from wrong , is quite a different thing from saying , that actions are right because they are useful , and , consequently , that utility is the very essence of virtue . No one denies the former proposition , or the propriety of adopting it as a guide to conduct , unle*s he be one of those blind enthusiasts , who repudiate all regard to consequences , and adopt the fanatical maxim , that we must act from moral impulse alone , and leave the results with God . The proper answer to such persons is , that , in morals , the act and its consequences are one , and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deed which will ultimately be injurious to others is as wrong as that which does immediate harm ; and reason is given to us that we may take care of the future , as well as of the present . So far , therefore , as Poor Richard shows the intimate connection between virtue and well-being , so far as he proves that to be honest and true is the best mode of becoming wealthy and happy , he is a sound moralist . Nor will any great objection be made to his doctrine , if he holds up this fact as one of the inducements to virtuous conduct . The theory of religion , no less than of pure ethics , sanctions an appeal to man 's instinctive desire of future happiness , as a motive and an incitement to an upright and holy life . This is but a preparatory step , it is true ; for that virtue is imperfect , is even mean and grovelling , which is not practised for its own sake . That beautiful law of our mental constitution , which accounts for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affords a means for the purification of the motive , and for a passage from the selfish to the disinterested stage // of moral progress . The process is a simple one , being merely a transference of the affections from the end to the means . By the association of ideas , that which was at first loved or practised only as an instrument , becomes the leading idea and the chief object of pursuit . Thus , in the downward course , money , which is at first desired only as a means of gratifying the appetites , or of answering still higher ends , becomes itself " an appetite and a passion , " and the habit and the vice of avarice are formed . And so , in our upward progress , the honesty , which was first practised only because it was " the best policy , " the worship of God , which was first paid only as the price of heaven , become at last the unbought and unselfish homage of the soul to uprightness , holiness , and truth . Virtue deserves its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a fixed habit ; for then only is it freed from the stain of selfishness . The terrors of the law are proclaimed to the sinner only that he may be able to overcome the first shock of the transition from sin to holiness ; its promises are reserved for those only who , by patient continuance in well-doing , bave become alike indifferent to the debasing fear and the debasing hope . Only through the process which we have bere attempted to explain can we account for the fact , that Franklin , after undergoing a full course of " Poor Richard " morality , be came a strictly pure , upright , and benevolent man . The virtues which he cultivated and recommended because they tended to promote success in life , he came at last to love and practise for their own sake . His integrity few will venture to question ; and he was a philanthropist in the broadest and most honorable meaning of the term , seeking the good of his fellow-men by methods which did as much honor to his intellect as to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most sensible and judicious in adapting his precepts and plans of improvement to the circumstances and characters of those whom he addressed . It is idle to lament his want of sentiment and enthusiasm , his low and practical views of life , his appeals to humble and even selfish motives . He understood the disposition and temperament of the people for whom he wrote and labored , and aimed to influence their conduct by the means which were most likely to produce an immediate effect . He possessed in an eminent degree that shrewdness and knowledge of human nature , for // which the natives of New England are proverbial , and which the great circulation of his writings has unquestionably done much to sharpen and increase . He delighted in the use of simple and innocent artifices , by which to convert men to his purpose , and , as it were , to cheat them into doing good to themselves ; and he describes the success of these little stratagems with great humor and delight . The account given in the autobiography , of the manner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and the welfare of the inhabitants , is an amusing and instructive sketch , and quite as characteristic as any thing in the work . He knew that men , taken in the mass , must often be treated like children , must be coaxed and allured into doing what is for their own good , must be trained by gocarts and leading-strings , before they can tread securely the path to virtue and happiness . The picture of a wise and benignant old man , contributing by such humble but effective means to the welfare of his fellow-men , is one which the zealot and the idealist may not dare to despise . Franklin 's views of political economy , and the science of legislation and government , were strongly tinctured with the peculiarities of his mind and temperament . Though he delighted in speculation , he did not theorize with a bold aim and a comprehensive reach of intellect . He looked only to single topics , discussing measures as they were suggested , one by one , with a view to their direct influence on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing state of things , and was led only by accident , as it were , to the examination of general principles . Not many of his speculations , therefore , in this department , will be found serviceable at the present day . His plain good sense delighted most in the familiar exposition of obvious truths , which were at variance with reigning habits and long established prejudices , and he ridiculed these last with much humor and effect . The speculations on the effects of a depreciated paper currency are not very sound , when considered in the light of theory ; but they were written for a temporary purpose , and formed an ingenious defence of a system which was then necessary in the American Colonies , as the lesser of two evils . In a short paper , published in 1766 , he argues very ably against the embargo on corn , and presents views respecting a provision // for the support of the poor , which coincide remarkably with those of Adam Smith , that were published nine years afterwards . We give a short extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcible and homely way of reasoning upon such subjects . It must be remembered , that the article was originally written for publication in a newspaper . " You say , poor laborers can not afford to buy bread at a high price , unless they had higher wages . Possibly . But how shall we farmers be able to afford our laborers higher wages , if you will not allow us to get , when we might have it , a higher price for our corn ? " By all that I can learn , we should at least have had a guinea a quarter more , if the exportation had been allowed . And this money England would have got from foreigners . " But , it seems , we farmers must take so much less , that the poor may have it so much cheaper . " This operates , then , as a tax for the maintenance of the poor . A very good thing , you will say . But I ask , Why a partial tax ? why laid on us farmers only ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public , take your share of it , by indemnifying us a little out of your publip treasury . In doing a good thing , there is both honor and pleasure ; you are welcome to your share of both . " For my own part , I am not so well satisfied of the goodness of this thing . I am for doing good to the poor , but I differ in opinion about the means . I think the best way of doing good to the poor is , not making them easy in poverty , but leading or driving them out of it . In my youth , I travelled much , and I observed in different countries , that the more public provisions were made for the poor , the less they provided for themselves , and of course became poorer . And , on the contrary , the less was done for them , the more they did for themselves , and became richer . There is no country in the world where so many provisions are established for them ; so many hospitals to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained by voluntary charities ; so many almshouses for the aged of both sexes , together with a solemn general law made by the rich to subject their estates to a heavy tax for the support of the poor . Under all these obligations , are our poor modest , humble , and thankful ? And do they use their best endeavours to maintain themselves , and lighten our shoulders of this burden ? On the contrary , I affirm , that there is no country in the world in which the poor are more idle , dissolute , drunken , and inso // lent . The day you passed that act , you took away from before their eyes the greatest of all inducements to industry , frugality , and sobriety , by giving them a dependence on somewhat else than a careful accumulation , during youth and health , for support in age or sickness . " In short , you offered a premium for the encouragement of idleness , and you should not now wonder , that it has had its effect in the increase of poverty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in their manners . Saint Monday and Saint Tuesday will soon cease to be holidays . Six days shalt thou labor , though one of the old commandments , long treated as out of date , will again be looked upon as a respectable precept ; industry will increase , and with it plenty , among the lower people ; their circumstances will mend , and more will be done for their happiness by inuring them to provide for themselves , than could be done by dividing all your estates among them . " - Works , Vol. ii . pp. 358 , 359 . The literary merits of Dr. Franklin 's publications are universally acknowledged . Though he received no academical instruction , and in early life did not enjoy the society of men of taste and letters , he labored on the formation of his style with great care . Fortunately , he chose Addison as his model , being accustomed to rewrite a paper of " The Spectator " from his general recollection of its contents , and then to compare his version with the original . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended for imitation , as it is likely to lead to a too slavish copying of another 's manner . But the simplicity of Franklin 's taste , the fertility of his mind , and his earnestness of purpose , guarded him against affectations and puerilities , and he did not attempt to transfuse into his own manner all the peculiarities of his model . Notwithstanding this early and diligent study of composition , the style in his productions was always made secondary to the thought . The practical and utilitarian turn of his mind prevented him from writing when he had nothing to say , and made him studious of those qualities which he had observed to be most effective in converting readers to his purpose . His compositions , therefore , do not exhibit extraordinary elegance or polish ; but they are easy , pointed , and natural , abounding with happy turns of expression and felicitous illustrations . He had that frankness and borthommie , which render the style a picture of the man , and which never fail to please , though they may uot // instruct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humorist ; and the playfulness of his manner , coupled with his obviously benevolent intentions , leads the reader on by an irresistible charm , and steals away his assent by gaining his affections . The trifles which he wrote in Paris , for the amusement of the gay society there , show all the lightness and spirit that distinguish the people for whom they were composed . We copy a portion of the " Dialogue between Franklin and the Gout , " as it gives an entertaining sketch of his manner of life at Paris . " FRANKLIN . Eh ! Oh ! Eh ! What have I done to merit these cruel sufferings ? " GouT . Many things ; you have ate and drank too freely , and too much indulged those legs of yours in their indolence . " FRANKLIN . Who is it that accuses me ? " GouT . It is I , even I , the Gout . " FRANKLIN . What ! my enemy in person ? " GouT . No , not your enemy . " FRANKLIN . I repeat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body to death , but ruin my good name ; you reproach me as a glutton and a tippler ; now all the world , that knows me , will allow that I am neither the one nor the other . " GouT . The world may think as it pleases ; it is always very complaisant to itself , and sometimes to its friends ; but I very well know that the quantity of meat and drink proper for a man , who takes a reasonable degree of exercise , would be too much for another , who never takes any . " FRANKLIN . I take , - Eh ! Oh ! - as much exercise , - Eh ! - as I can , Madame Gout . You know my sedentary state , and on that account , it would seem , Madame Gout , as if you might spare me a little , seeing it is not altogether my own fault . " GouT . Not a jot ; your rhetoric and your politeness are thrown away ; your apology avails nothing . If your situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your recreations , at least , should he active . You ought to walk or ride ; or , if the weather prevents that , play at billiards . But let us examine your course of life . While the mornings are long , and you have leisure to go abroad , what do you do ? Why , instead of gaining an appetite for breakfast , by salutary exercise , you amuse yourself with books , pamphlets , or newspapers , which commonly are not worth the reading . Yet you eat an inordinate breakfast , four dishes of tea , with cream , and one or two buttered toasts , with slices of hung beef , which I fancy are not things the most easily digested . Immediately after // ward you sit down to write at your desk , or converse with persons who apply to you on business . Thus the time passes till one , without any kind of bodily exercise . But all this I could pardon , in regard , as you say , to your sedentary condition . But what is your practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , with whom you have dined , would be the choice of men of sense ; yours is to be fixed down to chess , where you are found engaged for two or three hours ! This is your perpetual recreation , which is the least eligible of any for a sedentary man , because , instead of accelerating the motion of the fluids , the rigid attention it requires helps to retard the circulation and obstruct internal secretions . Wrapt in the speculations of this wretched game , you destroy your constitution . What can be expected from such a course of living , but a body replete with stagnant humors , ready to fall a prey to all kinds of dangerous maladies , if I , the Gout , did not occasionally bring you relief by agitating those humors , and so purifying or dissipating them ? If it was in some nook or alley in Paris , deprived of walks , that you played awhile at chess after dinner , this might be excusable ; but the same taste prevails with you in Passy , Auteuil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest gardens and walks , a pure air , beautiful women , and most agreeable and instructive conversation ; all which you might enjoy by frequenting the walks . But these are rejected for this abominable game of chess . Fie , then , Mr. Franklin ! But amidst my instructions , I had almost forgot to administer my wholesome corrections ; so take that twinge ,  --  and that . " FRANKLIN . Oh ! Eh ! Oh ! Ohhh ! As much instruction as you please , Madam Gout , and as many reproaches ; but pray , Madam , a truce with your corrections ! " GouT . No , Sir , no , - I will not abate a particle of what is so much for your good , - therefore " FRANKLIN . Ohhh ! what a devil of a physician ! " GouT . How ungrateful you are to say so ! Is it not I who , in the character of your physician , have saved you from the palsy , dropsy , and apoplexy ? one or other of which would have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRANKLIN . I submit , and thank you for the past , but entreat the discontinuance of your visits for the future ; for , in my mind , one had better die than be cured so dolefully . Permit me just to hint , that I have also not been unfriendly to you . I never feed physician or quack of any kind , to enter the list against you ; if then you do not leave me to my repose , it may be said you are ungrateful too . // " GOUT . I can scarcely acknowledge that as any objection . As to quacks , I despise them ; they may kill you , indeed , but can not injure me . And as to regular physicians , they are at last convinced , that the gout , in such a subject as you are , is no disease , but a remedy ; and wherefore cure a remedy ? - but to our business , - there . " FRANKLIN . Oh ! Oh ! - for I-leaven 's sake , leave me ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take exercise daily , arid live temperately . " Gour . I know you too well . You promise fair ; but , after a few months of good health , you will return to your old habits ; your fine promises will be forgotten , like the forms of the last year 's clouds . Let us thea finish the account , and I will go . But I leave you with an assurance of visiting you again at a proper time and place ; for my object is your good , and you are sensible now that I am your real friend . " - Works , Vol. ii . pp. 194-201 . We have no room for extracts from his letters , which present some of the finest models of epistolary composition in the English language . It is difficult to say which are deserving of most admiration , those written to his intimate friends on the ordinary topics of social intercourse , or his business correspondence with politicians and philosophers . Pleasantry , in the former , is sometimes carried a little too far ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the writer , and show a truly affectionate spirit towards his friends . The ease and simplicity of the language are admirable , and a sunny cheerfulness overspreads them , which keeps the reader in constant good-humor . The same traits appear , to some extent , in his political correspondence ; but the earnestness and deep feeling of the writer are here more apparent . His attachment to his native land was so strong , that injuries inflicted upon it drew from him indignant and bitter comments , which were never elicited by wrongs done to himself . His confidential letters to David Hartley , who was for a time an unrecognized medium of communication between him and the English ministry , have some energetic passages , in which the vituperation is carried to the utmost point that is consistent with dignity . His firmness and resolution during the darkest periods of the American war are remarkable . After the Declaration , though he was made the organ of several attempts at a reconciliation , he seems hardly to contemplate the possibility // of the struggle terminating on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country . His reply to a secret agent of England , who wrote to him in 1778 , under the name of Charles de Weissenstein , sounding him about terms for peace , contains such an emphatic expression of the determination with which the writer had embarked in the cause , though he has been accused of lukewarmness in it , that we can not resist the temptation to quote from it two short paragraphs . It must be remembered , that Franklin wrote it soon after he had received accounts of the gloomy winter passed by the American army at Valley Forge . " You conjure me , in the name of the omniscient and just God , before whom I must appear , and by my hopes of future fame , to consider if some expedient can not be found to put a stop to the desolation of America , and prevent the miseries of a general war . As I am conscious of having taken every step in my power to prevent the breach , and no one to widen it , I can appear cheerfully before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , though I have much occasion for his mercy in many others . As to my future fame , I am content to rest it on my past and present conduct , without seeking an addition to it in the crooked , dark paths you propose to me , where I should most certainly lose it . This , your solemn address , would therefore have been more properly made to your sovereign and his venal Parliament . He and they , who wickedly began , and madly continue , a war for the desolation of America , are alone accountable for the consequences . " You think we flatter ourselves , and are deceived into an opinion , that England must acknowledge our independency . We , on the other hand , think you flatter yourselves , in imagining such an acknowledgment a vast boon , which we strongly desire , and which you may gain some great advantage by granting or withholding . We have never asked it of you ; we only tell you , that you can have no treaty with us but as an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rattle of your right to govern us , as long as you have done with that of your king 's being king of France , without giving us the least concern , if you do not attempt to exercise it . That this pre . tended right is indisputable , as you say , we utterly deny . Your Parliament never had a right to govern us , and your king has forfeited it by his bloody tyranny . But I thank you for letting me know a little of your mind , that , even if the Parliament should acknowledge our independency , the act would not be // binding to posterity , and that your nation would resume and prosecute the claim , as soon as they found it convenient , from the influence of your passions , and your present malice against us . We suspected before , that you would not be actually bound by your conciliatory acts , longer than till they had served their purpose of inducing us to disband our foyces ; but we were not certain that you were knaves by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least confidence in your offers , promises , or treaties , though confirmed by Parliament . " - Works , Vol . VIII . pp. 279-283 . Of the extent and general character of Franklin 's political services to this country , it would be difficult to speak fairly , without appearing to run into the language of excessive panegyric . His services in England , up to the commencement of the war , and in France , through nearly the whole of its continuance , were worth more than triumphant battles , or the capture of invading armies , to the cause . On his discretion and good faith , his judgment and activity , and the immense influence which was acquired by his great personal reputation , depended mainly the hopes of the Americans for sympathy and assistance from Europe . Never was there a more Important trust , and never were expectations more fully answered . He went to England , in 1757 , as the agent of Pennsylvania , appointed to present and support the petition of the Assembly of that province against the arbitrary and oppressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion of this popular body , and had drafted most of the papers which emanated from it , in the course of the dispute . The opposite party dreaded his talents and influence , and made very favorable overtures , to draw him over to their side . But he steadfastly refused , and , in his own language , " was as active as ever in the opposition . " During this visit to England , which continued for five years , he labored indefatigably in the service of the province , and contributed freely to the press , in order to remove the misapprehensions and prejudices which existed there respecting the conduct of the Pennsylvanians . Among other works , he published the celebrated " Historical Review of Pennsylvania " ; a volume of considerable size , the object of which was , to expose the injuries that the inhabitants had suffered , and to vindicate them from the charges made by their opponents . It was a controversial 41 * // publication , not aspiring to the fulness and impartiality of history , but written with great ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular party . He was universally supposed to be the sole author of it , and was much abused for it by the friends of the Proprietaries , both in England and America . With his usual disregard of self , and indifference about personal calumniation , he never publicly disavowed it , and therefore , till the appearance of this edition , it was always attributed to him . But Mr. Sparks has discovered a private letter , which he wrote to David Hume , soon after the publication of the work , in which he expressly disclaims it , saying that the greater part of it was written by another hand . It is properly inserted in this edition , however , as many of the messages and reports of the Assembly , which he wrote when at home , are inserted in it , and as he probably revised the whole , and was certainly responsible for its publication . It is good evidence of the extent and success of Mr. Sparks 's researches , that he has been able to put at rest the question respecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first given to the public . Franklin returned from England in 1762 , and went thither again , on the same service , in 1764 . Notwithstanding his eminent services and reputation , the party of the Proprietaries in Philadelphia had contrived to defeat his reaction to the Assembly , by about twenty-five votes out of four thousand . But they gained nothing by this effort ; for , as their opponents still had a great majority in the Assembly , they appointed him special agent to Great Britain , to take charge of the petition for a change of government , and to have the general management of the affairs of the province . His adversaries , among whom we are sorry to find the name of John Dickinson , murmured loudly at this appointment , on the ostensible ground , that he was not in favor either with the ministers or the Proprietaries . Of course , this fact only endeared him the more to the mass of the people , whose interests and feelings he represented . He went to England this time as the agent of but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon compelled him to assume a broader sphere of duty , and he became at last the virtual representative of the whole American people . He was successively appointed agent for Georgia , New Jersey , and Massachusetts ; and his great reputation , and // acknowledged familiarity with the affairs and opinions of the colonists , caused all parties in London to apply to him for information and counsel . The f3tamp Act was passed , and when the determined opposition to it in America compelled the ministry to think of repealing it , his memorable examination at the bar of the House of Commons took place . It was a noble occasion for the display of his courage , his judgment , his intimate acquaintance with the affairs of the country , and his patriotism ; and nobly did he acquit himself . He was examined in presence of a full House , and was obliged to answer the questions as fast as they were propounded , without having time to consider and prepare a deliberate reply . Every word that he uttered has been preserved , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his unpremeditated composition , and of the firmness and the self-possession which enabled him to display his judgment and his great store of information with such impressive effect . The ablest speeches of Chatham and Burke did not contribute so much towards convincing the Parliament and the nation of the injustice and impolicy of their conduct towards America , as did the firm demeanour and the unstudied replies of the agent for Pennsylvania . As the sky darkened , and the danger of a division of the British empire became more imminent , the influence and the reputation of Franklin increased , and all eyes were turned upon him , as the only person who was capable of mediating between the angry parties . As prudent and sagacious as he was patriotic , he shrunk from the evils necessarily consequent upon separation and war , and exerted himself to the utmost to avert such calamities . He deplored the conduct of the ministry , and wrote home , with great earnestness , to allay the over-zealous and imprudent spirit which animated some of the patriots . His letters were full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purpose , no shrinking from the resolution once formed , and so often proclaimed , never to submit to the unjust tax . The government had recourse to him , and plans for reconciling all difficulties were repeatedly proposed , and discussed by him in a spirit of caution and forbearance , eager to avert from both countries the horrors of a civil war . It was all in vain . The insolent bearing of the ministry , and the fatal obstinacy of the king , now known to be the chief cause why matters were brought to such a crisis , overpowered all the efforts of // the friends of peace ; and the blow was struck at Lexington , which rendered the dismemberment of the empire inevitable . Yet the endeavours of Franklin to prevent the affair from being pushed to this extremity were not entirely fruitless . His reluctance and delay showed the conscientious character of the motives with which he entered into the contest . To the mingled moderation and firmness , the prudence , equity , and wisdom of Franklin , and of men like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dignity and soberness , by which it was characterized in a greater degree than was any other momentous political convulsion which the world has ever witnessed . It was not the turbulent rebellion of a moh , nor yet a wild and fearful outhreak , upheaving the very foundations of order , society , and morals , like the revolution in France . It was rather the grave and dispassionate act of a whole nation , upon sufficient cause , and with due consideration , severing the political ties which bound it to another , but preserving its own government and institutions intact . When the die was cast , and the tocsin of war was sounded , the cheerfulness of Franklin instantly returned . Though he had done all he could to avert the struggle , he doubted not its issue . It might be protracted , it was sure to be calamitous in many of its attendant circumstances , and to task to the utmost the resources and the fortitude of his countrymen hut he knew it must end in the establishment of their freedom . The solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it was written some years afterwards , shows his confidence , and the composure of his feelings at this crisis . As a farther illustration of his steadiness and decision of purpose at this period , we make a short extract from a letter which he wrote to Lord Howe , in June , 1776 . " I have not the vanity , my Lord , to think of intimidating , by thus predicting the effects of this war ; for I know it will , in England , have the fate of all my former predictions , not to be believed till the event shall verify it . " Long did I endeavour , with unfeigned and unwearied zeal , to preserve from breaking that fine and noble China vase , the British empire ; for I knew , that , being once broken , the separate parts could not retain even their share of the strength or value that existed in the whole , and that a perfect reunion of those parts could scarce ever be hoped for . Your Lordship may possibly remember the tears of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your good sister 's , in London , you once gave me expectations that a reconciliation might soon take place . I had the misfortune to find those expectations disappointed , andjo be treated as the cause of the mischief I was laboring to prevent . My consolation , under that groundless and malevolent treatment , was , that I retained the friendship of many wise and good men in that country , and , among the rest , some share in the regard of Lord Howe . " The well-founded esteem , and , permit me to say , affection , which I shall always have for your Lordship , makes it painful to me to see you engaged in conducting a war , the great ground of which , as expressed in your letter , is the necessity of preventing the American trade from passing into foreign channels . ' To me it seems , that neither the obtaining nor retaining of any trade , how valuable soever , is an object for which men may justly spill each other 's blood ; that the true and sure means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commodities ; and that the profit of no trade can ever be equal to the expense of compelling it , and of holding it , by fleets and armies . " I consider this war against us , therefore , as both unjust and unwise ; and I am persuaded , that cool , dispassionate posterity will condemn to infamy those who advised it ; and that even success will not save from some degree of dishonor those who voluntarily engaged to conduct it . 1 know , your great motive in coming hither was the hope of being instrumental in a reconciliation ; and I believe , when you find that impossible , on any terms given you to propose , you will relinquish so odious a command , and return to a more honorable private station . " Works , Vol. v. pp. 101 , 102 . He returned to America just in time to he chosen a member of Congress , to be appointed on the committee for drafting the Declaration of Independence , and to affix his name to that instrument , the charter of liberties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , to the most responsible post , except the chief command of her armies , which his country had to offer ; and we have seen with what a hurst of enthusiasm he was welcomed in the courtly circles of Paris . He remained there , unwearied and most successful in his efforts to conduct the war to a happy termination . He remained till he had negotiated and signed the treaty of alliance with France , which was virtually decisive of the contest , and to the definitive treaty of peace with Great Britain , which marked its triumphant close . // Then he returned for the last time to his native land , to die there . He landed at Philadelphia on the 14th of September , 1785 , in the eightieth year of his age . Sixty-three years before , he had landed at the same spot , on his first visit to the city , as a runaway apprentice from Boston , with a single dollar in his pocket . He came now full of years and honors , and greeted with acclamations by a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within his adopted city . Immediately after his arrival , he was chosen President of the State , and held that office by a unanimous vote at the successive elections for three years , being the full term that was allowed by the constitution of Pennsylvania . The infirmities of years were upon him , but his mental faculties were unimpaired , and he discharged all the duties of the station to the full satisfaction of those who elected him . He was chosen one of the delegates to the Convention for forming the constitution of the United States , as if that he might have a share in every important step for establishing the interests of the new republic ; and he entered into the proceedings with great activity and interest , many of his speeches being afterwards written out and published . The last speech which he made in the Convention affords such striking evidence of his liberality of opinion and practical wisdom , that we quote the concluding portion of it . Would that more of the spirit which animates it might appear in the actions of politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I expect no better , and because I am not sure that it is not the best . The opinions I have had of its errors I sacrifice to the public good . I have never whispered a syllable of them abroad . Within these walls they were born , and here they shall die . If every one of us , in returning to our constituents , were to report the objections he has had to it , and endeavour to gain partisans in support of them , we might prevent its being generally received , and thereby lose all the salutary effects and great ad vantages resulting naturally in our favor among foreign nations , as well as among ourselves , from our real or apparent unanimity . Much of the strength and efficiency of any government , in procuring and securing happiness to the people , depends on opinion , on the general opinion of the goodness of that government , as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its governors . I hope , therefore , // for our own sakes , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our posterity , that we shall act heartily and unanimously in recommending this constitution , wherever our influence may extend , and turn our future thoughts and endeavours to the means of having it well administered . On the whole , Sir , I can not help expressing a wish , that every member of the convention , who may still have objections to it , would with me on this occasion doubt a little of his own infallibility , and , to make manifest our unanimity , put his name to this instrument . " Life , pp. 518 , 519 . He was now in the full enjoyment of a serene and happy old age , looking forward with pleasure , but without impatience , to the termination of his career . He had the same cheerful activity of mind , the same interest in philosophical subjects , which he had manifested in the whole preceding portion of his long life . He was at ease in his domestic circumstances , and was surrounded by a happy family of grandchildren , and a circle of intimate and admiring friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most admirable letters that ever came from his pen , showing all his characteristic gayety , benevolence , and inquiring habit of mind , were written at this period .

He conversed with his usual cheerfulness and animation , and showed with great interest some curious objects of natural history , and a large work upon botany , which he was then snidying with much ardor . The sickness of death came upon him , but did not impair his serenity of mind , or the activity of his moral and intellectual powers . " A few days before he died , he rose from his bed , and begged that it might be made up for him , so that he might die in a decent manner .
