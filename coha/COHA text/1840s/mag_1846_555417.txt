txt THE purpose and spirit of this book place it aside from the technical canons of criticism . It is the tribute of a sincere philanthropist to a cause to which he has given not fair words alone , but the substantial efforts and costly sacrifices of many years . Yet , in a merely rhetorical point of view , the work has no need to intrench itself upon its moral rights , and evade criticism . Without art or ostentation , it possesses great merits of style . Its narrative is the plain , straightforward , unsophisticated story of a man of strong // sense , true refinement , and deep sympathy . Its appeals are in heart-coined words , of the utmost directness and cogency . Colonel M'Kenney was appointed in 1816 , hy Mr. Madison , Superintendent of the United States Indian Trade with the Indian Tribes . " For twenty years previously , our government had conducted , under officers of its own appointment , and on capital drawn from the public treasury , a barter traffic with the various Indian tribes on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribes from the imposition and extortion , which had grown into a system and constituted the basis of a common law among the irresponsible traders , many of whom had rapidly become rich on a business the lawful profits of which would have yielded them a bare subsistence . The federal government had from its formation exercised a careful and truly parental guardianship over all friendly Indians within its territory , though subsequent injustice and outrage have nearly obliterated the memory of those days . But the efforts of the government in their behalf encountered the most vehement opposition from individuals and companies engaged in the Indian trade ; and by their influence over the Southern and Western delegation in Congress , the public trade establishment was abolished in 1822 . Colonel M'Kenney , having triumphantly rebutted , by an overwhelming array of testimony , certain calumnious charges of official malversation , and still retaining the highest confidence of the administration , was , in 1824 , appointed chief of the bureau of indian Affairs , then first established as a separate department of the office of the secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was suffered to remain in office for nearly seven months after the change of administration , it being found impossible to fill his place with any one whose personal qualifications for it bore comparison with his own ; and he owed his final dismission undoubtedly to his refusal to sign and issue from his office a circular , the designed and understood effect of which was to break down the Cherokee government , and to deprive that tribe of its independent national existence . When he asked the acting secretary of war the reasons for his dismissal , the reply was , * Why , Sir , every body knows your qualifications for the place ; but General Jackson has long been satisfied that you are not in harmony with him in his views in regard to // the Indians . " This removal was a marked era in Indian history , as the commencement of that encroaching , arbitrary , and oppressive policy which has cost the country millions of treasure , many thousands of valuable lives , and more reputation than a patriotic American likes to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under treaties surreptitiously made , of tribes far advanced in the arts and refinements of life , and entitled to their soil by the joint claims of original proprietorship , reiterated guaranty and recognition on the part of the United States , and productive occupancy . Since his removal from office , Colonel M'Kenney has devoted himself , with great ardor and perseverance , to the objects which had received his chief attention when in office under the government . He has endeavoured , by public lectures , an extensive correspondence , and personal intercourse in every part of the country , to excite a sufficiently deep interest in the remains of our aboriginal tribes , to lead to some concerted plan and organized movement for their preservation , improvement , and elevation . His enthusiasm and eloquence , aided by an unusual combination of the best personal endowments for such a mission , have powerfully stirred up strong minds and good hearts , wherever he has gone . The present publication is designed to fix and deepen the necessarily vague and evanescent impressions made by the living voice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of autobiography ; hut he has taken advantage of it , beyond the main scope of his work , only to give us a few anecdotes of public men and traits of official life at Washington , which his readers would not willingly lose . From a chapter chiefly devoted to anecdotes of President Monroe we quote the following , as illustrative of a striking contrast between the better days of our republic and our own . " In 1823 , I think it was , I write from memory , Colonel Freeman , then fourth auditor of the treasury , died . Mr. Calhoun , being then secretary of war , asked me if I would accept the office made vacant by the Colonel 's death . I assented , - when , leaving me in his office , he went over to see Mr. Monroe , the President , and ascertain his pleasure on the subject . Mr. Calhoun soon returned , telling me the President very cordially assented , but had scarcely finished the sentence , when the President 's messenger came in , saying to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians . would be glad to see him . He left me , requesting me to remain until his return ; and being gone some half hour , he came back , saying , in substance , It is very strange ! The President , I think , is singularly scrupulous . He recognized you just now with great pleasure as Colonel Freeman 's successor ; and then sent for me to say he could not nominate you , - giving as his reason , that you had been active and useful in defending his administration , and if , with the knowledge the public had of this fact , he should appoint you to office , it might be interpreted as a compensation to you , out of the public money , for those services . He went on to say , that Mr. Monroe was anxious for my appointment to some suitable office in the government , provided a situation could be found that would not devolve upon him the duty , for the reasons stated , of conferring it upon me . " I introduce this little anecdote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how constantly alive to his fame ; and also , that it may serve as a contrast to the practice which was destined in a few short years to take the place of it , - of an exactly opposite character . " Another anecdote illustrative of this sensibility in Mr. Monroe to his reputation . It is known that his entire devotion to the public service left him but little time to attend to his private affairs . He became embarrassed , - greatly so ; but was perhaps never more so than during the term of his Presidency . He owned , by bequest , I believe , a valuable estate in Virginia , - known as the Albemarle estate . It was his great object , if possible , to save this , and pass it down to his descendants . But the pressing nature of his finances forced from him , at last , a reluctant offer of this property for sale . Some time after the appearance of the advertisement , he was waited upon by a gentleman , who said to him , - Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate in Albemarle . My object in going there was to examine it , with a view to its purchase . I have done this , and have also learned from your agent your terms . I am here to say , that I am ready , when you shall have made out the title-deeds , to pay you the stipulated price . ' " Mr. Monroe replied , Colonel 0- , I can not sell that estate to you . My necessities , I know , are great ; and these alone prompted me to advertise that property for sale , - but Colonel 0- , interrupting him , asked , with surprise , Why not sell to me ? ' For no other reason than one , - and that is , you were a contractor during the war ; and you received your contracts from me as secretary of war . You were faithful , I know , and fulfilled your trust like an honest man , and made money . And now , were I to sell you my estate , I might incur // the suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your power to buy it . ' All remonstrance on the part of Colonel 0- proved in vain . Mr. Monroe held to his first decision , preferring to bear the weight of heavy embarrassments , to the liability of incurring the suspicion that he had converted his trust , as secretary of war , into an instrument of pecuniary gain and personal emolument . " Such instances of purity in public life are refreshing . They will appear to the reader of the present day , perhaps , as fables ; and the patriotic Monroe may , probably , be considered , when contemplated through the medium of modern times , as fastidious . " - VoI.i. , pp. 41-43 . The greater part of this volume is occupied with the narrative of an excursion made , in the year 1827 , among various Indian tribes , from Lake Superior to Georgia . The story abounds in graphic descriptions of natural scenery , in detailed sketches of Indian habits and character , and in all the minute tracery of forest and savage life . Without stiltlike phrase or rhetorical artifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told his own family on his return , just what he saw and heard , said and did . And without any affectation of philanthropy , without a particle of that maudlin sentimentality which seems to us a philological rather than a moral attainment , he manifests everywhere a prompt and hearty sympathy with the noble though fallen race whose servant he made himself , and a keen and true moral discernment as to their relations , rights , and wrongs . In all his transactions with them , he appears as their apologist , defender , and patron , and seems to have sown along his whole path among them claims upon their personal gratitude and affection . We had marked several extracts from this volume ; but we should hardly do justice to the work in quoting single incidents of travel apart from those connectives of time , place , and circumstance , whence they derive so much of their interest and point . The second volume consists of discourses which the author has delivered , in the prosecution of the work of love to which his latter years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian races , Colonel M'Kenney supposes them to be of Tartar descent , and to have found their way to this country across Bebring 's Straits . He does not ascribe to the present races the construction of // the fortifications and other remarkable monuments which still baffle antiquarian acumen ; but supposes them to have been built by an earlier Asiatic race , identical with the Mexicans or Peruvians , which was vanquished and exterminated by the fiercer and less civilized ancestors of the modern tribes . His grounds for this hypothesis are a similarity between the mounds and circumvallations in our territory and those found in both Mexico and Peru ; a general resemblance in relics disinterred from the mounds in the three countries respectively ; traditions favoring this theory ; and the occasional digging up in our soil of skulls belonging to a manifestly extinct race . On these obscure points , without the profession or parade of learning , our author reasons with great good sense and discrimination ; and we can not but pay the more deference to his conclusions , from his having omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiquaries are wont to illustrate their own erudition much more than the questions at issue . We have neither room nor disposition to enter upon these questions here ; and setting aside both our author 's speculations and our own , we transfer to our pages a rare morfeau of Indian cosmogony or ant hropogony , which we commend to the admirers of the Vestiges , " as a parallel theory , resting on no less solid a posteriori grounds , and presenting a no less beautiful union of poetical fancy with profound philosophy , than that which finds literal truth in the words of Job , when he said to the worm , " Thou art my mother and my sister . " " The government had made arrangements , somewhere about the year 1825 , for introducing among the Seminoles of Florida the school system , and a sum of money was appropriated for that object . It was resisted by NEA-MATULA , a chief , at that time , of distinction , and exercising over that tribe great authority . After several ineffectual attempts to apply the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Nea.Mathla rose and addressed Governor Duval , ex officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs , as follows - " Father , - It is not my wish to have my red children made white children of . When the Great Spirit made man , he made him as he is , and under three marks . He assigned to each color , at the creation , the duties of each ; and it was never intended that they should mingle . " Father , - This was the way in which the Great Spirit made man . He stood upon a high place . Then taking into his hand // some dust , he mixed it , and dried it , and then blew upon it , sending it from his hand in front of him , - when there stood up before him a white man ! " The Great Spirit was Sorry . lie saw that what he had made was not what he aimed at . The man was white ! He looked feeble and sickly . When the Great Spirit , looking at him , said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are not what I want . I could send you where you came from ; but no , - I will not take away your life . Stand aside . " The Great Spirit mixed up the dust again , and drying it , blew upon it again , - and there stood before him a black man ! " The Great Spirit was grieved . He saw , now , this man was black and ugly ; so he bade him stand aside ; when , mixing up the dust again , he blew upon it , - and there stood before him A RED MAN ! The Great Spirit smiled . At this moment , all looked up and saw an opening in the heavens , and through it descended , slowly , three boxes . They came down , at last , and rested on the ground ; when the Great Spirit spoke , saying , " I have given life to you all . The red man , alone , is my favorite ; but you shall all live . You must , however , fulfil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . These three boxes contain the tools you are to use in getting what is necessary to support you . " So saying , he called to him the white man . " White man , " said the Great Spirit , " you are not my favorite , - but I made you first . Open these boxes , and look , and choose which you will take . They contain the implements you are all three to use through life . " " The white man opened the boxes , looked in , and said , " i 'll take this . " It was full of pens , and ink , and paper , and all the things you white people use . He looked at the black man , saying , " I made you next , but I can not allow you to have the second choice " ; then , turning to the red man , he smiled , and spoke , saying , " Come , my favorite , and make a choice . " The red man looked into the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That was full of beaver-traps , bows and arrows , and all the kind of things the Indians use . Then the Great Spirit said to the negro , " You can take this " ; and that was full of hoes and axes , - plainly showing that the black man was made to labor for both the white and red man . " Father , - Thus did the Great Spirit make man , and in this way did he provide the instruments for him to labor with . It is not his will that our red children shall use the articles that came down in the box which the white man chose , any more than it is proper for the white man to take of the implements that were prepared by the Great Spirit for the use of his red children . ' " The result was , the means provided for the support of schools // were rejected , and have never been employed to this day . " Vol. ii. , pp. 15- 17 . The second discourse treats of the " claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past services and suf .. ferings , and from unanswerable evidence of endowments , and capacity to receive and enjoy the benefits of civilization . " That the early indebtedness of the Colonists to the placable dispositions and friendly offices of the Indian tribes should have been so soon overlooked , and so unrighteously recompensed , in the very lifetime of Pocahontas and Massasoit , presents an enigma , for the solution of which the civil and domestic history of the Colonies furnishes no adequate materials . We are disposed to think that religious bigotry bore a large agency in the seemingly gratuitous suspicion and hostility with which the Indians began to be regarded , before any aggressive movements on their part authorized alarm . The origin of these tribes was then a vexed question among theologians , as now among antiquaries . The celebrated Joseph Mede was gravely consulted on this point , and replied by propounding and defending , in an elaborate and profoundly learned essay , the following theory . The name and faith of Christ having been rapidly diffused in the Eastern continent , Satan began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determined to found a kingdom in the New World , where the abhorred symbols of the Christian worship should never meet his eye ; or , as Mede more classically expresses the thought , " ubi nec Pelopidarum nomen , nec facta audiret . " He accordingly convened somewhere among the steppes of Tartary a body of his most devoted servants , and led them to the previously uninhabited glades and forests of America , marking out by his own diabolical ingenuity a more practicable path than unaided mortals could have found , defending their passage across the straits , and going before them by some visible sign of his presence , corresponding to the pillar of alternate cloud and fire that preceded the Israelites in the desert . The grounds of this theory are ample and satisfying . The reasoning of the author of the " Vestiges " is not one whit more conclusive . In the first place , the Peruvian and Mexican divinities , which Mr. Mede had seen , strikingly resembled the Devil in face and form . Then , again , it had been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert any of the Indians to Christianity . // And , thirdly , the New England settlers had suffered much sorer hardships than the Almighty would have permitted his special favorites to endure , had they not put themselves beyond his protection , by intruding on Satan 's own soil . From all which Mr. Mede sagaciously infers , that the experiment of colonizing America with Christians was a very doubtful one , and liable at any ' moment to be abruptly closed by an explosion of diabolic wrath . Now , when we consider that these absurdities were believed and published by the first divine of the day , a cherished ornament of the English church , and a correspondent and friend of many distinguished Puritans , it is not too much to suppose that similar opinions had a deep root in Virginia and in New England , and that the Colonists hunted and slew Indians , not maliciously or wantonly , but from religious motives , and as an essential departrnent of divine service . Colonel M'Kenney has brought forward , were it still needed , abundant evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptibility of the highest moral and religious culture . Few portions of our country would present an average standard of intelligence and moral worth , that would compare with that of the Cherokees before their removal ; and they in their new homes , as well as the Choctaws , Chickasaws , and Creeks , are well organized nations , with written laws , representative assemblies , regular courts of justice , and liberal provisions for public education . We extract the following beautiful portraits of Indian piety ; and we confess that we know not where to look for a more luculent commentary on the precepts of the New Testament than in Kusick 's rigid , tender , minute conscientiousness . " Who has not heard of the famous Oneida chief Skenandoab ? He whose pathway , for sixty years , had been marked with blood ; whose war.whoop had resounded through many a terrified settlement , and until the regions of the Mohawk rang with it ; and who was , in all respects , the cruel , the indomitable savage . One would suppose that habits , stiffened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easily , if at all , softened and remoulded ; that the spirit of the warrior , having been so long indulged in the practices so congenial to the feelings of the savage , could not be subdued , and made to conform to all that is gentle , and peaceful , and pious . But all this was effected in the person of this chief . He was awakened under the preaching of the Rev. Mr. Kirkland , and 42* // became a convert to the faith of the Christian . The tomahawk , the war-club , and the scalping-knife fell from his grasp ; the desolations which he had produced he mourned over ; he saw , in his mythology , nothing but chimeras ; he was penitent , - and was forgiven- Nor did he ever abandon the faith he had adopted , hut continued a peaceful , faithful , and devoted Christian , until his death , which occurred when he was over a hundred years old . " Awhile previous to his death , a friend , calling to see him , and inquiring after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , doubtless , have heard ) , - I am an aged hemlock . The winds of a hundred winters have whistled through my branches . I am dead at the top ( referring to his blindness ) . Why I yet live , the great , good Spirit only knows . When I am dead , bury me by the side of my minister and friend ( meaning Mr. Kirk . land ) , - that I may go up with him at the great resurrection ! ' He was accordingly so buried , and I have seen his tomb . " Another case was that of Kusick , chief of the Tuscaroras . He was also an Indian , and had served under La Fayette , in the army of the Revolution . It was usual for him , in company with a few of his leading men , to visit , once in every two or three years , the State of North Carolina , whence his tribe originally came , to see after some claims they had upon that State . in passing through Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of submitting his papers , and of counselling with me . On one of these occasions , he made a call before breakfast , at my residence , accompanied by his companions . A neighbour had stepped in to see me , on his way to his office , and our conversation turned on Lady Morgan 's France , which had been just then published , and was lying on my table . We spoke of La Fayette . The moment his name was mentioned , Kusick turned quick upon me his fine black eyes , and asked , with great earnestness , - " Is he yet alive ? The same La Fayette that was in the Revolutionary war ? * " Yes , Kusick , ' I answered , he is alive ; and he is the same La Fayette who was in that war . That book speaks of him as being not only alive , but looking well and hearty . ' " He said , with deep emphasis , I 'm glad to hear it . ' " Then you knew La Fayette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered , I knew him well ; and many a time in the battle , I threw myself between him and the bullets , - for I loved him . ' " Were you in commission ? ' " 0 , yes , ' he replied , I was a lieutenant ; General Washington gave me a commission . ' // " My friend ( who was the late venerable Joseph Nourse , at that time Register of the Treasury ) and myself agreed to examine the records , and see if the old chief was not entitled to a pension . We ( or rather he ) did so . All was found to be as Kusick had reported it ; when he was put on the pension list . " Some years after , in 1827 , when passing through the Tuscarora reserve , on my way to the wilderness , I stopped opposite his log cabin , and walked up to see the old chief . I found him engaged drying fish . After the usual greeting , I asked if he continued to receive his pension . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress passed a law making it necessary for me to swear I can not live without it . Now here is my little log.cabin , and it s my own ; here 's my patch , where I can raise corn , and beans , and pumpkins ; and there 's Lake Oneida , where I can catch fish . With these I can make out to live without the pension ; and to say I could not would be to lie to the Great Spirit ! ' " Here was principle , and deep piety ; and a lesson for many whose advantages had far exceeded those of this poor Indian . In connection with this , I will add another anecdote , in proof of his veneration for the Deity . He breakfasted with me on the morning to which I have referred ; and knowing him to be a teacher of the Christian religion among his people , and an interpreter for those who occasionally preached to them , I requested him to ask a blessing . He did so , and in a manner so impressive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the proper spirit . He employed in the ceremony his native Tuscarora . I asked him why , as he spoke very good English , he had asked the blessing in his native tongue ? He said , When I speak English , I am often at a loss for a word . When , therefore , I speak to the Great Spirit , I do not like to be perplexed , or have my mind distracted , to look after a word . When I use my own language , it is like my breath ; I am composed . ' Kusick died an honest man and a Christian ; and though an Indian , has doubtless entered into his rest . " - Vol. ii. , pp. 83- 86 . In the series of Indian portraits published by McKenney and Hall , some of our readers have no doubt become familiar with the noble countenance of Petalesbarro . His story is a long one ; but we can not well abridge it , and it is so full , not only of romance , but of the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . " The Pawnee Loups had long practised the savage rite , known to no other of the American tribes , of sacrificing human // victims to the Great Star , or the planet Venus . This dreadful ceremony annually preceded the preparations for planting corn , and was supposed to be necessary to secure a fruitful season . To prevent a failure of the crop , and a consequent famine , some individual was expected to offer up a prisoner , of either sex , who had been captured in war , and some one was always found who coveted the honor of dedicating the spoil of his prowess to the national benefit . The intended victim , carefully kept in ignorance of the fate that impended , was dressed in gay attire , supplied with choicest food , and treated with every tenderness , with the view of promoting obesity , and preparing an offering the more acceptable to the deities who were to be propitiated . When , by the successful employment of those means , the unconscious victim was sufficiently fatted , a day was appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness the solemn scene . " You will now fancy yourselves in view of the great gathering of the Pawnees , and in sight of the multitude assembled in honor of the sacrifice . In your nearer approach you will hear their orgies . In the midst of the great circle a stake is brought , its end is sharpened , when it is driven deep in the ground . Yells and shouts are heard , and these announce that all is ready . In the distance is a company of Pawnees , - by the side of the leader is a delicate girl . She is an Itean maid . They approach nearer . He who made her captive steps proudly into the circle . Shouts welcome him . He takes the maid by the hand , and leads her to the fatal spot . Her back is placed against the stake ; cords are brought , and she is bound to it . The fagots are now collected , and placed round the victim . A hopeless expression is seen in her eye , - perhaps a tear ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A torch is seen , coming from the woods , hard by . At that moment a young brave leaps into the circle , - rushes to the stake , - severs the cords that bind the victim to it , and springing on a horse , and throwing her upon another , and putting both to the top of their speed , is soon lost in the distance . Silence prevails , - then murmers are heard , and then the loud threats of vengeance , when all retire ! The stake and the fagot are all that remain to mark the spot , on which , but for this noble deed , ashes and charred bones would have been distinguished . Who was it that intrepidly released the captive maid ? It was the young , the brave , the generous PETALESHARRO . Whether it was panic , or the dread of Letalashahou 's vengeance ( LETALASHAHOU was the great chief of the Pawnees , and father of Petalesharro ) , that operated to keep the warriors from employing their bows and arrows , and rifles , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , they did not use them . // " Having borne the rescued maid into the broad plains beyond the precincts of the Pawnee village , and supplied her with provisions , he admonished her to make the best of her way to her own nation , which was distant about four hundred miles , and left her . She , alive to her situation , lost no time in obeying such salutary counsel , and had the good fortune , the next day , to fall in with a war-party of her own people , by whom she was safely carried home . " Can the records of chivalry furnish a parallel to this generous act ? Can the civilized world bring forward a case demonstrating a higher order of hi*manity , united with greater bravery ? Whence did the youthful Petalesharro learn this lesson of refined pity ? Not of civilized man . The lessons of the good had never yet reached the Pawnees , to instruct them , or to enrapture their thoughts by such beautiful illustrations of the merciful . It was the impulse of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and probably , as the sequel will show , nurtured by the blood and spirit of a noble , though untaught father . " The rescue of the Jtean maid happened a short time before Petalesharro was deputed to Washington , as one of a deputation on matters connected with the interests of the Pa*vnee nation . His visit to that city was in 1821 . He wore a head-dress of the feathers of the war-eagle , which extended , in a double series , down his back , to his hips , narrowing as it descended . His robe was thrown gracefully , but carelessly , over his shoulders , leaving his breast , and often one arm , bare . The usual garments decorated his hips and lower limbs , - these were the auzeum , the leggins , and the moccasons , - all ornamented . The youthful and feminine character of his face , and the humanity of its expression , were all remarkable . He did not appear to be older than twenty years , but his age was about twenty-five . I had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As was most natural , the tidings of his noble deed accompanied Petalesharro to Washington . Both himself and his chivalry became the theme of the city . The ladies , as is their nature , hastened to do him honor . A medal was prepared , and a time appointed for conferring on him this merited gift . An assembly had collected to witness the ceremony . He was told , in substance , that the medal was given him in token of the high opinion which was entertained of his act , in the rescue of the Itean maid . He was asked by the ladies who presented it , to accept and wear it for their sake ; and told , when he had another occasion to save a captive woman from torture and from the stake , to look upon the medal , think of those who gave it , and save her , as he had saved the Itean girl . With that grace which is peculiar to the // Indian , he held the prize he had so nobly won before him , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest to my heart . I feel like the leaf , after a storm , and when the wind is still . I have listened to you . I am glad . I love the pale-faces more than ever I did , and will open my ears wider when they speak . I am glad you heard of what I did . I did not know the act was so good . It came from my heart . I was ignorant of its value . I now know how good it was . You make me know it , by giving me this medal . ' " The rescue of the Itean girl might , if a solitary act , be looked upon as the result of impulse , and not as proceeding from a generous nature . It happens , however , not to stand alone , as the only instance of the sort , in the life of Petalesharro . One of his brother warriors had brought in a captive boy . Lie was a Spaniard . The captor resolved to offer him as a sacrifice to the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time opposed to these barbarous rites . He sent for the warrior , and told him he did not wish him to make the sacrifice . The warrior claimed his right , under the immemorial usages of the tribe . They parted . Letalashahou sent for his son , and asked what was to be done to divert the captor from his purpose ? Petalesharro replied promptly , I will take the boy , like a brave , by force . ' The father thought , no doubt , that danger would attend upon the act , and resolved on a more pacific mode . It was to buy the boy . This intention was made known , when those who had any goods of any kind brought them to the chief 's lodge , and laid them down , as an offering , on the pile which the chief had supplied from his own limited stores . The captor was again sent for , and in the authoritative tone of the chief thus addressed : - Take these goods , and give me the boy . ' He refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over the head of the captor . At the moment , Petalesharro sprang forward , and said , - Sruiuz ! and let the wrath of his friends fall upon me . ' " The captor , making a merit of necessity , agreed , if a few more articles were added , to give up the boy to the chief ; they were added , and the boy was saved . The goods were sacrificed instead of the boy . The cloth was cut into shreds , and suspended on poles , at the spot upon which the blood of the victim bad been proposed to be shed , and the remainder of the articles were burned . No subsequent attempt to immolate a victim was made . " - Vol. ii. , pp. 93-97 . The plan which Col. M'Kenney proposes for the permanent benefit of the Indians , and in behalf of which he is diligently manufacturing public opinion , is , for the United States to convey to the Indian races the unconditional fee of the // lands 1*Test of the Mississippi , to which the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a territorial government , with a view to their ultimately taking their place as an independent state in the confederacy . By this arrangement , a stimulus would be given to all institutions and enterprises for the general good , and to all forms and modes of self-improvement , which now languish on account of the doubtful tenure on which the Indians hold their soil and their rights , and the large experience of Punic faith vouchsafed to them by the American republic . For our own peace , as well as for their good , ought the fee of their soil and the permanence of their political condition to be guarantied to them . As they are now situated , should any new invasions of their rights rouse a vindictive spirit , there is hardly a limit to the mischief which they might do to the States on their eastern frontier , before they could be successfully resisted , or to the extent to which , if driven back among the fastnesses of the Rocky mountains , they might prolong a desperate guerilla warfare .

We trust that it will find a free and rapid sale in all parts of the country . Except that it is a larger book than the devourers of cheap literature like , it is admirably adapted to win its way into general circulation . Its typography is large , clear , and tasteful . It is embellished by numerous and well designed lithographs . It contains a fac szmde of the venerable Mrs. Madison 's letter , accepting the dedication of the first volume . It bears for its frontispiece the author 's own intellectual and benevolent face ; and to the second volume is prefixed a strikingly beautiful colored engraving from Sully 's copy of the original portrait of Pocahontas , with a characteristic anecdote of one of whose illustrious descendants we close our critical labors , and earnestly commend the book , on which we have bestowed them , , to all who admire the native nobleness of the Indian character , who sympathize with the sufferings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulses which are now urging some of these tribes rapidly on in a career of selfimprovement . " I was present in the halt of the House of Representatives at Washington , during an exciting debate ; on the one side of which // was Mr. Randolph , and on the other , Mr. Jackson , of Virginia . Mr. Randolph had spoken , when Mr. Jackson rose in reply . He had not proceeded far , when , having occasion to refer to some part of Mr. Randolph 's speech , he addressed him as - My friend from Virginia . ' He had scarcely given utterance to the word friend , ' when Mr. Randolph sprang to his feet , and throwing his lustrous eyes first on Mr. Jackson , and then on the speaker , keeping his arm extended , meantime , and his long , bony finger pointing at Mr. Jackson , said , in that peculiar voice of his ,  --  " Mr. Speaker ! - I am not that gentleman 's FRIEND , sir . I have never been his friend , sir ; nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! - when he took his seat . " Mr. Jackson , meantime , keeping his position on the floor , look . ing first upon Mr. Randolph , and then at the speaker , replied , - " Mr. Speaker , I am at a loss to know by what title to address the honorable member from Virginia ' ; - then pausing awhile , with his finger beside his nose , he said ,  --  ' I have it , sir , - I have it , - it shall be ' - looking Mr. Randolph full in the face - THE RIGHT HONORABLE DESCENDANT OF HER MAJESTY , QUEEN PocAHoNTAs ! ' " The entire countenance of Mr. Randolph changed instantly ; - and , from a look of mingled aversion and contempt , to a smile the most complaisant and gracious . The storm-cloud was dissipated , and the rainbow seemed to reflect all its hues upon his countenance , in one glow of heart-felt reconciliation , - when he bowed most courteously , giving evidence that of all the honors he had ever coveted , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he most highly prized . And who would not be proud of such a descent ? "
