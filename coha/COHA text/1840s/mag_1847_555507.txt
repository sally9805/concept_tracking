txt MR . WILLIAM B. REED is favorably known to our readers and to the literary and general public . Among our scholars and orators he occupies a distinguished rank . Not merely by the volumes before us , but by other elegant and excellent productions , he has added to the lustre of an honored parentage and name . Several of his addresses on literary and historical occasions have been published , and are of permanent interest and value . The Discourse delivered before the New York Historical Society , in December , 1839 , entitled The Infancy of the Union , conveys , in a short compass , more important instruction in illustration of our history than can be gleaned from many bulky volumes . Its object is to trace the origin and growth of the social union of the Colonies , preceding , and in fact , from the very first , preparing the way for , the political and national union which the Revolution and Federal Constitution fully developed and consummated . Before proceeding to notice particularly the literary execution and historical value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refresh the recollections of our readers relating to the life and character of their subject . Joseph Reed was born in Trenton , in the then British Province of New Jersey , on the 27th of August , 1741 . His family was of Irish origin and respectable standing , his father being actively engaged in commercial pursuits . No pains or expense were spared in the education of the son . He took his Bachelor 's degree at Princeton College in October , 1757 , delivering on the occasion an oration in Latin , which is still preserved . A fter pursuing the study of the law , under the care of Richard Stockton , he was admitted to the bar , in May , 1763 . He immediately sailed for England , where he completed his legal education in the Middle Temple , continuing there about two years . In the // spring of 1765 , he returned to America , and entered upon the practice of law in Trenton . He succeeded , in a very short time , to a large business , and attained a commanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father died , and early the next spring he embarked for England , to fulfil a matrimonial engagement contracted during his residence in the Middle Temple . In May , 1770 , he was married , at St. Luke 's Church , in the city of London , to Esther De Berdt , daughter of Dennis De Berdt , an eminent merchant , and at one time Agent for the Province of Massachusetts Bay . On returning to America , he removed from Trenton to Philadelphia , where his talents and accomplishments commanded high professional and social distinction . In 1772 , Lord Dartmouth succeeded Lord llillsborough as Secretary of State for the Colonies . Between Lord Dartmouth and Mr. De Berdt a personal and confidential intimacy existed , which , on the death of the latter , was continued in the person of his son . Through the agency of Mr. De Berdt , junior , a correspondence was brought about between Lord Dartmouth and Mr. Reed . On the 4th of January , 1772 , Mr. Reed wrote to his brother-in-law to the following effect . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my services in pointing out some things which would be of mutual advantage to both countries , and tend to make his administration honorable and useful . But the difficulty of introducing it in a proper manner , and free from any suspicion of interested views , has hitherto prevented it . The intelligence from this country has generally flowed through such corrupt channels as would expose any minister to danger and difficulty . I think I could procure his Lordship one or two correspondents in other Provinces , who would , if it was agreeable , render him any services in that way , and who have nothing to ask from him but his cheerful acceptance of their honest and disinterested endeavours to serve both the mother country and the Colonies . " - Vol . I. , p. 49 . It was signified that such communications would be agreeable to his Lordship . The correspondence that ensued is exceedingy interesting and valuable . Mr. Reed 's position as an active and , although quite young , a prominent asserter of Colonial rights , his sincere and earnest desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securities // which the Colonies demanded , his finished education , extensive and elevated connections , acquaintances , and correspondents in both countries , his incomparable facility and elegance of style , and the liberal , enlightened , and welltempered tone of his spirit , qualified him to perform the delicate and responsible part on which he had ventured , of conveying to the ministry a fair and candid , a just and fearless account of the condition and progress of the controversy in the Colonies . When we consider how fully the government were apprised of the strength , extent , and depth of the popular excitement by the letters of Mr. Reed , it is more unaccountable that they persisted in the policy which finally resulted in the loss of their colonial empire in America . Indeed , their management of the dispute , and of the war to which it led , exhibits a strange blindness and fatuity . From the beginning to the end , there was what in popular parlance is sometimes called " a run of ill-luck " in the measures of the ministry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , when the current of circumstances is adverse , reason loses its discernment , and the mind its guiding light ; " Men 's judgments are A parcel of their fortunes . " The first letter of Mr. Reed to Lord Dartmouth commenced thus - Philadelphia , December 22d , 1773 . " My Lord , - The present state of public affairs in this part of America so nearly affects the ease and honor of your administration , that I can not but think it my duty on this occasion to break through the common forms which your Lordship 's rank and my own respect would prescribe , and endeavour to inform you truly and faithfully of our present views and situation . " - Vol. i. , p. 51 . Five days afterwards he wrote again , informing him of the proceedings in Philadelphia , of the populace compelling the master of a tea-ship , when supplied by them with provisions and other necessaries for the voyage , upon two hours ' notice , to return to England without starting a box of his cargo . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made acquainted with facts , but with the circumstances , rank , and character of those who promote this opposition , it would be improper for me to conceal that it has originated and been conducted // by some of the principal inhabitants , and I may safely say countenanced and encouraged by all , as there has not been a single publication , nor have I beard one person speak , in favor of the measure . " Your Lordship will judge from these facts how general and unanimous the opinion is , that no article subject to a duty , for the purpose of raising revenue , ought to be received in America . Nor is it confined to this city ; your Lordship will see by the papers herewith , that the same opposition is made at New York , Charleston , and Boston , and you may rely upon it , the same idea prevails throughout the country . Any further attempt to enforce this act , I am humbly of opinion , must end in blood " Your Lordship 's goodness will , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as on the one hand I will not conceal or misrepresent , so on the other I would wish to avert the impending blow . " - Vol. i. , pp. 54 - 56 . On the 10th of June , 1774 , he wrote as follows - " The engagement I have made to give your Lordship a faithful account of the transactions in this city and Province , in the distant hope that my communications may be of some use , induces me still to trouble you . My opportunities are such as no officer of government can have , and as I have the most passionate and sincere desire to see a reconciliation between the mother country and the Colonies take place , I shall continue writing until I find it disagreeable to your Lordship , hoping , 1 confess , that I may contribute , in some small degree , to enable your Lordship to judge with precision , and point out some mode by which these unhappy disputes may be terminated to the satisfaction of both parties " Your Lordship , I think , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful consequences of civil war will ensue before the Americans will submit to the claim of taxation by Parliament ; I mention this that your Lordship may not be deluded by the suggestions of designing , interested people . " - Vol. i. , pp. 68- 70 . In a letter of July 25th , he alludes to his own agency in the patriotic movements . " Though I have had some share in the transactions in this city , I assure your Lordship it has been with reluctance , and if I could be convinced that submission to the claims of Parliament did not virtually and necessarily imply a surrender 1 ) 0th for myself and my children of the blessings of liberty , I should have borne testimony against some of the measures pursued . I am sure I speak not only my own sentiments , but the sentiments // of the most respectable in this city , when I say that there is nothing they so much lament as these unhappy differences , and that they will rejoice to see the old union and affection restored . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 25th exhibits the manliness of his tone , and the elevation of his principles , as a British and an American patriot . " Your Lordship is pleased to say that government has no intention to enslave the people of America , but to allow them all the freedom consistent with their connection with the parent state . ' If we are to be thus free , should it not have been distinguished in what instances our freedom is inconsistent with our connection , that , as reasonable beings , we might be convinced of the necessity and propriety of being less free than our brethren landholders in Britain ? la my poor . judgment , the declaratory law , and the acts passed respecting Boston , which are streams from the same fountain , degrade us from the scale of freedom ; the former , indeed , does not agree with your Lordship 's ideas of American liberty , which you think should be only partially restrained . Whereas this law is a general restraint , enacted by a power wholly independent of us , and binding us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatible with the rights of an English subject , than a violent one . " - Vol. i. , p. 77 . The following description of the Congress which met in Philadelphia , September 1st , 1774 , and of the state of feeling then pervading the people , takes its place as part of the record on the permanent pages of American history . " The Congress met here on the 1st of September , consisting of delegates from all the colonies , from New Hampshire to South Carolina inclusive , in all about fifty-two . They opened the meeting with great solemnity , and chose the Speaker of Virginia their Chairman , or President . They concluded their deliberations should be secret , which rule they observed until the publication of the inclosed papers . We only know that as yet great unanimity of sentiment prevails , and that a very large committee is engaged in stating the rights of an American subject . There are among them many persons of excellent sense and great abilities . The Boston delegates , who are critically situated , act with uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Lordship , and impute the loss of your protection to the misrepresentations of their enemies . But what shall I say to your Lordship of the appearances in this country ? What seemed a little time since to be a spark which might with pru. // dence have been extinguished , is now a flame which threatens ruin to both the parent and the child . The spirit of the people gradually rose when it might have been expected to decline , till the Quebec Bill added fuel to the fire . Then all those deliberate measures of petitioning previous to opposition were laid aside , as inadequate to the apprehended mischief and danger , and now the people are generally ripe for any plan the Congress advise , should it be war itself . I can hardly think that I am in the same place and among the same people , so great is the alteration of sentiment . As far as I can judge , should the merchants hesitate to comply with any suspension of trade the Congress direct , the people of the country will compel them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few days ago we were alarmed with a report that General Gage had cannonaded the town of Boston . So general a resentment , amounting even to fury , appeared everywhere , that I firmly believe , if it had not been contradicted , thousands would have gone , at their own expense , to have joined in the revenge . It was difficult to make them doubt the intelligence , or delay setting out . Those who served in the last war in the Provincial troops , others discharged from the recrulars , and many who have seen service in Germany , and migrated to this country , with such others as would have joined them , would have formed from the best accounts a considerable body . I believe , had the news proved true , an army of forty thousand men , well provided with every thing except cannon , would before this have been on its march to Boston . From these appearances , and the decided language of all ranks of people , I am convinced , my Lord , that if blood be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrors of a civil war . Unacquainted either from history or experience with the calamities incident to such a state , with minds full of resentment at the severity of the Mother Country , and stung with the contempt with which their petitions have always been received , the Americans are determined to risk all the consequences . " - Vol. i. , p. 78 . The last letter to Lord Dartmouth is dated February 10th , 1775 , and concludes with the following decisive sentiment - " This country will be deluged with blood , before it will submit to any other taxation than by their own legislature . - Vol. i. , p. 95 . The current of events grew more and more rapid every hour . The war broke out , a Continental army was organized . General Washington , on his way to the camp in Cambridge , // deiphia ; and on the 4th of July , 1775 , he was announced , in the General Orders , as Secretary to the Commander-inchief . No American patriot of that day had been more desirous to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy with the mother country had been brought by the obstinacy of ministers , but no one was more resolutely and deeply fixed in the determination to abide that issue , than Joseph Reed ; and when he attached himself to the military family of Washington , he knew the perils of the position . In a letter to a friend he said , - " I have no inclination to be hanged for half treason . When a subject draws his sword against his prince , he must cut his way through , if he means afterwards to sit down in safety . I have k ( ken too active a part in what may be called the civil part of opposition , to renounce without disgrace the public cause , when it seems to lead to danger , and have a most sovereign contempt for the man who can plan measures he has not spirit to execute . " - Vol. i. , pp. 105 , 106 . His education , talents , and energy of character were fully appreciated by Washington , and the services he rendered can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from head-quarters , by his aid and that of others . While Washington himself had a facility , purity , elegance , and dignity of style , which never suffered in comparison with the higher abilities of any who were associated with him at any period of his career , civil or military , he was particularly careful and skilful in the selection of the persons who were to share with him the labors of the pen . Mr. Reed from his early youth was an admirable writer , and his letters and official papers are models of their kind . In a mere literary point of view they will suffer from no criticism , but are marked with a freedom , fluency , and force rendering them interesting and instructive in the highest degree . Whatever events he described , or topics he treated , will not require to be cast into a new mould , but may be transferred at once to the use of the historian . Indeed , it is the peculiar charm of the history of the American Revolution , that it will hereafter be invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the form and the spirit of the drama . It will not be a narrative related by another , but a story told by the actors themselves , passing , // as it were , in very life across the stage . History in reference to most other epochs is a decoction of the lees of events and characters , selected by the arbitrary , prejudiced , and necessarily limited judgments of writers distant from the scene and the period , and boiled down into a reduced and confused compound . The filial affection and honorable ancestral pride of the descendants of the men of the Revolution , and the gratitude and enlightened patriotism of public bodies , are faithfully and busily recovering from decay and oblivion the memorials of the great actors in that struggle , and , by such publications as the one before us , are securing to them a brighter and more worthy fate . Heroes and sages are thus restored to living action , and as we read their letters , written from day to day and from hour to hour , the grand movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already been done , and much more will be done ; and when all that now slumbers in decaying manuscripts shall have received imperishable life from the press , the historian will be prepared to execute his office in a shape and with a spirit that will transcend all the forms in which genius and eloquence have heretofore attempted to perpetuate the knowledge of events . By a judicious and discriminating use of the materials thus provided , the immortal chieftain in that war of liberty , the Father of his country , and his associates in the camp and the cabinet , will enact their own parts , and the reader see and hear all that they did and suffered . The whole will be radiant with the interest which , at the time , belonged to the fearful risks , the exhausting toils , the anxious doubts , and glowing hopes , and triumphant rejoicings and plaudits , which alternately spread their clouds , and diffused their sunshine , from the beginning to the end of that long and eventful day of trial and of glory . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these living resources of our history . Not only does he tell his own story , and that of the Revolutionary struggle so far as he was connected with it , but he brings before us , in the same original vividness of delineation , many others of the great spirits of the day and the scene . There are letters from Generals Greene and Wayne especially , which present those two heroes and patriots to our imaginations and our hearts with an attractiveness which no description by a third person could possibly reach . Of General // St. Clair we had failed to receive any distinct or particularly interesting impression before ; but there is one letter from him , in these volumes , which will make us love and honor his memory for ever . During the latter part of October , 1775 , Mr. Reed returned to Philadelphia . In the ensuing year he was elected to the Assembly of Pennsylvania . In May , 1776 , Congress , at the express desire of General Washington , appointed him Adjutant-General , and the following extract from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that office . " You will be surprised , but I hope not dejected , when I tell you that a great revolution has happened in my prospects and views . Yesterday the General sent for me , and in a very obliging manner pressed me to accept the office of AdjutantGeneral , which General Gates lately filled . The proposition was new and surprising , so that I requested till this day to consider of it . I objected my want of military knowledge , but several members of Congress and the General treated it so lightly , and in short said so many things , that I have consented to go . I have been much induced to this measure by observing that this Province will be a great scene of party and contention this summer . The Courts are stopped , consequently no business done in my profession , and at all events my time so engrossed that I have not a moment to devote to keeping up my stock or adding to my law knowledge . The appointments of the office are equal to ? 700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these calamitous times are at an end . Besides , this post is honorable , and if the issue is favorable to America , must put me on a respectable scale . Should it be otherwise , I have done enough to expose myself to ruin . I have endeavoured to act for the best , and hope you will think so . " - Vol. i. , p. 190 . General Reed shared actively and prominently in all the dangers , disappointments , and distresses of the ensuing campaign , from the battle of Long Island with its train of disastrous consequences , to the evacuation of New York , the skirmishes that succeeded , the battle of White Plains , the loss of Port Washington , and the retreat through the Jerseys , - that darkest hour of the Revolution . In these and all subsequent scenes of his military experience , he proved himself a brave , active , and skilful officer . His courage rose to the height of romantic intrepidity , and eminently fitted him for perilous adventures , daring reconnoissances , and desperate 38* // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times shot under him . One of the instances he thus relates - " Just after I had sealed my letter to you , and sent it away , an account came that the enemy were advancing upon us in three large columns . We have so many false reports , that I desired the General to permit me to go and discover what truth there was in the account . I went down to our most advanced post , and while talking there with the officer of the guard , the enemy 's advanced guard fired upon us at about fifty yards ' distance - our men behaved well , stood , and returned the fire , till , overpowered by numbers , they were obliged to retreat . The enemy advanced upon us very fast . I had not quitted the house five minutes be . fore they were in possession of it . Finding how things were , I went over to the General to get some support for the brave fellows who had behaved so well . By the time I got there , the enemy appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulting manner , as is usual after a fox-chase . I never felt such a sensation before - it seemed to crown our disgrace . The General was prevailed upon to order out a party to attack them , and as I had been upon the ground , which no one else had , it fell to me to conduct them In a few minutes our brave fellows mounted up the rocks , and attacked the enemy with great spirit . At the same time some of our troops , in another quarter , moved up towards the enemy , and the action began . Major Leitch fell near me , in a few minutes , with three balls through him Colonel Knowlton , a brave Connecticut officer , also fell mortally wounded . I mounted him on my horse and brought him off . in about ten minutes , our people pressing on with great ardor , the enemy gave way and left us the ground , which was strewed pretty thick with dead , chiefly the enemy , though it since turns out our loss is also considerable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit ought to be immortal . I assisted him off , and when gasping in the agonies of death , all his inquiry was if we had driven in the enemy . The pursuit of a flying enemy was so new a scene , that it was with difficulty our men could be brought to retreat , which they did in very good order . We buried the dead and brought off the wounded on both sides , as far as our troops had pursued . We have since learned that the main body of the enemy was hastily advancing , so that in all probability there would have been a reverse of things , if the pursuit had not been given over . " You can hardly conceive the change it has made in our army . The men have recovered their spirits and feel a confidence which before they had quite lost . I hope the effects will // be lasting . You will probably hear from other quarters of the double escape I had . My own horse not being at hand when the alarm was first given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a shot just behind his fore-shoulder , which narrowly missed my leg . I am told he is since dead ; but the greatest was from one of our own rascals , who was running away . Upon my driving him back , he presented his piece and snapped it at me at about a rod distance . I seized a musket from another soldier , and snapped at him ; he had the same good luck . He has since been tried , and is now under sentence of death ; but I believe I must beg him off , as after I found I could not get the gun off , I wounded him on the head , and cut off his thumb with my hanger . I suppose many persons will think it was rash and imprudent in officers of our rank to go into such an action . General Putnam , General Greene , many of the General 's family , Mr. Tilghman , &amp;c. , were in it , but it was really to animate the troops , who were quite dispirited , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Vol. 1. , pp. 237 , 238 . It was during this campaign that General Reed became embarrassed by an entanglement into which he was drawn in a correspondence with Genera Charles Lee , occasioned by the loss of Fort Washington . It was the opinion of many of Washington 's military council that the attempt to hold that place ought not to have been made . This was the judgment , it was understood , of the Commander-in-chief himself , who was supposed to have been overruled by others , especially by the influence of General Greene . Several times during the war , at the battle of Germantown , for instance , as well as on this occasion , Washington incurred the censure of some of his associates , particularly among the younger and more inconsiderate officers , by attaching , as they thought , too much weight to the opinions of others , against his own better judgment . As , in the lapse of time , the evidence arising from the publication of original documents increases , the wisdom and greatness of Washington become vindicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position forbade his disclosing to any , even to his most confidential subordinates . With a sublime magnanimity , he silently endured reproach , not only from enemies , but from his nearest and most devoted friends , rather than jeopard the cause of the country by producing his justification . Reed was unhappily and imprudently ensnared into an interchange of letters with Lee , which , for a time , // exposed him to the imputation of sympathizing with the manner in which that officer censured the Commander-in-chief for having sacrificed Fort Washington and its brave garrison . An explanation shortly afterwards took place between the adjutant-general and his chief , most honorable to them both , and their former friendship and confidence were entirely restored . The reasons which induced the Commander-in-chief to hold on to Fort Washington are thus stated by him in a letter to Reed , written a few years afterwards . " The loss of Fort Washington , simply abstracted from the circumstances which attended it , was an event that gave me much pain , because it deprived the army of the services of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public of many valuable lives , by the cruelties which were inflicted upon them in their captive state . But this concern received additional poignancy from two considerations , which were but little known ; some of them will never be known to the world , because I shall never attempt to palliate my own foibles by exposing the error of another ; nor indeed could either of them come before the public , unless there had been such a charge as must have rendered an inquiry into the causes of this miscarriage necessary . The one was a non-compliance in General Greene with an order sent to him from White Plains , before I marched for the western side of Hudson 's River , to withdraw the artillery and stores from the Fort ; allowing him , however , some latitude for the exercise of his own judgment , as he was upon the spot , and could decide better , from appearances and circumstances , than I , the propriety of a total evacuation . The other was a Resolve of Congress , in these emphatical words : October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired , if it be practicable , by every art , and at whatever expense , to obstruct effectually the navigation of the North River , between Fort Washington and Mount Constitution , as well to prevent the regress of the enemy 's frigates lately gone up , as to hinder them from receiving succour . ' " XVhen I came to Fort Lee , and found no measures taken towards an evacuation , in consequence of the order before mentioned ; when I found General Greene , of whose judgment and candor I entertained a good opinion , decidedly opposed to it ; when I found other opinions coincident with his ; when the wishes of Congress to obstruct the navigation of the North River , which were delivered in such forcible terms to me , recurred ; when I knew that the easy communication between the different // parts of ' the army , then separated by the river , depended upon it ; and , lastly , when I considered that our policy led us to waste the campaign without coming to a general action on the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other , I conceived that every impediment which stood in their way was a means to answer these purposes ; and when thrown into the scale with those opinions , which were opposed to an evacuation , caused that warfare in my mind , and hesitation , which ended in the loss of the garrison ; and , being repugnant to my own judgment of the advisableness of attempting to hold the post , filled me with the greater regret . The two great causes , which led to this misfortune , and which I have before recited , as well perhaps as my reasoning upon it , which occasioned the delay , being concealed from public view , of course left the field of censure quite open for any and every laborer , who inclined to work in it ; and afforded a fine theme for the pen of a malignant writer who is always less regardful of facts than the point he wants to establish , where he has the field wholly to himself , where concealment of a few circumstances will answer his purpose , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different complexion to the same transaction . " - Vol. i. , pp. 263 , 264 . It is due to General Reed to observe , that , whatever he may have written or said to Lee or others , it could not have been in stronger or plainer terms than he used to Washington himself . The following passages are from a letter , dated December 22d , 1776 , just before the glorious affair at Trenton , by which the dying hopes of America were revived , and an impression made that secured the final triumph of the cause . Washington was already , it is believed , meditating the enterprise , which , four nights afterwards , he carried into effect with a heroism and energy never surpassed . " We are all of opinion , my dear General , that something must be attempted to revive our expiring credit , give our cause some degree of reputation , and prevent a total depreciation of the Continental money , which is coming on very fast ; that even a failure can not be more fatal , than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise must be undertaken in our present circumstances , or we must give up the cause . In a little time the Continental army will be dissolved . The militia must be taken before their spirits and patience are exhausted ; and the scattered , divided state of the enemy affords us a fair opportunity // of trying what our men will do , when called to an offensive attack . Will it not be possible , my dear General , for your troops , or such part of them as can act with advantage , to make a diversion , or something more , at or about Trenton ? " Allow me to hope that you will consult your own good judgment and spirit , and not let the goodness of your heart subject you to the influence of opinions from men in every respect your inferiors I will not disguise my own sentiments , that our cause is desperate and hopeless , if we do not take the opportunity of the collection of troops at present , to strike some stroke . Our affairs are hastening fast to ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Delay with us is now equal to a total defeat . Be not deceived , my dear General , with small , flattering appearances ; we must not suffer ourselves to be lulled into security and inaction , because the enemy does not cross the river . It is but a reprieve ; the execution is the more certain , for I am very clear that they can and will cross the river , in spite of any opposition we can give them . " Pardon the freedom I have used . The love of my country , a wife and four children in the enemy 's hands , the respect and attachment I have to you , the ruin and poverty that must attend me and thousands of others , will plead my excuse for so much freedom . " - Vol. i. , pp. 272 , 273 . Immediately upon receiving the letter which contained these remarkable passages , Washington sent for Reed , and communicated to him the outlines of the contemplated attack on Trenton . The language we have quoted , particularly that in Italics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that it was kindly and respectfully received illustrates the true greatness of him to whom it was addressed . In the consultations , reconnoissances , and gallant achievements connected with the battles of Trenton and Princeton , General Reed bore an important and conspicuous part . On the 12th of May , 1777 , he was elected by Congress a brigadier-general , and it was designed to commit to him the command of the entire cavalry forces of the army ; but he declined the appointment , as he did also , about the same time , that of Chief Justice of Pennsylvania , his nomination having been the first made under the new government of that State . He had previously resigned the office of adjutant general , in which he was succeeded by Timothy Pickering . Ever after this he declined all permanent appointments in the // army , but served , wherever danger threatened or opportunities of usefulness offered , as a volunteer . On the 14th of September , 1777 , he was elected by the Pennsylvania Assembly a delegate to Congress . In the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Johnstone arrived , with conciliatory propositions from the mother country . Whatever might have been the effect , at an earlier stage of the conflict , and under more favorable circumstances , of the concessions and assurances then offered , the measure was utterly baffled , and involved in irretrievable and exasperating failure , by an attempt , on the part of one of the British commissioners , to employ bribery . Governor Johnstone , through the agency of a Mrs. 3'erguson , a mutual acquaintance , proposed to General Reed inducements of personal arid private advantage . He was offered ten thousand guineas , and any office in British America . The answer , instantly and indignantly made to the glittering but base proposal , will carry down the name of Joseph Reed with the brightest lustre to all future ages - " I am not worth purchasing , but such as I am , the king of Great Britain is not rich enough to buy me . " On the 1st of December , 1778 , he was unanimously chosen by the Assembly of Pennsylvania President of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reelection as long as the constitutional limit allowed , until December , 1781 . No one , who does not study the evidence contained in this work , can estimate the importance to the American cause of the services rendered during these years by President Reed . Pennsylvania , besides being more than any other State the centre and heart of the war , was particularly embarrassed and distressed by peculiar social and local difficulties . Evils arising from its proprietary institutions , and , for political and military purposes , the unmanageable character and notions of a large part of its population , placed obstacles in the way of administering its government and drawing out its resources . The Tory portion of its population , very considerable in numbers , and still more so in influence , artfully fomented and effectually aggravated its internal political dissensions , too often turning the hands and hearts of the friends of liberty against each other . To complete the mischief , Arnold was in command at Philadelphia , and at the same time secretly in traitorous correspondence // with the enemy . President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this treason , had the sagacity to discern the profligacy of his character , and encountered all the opposition which his active and powerful malignity could excite . Arnold exerted a disastrous influence in Congress , and to some extent succeeded in casting a shadow between the President of Pennsylvania and the Commander-in-chief . But when , at last , the whole depth of the traitor 's depravity was disclosed , justice was done to the patriotic penetration and energy of those who had boldly and faithfully resisted his arbitrary deportment and endeavoured to check his profligate career . The term of office of President Reed extended beyond the active military struggles of the Revolution , and the services he rendered can not be overestimated . The following summary gives but a faint idea of his toils and trials . " Thus was the Chief Magistrate of the State , in these times of varied responsibility , directing legislation , administering an active executive trust , presiding in the highest court of justice , superintending the recruiting service and the discipline of militia troops , - occasionally , as will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading them to the field , - and all this amidst the fury of party conflict , and in the agony of a civil and an Indian war . Little , indeed , is it to be wondered at that the overtasked spirit broke at last under the burden ; for at this time , it must be remembered , that Mr. Reed was not forty years of age . Five years later , he was in his grave . " - Vol. ii. , p. 178 . After the war , in the hope of recruiting his exhausted strength , and arresting his declining health , he visited Eng .. land ; but it was too late . The following is the inscription over his tomb . " In memory Of the virtues , talents , and eminent services of GENERAL JOSEPH REED .

Her loss was irreparable , and , cooperating with the pressure and burden of public cares and patriotic solicitudes , hastened his own descent into the grave . The last child of General Reed , born May 26th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have already drawn upon the work before us , we can not refrain from making the following extract . We wish to insert upon our pages an example of heroism and self-devotion , which must be allowed to be one of the brightest and most truly glorious passages in the naval annals of our country . " In General Washington 's letter of the 4th of June , he thanked Mr. Reed for naming after him The Young Christian . ' This was George Washington Reed , whose brief career , so far as it was public , is not without interest . He was thoroughly educated , and , after being graduated at Princeton College , in 1798 , entered the navy of the United States , as a midshipman . He was soon promoted , and in 1803 was lieutenant of the Nautilus schooner , under the command of Richard Somers , and attached to Preble 's squadron , before Tripoli . Lieutenant Reed was in command of the Nautilus in the attack of the 28th of August , and is referred to with high praise by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night of the 4th of September , Somers undertook the perilous enterprise of entering the harbour of Tripoli , on board the fire-ketch Intrepid . Its mysterious and fatal result is well known . It was eight o'clock , ' says the biographer of Somers , in // the evening , before the Intrepid lifted her anchor ; the Argus , Vixen , Nautilus , weighing , and standing in , in company . The night was sufficiently advanced to cover the movement , and all four vessels stood towards the rocks , under their canvas . The last person who left the ketch was Lieutenant Washington Reed , then first of the Nautilus . This officer did not quit his Commander , until it was thought necessary for him to rejoin the vessel of which he was now in charge . When he went over the side of the Intrepid , all communication between the gallant spirits she contained , and the rest of the world , ceased . At that time every thing seemed propitious ; Somers was cheerful , though calm ; and perfect order and method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serious with the officers , though the common men appeared to be in high spirits . This was about 9 , r . M. The Argus and Vixen lay off at a little distance from the rocks to attack the galleys or gun-boats , should either attempt to follow the party out in their retreat , while the Nautilus shortened sail , and accompanied the ketch , as close in as was deemed prudent , with the especial intention of bringing off the boats . Lieutenant Reed directed the present Commodore Ridgely , then one of the Nautilus 's midshipmen , to watch the ketch 's movements , with a night-glass ; and as this order was strictly complied with , it is almost certain that this officer was the last person of the American squadron who saw the vessel . She seemed to be advancing slowly . ' In a few minutes later , the ketch exploded under the batteries of Tripoli , and the fate of Somers and the gallant crew was darkened for ever . Somers , Decatur , Reed , and Stewart , the actors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia sailors . But one of them now survives . " Lieutenant Reed accompanied General Eaton 's detachment to the coast of Africa , and served on board the vessel which cooperated with him on that romantic expedition . " When war was declared against England , Mr. Reed having then been promoted to the grade of Commander , though in extremely delicate health , solicited active service and took command of the Vixen brig-of-war of 12 guns , then fitting for sea in one of our eastern ports . Whilst on a cruise in the West Indies , the Vixen was captured by the Southampton frigate of 32 guns , commanded by Sir James Lucas Yeo . On the night of the capture , both vessels , being under heavy press of sail , were almost simultaneously wrecked on one of the Bahama keys . The Vixen sank so rapidly , that the prize crew barely had time to save their lives ; the American prisoners having been previously transferred to the Southampton . On board the frigate , a scene // of great disorder occurred ; the British sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of their officers , and it was only by the aid of the American prisoners , officers ark ( l men , that the mutiny was suppresscd . " On arriving at Jamaica , Sir James Yeo publicly returned thanks for the assistance thus rendered , and at once offered Captain Reed his parole . This was declined , on the ground that he would under no circumstances leave his officers and crew , among whom the disease of the climate had already made its appearance , and over whom their commander , himself destined to be its earliest victim , watched with the most affectionate solicitude . Every day , in all the extremity of the climate , he repaired from Spanishtown to Kingston , to be with and relieve the wants of his men . The exposure soon produced its ordinary results , and he was attacked by a tropical fever . His constitution , never very robust , soon yielded , and on the 4th of January , 1813 , he died at the early age of thirty-three. " - Vol. a. , pp. 23O*-232 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but indicate their peculiar excellence , when we say that they will be perused with greater interest in proportion to the previous amount of information the reader may possess of the Revolutionary era ; and if he is wholly ignorant of the events and characters belonging to it , they are , perhaps , of all others , what we should first place in his hands . The biographer has shown equal wisdom and modesty in allowing his hero and those associated with him to occupy the stage , not appearing himself but at infrequent intervals and for brief periods , where connecting links and explanatory remarks are needed to sustain and illustrate the narrative . Much that we had intended to reserve to the conclusion , commendatory of the work and of its preeminent historical h*-terest and value , has been incidentally anticipated in the notice we have compiled from it of the life and character of its subject . There is but one point upon which we would suggest a criticism upon the composition of these volumes . It is a criticism to which several recent works , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . In the notes and in the body of the work , passages are introduced in foreign languages , and unaccompanied by translations . For this practice we can imagine no recommendations , while objections to it are obvious and great . It surely can not be designed or desired to limit the readers of valuable works to that class // of ' persons who are familiar with other languages than their own . Sometimes , where questions of construction may occur , or any circumstances attach importance or interest especially to the mere phraseology of a passage or document , it may be proper to give it in the original ; but even then a translation might well accompany it . Foreigners , who read the work at all in its English dress , of course are not particularly accommodated by a sentence here and there in their own language , while the vast majority of readers are disappointed and provoked by being excluded from instruction and entertainment , often at points where their curiosity is most excited , and by having the current of their thoughts suddenly intercepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in effect , a sort of discourtesy on the part of the writer to the great bulk of his readers . We would promote to any practicable extent the study of the modern and the ancient languages , but must protest against excluding from the full enjoyment of our own literature all who have not the means of becoming familiar with them . To mix up in our best books French and Spanish , German and Italian , Greek , Latin , Hebrew , or any other languages , is a violation of the dignity of our own tongue . The English language is destined to spread over both hemispheres , and has a surer prospect of ultimately becoming universal than any ever uttered by man . The world-embracing conquests and dependencies of Great Britain have given it prevalence in a large portion of the older continents , and the northern latitudes of this . It is advancing over America with the expanding boundaries of our Union . The commerce , navigation , enterprise , philanthropy , and superior political institutions of the two leading nations of the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are carrying it to all the islands of the sea , and extending it along all shores . We may confidently believe that the literature it bears on its bosom will find continually multiplying readers in all lands . Let our writers be just to its claims and its dignity ; and let them be just to themselves , by securing to the widest extent the field it is thus ever opening and expanding before them.
