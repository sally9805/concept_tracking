Smith , Seba , 1792-1868 : A CHOICE OF LIFE . from A choice of life ( 1843 ) I covet not wealth , and I care not for fame , But if my own lot I might choose , A quiet retreat in some lone wood I 'd claim , Where the pure earth drinks Heaven 's pure dews . At the north a dark mountain should solemnly rise , With its old trees by lightnings riven , And its bald rocky summit look out from the skies To point me the right way to Heaven . Far away to the south a green valley should spread , And up from its bosom should gleam , Through maples and elms , a bright silvery thread Of a slow-winding , pure crystal stream ;  --  And a small quiet lake , on whose unruffled breast The wild duck might fearlessly play , Should spread its soft waters away to the west , And blush in the sunsetting ray ;  --  And the stout-armed oak with its deep scolloped leaves Throw its shade on my cottage door , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvest restore . With the wife of my heart , and my joyous sons , And my book and my pen , here I 'd rest , And the wealth and the power of earth 's mightiest ones , Were they mine , could not make me more blest .
