txt The period embraced in this work of Mr. Alison furnishes more copious materials for a brilliant narrative than any period of the same length in the history of nations . To commence with a description*of the " earthquake that opened under the Bourbon throne , " and let down a whole dynasty of kings , and end with the battle of Waterloo , which overthrew an Emperor and an Empire , is to commence and end with all that is exciting in the history of man . The selection of this period shows the taste and character of the writer . Of an ardent temperament and highly poetic imagination , the terrific scenes that followed each other in such rapid succession from the first outbreak in Paris , are , to him , but so many separate passages in a great tragedy of which Bonaparte was the hero , and Waterloo the closing act . The history of this period is , for the most part , a history of battles , in the description of which lies Mr. Atison 's peculiar excellence . He is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vivid description and brilliant style can take captive ourjudgment and blind our criticism . Ask the hundreds who speak in rapturous terms of his work , Why they are so enchanted with it , and the answer is , " he is a splendid writer-do you remember the description of the Battle of Wagram , Borodino and Waterloo ? " Of the truth of the great political events he narrates , the skill manifested in their grouping , and the causes which led to them , we hear nothing of praise . The arrangement of the work is exceedingly faulty , confusing us more than ue ever remember to have been confused in reading the history of so short a period . The style , which is animated and racy , making us eye-witnesses of the terrific scenes he depicts , is yet often inflated and eminently careless . A sentence in the opening paragraph of the very first chapter , is but one of many examples . In speaking of the French Revolution he says , " From the flame which was kindled in Europe the whole world has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon both hemispheres from the effect of its expansion . " The figure here introduced by " conflagration , " and carried out by " expansion , " Mr. Alison may think very good English , but it is any thing but good rhetoric . * History of Europe from the commencement of the French Revolution in 1689 , to the Restoration of the Bourbons in 1815 . By Archibald Alison , F. R. S. E. Advocate . Ii* four Volumes . New York , Harper &amp; Brothers . // The opening pages of such a work we should expect to see devoted to the causes which produced the French Revolution-the great event which commences the history . But we were not prepared to find nearly forty pages occupied in drawing a parallel hetween it and the English Revolution under Cromwell , going hack to the En*lish Settlement and the Danish and Anglo- Saxon Conquests . The English Revolution does not come into the period of his history ; and to lead us down through the half harbarism of England in the early ages , and through all her feudal history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is as foolish as it is confusing . Were one to write a history of England or France from its origin , it would he interesting to trace how civilization and liberty grew step hy step , till they reached their present state in the nation . But the inappropriateness of the thing is our least objection . His philosophy and logic are false from beginning to end ; and here , at the outset , we state the grand fault of Mr. Alison in compiling this history . He is a high Tory , and nomore fit to write of this period , ushered in by tha outbreak of the Republican spirit , and carried on with all the wildness of newly recovered and untamed freedom , than an Ultra Chartist of Birmingham to write the feudal history of England . A man falsifies history in two ways-first by falsifying facts -- second , by misstating the causes of those facts . The last we consider the most culpable of the two , and of this crime Mr. Alison stands heavily charged . He set out with the determination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongly coloring facts , he exposes himself to the most ridiculous blunders , and contradicts his own assertions to secure his end . Whenever he speaks of " Democracy , " or the " Rights of the people , " he evidently has before him the riots of Birmingham , the Chartist " Bill of Rights , " and the petition of three millions of Englishmen for universal suffrage . This picture warps his judgment sadly , and his philosophical " reflections on the French Revolution are a mixture of false logic , self-contradictions , and merest common places from first to last . Thus , at the outset , in the very parallel we were speaking of , he says of the English Revolution , " the pulpit was the fulcrum on which the whole efforts of the popular leaders rested , and the once venerable fabric of the English Monarchy , to which so large a portion of its influential classes have in every age of its history been attached , yielded at last to the force of fanatical phrensy . " " In France , the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp;c . In other words , true religion was with the royalists in both rebellions , and fanaticism or infidelity with the republicans . Now in the first place , if this be true , why lead us down through the dark ages to show the causes of the English Revolution-why talk to us of the struggle for principlewhy boast of the moderation of the people during its progress , and the regard to individual rights . Fanaticism is not so discriminating and just when it seizes the sword , and Mr. Alison has falsified one of the most important events of English History . The statement is equally untrue with regard to the French Revolution . No attack was made on religion , nor did it enter one way or other into the conflict as a great element , until the priests began to declaim from the pulpits against the assembly , denouncing every act of the reformers as sacrilegious , and exciting the people to resistance . The church took sides with the throne and the aristocracy , as it had been partner in their oppressions and rapacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cromwellian rebellion growing out of the fanaticism of the priests it sprung from the Parliament itself . The despotism of Charles I. , his dangerous encroachments on the liberty of speech , and on the Constitution , were borne with till longer endurance became a crime . The whole history of the Long Parliament denies this statement of Mr. Alison . . Charles I. trampled on the laws of England : he was tried for his crime and beheaded . The struggle . that followed is chargeable on those who defended the throne in its wrong-doing . There was no need of rebellion ; and there would have been none but for the tyranny of the king and the injustice of his friends . The conflict was between the parliament and the throne . The people sided with the parliament , and the throne went down . It was a struggle for the supremacy of British law and British rights , and hence was conducted with the moderalion and justice which the cause demanded . New , turn to the French Revolution  --  and what lay at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulating through ages . There were really but two classes in France -- the privileged a nd unprivileged-the // taxed and untaxed  --  the devoured and devourers . Mr. Alison acknowledges , " there was a difference in the circumstances of the two countries at the period when their respective revolutions arose , l ) ut not so much as to make the contest in the one the foundation of a new distribution of property , and a different balance of power in the other the chief means of maintaining the subsisting interests of society , the existing equilibrium of the world . " There was just this difference : The contest in England was for order and the supremacy of right and law , in France it was for bread . Stern , unbending principle guided the one , starvation and desperation the other . The inevitable result must be the establishment of justice in the one case , and the overthrow of everything established in the other . Rousseau never uttered a truer sentiment than in saying , " when the poor having nothing to eat they will eat the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts of a people in the great mass of it , have grown mad , the combined issue of that peoples ' workings will be madness-an incoherency and ruin . " It must be so . With the first consciousness of power they cry out as they run over the long catalogue of their sulkrings , " plunder shall he paid with plunder , violence with violence , and blood with . blood . " The same influence of his hatred of democracy , blinding his judgment and compelling him to misstate facts , is seen in the proximate causes he gives as leading to the Revolution . It would be too gross a misstatement to declare that there was not sufficient suffering iii France to produce an insurrection , as the Duke of Wellington once said there was no suffering in England . He acknowledges it , hut thinks it has been overrated . Still , the picture he draws of the misery of the lower classes is frightful . The taille and vingtieme imposts fell heavily on the farmer , so that out of the produce of his land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters being divided between the proprietor and the king . This alone would reduce the population of any country to starvation and consequent madness . Accustomed to yield to arbitrary power , the people never dreamed of resistance tilldriven toitbydespair . Men dare ask for bread anywhere . The bayonet and scaffold can be contemplated with more calmness than famine . Out of this state of feeling grew the Revolution and all its horrors . Mr. Alison admits there was sufficient suffering and oppression to create an outbreak-indeed , he goes as far as to make the lower classes 76 per cent . poorer than the laborer in England , which is a degree of poverty beyond our conception-yet he affirms that the Revolution was started by the upper classes , and could have been checked by them at any moment ; nay , he puts the blame of setting it in motion on such dreamers as Voltaire and Rousseau , who uttered fine sentiments about liberty , equality , etc . In making a statement so opposed to facts , he doubtless has in his mind such men as Carlyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling with such wonderful effect upon the English people . It needs but a glance to see where the grand difficulty lay . The leaders of the mobs knew it well , and wrote epigramatically , " tout va bien ici , le pain manqeee , " all goes well  - -  there is a lack of bread . The first attack of the populace was on one who said a man could live on seven sous a day . Then followed attacks on taxgatherers and bakers . lie first man hung at the lamp-post , Foulon , was hung for replying to the people 's cry of distress , " let them eat grass . " Watch the army of women swarming around Versailles , crying , " bread ! bread ! " See them gathered around their watch-fire at midnight , devouring the remains of a horse . Hear them screaming back to the national assembly , whither they had forced themselves , " du pain pas tant de long discours " - bread , and not long speeches . There lies the cause of the disease , and not all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must , but submission came too late . They themselves had backed the waters till , when the barriers gave way , the flood must sweep every thing under . But to acknowledge this was to admit the danger that now threatens England , and sanction the Chartists in their ceaseless petitions to the throne and parliament for reform . Carrying out his monarchical sympathies , Mr. Alison also charges on Democracy the blood and devastation that followed in the wake of the Revolution . He gives us a synopsis of the declaration of the " Riaa*rs OF MAN , " by the Assembly , in which he says , " it declares the onginal equality of mankind ; that the ends of the social muon are liberty , property , security , and resistance to oppression ; that sovereignty resides in the nation , // and every power emanates from them ; that freedom consists in doing every thing which does not injure another ; that law is the expression of the general will ; that public burdens should be borne by all the members of the state in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extended to all ; and that the exercise of natural rights has no other limits but their interference with the rights of others . " " In these positions , considered abstractly , " says Mr. Alison , " there is much in which every reasonable man must acquiesce . " We say , on the contrary , that every " reasonable man must acquiesce " in the whole , " abstractly . " There are no plainer principles in human logic . They are axioms , considered " abstractly , " no man can doubt , while we believe they are not only " abstractly " but practically true . They rest at the very foundation of our government , and if they be not true our government is a lie . The want of means in carrying them out does not prove their falsity , but the power of man to turn his greatest blessings into evils . Yet , reasonable as he admits some of them to be , considered " abstractly , " he calls them , in another place , " a di , eet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Constitution of the United States , is " a digest of anarchy , " an assertion which the history of our country for the last fifty years , fully contradicts . To this " digest of anarchy , " this explosion of democracy , he attributes all the hor. rors of the revolution . He devotes whole pages to very grave and very sad reflections upon it , and at the end of almost every chapter on this period , he pours forth his " note of woe " on the acts of republicanism . Now , no one doubts the danger of suddenly giving too much power and freedom to slaves . The eye long accustomed to darkness , can not bear immediately the full splendor of noonday . The oppression of centuries , when suddenly broken , does not end in calm and intelligent action . We do not find fault with Mr. Alison for preaching this doctrine , but for preaching this alone . There are three other great truths to be considered in connection with this , before we can form a correct judgment upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start this long array of ills , is that its natural action , or is it the re-action of something else ? Was it not human nature , long chained , and scourged , and trampled on , suddenly taking vengeance on its oppres sors , and wiping out with one bloody stroke the long arrears of guilt ? Were the horrors of the Revolution the result of democracy merely or of vengeance ? Is it to be wondered at , that the captive , so long bound and goaded to madness , should fling abroad his arms a little too wildly at the first recovery of his freedom , and shake the bars of his cage a little too roughly ? We believe the great truth , after all , to be drawn from that bloody tragedy , is the evils of long oppression , and not the evils of giving man his rights . The primal ultimate cause is the one that should have engaged Mr. Alison 's attention and reflections , and not the secondary proximate cause . The youth of the world should learn a different lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , granting that the crimes and violence of the revolution did naturally and entirely grow out of republicanism , we believe they did not begin to compare with the misery and suffering caused by the tyranny that preceded it . One million is supposed to have perished during the Reign of Terror . Frightful as this waste of life and happiness is , we do not believe it is the half of that produced by the reign of despotism . The guillotine loaded with human victims-whole crowds of men , women and children shot down in the , public streets , and the murders and massacres on every side , that made rrance reek in her own blood , make the world stand aghast-for the spectacle is open and public . We have seen every one of that million cut down by the sword of violenc* ' , but the thrice one million that have perished , one by one , during the antecedeixt ages , under the grinding hand of oppression , and slow torture of famine , and all the horrors of a starved people , dying sil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know nothing of . Generation after generation melted away , whose cries of distress no ear heard hot that of Rim who in the end avenges the helpless . Let Mr. Alison utter his lamentations over these millions who died none the less painfully because they perished silently , as well as over the victims of the revolution . But in the third place , we deny the former supposition to be true , believing that the great danger of giving the ignorant masses sudden freedom , arises from two causes . The first is the strong sense of retributive justice in the human bosom . Assuming the doctrine , " an eye for an // eye and a tooth for a tooth , " to be just , they will at once turn round and spoil their spoilers . The desperation of famine guided by this feeling , shed the first blood in Paris . The second and continuing cause arises from tyranny itself . The love of power may be as dominant in the heart of a peasant as of a prince . There are multitudes that want only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all tyrants who by nature are fitted to be . All they need to make them enact the same follies and crimes the titled and legalized tyrants are committing before them , is the means of doing it . These men flourish in revolution . If possessed with energy and skill , they will lead the blind and ignorant masses where they please . Appealing to their prejudices and passions , and fears of renewed oppression , they excite them to renewed massacres and bloodshed . This was the case in Paris , and the horrors enacted during the Reign of Terror were not so much the work of democrats as aristocrats . We are to look for the causes of actions , not in men , but the principles that guile them . Who looks upon 1obespiere , Danton , Marat , Conthon and Barrere , as Republicans . They were such men as the despots of the world are made of . Seekin* the same ends with those who had crushed France so lon*-viz : power at whatever costthey made use of the passions of the mob to elevate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding their baser desires , they both ruled and trampled on them . It was ambition and tyranny that drenched France in bloodthe same that had reduced it to starvation , only by different means . In the one case they were manifested through the steady action of an oppressive governmnent , in the other through the passions uf a mob . The love of equality and the love of power are two very different things . Tyranny is no less tyranny because it puts on the cap of liberty , and despotism is just the same , whether it seeks its ends through authority or violence . This inability on the part of Mr Alison to see any virtue in republicanism forces him into statements that are calculated to mislead his readers in that most important truth now before the world-the progress and tendency of the democratic spirli among men . Wrong may be done to individuals in belying their motives , and injustice to military leaders by depriving them of their just reward of praise , but these are small errors compared to the wrong of charging on Liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never deserved . It is for this reason our remarks seem to be aimed at one point . This is the great error of Mr. Alison 's work , and there could he no greater . lie incurs a heavier responsibility who teaches us wrong on the great doctrine of human freedom , than he who errs on all other points beside . Were this sympathy of his for monarchical institutions kept within ordinary bounds , we should say nothing ; but he travels out of his way to strike republicanism , and whenever the plain facts he relates might be construed contrary to his wishes , he obtrudes on us a long list of reflections , often , it is true , very stupid , but sometimes exceedingly plausible . This tendency of his is a matter of feeling , rather than judgment , and hence leads him into endless blunders and contradictions . A.fter ( levoting one chapter to the disastrous campaign of 1793 , the first under the republic , he closes with six reflections , among which ( No. 2 ) is the followino- : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the capability of an enthusiastic population alone to withstand the attacks of a powerful regular army . " And what is the ground of this sage coiiclusion ? Why this campaign , planned and appointed while . France was heavin0 like the breast of a volcano to the fires that rated within her , badly conducted , and feebly prosecuted , had been disastrous to the French army . It is a hasty conclusion , not only groundless in this case , but false in every way . There can be no rule laid ( lown in such matters ; but as far as history can settle it , it proves directly the reverse . Look at the wars of the Tyrol and Switzerland , in which rude peasants , led on by such men as Tell and Winkelried , overthrew the best disciplined armies on the continent . Go over our own battle-fields , where valor and enthusiasm triumphed over troops that had stood the shock of the firmest battalions of Europe . But it is not with the principle we quarrel so much as the inference he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next chapter devoted to an account of the Vendean war , he gives us a most thrilling description of the valor and enthusiasm of the peasants . Army after army sent to subdue them were utterly annihilated . The peasants of // Vendee* according to Mr. Alison , were rude and " illiterate , ignorant of military discipline , " and of the most ordinary rules of war , yet they fought six hundred battles before they were subdued . Occupied on their farms , they continued their peaceful labors till it was announced , an army was on their borders . Then the tocsin soundel in every village , and the church bells rang out their alarum , and the peasants armed with pikes , pitchforks , muskets , and whatever they could place hands on , flocked from every quarter to the place of rendezvous . Thus armed and organized , they offered up their vows to the Supreme Being , and while the priests and women were assembled in prayer , fell with the might of a brave and enthusiastic people on their foes , and crushed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government gathered its best armies around this resolute province till 100,000 men hemmed it in , some of them composing the choicest troops of France . The tocsin again was sounded and the alarm bells rang , and the peasants assembled and the armies were routed . Without cannon , without discipline , they boldly advanced against the oldest battalions of France . On the open field they marched up in front of the artillery , and , as they saw the first flash , prostrated themselves on their faces , and when the storm of grape had passed by , rose and fell like an avalanche on their foes , charging the cannoniers at their own pieces , and trampling down the steady ranks like grass beneath their feet . Prodigies of valor were wrought , and acts of heroism exhibited in this war , to which the history of the world scarcely furnishes a parallel . The population , men , women and children , turned out en masse at the first alarm . Every hut sent forth a soldier , till an army of forty or fifty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so undisciplined were they , that as soon as the enemy were routed and driven from their province , they disbanded to their homes till another army made its appearance . Speaking of their bravery and success , Mr. Alison says , " thus was the invasion of six armies , amounting to 100,000 troops , part of whom were the best soldiers of France , defeated , and losses inflicted on the Republicans , incomparably greater than they had suffered from all the allies put together since the commencement of the war  --  a memorable instance of what can be effected by resolute men , even without the advantages of d regular organization , if ably conducted against the most formidable superiority of military force . " And in speaking of the expedition of the Vendean army beyond the Loire , whither they had gone expecting to meet the English under Lord Moira , he says this army , before it fell " without magazines or provisions , at th' distance of forty leagues from its home , and surrounded by three hostile armies , marched one hundred and seventy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven battles , killed twenty thousand of the Republicans , and took from them one hundred pieces of cannon , trophies greater than were gained by the vast allied armies in Flanders during the whole campaign . " This war of peasants with veteran troops , marked by such bravery and enthusiam on the one side , and such atroctities on the other , furnishes Mr. Alison with excellent materials for his accustomed quota of reflections ; and what are they ? - " Such , " he says , " were the astonishing results of the enthusiastic valor which the strong feelings of loyalty and religion produced in this gallant people ; such the magnitude of the result , when , instead of cold calculation , vehement passion was brought into action . " Place this philosophic and moral reflection beside the one we quoted , as made at the close of the first campaign of the Republic against the allied forces on the Rhine . " These considerations are calculated to dispel the popular illusion , as to the capability of an enthusiastic population alone to withstand the attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to admire most here , the awkward look of this Janusheaded philosophy , or the solemn assurance with which the contradictory faces look down on us . But what is the reason of this strange twist in his logic ? Simply this : When speaking of the defeat of the Republicans in their contests with the allied forces , it was the enthusiasm of democrats against disciplined royalists ; in the other case , the enthusiasm of reryalists against disciplined democrats . A " popular illusion " becomes a grave fact with Mr. Alison , in the short space of one chapter , and the " enthusiasm and valor " of republicans and royalists has an entirely different effect on the serried ranks of a veteran army . l3ut the flat contradiction he here gives himself , is of no great consequence , only as it illustrates our // first statement , that , he can not be relied on in those cases , where monarchical and republican principles or men come in collision . The deductions of such a man are false and injurious , and the same spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his sympathy with monarchy is not stranger than his sympathy with England ; and we find , that no trust can be placed in him , whenever in his narrative his own government and country are contrasted with others . His account of the lush Rebellion , during this period , and indeed his whole description of the affairs of that unhappy country , are shamefully false ; and we must believe , in charity , that Mr. Alison never thoroughly studied the history of Ireland . He was too much occupied in tracing the marches and battles of those armies that shook Europe with their tread , to devote much time or space to the struggles of a few millions of Irishmen . We should be indignant with the heartlessness evinced in his opening paragraph on the history of Ireland , were it not for the ludicrous solemnity with which the words are uttered . " In surveying the annals of this unhappy country , it appears impossible , at first sight , to explain the causes of its suffering , by any of the known principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been equally unavailing to heal its wounds-conquest has failed in producing submission , severity in enforcing tranquillity , indulgence in awaking gratitude . " There spoke the self-complacent Englishman . With what a patronising air , and deploring tone , he refers to this " unhappy country , " and how utterly unable to account for its ill-will . We can not sympathise with Mr. Alison in his surprise , for , in all our knowledge of the history of nations , we have never read of such national perfidy and oppression and cdielty so long continued , as the whole history of the English and irish connection presents . How England could have heaped more insults and wrong and misery on Ireland than she has , without exterminating her , we are unable to see . " The first British soverei0n , " says Mr. Alison , " who directed his attention to the improvement of Ireland , was James 1 . He justly boasted , that there would be found the true theatre of his glory , and that he had done more in a single reign for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pre decessors from the days of Henry II . " And what was the result of all this kindness on the part of James I. , " Instead of increased tranquillity and augmented gratitude , there broke out , shortly after , the dreadful rebellion of 1641 , which was only extiiiguished in oceans of blood . " Poor return this for the kindness of the indulgent monarch . But in what consisted the kindness of King James , that it so outshone all that had been done by his predecessors since Henry II. , and which , instead of awakening gratitude , exasperated the Irish into rebellion ? Elizabeth had commenced an extensive scheme of confiscating Irish estates , but as she approached her grave her injustice alarmed her fears , for she thought of that tribunal above all earthly tribunals , and immediately gave order to have the confiscation stopped , and some of the estates restored . The very first act of kind King James was to recommence this plan of confiscation . The Earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnel first fell beneath his hand . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was not only never proved , but never attempted to be proved , all the land of which they were chiefs , to the amount of *00,000 acres , fell to King James . Having accomplished this benevolent act , he undertook to establish an English colony there , but fearing the Irish Parliament would defeat his plans , he createdforty boroughs at once in order to have a majority in the house . This was very kind of the king , but his kindness did not stop here . his next act was to appoint a commission " for the discovery of defective titles " in Irish estates . A band of " discoverers , " who were rewarded according to their success , went through the country prying into the private affairs of the nobility , and wringing from them large sums as fees to pay for not being robbed . But witnesses had also to be suborned , bribes and tortures and violence used , till the annual expense of carrying out this kingly robbery amounted to ? 16,000 , or neal ly *80,000 , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this king of blessed memory , was to start a scheme to get the whole province of Connaught into his royal hands . The proprietors of the land becoming alarmed , offered to the covetous monarch ? 10,000 to let them alone ; and while he was balancing between the money in hand and the whole province of Connaught in prospect , the " King of kings " summoned // him away from the throne he had stained with injustice and blood . We confess the Jrish were not eminently grateful for the espiona*e , confiscation , and robbery , that James graciouslygranted them , and it is difficult for us to see on what " principles of human nature " they should be . It is equally untrue that the rebellion followed this extraordinary generosity of James . The rebellion did not take place till after the accession of Charles I. To save themselves in future , a large meeting of gentlemen was held in Dublin , at which a bill of rights was drawn up , entitled " Graces . " The king 's signature to this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 50,000 for the use of the crown . The king gave his promise , took tire money , and then refused to grant the " Graces . " On the top of this falsehood , the Earl of Strafford began to carry out James ' plan of the settlement of Connaught . This was followed by robberies and injustice in the shape of confiscations , backed by 500 horsemen , till the indignation of the people broke over all bounds ; and then the rebellion commenced , and not till then . We charge Mr. Alison here with more than ignorance . He has misstated some of the most obvious facts in English history . There is not a tyro in history unacquainted with the perfidy of the English government towards Ireland , and that she has never granted her any privileges until they were wrung out by stern necessity , and the threatened horrors of a civil war . If Lord Castlereagh could rms* from his suicidal grave , he could whisper some truths in Mr. Alison 's ear , that might enlighten his conscience if not affect his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be the severest argument against all that Mr. Alison has said . From the statute of Kilkenny , in 1367 , which declared " that if any of English descent should use an Irish name , the Irish language , or observe Irish customs , he should forfeit his estates until security was given for his conformity to English habits , " and in which it was forbidden " to entertain any native minstrel or story.teller , or to admit an Irish horse to gToze in the posture of an English sub*cct ; " to the carrying of the Union by 50,000 troops , and bribes to the amount of $5,000,000 under the infamous Castlereach , and the breakin8 of the solemn promise that the exchequers should be kept separate , the acts of the government of England have been worthy the worst days of the inquisition . The barbarous massacres that have been perpetrated by successive monarchs , the repeated confiscations of a large portion of the entire island , the robbing her of her legislature by fraud and violence , the oppressive action of the tithe system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by absenteeism , and the scorn , and injustice , and contumely heaped on her for centutunes , have so exasperated the people that there is constant and terrible danger of outbreaks . As a conclusion of all this , Mr. Alison declares it to be an incontestible fact that Ireland is unfit for a popular government , and that a " wise philanthrophy " dictates that she should now " receive for half a century , a wise , humane , but despotic government . " Were the English statesmen such fools as to believe this , we should have one of the bloodiest massacres that ever stained the pages of history . He seems utterly unconscious of the progress of the human mind towards its rights , and imagines that it needs only a few bayonets to arrest all its inquiries , and check all its impulses He speaks in the same manner of the Catholic Emancipation Bill , and though he acknowledges the principle to be true in the abstract that religious opinions should not subject a man to civil disabilities , yet the result has proved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unwise , for instead of pacifying the country it has only taught it to increase its demands , till now the cry of repeal swells over the land . It may have been unwise , but all the aristocracy of England could not delay it without commencing a massacre that would have loaded England with endless infamy , and bron ht down on her the curses of the civilized world . Is Lord Brougham 's history of this fearful excitement a fiction ? The petition accompanying this bill was rejected by parliament on the very grounds Mr. Alison presents at this late day . This was in the winter ; but during the summer agitation and excitememit increased to such air alarming extent , and the petition came back , multiplied by so many voices amid with so stern and fierce an aspect , that noble lords began to balance between a civil war and an act of the plainest justice . The next winter passed away in uttering just such arguments as Mr. Alison now claims to be so weighty ; but on the return of spring it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bill , and it passed . There was no other choice in the case . We remarked the same unconsciousness of the inevitable tendency of the spirit of the are in which he lived , when speaking of the French Revolution . Again and again he puts his finger on the very point where the revolution could have been arrested with the utmost ease-nay , in one instance he asserts that the Vendean peasantry could have marched into Paris and re-erected the Bourbon throne . He seems to have about the same idea of the providence of God in this struggle of man for his rights , that Moreau had of it in battle , when he said he usually found it favored the strong battalions . A revolution in France was as inevitable as fate itself . Oppression and suffering had reached the point of despair . Beyond that they never go . In the same spirit and in the same ignorance , he speaks of the Reform Bill , starting with the principle , that the true idea of government is to have the " greatest amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that clamors for reform should never be granted except when there are real grievances ; he condemns the expediency of the passage of the Reform Bill . It was . he declares , a mere aggression of the democratic spirit which should have been met and stifled at once ; for to yield to its demands , is only learning it to make greater demands , as subsequent history has shown . This theory is correct , when applied to a feudal government . We do not object to the logic , but to the belief that it could be practically carried out . The aristocracy of England reasoned precisely in the same way , and soundly , too ; but they found a spirit abroad stronger than their logic . The foe they had to contend with was not one of bone and muscle , that could be thrust through with the bayonet or suffocated in a prison . Macauley knew it , when he thundered forth in the House of Commons , " throng/c Parliament or over Parliament this bill will pass . " Earl Grey knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass , and when recalled , made its passage the condition of his return , declaring that otherwise he could not save England from a civil war . Of this stern uecessity , this absolute omnipotence of the spirit that is now abroad in the world , Mr. Alison seems entirely uncon*cmous . His remedy for Democracy , in all its stages and movements , is physical force , and , so far as his doctiines have influence on the Continent of Europe , they will augment the present evils , and hence increase the violence of their ultimate cure . It is a relief to turn from these events , in the narrative of which Mr. Alison 's prejudiced feelings so bias his judgment and truth , to those stirring scenes which made Europe for nearly thirty years one wide battle-field . While Mr. Alison stands and looks off on the continent , after Bonaparte 's star arose in the troubled heavens , his English sympathies do not put such obstacles in the way of relating facts . Especially after Bonaparte shows his aristocratic tendencies , does he exhibit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conqueror of so many battles , necessarily wakens , in one of Mr. Alison 's poetic temperament , an interest which is quite strong enough to secure fair treatment from him . He does Napoleon full justice , and if he errs at all , does so in making him too unlike ordinary mortals . In the description of a battle we have never seen Mr. Alison 's superior . Before his excited imagination the field rises again with all its magnificent array . He looks on the formation of the line , the moving of the columns , the charge of the cavalry , and all the uproar and thunder of battle , with the eye of a poet . He beholds nothing but heroism in the commonest soldier , if he but fights bravely , and the trade of war is to him a splendid tragedy . This vividness of imagination and excitement of feeling give to his descriptions a life , that , for the time , make them passing realities . They throw over his narrative also the charm of freshness ; and his style , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombastic , becomes clear and vigorous . How much allowance is to be made for his imagination , is not so easy to say , and we suspect that most of his readers would rather be wrong on some details than lose the vividness of the picture . The mere historic parts being only a compilation from other works , they owe their chief excellence to the charm of Mr. Alison 's style . The work also is the only English one devoted to those thirty years that witnessed the rise and glory and downfall of the French empire . Perhaps no better will be written , yet Mr. Alison 's owes more than is generally conceded , to the period he has chosen for his history . // Thirty years of such stirring scenes , lofty achievements , and awful disaster , the earth never before witnessed . First comes the French revolution , that terrific explosion , that buried the king , the throne , the aristocracy , and a million of men in one bloody grave . Its scenes of violence and massacre , its exhibitions of valor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty of the historian to consist in knowing what to reject rather than what to choose . Next rises before us that strange being , so powerful for evil or for good , Napoleon Bonaparte , who afterward scarcely leaves the field of vision , till he disappears forever in the war-cloud of Waterloo . The campaign of Italy follows in quick succession , with its bloody field of Marengo and Novi and Arcola and Lodi . Scarcely has the battle-cloud swept from the empire of the Cesars , revealing a new dynasty there , before the gleaming of French lances is seen around the pyramids of Egypt . Spain is covered with battle-fields --  --   --  the Alps with mighty armies , struggling where the foot of the chamois scarce dares to tread . Jena and Austerlitz and Wagram and Borodino , rise , one after another , before our astonished sight , and Moscow 's towers blaze over the army of the Empire . Never before were such materials furnished , ready made , to the historian . All varieties of war , from the ferocious and headlono violence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter of the steadiest armies of Europe-from the wild charge of the Cossack , on the plains of Russia , to the fiery valor of the Turkish cavalry , in the deserts of Egypt , we see every shade and degree and quality of combat . The same is true of the scenery amid which all this is laid . Amid the glaciers of the Alps and the vineyards of Italy-on the sierras of Spain and the sands of Egypt-amid the heat of the desert and the snows of a Russian winteron the Nieman and Danube and Rhine and Tiber and ancient Nile , is seen the march of armies and heard the thunder of battle . And seldom does the world witness such distinguished men as moved amid these scenes . There was Pitt and Burke and Fox and Talleyrand and Ney and Murat and Moreau and Lannes and Macdonald and Wellington and Bonaparte . And never , in modern history , were such results accomplished . A common soldier rises to the empire of half of Europe-thrones are overthrown , kings discrowned , dynasties changed , and the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The strange spectacle of kings searching round their overturned thrones for their fallen crowns-princes begging for bread through the civilized world , and Europe shaking to the tread of a single man , is here presented for the first time to our astonished view . We behold the power of kings broken , and hear the final knell of tyranny rung . And all this is seen amid the tumult of battle , where prodigies of valor are performed unparalleled in the history of man . The peasants of Vendee fight and fall about their homes , with the heroism of the Spartan band at Thermopyl* . Bonaparte drags his artillery over the Alpine pass that Hannibal trod before him . Macdonald fights with the avalanche that bears down whole companies by his side , or leads his mighty column straight into the murderous fire of the enemy , leaving in his path a swath of his dead followers , as he moves , till only fifteen hundred are left around him . Undaunted and unscathed , he still pushes the torn head of his column into the enemy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Murat and the fiery Ney lead on their strong battalions where the bravest shrink ; and , last of all , come the heroic courage , the reckless daring , and awful carnage of Waterloo . These scenes no pen can paint better than Mr. Alison 's ; and had he but shown himself superior to the narrow prejudices of a bigot , and taken the trouble to inform himself on some points where his feelings have made his facts , his history would have been as reliable as it is entertaining . We might select from these pages descriptions that are perfect pictures , remaining among the distinct things of memory . There is Arcola and Bonaparte standing on the bridge with the standard in his hand , refusing to stir from the storm of shot that swept where he stood , till borne back by his own grenadiers . There is Wagram , with the island in the Danube , converted , for a while , into a theatre , where genius wrought like magic , and beside it the battle-field , with Bonaparte on his milk-white charger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winced to the murderous fire of the enemy 's artillery-himself undaunted and unharmed , though the grape-shot rattled like hail-stones around him . There , too , are Eylau , Borodino , and Austerlitz , and there the mighty // columns of France . disappearing , one after another , in the heavy snow-drifts of Russia . These are vivid sketches ; so also is the last interview of Bonaparte with Metternich , before the latter joined the allies . We seethe bonfires kindled along the Bohemian mountains , announcing the joyful intelligence to the host that lay encamped in the valley beyond . The mad ride of Bonaparte to Paris , to save the city that had already fallen into the hands of the enemy , his uncontrollable impetuosity that drove on his carriage tifl the axletrees took fire , his fiery and characteristic soliloquy on the way , are all admirably drawn . But the campaign in Egypt brings out again his English sympathies , and his statistics differ , of course , from those of the French . So in the peninsular campaign , he looks at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of huge dimensions , and at those of the French through the same glass ia'verted . He may think , however , he compensates for this by reversing the process , when he surveys the numbers , position , and comparative strength of the two armies . This double method of magnifying and dwindling , makes quite a difference in the impression conveyed of this whole campaign . The same bias of his judgment by his feelings , is exhibited in his account of the battle of Waterloo . No one hut an Englishman ever stood on that battle-field with the map of it in his hand  --  and even the English account of it before him-without being convinced , that but for the timely arrival of Blucher , Wellington would have been defeated . Yet Mr. Alison declares that Bonaparte would have been repulsed had not Blucher arrived , and all that the latter accomplished was to convert the defeat into a total rout . The only fact he predicates this assertion on , is the repulse of the imperial guard before the junction of Blucher . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate charge at the time he did , but for the approach of the Prussians . It was done to force the English lines and place himself between the two armies , that he might fight them separate , as he did at Novi . If Grouchy had kept Blucher in check , Bonaparte would have soon broke down the already exhausted English squares , and at a later moment led on his fresh indomitable guard to complete the victory . In the second place , although the guard was routed , 11 they formed again into two immense squares , and endeavored to stay the reversed tide of battle , and if Blucher had not been there with his fifty thousand fresh troops , Wellington could not have followed up his success , and would have been compelled to remain as he had done all day , on the defensive . Wellington himself , in his dispatches , says : " I should not do justice to my feelings , or to Marshal Blucher and the Prussian army , if I did not attribute the successful result of this arduous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " ( Wellingtomi versus Alison . ) If there is one thing clear to the impartial mind , when standing on that field , it is that if Blucher had staid away , as did Grouchy , or Grouchy came up , as did Blucher , that Wellington would have been utterly routed . It was a desperate movement of the British general , to make the stand he did , and he knew it , and nothing but unforeseen circumstances saved him from ruin . The " stars " fought against Bonaparte on that day ; his career was run , and the hour of retribution had come . But with the whole continental struggle we have nothing to do . That Mr. Alison should often disagree with Jomini and other French historians , is natural . We do not profess to have his knowledge of military tactics , for there is not a battle lost by the allies in which he does not place his finger on the very point where the issue turned and where ordinary clear-sightedness could not have redeemed the day . In reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly to exclaim , " what a pity Mr. Alison could not have been there-he could have so easily changed the result . " We have had to do simply with the impressions conveyed by this historyits philosophy and logic concerning the great question of republicanism ; for it would be impossible to embrace the whole work in the limits of a single article . Besides , the struggles of armies and nations may he falsified with comparative impunity , but to be untrue when treating of the conflict between the two great principles of democracy and des- , potism , whose results are to reach remotest ages and affect the most intimate relations of society , is the worst crime a historian can commit in the present crisis of the world . We have gone over the history of Ireland and the French revolution , to show the strength of Mr. Alison 's 1845.1 161 // bigoted monarchical feelings , and how utterly unable or unwilling he is to see the truth when it conflicts with his prejudices . Jf his sympathies plunge him into inextricable blunders when writing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of error in his accounts of the United States and the Last War . The chapter which opens our history is is a specimen of his attempt at fine writing when he is not really excited . The whole of it is fitter for a popular declamation , or second rate magazine , than grave history . Does he wish to say that the waters of the Mexican gulf are clear , he says , " the extraordinary clearness of the water reveals to the astonished mariner the magnitude of its abysses , and discloses , even at the depth of thirty fathoms , the gigantic vegetation which , even so far beneath the surface , is draxvn forth by the attraction of a vertical sun " Does he wish to state that beautiful islands are sprinkled over its bosom , he says , " in the midst of these glassy waves , rarely disturbed by a ruder breath than the zephyrs of spring , wholly untrue by the way , an archipelago of perfumed islands is placed , which repose like baskets of flowers on the tranquil surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapes grow in profusion on its shores , he says , " grapes are so plenty upon every shrub , that the surge of the ocean , as it lazily rolls in upon the shore with the quiet winds of summer , dashes its spray upon the clusters . " This might adorn the maiden speech of a college sophomore , or be a very fine paragraph with which to open a chapter of a novel , hut in this place it is the merest " prose run mad . " Alike inappropriate is his long description of our continent and equally long dissertation upon its early inhabitants . Such a duty belongs to one who wri4es our history from the beginning , and not to him who simply cuts out the Last War for his topic . Indeed , Mr. Alison seems so profoundly impressed with the magnitude and importance of his views on matters entirely irrelevant to to his main purpose , that he takes vast semi-circles to bring them all in . After dilating with more poetry than profundity on our savages , and describing our vast primeval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the hatchet of the civilized man has never been heard , " he comes to our present characteristics . At first , he endeavors to account for the vast difference between the condition of the inhabitants of the Canadian provinces and those of our Northern States . We should expect here to find something said of our different forms of government , and the different character of those who landed on Plymouth Rock and the who first settled along the northern shores of the St. Lawrence . Not a bit of it  --  the chief cause of our pre-eminence in the States , he declares to be owing to our " paper credit . " And yet he makes this very " paper credit , " that has wrought such wonders in our political and social condition , one of the great inherent evils of our republican institutions . His philosophy is as flexible as his facts , and heads to any absurdity , however great , if it will only teach the one great lesson he is so profoundly impressed with  --  the evils of republicanism . Scarcely is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that labor is so much in demand here and so liberally rewarded , " that a widow with eight children is sought cfter and married as an heiress , " The reader has scarcely time to awake from this new and astounding fact , before he goes on to state , that the American agriculturist is wholly unlike those of all other lands , in that he has no attachment to the soil he occupies . The wandering propensities of our farmers are so strong , that he calls our social system " THE NOMADE AGRICULTURAL STATE . " If he made this assertion so strongly , in order to justify him in applying the new title he puts in capitals , we have nothing to say . But if he intended it for a fact , he has been very unfortunate in the authorities he has consulted . He* reditary feeling is also " unknown , " so that there is no attachment to the old homestead or the old fixtures of our birthplace . So " wholly unknown , " Mr. Alison declares it to be , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often not framed , as it is well understood that at the death of the head of the family they will he sold and turned into dollars to be divided among the children ! " We doubt whether even Mrs. Trollope would swear to this statement , and Basil Hall himself would refuse to stand as authority for it . But having proved this deplorable state of our country by his own assertion , he adduces Mungo Park as evidence that even the most degraded and savage negro tribes of Africa possess , and in an eminent degree , this attachment so " wholly unknown " among us . This is truly a distressing picture of our condi // tion . Our large farming population is only a slightly improved breed of the Arabs , and go wandering about without a home-without any of those local attachments which make certain spots " Palestines and Meccas of the mind carrying their unframed pictures in their hands , haunted by the fear of the " dollars . " Not wholly destitute of natural affection , which even the tiger and jackall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of our beloved parents , " running the dreadful risk of the final partition  --  but the frames , the plain cherry wood frames , costing four and sixpence , we refuse to buy , lest they be lost at last , by being divided among some " widow and eight children . " There is , doubtless , some profound philosophic principle lying at the bottom of the distinction to be made between the cost of the pictures and the cost of the frames , which Mr. Alison discovered by applying his monarchical stethescope to the breast of democracy , and he has wronged us , and wronged the world , by not incorporating it in his history . It is fortunate the two facts of a " widow with eight children " being an " heiress , " and our strong Arabic tendencies , are put together ; otherwise , we might be overrun with poor English widows and their numerous progeny . Some few of these , from Leeds , Manchester , and Birmingham , we have seen in our manufacturiiig districts , with even more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked like anything but " heiresses . " Tribe after tribe of our nomadic farmers had wandered past them without grasping the fortune . When our history becomes as old as the Roman history now is , with what astonishment will men read of a state of society where a " widow and eight children " were looked upon as some " rich freighted argosy . " But notwithstanding the high price of labor , and the general competence that prevails in the rural districts , he adds , as an offset , that " pauperism exists to a distressing extent in many of the first peopled states along the sea-coast , and nearly all the great commercial towns of the Union ; poor-rates are in consequence generally established , and benevolence is Penitentiary , . - Alms House ( adults ) , ( children ) , Bellevue Hospital ( sick ) , taxed nearly as severely as in the old monarchies and dense population of the European nations . " This statement , standing alone and without explanation , is untrue ; for though as much money may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our cities , as in the cities of Europe , there is not a fourth part of the demand for it . Besides , poor-rates are not established at all in the sense conveyed by the passage . The poorrates of England are a thing unknown here . But , granting it all , from whence come these paupers ? From " the old monarchies , and out of the dense population of the European nations ; "  --  a fact Mr. Alison did not find it convenient to state . To say nothing of the continental nations that make a system of despatching their paupers and criminals to the United States , it needs but to look at England herself to find ample cause for the pauperism that is forced upon us . In one year , between June of 1835 and July of 1836 , the Law Commissioners of England reported that seven thousand and seventy-five paupers were expatriated at the cost of $196,000 . The proportion that came here it is not difficult to conjecture . Lord Stanley declared , not long since , in the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the average amount of emigration to British America alone was from 75,000 to 80,000 annually . In 1840 , there were 90,700 left England . In 1841 , there were 118,475 . In 1842 , 15,000 left in April alone , and during the three months ending last June , 25,008 arrived in New York city . The whole number , for the past year , is estimated at 59,000 to New York city alone . How many of these are paupers , or become so , may be inferred from the fact , that out of 47,571 aliens arrived in one year , 38,057 , soon after they landed , had no occupation . Place these facts beside the following table published in the American Quarterly Review of 1838 " In the city of New York , the following extracts have been obtained , illustrative of the comparative amount of poverty and crime , as existing among native Americans and foreigners , from all parts of the United States . 593 1,355 772 238 Total . Foreigners . 203 over one-third 969 " two-thirds 579 " 170 " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( actual state ) , City Dispensary , ( male indoor patients ) ( female ) ( male outdoor ) ( female ) We have taken this table , ready furnished to our hands , to save the trouble of compiling one ourselves , and because it refers to that period on which Mr. Alison is supposed to have had his eye more particularly , when he wrote his history . It is inevitable that pauperism should exist in our country , so long as England is allowed to deposite her tens of thousands of poor annually on our shore . The vessels from that land of liberty , where property and life is secure , and monarchy and aristocracy shower down their blessings on the people , and the wealthy church provides for the " gratuitous instruction of the poor , " are like Alpine torrents , which descend in spring and deposite their mud in the fair valleys below . Vessels have arrived filled with paupers alone , and " the amount expended during seven years by the authorities of New York , for the support of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen received but a third of that sum . " More than $50,000 is annually paid , by tax on the citizens of New York , for the support of foreign pauperism ; " and , of the 2,790 white adults in the Alms House , Asylum , and Penitentiary this year , 1881 , or more than twothirds , are foreigners . Let this ceaselsss flow of *aupers continue towards our shore a little longer , and Mr. Alison 's words will be true , that " benevolence is as heavily taxed as in some of the old monarchies of Europe . " He must , or should have known this state of things before speaking of pauperism in this country , and given us credit for that which he now places upon us as a stigma . They are your paupers , Mr. Alison , that " tax our benevolence " so heavily-Englishmen , filled with all the noble aspirations of British subjects , brought up under the blessed influence of a monarchy , aristocracy , and church establishment , that choke our alms-house , live on our money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its " gratuitous proTotal. 177 1,983 2,034 1,126 1,670 5,555 7,876 Foreigners . 101 near two-thirds 908 " one-third 1000 " " 563 one-half 917 near three-fifths 3,666 over 4,748 " vision for the instruction of the poor , " leaves to our voluntary system to educate the tens of thousands she sends here in ignorance . And here , we would remark a great objection to the notes added in Mr. Harper 's edition . They lack manliness and independence . For instance , the laughable assertion of Mr. Alison , respecting our slight hereditary feeling , is gravely met , and the division of family estates accounted for , on the ground , that we have seen the evils of primogeniture . So also , is the charge , that we have no literature , etc. , refuted by a catalogue of our colleges , published books , &amp;c . If Mr. Alison sees fit to make assertions so utterly destitute of delicacy and truth as these , they should be put in the catalogue of Trollopiana , and treated as such . He can , if he likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Monboddo 's theory of the human race , but it does not follow that we are soberly to set to work , to prove that we are not monkeys , and hairy , and give measurements and affidavits to show that we correspond to ordinary men . The historian is ridiculed in such cases , more than those he slanders . When speaking of the evils of republicanism , he draws still more largely on his fancy for facts , and says , " as a natural consequence of this state of things , ( referring to the practical action of the principle of equality ) , " there is in opposition to the will or passions of the majority , no security whatever , either for life or property in America ; " and again , " is life secure in the United States , when property is placed in such imminent peril ? Experience , terrible experience proves the reverse , and demonstrates , that not only is existence endangered , but law is powerless against the once excited passions or violence of the people . The atrocities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , have been exceeded on the other side of the Atlantic . " Much is // to be allowed for the extravagant assertions of a man of Mr. Alison 's peculiarly excitable temperament and strong anti-republican feeling ; and , we should feel inclined to put this down as one of his wild statements , made in a moment of irritability , did we not find the same declaration repeated and amplifiedin the concluding reflection of his work . He states there , " that deeds of violence have been perpetrated in many parts of the United States by the tyrant majority , with entire impunity , of so frightful a character , that , they exceed in cruelty all the savage atrocity of the French Revolution , and have made the Americans fain to seek a parallel for them in the hideous persecutions and iniquities , which have forever disgraced the Roman Catholic religion . " This reiteration and enlargement of the first assertion , destroys our charity ; and we charge on Mr. Alison here a deliherate and downright falsehood . We will not dwell a moment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive , by a mob of excited men , for a crime almost unparalleled *n its atrocity . The statement as it stands , and the impression intended to be conveyed by it , is utterly destitute of truth , and Mr. Alison knew it when he made it . It was an ebullition of passion and fancy together , unworthy the writer of a pretended impartial history . Besides , he is testimony against himself in the case ; for in repeated instances , when describing the atrocities of the French Revolution , he declares them without a parallel in the history of the world . Against the declaration that , life and property are insecure , we will make no defence , because it is mere assertion , which any one could have made just as easily , and no one left more unsustained by any proof ; but this we do say-for every man killed in this country the last twenty years , by the violence of the mob , we will find ten killed in England by the same cause ; and for every dollar of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will show one hundred thus uasted in England . If he could have for once , consented to leave the regions of fancy , and gone into statistics , we would have offset them with an account of the riots in Birmingham , Manchester , and Bristol , the mob in the Bull Ring , swaying like a forest to the tempest , the night the Reform Bill was struggling through Parliament , and the " torch and daggre meetings " in every part of the kingdom . We might read " the People 's Charter " aloud , striking at the very foundation of the English Government , and yet it was rolled into Parliament by 4,000 determined men , signed by 3,500,000 petitioners . We might describe the midnight heavens made lurid with the incendiary 's torch over Birmingham  --  the burning of the Parliament House and Guildhallthe firing of York Cathedral and the conflagration of the Armory of the Tower ;  - -  we might point to the Duke of Wellington 's house , still standing dilapidated , just as the mob left it  --  the meeting of 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more taxes-the convocation of 26,000 on thehills of Acerington , swearing " they will never petition Parliament again , but will take redress into their own hands . " We might quote Mr. Macauley himself , when at midnight , while the confused sound of the turbulent mob was without , he concluded his thrilling speech on the Reform Bill with " through Parliament or over Parliament it must pass , " or Lord Brougham , when he says , " those portentious appearances-the growth of later times-those figments that stalk abroad of unknown stature and strange form-union at leagues and mustering of men in myriads , and conspiraciesagainst the exchequerswhence do they spring , and how come they to haunt our shore ? What power engendered those uncouth shapes ? What multiplied the monstrous births , till they people our land ? Trust me , the same power which called into frightful existence , and carried with resistless force the Irish volunteers of 1782  --  the same power which rent in twain your empire and raised up thirteen Republics , the same power which created the Catholic Association and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Justice deserted , rights withheld , wrongs perpetrated , the force which common injuries lend to millions . " We might speak in detail of these things and show where the balance lay of " security of life and property . " We might describe the burning of the hay stacks of the country , and the public edifices of the cities , all of which was " secure property . " We might point to the deadly conflict of the populace with the soldiery , strewing the street with corpses , the threats to assassinate the Duke of Wellington , the murder of the Prime Minister 's Secretary in the streets of London , and the pistol shot of Francis that well nigh rid England of her Queen , to show how much more " secure " life was // in England than here . If we could not with all these facts make good our assertion , we would throw in the massacres of Ireland , and the riots of Wales , to fill up the measure , and show by parity of reasoning , how insecure life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were simply pointed out as things to be deprecated and remedied , we would take the correction with becoming humility ; but they are exaggerated a thousand fold , and then all charged over to Liberty . They are not given as simple facts of history , but to show the peculiar working of democracy , and are declared the natural and monstrous offspring of our form of government . This we deny , and point to England to substantiate our denial . There are the same " uncouth shapes , " multiplied and enlarged to a fearful extent ; and if it be just to make the government responsible for their existence , how stands the English monarchy . After gathering up all the gossip and scattered rumors within his reach , and subjecting them to the coloring process of his own imagination , he triumphantly exclaims , " here , then , is a country in which , if they ever had on earth , republican principles have enjoyed the fairest grounds for trial , and the best opportunity for establishing their benefits . They had neither a territorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hereditary nobility , nor a national debt , nor an established church , which are usually held out as the impediments to the blessings of freedom in the Old World . How , then , has the republican system worked in this , the garden of the world and the land of promise ? " The question is answered in the asking if his assertions be true , without the trouble of stating , as he does , that it is an utter failure , and that freedom here is only a name with which to conjure up horrible shapes of evil . But looking at England with the evils of our own country multiplied and enlarged , and with superadded diseases and miseries , under which she sickens and staggers like falling greatness , we , also , may put the question Mr. Alison deems so annihilating . To employ his own expression , ( though we beg pardon for writing so ungrammatical a sentence ) Here , then , is a country in which , if they ever had on earth , monarchical principles have enjoyed the fairest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefitsthey have had an aristocracy , a sovereign , a throne , an hereditary nobility , a national debt , an established church which are held out to be " no " impediments of Freedom in the old world . And how has the monarchical system worked here ? Let the Report of the Commissioners appointed to investigate the state of Ireland-of those sent to inquire into the condition of children employed in the mines and in the factories-let the national debt itself , the starvation and suffering in every part of the land , forcing the inhabitants to other and freer stateslet the speeches of Brougham and Macauley , and the writings of Carlyle , answer . As for ourselves , we believe this mode of reasoning on governments is unsafe , unless taken with great limitations . But if it be sound in one case it is in the other , and Mr. Alison will find that his logic , like Saturn , devours its own children . If pauperism , suffering , popular outbreaks , agitation and universal disquiet , are substantial arguments against the principles on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a model for the world stands condemned forever . As another instance of his novel mode of reasoning , we give the following paragraph , designed as a backer to the assertion , " there isno independence of thought in America . " " Is it as usual , " he exclaims , " to see candidates for popular favor there , at public meetings , maintain monarchical and aristocratical opinions , as it is in Great Britain to see them support republicanism ? Does the hall of Congiess resound with arguments in favor of a mixed monarchy in preference to a republic , in like manner as the English House of Commons does with declarations in favor of democratic and republican institutions ? " After putting several questions of this sort in his eager way , he answers them himself , and declares , till this thing does happen there is no " real freedom or independence of thought " in America . We hardly know which astonishes us most , the absolute want of common sense in this whole paragraph , or the stupidity of Mr. Alison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such ridicule on himself . Does he not know that in every republican government , as well as limited monarchy , there are two parties , the more conservative and the more liberal , and that those who uphold a democratic form of government in England are advocating a great party measure in the kingdom , and it has no more to do with independence of thought or freedom of debate , than the // 1845 . Alison 's flisiwy of Europe . discussion of the Reform Bill . To adopt Mr. Alison 's novel mode of reasoning we might ask , do we hear an unmixed despotism advocated in England , as we do conservatism here ? Do the halls of Parliament " resound with arguments in favor " of a pure tyranny ? Till this does occur there can he no real " freedom and independence of thought " in the British nation . Yet this question might have some force in the latter case , for there are those in England who believe in a despotism , while there are none here who believe in a mixed monarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States to admit what they believe a lie , and members of Congress plead for a doctrine , the very first attempt to carry out which by others they would resist with their blood , there can be no " independence of thought . " He seems destitute of the ordinary sense of ordinary men , when speaking of this country . His want of judgment is only equalled by his want of knowledge , and it surprises us how any literary man could be so ignorant of those things with which the English school children are familiar . How a man could so expose himself to ridicule by writing on topics he knows nothing of , is stranger than falsehood . He gravely speaks of the " two States of Massachusetts and New England . " This he repeats twice , exhibiting an ignorance of geography that would have sccured a pupil of one of our district schools a seat on the dunce block . Of the powers of the President , the manner of electing judges , and the Constitution itself , all of which he discourses about with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington give his casting vote in Congress at the time he was President of the United States ; and , speaking of the separate States of the Confederacy , and their powers , he says , " so extensive and undefined are their powers , that it may be doubted whether they do not amount to those of declaring peace and war , and acting in all respects as independent States . " It " may not be doubted " that they have power to rebel against the Union-so has Cornwall or Yorkshire to resist the English government ; but their powers are as well defined in this respect as words can make them ; and if Mr. Alison had taken the trouble to read our Constitution , ( as we must in charity think he never has done , ) he would have found it expressly stated , that this power is vested in the President and Congress alone . If one had said that because there had been insurrections in Ireland , and resistance to authority in Wales and Birmingham , that it " might be doubted " whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring war , he would have made just as ridiculous a statement as Mr. Alison has done , and no more so . But he evidently thought he was declaiming against the evils of republicanism before an assembly of ignorant Chartists-for , not content with ludicrous fiction , he seeks after the horrible , declaring " that murders and assassinations in open day , are not unfrequent among the members of Congress themselves . " Mr. Alison would put even an Italian editor to the blush-since thelatter is careful only to leave out every item of news bearing favorably on our institutions , and give every account of a riot or misfortune ; but the former makes facts to order while he orders his own facts . But that we should be in so deplorable a state , Mr. Alison makes out to be most natural : " the American , " says he , " has no sovereign ; in him the aspirations of loyalty are lost ; the glow of patriotic devotion is diffused over so immense a surface as to be well nigh evaporated . In the Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , mingled with chivalry ; the lustre of British descent , the glories of British renown , animate every bosom , at least in the British race , " so that " their character bears the same relation to the Americans that the Tyrolese do to the Swiss "  - -  i. e. they are a far more noble , brave , and patriotic race . These great and commanding features of the Canadian character are working such wondrous effects in the race , that ( he continues ) they " may in some future period , come to counterbalance all the riches of the basin of the Mississippi , and re-assert in America the wonted superiority of northern valor over southern opulence . " We are glad Mr. Alison has opened our eyes to this impending danger , so that Congress may immediately set about strengthening the posts on our northern frontier . The irruption of these " Tyrolese of America , " has not , heretofore , been considered as a very proximate danger , and we trust that our representatives in Washington will attend to it , before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions fall also under his sweeping assertions . " Religion , " he says , " has descended from its functions of denounc // ing and correcting the national vices , and become little more , with a few noble exceptions , of which Channing is an illustrious example , than the re-echo of public opinion . " lie adopts the sentiments of Miss Martineau , ( whose rambling sketches of society in the United States is , we verily believe , about the only book he has ever thoroughly read on our country , ) in which she says that , " the American clergy are the most backward and timid class in the society in which they live ; the least informed with true knowledge ; the least conscious of that Christian and republican freedom , which , as the natural atmosphere of piety and holiness , it is their prime duty to cherish and diffuse . " This is not all ; " the difficulties of the American church are yet to come . " Now the defence of the character of our religious institutions , as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles on which they are based , is another . These evils are not mentioned as historical facts , but brought in to prove his charges against a republican form of government , and to illustrate the evils of the voluntary system , and the necessity of an established church . They are condemned as a part of the " repuhlican system , " and he asks in triumph how it has worked in this " land of promise . " Very poorly , to be sure , if Mr. Alison , and a gossiping , garrulous woman , are to be received as authority Evil is inseparable from all institutions , and we do not claim exemption from the general law of nature , nor shall we attempt to disprove these allegations , but the argument he builds from them . We say that evils are attached to all systems ; Mr. Alison declares that in this country , at least , they grow out of the system itself , and the form of government to which it is adapted . Before we try the other  --  the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it works , and what sort of a church and clergy it gives us under a monarchy . The two great evils Mr. Alison charges on the American church are , first , want of ind*pendence and faithfulness on the part of the clergy , in rebuking national sins : and , second , that it has no " gratuitous provision for the instruction of the poor . " Both of these grow out of the voluntary system . The minister deriving his support from the voluntary contributions of his parish , he dare not do otherwise than re-echo their sentiments , while the poor , having nothing wherewith to pay , are bereft of the gospel . We might show how false are the impressions in this statement : but , in order to see the beauty of Mr. Alison 's conclusions , we will grant , for the time being , their truth , and inquire how much we should gain by adopting the English plan , which , we will allow , is not founded on republicanism or subject to its mutations . In the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass , is known , the world over , to be anything but apostolic ; and we can not see how it could well be otherwise . The aristocracy of England hold half the livings of the church in their own hands , giving them to whom they please , and their spirituality and love of plain unpalatable truth , is known not to be peculiarly strong . No clergyman , who values his place , will offend his patron , by showing the abuses of the aristocracy and the tremendous tax it levies on the working classes . Besides , the fattest of these livings are given to the younger sons of nobility , through family or ministerial influence , who hire a curate , for a few hundred dollars , to perform the labor while they spend the income on the Continent or in London . So generally does this custom prevail , that we find it stated in Hansard 's Debates ( authority which Mr. Alison will not presume to question ) that out of 10,496 clergymen of the established church , only 4,416 reside and labor among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This naked fact more than offsets all he alleges against us , even if true ; for if the clergy are nonresidents , it matters not what their character may be ; - England and the world are none the wiser or better for it . Their thoughts may he free , hut their " speech is never heard . " These livings are sometimes sold at auction , to the highest bidder . We have seen one advertised for sale in the London Times ; and , to increase its value , it was added , that it was in the " immediate neighborhood of one or two of the first packs of foxhounds in the kingdom . " The annual income was about one thousand dollars per year . With this and the fox-hounds , the clergyman could , doubtless , be sufficiently independent . We saw not long since , in the North Devonshire Journal , the following card // " CLERICAL DINNER PARTY . " The sporting friends of the Rev. John Russel gave him a dinner on Friday last , at the Golden Lion in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a picture , t ) y Mr. Lowden of Bath , representin* the reverend gentleman , mounted on his favorite hunter , surrounded with his dogs . The likenesses are said to be faithful , particularly of his horse , and the execution as highly creditable to the risin , artist . The picture was presented to Mr. Russel , as a tribute to his unwonted exertions in support of the sports of the field . " A very independent and spiritually minded man . But the topic is too trite . Every one knows what the fox-hunting non-resident clergy of England are . If he does not , we refer him to the columns of the Court Journal , where , he will find what they are ahout , while the nation reels under suffering and oppression , and her own clear-sighted statesmen look grave as they contemplate the future . More than one third of the incumbents of the established church in Ireland never reside in their parishes , while the revenues of some of the bishops are upwards of three hundred thousand dollaus per annum . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , army , and navy , but chiefly from the churdli . The archbishops of Canterbury and York , have incomes of over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . The bishops of I ) erry , Cloyne , Cashel , Cork , and Ferns , have an annual income , to which , the salary of the President of the United States is a mere fraction . That of the bishop of London , will soon be three hundred thousand dollars per annum . All these are the independent clergy under an established church and a monarchy . The annual revenues to the church have been shown in a printed table , and they amount to the enormous sum of ? 9,459,565 , or $45,405,912 . The manner in which this is collected , proves that it is any thing but a voluntary contribution . The helpless widow , and the po.or dissenting clergyman , and his conscientious parishioner , who have suffered distraint on property , and imprisonment , will bear witness it is not a voluntary system . Nay , the cost and danger of collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been commuted , that is charged to the landlord , who must collect them without cost or danger to the government . This immense revenue does certainly afford a rare opportunity for the " gratuitous instruction of the poor ; " but the poor of England feel that such religion is a poor return for famine . Untaught , unfed , and unclothed , how can they be instructed hy that church which plunders them . We have read the Reports of the British and Foreign School Society , and have been astounded at the developments it makes of the ignorance of the lower classes . Out of 22,000 inhabitants in one parish of the city of Durham , only one in thirty receives instruction . Out of 6,000 children in Wolverhampton , there is provision for the education of only one out of every nine . In Worcestershire , in sixty-six parishes , containing 14,000 in habitants , there are only twelve schoolmasters , while in a territory of thirteen miles hy seven , in Buckinghamshire , there was only one school where the poor could he taught . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Berkshire , and Kent . This is " gratuitous provision " for the religious instruction of the poor , with a vengeance . The truth is , the laborer of England is forced to the starving point , to furnish the very money by which he is able to have this " gratuitous provision , " which , after all , never reaches him . Half the money forced out of England by her tithe system would supply every parish with a clergyman and schoolmaster , and leave an ample fund for the poor . If republicanism saddled such a burden on us as the established church places on the neck of the British people , we should certainly cease to be republicans ; and , if Mr. Alison wishes to convince the world of the evils of free government , and slander it beyond recovery , let it be charged with the curses which England inflicts on her subjects through her church . Her " gratuitous provision " for the poor , islike the generosity of him , who " With one hand puts A penny in the urn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " What the future may be , destiny alone will reveal ; but if the present state of the church and clergy in the two countries are conclusive arguments on the character and action of the respective governments , we tremble for Mr. Alison 's model government . We believe the logic is unsound , applied in this unlimited way ; // but we will abide the conclusions , and then ask as before , how stands the English monarchy . As to the stereotyped charge , that there is no literature in America , it has been so often refuted that we will not repeat the arguments furnished against it by the mere list of the works of American authors . England has been gathering up the treasures of her great minds for centuries-the noblest legacy she will le*ave to coming ages . To offer these by way of comparison to what we have been able to accumulate in sixty or seventy years may be very flattering to egotism , but it is very poor justice . We are to be judged not merely by what we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in . This is the only just rule that can be applied to any nation , and yet it is a rule which no English critic has ever yet applied to us . The authority Mr. Alison often quotes is as laughable as his facts . Capt . Marryatt , who never wrote any thing but fiction ; Miss Martineau , who with her ear trumpet to her ear went gossiping over the country and , like Pickwick , putting down as truth every monstrous story that a " Mississippi roarer " saw fit to entertain her with ; Basil Hall , another captain , who was set ashore in a Mis* sissippi swamp for his want of manners ; and finally the story of the little ( laughter of a milliner , boasting of her rank and that she never " associated with a haberdasher 's daughter ; " these are given to substantiate the gravest assertions . We should not be surprised to find him quoting Mr. Gulliver , to prove some singular notion he may have of the inhabitants of Lilliput . The reason Mrs. Trollope does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of blunders , falsehoods , ignorance , and simplicity , called history , is doubtless o*vingto the fact , that Mr. Alison has incorporated her principal statements into the body of the work . But when he approaches the war of 1812 , the subject assumes a more serious aspect . Routed armies and conquered frigates can not be swept away by an extravagant assertion , and he exhibits by his contortions , sudden admissions and as sudden denials , his inward repugnance to so unpoetic a theme . We were prepared for the grossest misrepresentations here , but not we confess for the operations of a reversed fancy . His imagination is able to sleep a moment , while by brief and dry statistics he converts a brilliant action of ours , into a common place affair ; but reaching a certain point , it , like gravitation , " - turns the other way , " creating , grouping , and coloring with its wonted vigor . He starts by boldly asserting , what no intelligent man in Europe believes , viz , that " America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to war with Great Britain , then the last refuge of liberty in the civilized world , when their only ground of complaint against it had been removed " There must have been some strange infatuation on the part of our people , with a fleet of a few ships and an army of a few thousand men , to provoke hostilities with the strongest nation on the globe . But Mr. Alison has discovered a profound and philosophic reason for this madness , which we will allow him to give in his own words : " on war she was determined , and to war she went . " After running over our naval and military force , making our whole army about as large as one of Napoleon 's divisions , and giving to our militia only one good quality , that of being fast runners , he expresses the most unfeigned astonishment at our temerity at measuring swords with Great Britain , but finally consoles himself with the reflection that it only " proves the insouciance of democracy . " He is not hard to please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his difficulties . But , perhaps , the most remarkablc allegation in the whole work-remarkable not so much for its falseness as the utter incredulity with which it must be received by the civilized world , is the declaration that " the system of government in the United States has been proved to be wholly unequal to the external security of the nation . " His assertion that we are so weak that we should be " conquered in three months if located among the powers of Europe , " was natural ; and if he had stated that in any future war we should be frightened into submission at the first cannon shot , it would have been in perfect harmony with the rest of his facts ; but to saythat it has been proved that we are " unequal " to protect ourselves , affects us with profounder astonishment even , than our temerity in declaring war seems to have filled him . We are not surprised at the statement because it is untrue , but that he should put his reputation , as a historian , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of sixty years and the glorious termination of two bloody wars so openly and palpably contradict . What the future may be , we leave to Mr. Alison 's fruitful imagination to point out ; but " tbe past is secure . " It the long and wastin war of the revolution and its termination , with the brave struggle by sea and land of the war of 1812 , do not prove that we " have been " able to " protect " ourselves , will the historian say what can prove it ? If the flag of the States left floating over a conquered enemy after almost every sea fight , the steadiest armies of Europe routed and hurled from our shores , are not satisfactory arguments , we confess ourselves unable to furnish them . There are Bunker Hill and Yorktown , Champlain and Erie , and Plattsburgh and New Orleans , and yonder goes the Macedonian firing her salutes in honor of the Republic : - if these do not flash back the ridiculous falsehood in Mr. Alison 's face they are unmeaning things . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to depreciate our present military strength , classing our navy , and army under the denominatio.n of " Lilliputian forces " - from a slight soreness in view of the result of our struggle with the parent country . He tells us our men are fit only for a bush fight and can not stand fire in the open field . Whether this be true or false , it is paying the British soldiers a poor compliment . It reminds us of an anecdote of an American sailor , who happened to be in the pit of a London theatre *Vhen King William was present . During the play , a company of men dressed as tailors , cobblers , blacksmiths , farmers , without uniform , and swinging around their heads pitchforks , hammers , fowling pieces , and muskets , were introduced on the stage to represent the American army . Jack looked awhile on the tatterdemalion company until the boisterous laugh had died away , then shouted out " Hurrah ! Old England beat by blacksmiths and cobblers . " The laugh raised at our undisciplined forces has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It reminds us of his stricture on our manners . " The Americans , " says he , " are vain on all national subjects and excessively sensitive to censure , however slight , and , most of all to ridicule . The English not only no way resent , but positively enjoy , the ludicrous exhibitions made of their manners on the French stage : such burlesques would flay the Americans alive . The English recollect that the French learned these peculiarities when the British troops occupied Paris . " However true this may be , as a general remark , ridicule of our " Lilliputian forces " we are able to bear with becoming composure , for " we " also " recollect " where the " English " learned these peculiarities " of our army . " The first view they obtained of them , in the revolutionary war , was at Bunker Hill , and the last at Yorktown , and the last review that a Briton ever made of our troops was at New Orleans . The English have had a good opportunity to witness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have been near enough to see their faces , and the manner they wheel , and especially how they fire . The laugh raised at these specimens , sounds to us altogether like mockery . When Mr. Alison comes to our naval battles , his descriptive powers suddenly fail him . The fancy that could bring before us every action between an English and French vessel , describe the beautiful manomvring of the ships , the fluttering of the canvass , the blazing broadsides , the uproar of battle , the carnage and the victory , becomes suddenly wingless . Those fierce single-handed fights of ship with ship , and frigate with frigate , are dismissed almost as rapidly as their broadsides were . One would think he was writing dispatches on the field of battle . The only occasion that calls forth his descriptive powers is the capture of the Chesapeake by the Shannon , an action that lasted about fifteen minutes and . was fought by a half drunken and undisciplined crew . He devotes more space to this single battle-which Captain Lawrence never should have fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious death-than he does to the actions between the Guerriere and Constitution , Frolic and Wasp , Macedonian and United States , Java and Constitution , Peacock and Hornet , altogether . These five naval engagements , in which the American vessels were victorious , each deserved as lengthened a notice as the action between the Chesapeake and Shannon , and yet they are all crammed together , as if belonging to one dispatch , and dismissed with the everlasting " in this as in the previous instances where the Americans had proved successful , the superiority on their side was very decided . " If the American vessel , as in the case of the Peacock and Hornet , had but 1845.1 171 // one more gun than the English and fiftytwo more men , Mr. Alison calls it a " decided superiority . " The difference of two or three guns and fifty or a hundred men , in a battle between two of the first class frigates , we never supposed to constitute such a decided superiority as to account for almost universal defeat But it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in numbers or weight of metal . It would be tedious to go into the details of each engagement ; but one will stand for the rest . In Mr. Alison 's very minute account of the capture of the President , he says , " an action more prosperous , but not more glorious for the British arms , than that between the Reindeer and Wasp , took place next spring , which terminated in the capture of the noble American frigate President , one of the largest vessels of that class in the world , by the Endymion , Captain Hope , slightly aided by the Pomona . " And in the conclusion , he adds , " the Endymion having fallen astern the Pomona came up and gave the President two broadsides , with little or no elThct owing to the darkness of the night , but this circumstance saved the American 's hoiior , as two vessels had now opened their fire upon her , and he accordingly hauled down his colors . " This account , though entirely erroneous , is not more so than many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wish to let English officers themselves bear testimony against Mr. Ahison . The President was compelled to fight the Endymion at disadvantage , because she had to run for it or find herself enveloped in the fire of four ships . We are indebted to a friend for a document , which , we believe , has never before been published in this country . It is an account of this engagement , by the officers of the two vessels , Pomona and Tenedos , to which the President surrendered , written immediately after they arrived with their prize at Bermuda . Accompanying it is a deposition of Commodore Decatur , taken at St. George 's at the same time . " His MAJESTY 'S FRIGATE POMONA , Bermuda , 29th January , 1815. $ " About an hour before daylight of the 15th inst. , two strange sail ( a ship and brig ) were discovered on our lee how , standing to the eastward , under a press of sail , wind N. W. by N. Majestic and Endymion in company-all sail was made in chase , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained on them . As day dawned , another ship was seen , hull down , to leeward , and the commodore , imagining her also to be an enemy , detached the Pomona in chase ; we immediately bore right up before the wind , and in three quarters of an hour , ascertaining her to he the Tenedos , again hauled up to the east , being by this circumstance , thrown seven or eight miles more astern of the original , chase ; however , we soon again began to approach the enemy , as did also the Endymion ; which , from the above event , was now far ahead of the Pomona . At one P. M. , we passed the Majestic ; President and Endymion , at two , occasionally exchanging stern and bow guns ; the wind began to fall light , and the Pomona was yet too far off to render any assistance , but still coming up . At 5,30 , the President bore up , closing with the Endymion , and fired her starboard broadside , which was promptly returned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time , which gradually slackened ; and at half past eight ceased , the Endymion falling astern-Pomona passing her at half past eight . At this time she was observed to fire two guns , which the President returned with one . At eleven , being within gun-shot of the President , who was still steering to the eastward , under a press of sail , with royal top-gallant top-mast and lower studding sails set , and finding how much we oiitsailed her , our studding sails were taken in , aud immediately afterwards we luffed to port and fired our starboard broadside . The enemy then also luffed to port , bringing his larboard broadside to bear , which was momentarily expected , as a few minutes previous to our closing her , she hoisted a light abaft , which in night actions substituted the ensign . Our second broadside was fired ; and the President still luffing up , as if intent to lay us on board , we hauled close to port , bracing the yards up and setting the mainsail . The broadside was again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hauled down the light , and we hailed , demanding if she had surrendered . The reply was in the affirmative , and the firing instantly ceased . The Tenedos , which was not more than three miles off , soon afterwards* came up , and assistcd in securing the prize and removing the prisoners . At three quarters past twelve , the Endymion came up , and the Majestic at three in the mornino " // Commodore Decatur 's Deposition , taken at St. George 's , Bermuda . " The President was taken on the 15th of January , being under American colors . Resistance was not made against the Endymion for two and a half hours-she having dropped out of the fight . The next ships comm , up two and a half hours after the action with the Endymion , were the Pomona and Tenedos ; to these two ships the President surrendered ; the Pomona had commenced her firing within musket shot . " The testimony Mr. Alison 's countrymen utter against him here , is , first , that the President was not taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American having " saved her honor , " by the " fortunate " arrival of two other vessels , she had so thoroughly beaten the Endymion , that the latterwas forced to retire from the fight " two and a half hours " before the Pomona arrived , and did not come up with the prize till two hours and three-quarters after she struck . This is called being " slightly aided " by the Pomona , . The officers of the two ships that boarded the President , after she struck , state that the Endymion and President commenced exchanging shots at half past two in the afternoon , and caine to close engagement at half past five . At half past eight , the action having continued with more or less severity three hours , the Endymion fell astern fairly beaten off , while the President was walking away under a press of canvas , to escape the rest of the fleet that was now rapidly coming up . At this time the Pomona passed the Endymion , so crippled as to be unable longer to sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also crippled from her long engagement , and opened her broadsides . The Tenedos now rapidly approaching , the contest became hopeless , and the noble frigate was compelled to surrender . At a quarter before one , or at least four hours after the Endymion dropped out of the action , she came up . It took two hours and three-quarters steady sailing to reach the President , after she had struck her colors . This is a new mode of capturing a vessel . Those guns must be like Mr. Ahison 's imagination , to reach a ship at such a distance that it required two hours ' sailing to overtake her after she had surrendered . The truth is , as evinced by the statement of the English officers and the deposition of Coin . Decatur-the President beat the Endymion , and then was beaten by the rest of the fleet , and she could not have considered her honor in particular danger from a crippled vessel , left by her four hours before , mending her rigging . If Captain Hope considers the heavy broadsides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid approach of another ship to the combat , while he was out of sight , " slight assistance , " his gratitude will never lie severely taxed in this world . But the repeated victories gained by us , could not be swept awayby assertion , and the world would not reason as Mr. Alison contends it ought to have done , so that their " moral effect , " he is compelled to admit , " was astounding . " Well it might be . We know of nothing in the annals of civilized warfare that will compare with the boldness and success of our little fleet during that war . The battles of the Nile and Trafalgar , which had covered the English navy with glory  --  the undisputed triumph with which the British flag was borne over every sea , had been for years ringing over our land . Flushed with victory , and confident of success , that fleet now bore down on our coast . With only a handful of ships to offer against this superior force , our commanders , nevertheless , stood boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the breeze . The civilized world looked with amazement on the rashness that could provoke so unequal a strife ; but while it waited to hear that our little navy was blown to atoms , the news came of the loss of the Guerriere . Report after report of victories gained by us followed with stunning rapidity . " The English were defeated on their own element , " and her hitherto undisputed claim to the mastery of the seas broken for ever . The courage that could bear up against such fearful odds , and pluck the wreaths of victory from the English navy , has covered the commanders of that time with abiding honors . Our rights were restored-our commerce protected-and the haughty bearing of England towards us , caused by the memory that we were rebels , was chastised from her . The Brifish flag had been lowered so frequently to the " stars and stripes , " that respect and fear had usurped the place of contempt and pride . The war on land was prosecuted with equal success . Yet this war , so triumphantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // We never gained , if his account of the matter is to be taken , except where all the advantage was on our side ; while in all our losses , we were on the average equal to our opponents . Our hazarding a war , in the first place , was the unparalleled rashness of a reckless democracy-our partial success , mere good luck not to be anticipated again ; the result , on the whole , " advantageous to England , while the United States emerged worsted from the fight , " and the final treaty highly honorable to Great Britain . His conclusions are , that " the triumphs of Plattsburg and New Orleans , with which the war terminated , have so elated the inhabitants of the United States , and blinded them to the real weakness of their situation , that little doubt remains , that out of this premature and incomplete pacification the germs of a future and calamitous war between the two countries will spring , " - that the Americans are aggressive , like all republican governments , and that they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refute these declarations , is to acknowledge their force . The statement at the outset , that we sought an unprovoked war with England , is not more erroneous than his account of the manner it was carried on . Instead of all grounds of dissatisfaction being removed previous to hostilities , grievances had accumulated , the half of which would now precipitate a war between us and any other country on the globe . And instead of our vessels being greatly the superior in those naval engagements where we came off victorious , there is not one sea-fight in fifty , where the combatants were more equally matched . If a battle is never to be considered equal until both ships have the same tonnage to a pound , the same number of cannon , and the muster roll of the crews equal to a man , we are inclined to suspect there never will be one fo.ught . There was not a naval action during the whole war where the real , effective , practical force was so disproportionate as in the battle between the Chesapeake and Shannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most brilliant engagements . that occurred . So the battle of the Thames , Plattsburg , and New Orleans , were the necessary results of overpowering advantages , either in position or number , while the battle of Bladensburg , and the bloodless capture of Washington , was , to use his own words , " one of the most brilliant expeditions ever carried into execution by any nation . " An army of some four thousand regular troops , with two three-pounders , put to flight five or six thousand raw militia , and with the loss of five dozen men , marched into a small unfortifled town , occupied as th' Capitol of the United States , and set fire , like a hand of robbers to the Capitol , Arsenal , Dockyard , Treasury , War Office , President 's House , a rope walk and a bridge . Such an affair the historian of Lodi , and Marengo , and Waterloo , of the terrible conflicts of the Peninsula , and the subliine sea-fights of Aboukir and Trafalgar , calls , " one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The truth of the whole matter is , that the war , abating the usual vicissitudes , was carried on successfully to its termination , and a peace concluded , securing to us our rights and protecting our commerce . The plain conclusions that a man of common sense would draw from if all , are , that we were disinclined to a war , except in self defence , and then were equal to our own protection . But Mr. Alison is always diving after truth , and afoolish reason is better than an old one . He is , also , perpetually discovering awful crises where the fate of the world depends on a single move . Thus he hinges Europe a score of times on the movement of a single column . lf this had happened here or there , the fate of the continent and of the world would have been changed . Very probable : so if Bonaparte had been shot in some of his countless battles , or broken his neck by a fall from his horse at some grand review , or fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going ten knots an hour , or caught cold in some of his night marches , the history of the world would have been changed . A different result to any battle might have done it , and yet many often turned on the charge of a single body of cavalry . But history is nothing to Mr. Alison unless it is tragedy , and we believe the reputation of his work rests far more upon its dramatic character than upon its facts . To us history is important only for the philosophy it teaches , and in this respect Mr. Alison has done the world more hurt than good . He is incapable of philosophizing correctly , because he sets out with the conviction that his feelings are right in all cases . Utterly // unable to escape from his prejudices and occupy a high standing-point , from whence he can survey the world with the clear eye of an impartial historian , he goes plunging on , endeavoring to make every thing bend to his philosophy of monarchy . In all the good wrought out by man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the evil done under the sun , the cloven foot of democracy . Is there an unjust war commenced , it is done by republicans ; is there any climax to oppression , it is that of the majority ; and is there any atrocity rivalling the horrors of the Inquisition , it is committed by democracy . All that is firm and useful in the world owes its place to monarchy-all that is unsettled and dangerous , to republicanism . Religion itself can flourish nowhere but under a monarchy , and literature descends to the capacities of the mob in a republic . All nations are wrong but England , and true liberty is a stranger to any other land . " No community , " says he , " need be afraid of going far astray which treads in the footsteps of Rome and England . " Lord Brougham may ask , " what mean those portentous shapes that stalk through England , " and Macauley and Earl Grey bid the throne and nation stop and feel the first throb of the coming earthquake . Sir Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no farther taxed , " and , in a time of peace , resort to the extraordinary measures of war to keep the nation above water  --  the most pitiful sight of strong bodied men wandering over the land , begging for work that they may not starve , may meet one at every turn " torch and dagger meetings " may occur almost every night in the week , and the muttered curse of millions of suffering men and women swell like distant thunder around the throne-it all matters nothing to Mr. Alison . The conclusion is , " follow England . " Heaven keep us from that path and its issue . We have looked down that gulf , and have no desire to try its depths . When we feel the first step of the approaching earthquake , let us know it is not human suffering and human despair on the march , and we can abide the rest . Follow England and monarchy , and shun the French Revolution and American democracy , are the two great lessons Mr. Alison attempts to impress on the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better belied every miltary leader and falsified every battle , than done this . He ought to have known the omnipotence of the rising strength of the masses , and instead of urging the glory of a monarchy and aristocracy , to have pleaded the necessity of yielding betimes , and guiding the spirit which is now awake and will not be laid , and which otherwise will rend its oppressors , though it then turn and rend itself . If there is one thing clear and fearful to the thoughtful man , it is that the American rebellion , the French Revolution , and English Chartism , are but the commencement of a struggle destined to be universal . The theories of Rousseau and Voltaire never raised it in 1789 , nor can the theories of Mr. Alison lay it now . The masses that create and carry it on argue from experience , and the only effect of such a history is to delay , and hence increase the intensity and violence of the conflict . The conclusion of this history is worse than the commencement , and worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its philosophy , it is laid down as an inevitable result , that war must take place between us and England . Having established this fact , Mr. Alison marks out the plan of the next campaign in all its details , and speaks of the necessity of suddenly precipitating vast armies upon our coast , at the outset , with the coolness of a man whose trade is war . Not satisfied with the incitements to bad feeling furnished by his history alone , he inflames the passions still more by his outlines of the coming war , and renders the catastrophe familiar and probable by declaring it to be inevitable . No such necessity as he pretends exists ; and if so great a calamity to both nations should befall them , it will be brought about by such men and writers as Mr. Alison . One would think he had fallen in love with battles , from the fine materials for description they furnish him . Indeed , it harmonizes perfectly with another branch of his theory , drawn from the long and bloody wars of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the moral purification of mankind . " He acknowledges that it is the cause of unparalleled suffering , " but , " he asks , " is not suffering necessary to the purification of the human heart ? Have we not been told , by the highest authority , that man is made perfect through suffering ? Is not misfortune , anxiety and distress , the severe but salu // tary school of individual improvement ? And what is war but anxiety , distress , and often agony , to nations ? " The philanthropist will he angry at such ahsurdity , and the philosopher laugh at the stupid sophistry . We venture to say the apostle never dreamed that human ingenuity could ever so distort his divine precept , as to make it prove the purifying effect of war . Mr. Alison certainly has the credit of being the first discoverer of this entirely original aplication of the text . Murder and massacre , the torch of civil war blazing over human dwellings , mothers and children trampled down as the car of war rolls in carnage over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cities sacked , women ravished , and all the brutal passions of man , inflamed to the utmost , let loose on society , are necessary in order to purify it . They are to a nation what a sick bed is to a man , making it thoughtful , calm , and prayerful . Afflictions loosen us from the worl*l hy teaching us that nothing is stable here . War has the same effect on nations , lifting their tho tights to God . To close up a history of twentysix years of most bloody and wasting wars , during which religion was forgotten and education neglected , and life wasted like water , with the grave assertion that war is " necessary to the moral purification of mankind , " and base the assertion on the divine precept that " man is made perfect by suffering , " is the absurdest thing that ever found its way into the pages of history . Europe must have been very near the millenium at the summing up of her long purification at the battle of Waterloo , and Spain will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire ought to have grown very pure as it grew older , and the incessant conflicts of South America and Mexico must end in a high state of moral culture . The excitement to military glory , the recklessness of life and principle a war creates , the influence of an army quartered in a city or country , the purity of the camp , and the husbands and sons the scythe of battle mows down , are all so many causes of purification . So says Mr. Alison , while the history of the world , the experience of mankind , the spirit of the gospel , and the indignant response of the human heart brand it as false and calumnious . That there is no evil without some corresponding good , or in other words , that we may learn some lessons from every event , all men admit  --  but that war is a purifier of society , just as affliction purifies the Christian , is the most preposterous idea a Christian man ever entertained . Deeds of heroism are performed , and patriotism and affection and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in peace , but we thought it had been adopted as a maxim , long ago , that the physical evils of war , terrible as they are , were small compared to its moral evils . But Mr. Alison has one peculiarity , which other things being equal , would place him high above ordinary historians - he recognizes a GOD in history . The hand of Providence is seen in the course of human events , and the principle that the Almighty visits the sins of nations upon themselves , fully recognized . It is a standing objection to the best histories of our race , that secondary causes have been put for ultimate ones . Even the Pagan writers allow their gods to have some design in the changes that visit nations , while those of a more enlightened age see nothing in the mutations around them but the work of human passions . This belief in an overruling Deity , however , is almost neutralized hy the very aristocratic sort of a being he puts in heaven to preside over human affairs . Heisa high Tory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with republicanism or republicans . Indeed , we find it expressly stated , that religion and democracy are antagonisms , and that the one can not exist without the destruction of the other . The infidelity , the cruelty , the meanness , and utter ruin connected by necessity with a republican form of government , are taught on almost every page of this history . He has coupled the French Revolution and Democracy together in his mind , and neither facts nor argument can sunder them . The word , " revolution , " seems to have the same effect on his mind , that it might be supposed to have on one who had just passed through the Reign of Terror . But the Reformation of Luther was a revolution unshackling the world , and pouring daylight on its darkness . The Cromwellian rebellion was a revolution , doing more for English liberty than all antecedent ages had done for it . The American rebellion was a revolution , breaking the spell of tyranny , and sending hope and light to the farthest limits of the earth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in holding up before despots a mirror in which they might read their own fate , and teaching the world that oppression has a limit , and buried freedom its resurrection day ; and that just so deep as human rights and hopes are sunk , just so high will the tide of vengeance swell at last ; " Truth crushed to earth will rise again ; The eternal years of God are hers . " The fate of our own republic , which Mr. Alison rends so prophetically , is by no means yet decided ; and even should we fall , we do not consider the question of the durability of a republican government settled . Had our population been suffered to increase , by the natural laws which govern it , and all those who control our interests been educated in the principles of true freedom , and been bound together by the common ties of kindred and country , and the whole glorious fabric of our constitution steadily strengthened as bulwark after bulwark was reared around it by the jealous watchfulness of an intelligent people , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oursekes , on our own soil , then we should consider the question of the expediency of a republican form of government fixed for ever . But now we are compelled not only to struggle with the evils that gather around every new undertaking , hut to blend and incorporate into the very heart of our system the ignorance and degradation and crime of the despotisms of Europe . From such materials as tyranny sends us we are asked to rear our structure , and if it ever sways and totters , from the heterogeneous mass we are compelled to pile so hastily into it , we are tauntingly asked-How goes the doctrine of equality ? The tens of thousands of hungry , half naked , and miserable beings , that are precipitated yearly upon our bosom , and enter almost immediately upon the work of reforming our system , come from a government where all their sorrows have sprung from the oppression of the upper classes . Knowing the " wormwood and the gall , " and retaining the old hatred against the rich that has strengthened with their sufferings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , by unscrupulous leaders , to act against their own permanent interests . So , also , the convicts and famine-struck wretches , that the prisons and almshouses of Europe disgorge yearly on our shores , swell the records of crime and pauperism in our land , while the acts they commit and the sufferings they engender , are charged over to republicanism . " Laissez faire " is a just request ; and could the world hut have granted it to us we should have been content.
