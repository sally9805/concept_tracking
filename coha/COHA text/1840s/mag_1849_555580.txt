txt AMIDST the events that have agitated Europe during the past year , the revolution which occurred in Berlin on the // 18th of March deserves particular notice . The commanding position which Prussia occupies as the great Protestant power of Continental Europe , the past history of that country to which Frederic the Great imparted so bright a lustre by his military genius , and , more than all , the rapid growth of a kingdom which , humble and recent as is its origin , has for the last half-century ranked among the most powerful states of Europe , all serve to give to the political commotions which agitate it an unusual degree of interest . There is , indeed , something so impressive in the sight of a great and powerful nation like the Prussian rising up against its rulers , and overthrowing in a few hours the whole political organization of the state , that it must engage our attention and awaken our sympathies , even at a time when revolutions , shaking and overturning mighty thrones , convulsing society to its centre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common city , have become every-day occurrences . And when we consider the peculiar characteristics of a nation , perhaps better educated than any other in Europe , a nation which has ever enjoyed the reputation of being sincerely attached to its sovereigns , and which was certainly never suspected of being animated by that daring and restless spirit which causes a people to embrace , for the sake of change , any schemes of reform , however wild or absurd they may be , we feel that our interest is not misplaced , for we know that such a nation would not raise the standard of rebellion , unless it were actuated by some powerful and just motive . The lamentable events which in February last changed the form of government in France  --  the only effect of which has been , as far as we are able to see , to discredit republicanism in Europe - may have given the signal for the outbreak in Berlin . When the news of another French revolution reached the capital of Prussia , it was not unnatural that the people should think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , and endeavour to obtain from the king some political guaranties . But it would be rating the Prussian nation far too low , to suppose that this foolish desire of imitating that revolution , the importance of which , owing to the poetical halo which Lamartine had succeeded in casting around it , was greatly magnifled in the eye of the distant observer , alone actuated them . Nor would it be more just to attribute their glorious struggle to the machinations of those who profess the fantastic and 19* // absurd doctrines of communism or socialism , which we should view but with contempt , if they were not liable to produce so much mischief and crime . Such a party undoubtedly exists in Prussia , and has long wished to revolutionize the state , and to profit by disorder and anarchy in order to build up their own shattered fortunes . But this party alone did not make the Revolution of Berlin , and we must seek elsewhere for the cause of that mighty struggle , which , for a time , seemed to endanger the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monarchies of Europe , there are two great and inevitable contests which have already taken place , or are yet to come . The first is the struggle of royalty against the feudal system ; the second is the struggle of the people against the unlimited power of the sovereign . It was the peculiar good fortune of France to experience , earlier than any other European state , the first of these revolutions . Louis XI . and Cardinal Richelieu - much as the duplicity of their conduct is repugnant to our moral feelings - did a great work for France . They labored to destroy the many sovereignties which divided the country , and to form one united nation under the yoke of a despot . The Revolution of 1789 accomplished the second change . The absolute power of the crown was broken down , and its authority limited . It was not so in Germany . The first of these two crises is not to be found in her history till a much later period . The feudal system existed in that country down to the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations have but just entered , must also be accomplished . The recent revolutions at Berlin and Vienna have been but progressive steps in this inevitable course . This view of these events explains the difference in the feelings excited within us by the Revolutions of Paris and of Berlin . We can not but consider the first as useless and criminal , - not so much a revolt against despotism , or a generous movement in favor of liberty , as one against order and in favor of the wildest anarchy . The second we regard as legitimate and just . Prussia has emerged from childhood . Prosperous in her commerce and industry , in science and literature at the head of all German nations , and alive to a sense of the importance of the part which she might be called upon to play in the future destinies of Germany , she could no longer bear to be // held in the leading-strings of paternal despotism . She had been long enough deceived by her rulers ; she no longer trusted in their promises , but relied on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the place to prove that the Revolution of Paris was needless and wrong . Every impartial mind , even though at first seduced by the highsounding promises of liberty , equality , and fraternity , and by the pompous eloquence of Lamartine , must by this time be convinced of the truth of this assertion . As to the second of our propositions , that the revolution which has transformed the military despotism of Prussia into a constitutional monarchy was legitimate , we think that a brief sketch of the history of that kingdom since the French Revolution of 89 will sufficiently prove it . Frederic William III. , the father of the present king of Prussia , ascended the throne in 1797 , at a time when it required more than ordinary talents to wield the sceptre . The treasury was nearly bankrupt , owing to the folly and extravagance of the preceding king . The army , which under Frederic the Great had excited the admiration of Europe , had been completely disgraced by the profligacy of that monarch . Prussia had been dishonored by the humiliating treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of difficulty within the kingdom itself , the principles of the French Revolution were beginning to he disseminated throughout Europe . It was evident that the new king would be obliged either to resist the growing spirit of innovation , or to favor those reforms which the progress of the age demanded . Fortunately for Prussia , Frederic William , without being a man of superior talents , had the welfare of his subjects at heart , and was willing to surround himself with able and faithful counsellors . The first acts of his reign were calculated to render him popular . He abrogated the edicts which his father had promulgated on religious matters and the press . He sought , as much from taste as principle , to maintain the strictest neutrality in European politics , but became finally involved in the coalition of 1805 against France , a coalition which was dissolved by the battle of Austerlitz . He was obliged again to take up arms when Napoleon formed the Confederacy of the Rhine . It was his desire to establish a confederacy of the states of Northern Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French emperor in the // Southern states ; hut he could not accomplish this object . Without a single ally , then , Prussia was obliged to encounter France in 1806. rlll ) e battle of Jena decided her fate . It has been said by a German writer , that it was Frederic the Great who was defeated at Jena . There is much of philosophic truth in this remark . It was he who had given to Prussia a new system of laws , and opened in the kingdom innumerable sources of wealth and prosperity . It was he who , by bumbling the pride of the house of Austria , had given her that ascendency which she has since enjoyed . But from the time of his death in 1786 , every thing had remained unchanged . Not one step in advance had been taken during the reign of his imbecile successor , Frederic William II. , and in 1806 the Prussian monarchy was almost exactly in the same condition as when Frederic the Great expired . The feudal system of privileged and distinct classes had been maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the aristocracy , who could neither divide nor sell their estates , nor leave them by will to a commoner . Neither could the noble become the owner of the landed property of a commoner , or of the farm of a peasant , nor could he exercise the trade of a commoner . At a time when the French Revolution was beginning to bear its fruits , and to inspire the rest of Europe with a desire for the reorganization of society on a more liberal and equitable basis , this antiquated system - in which the accident of birth exerted so fatal an influence on the whole life of a man - was still in force in Prussia . And it was these two powers , Prussia and France , - the one but a lifeless corpse , which had retained only the sernblance of a form after the spirit of Frederic had abandoned it ; the other full of youthful vigor , and inspired by those principles of independence and equality which had grown out of the Revolution - it was these two powers which met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contest be doubtful ? Brought into contact with these new-creating principles , the old system crumbled into dust . Prussia fell , as many thought , never more to rise . The peace of Tilsit ( 1807 ) deprived her of all her provinces between the Elbe and the Rhine , as well as of her possessions in Poland , including in all about five ruillions of subjects . She was , moreover , obliged to pay 120,000,000 francs to the French government , and to support // 11,000 French troops in the very heart of the kingdom . Might it not well have seemed , even to the wisest , that Prussia was for ever crushed ? It was not so , however ; and it is not a paradox to affirm , that nothing but so heavy a blow could have saved her from utter ruin . The defeat at Jena brought to light the defectiveness of the old organization of the Prussian monarchy . Until then , king and nobility had alike opposed all plans of reform . Experience taught them wisdom . Not quite a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Baron Von Stein to preside over his ministry , and a new era was opened in Prussian history . This distinguished man , to whom Prussia owes more than to any other individual , if we except Frederic the Great , had been , it is said , recommended to the king by Napoleon , who called him " un homme d'esprit . " Stein was something more , and Napoleon himself soon discovered it . He determined to reform his country , to raise her from her humbled condition , and to enable her , when the moment should arrive , to free herself from the yoke of foreign dominion . The principles on which he proposed to found his reforms may thus be summed up - " What the state loses in extent must be regained in intensity of power . That which is old has perished ; every thing must be created anew , if Prussia is ever to resume her importance among the nations of Europe . In what remains of the former larger state there are hostile elements . These must be got rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The different classes are at variance with each other , on account of the favor which the one has always enjoyed , and of which the others did not partake . Union gives strength . Equal rights to all members of the state , no order being more favored than another , must be introduced , if union is desired . Each citizen must have the same duties towards the state . Each must be personally free , and obey only one master , the king , with his code of laws in his hand . And in order that duties and rights may be equal , and that the former he not oppressive for any one , there must be a national representation , by means of which better laws may be made . Every man must be allowed to exercise freely his powers , and to follow his own tastes and judgment , so long as he does not pass the limits prescribed by religion , morality , and the laws of the land . All landed // property must be accessible to every one wishing to acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . The administration of communities by government officers , or by single privileged individuals , is a dangerous practice , which precludes all unity of feeling , and which must be remedied . No one in the state , whether a corporation or an individual , should be judge in his own cause . The judiciary must therefore be separated from the executive . All must be governed by the same laws ; consequently , there must be but one judicial authority , whose verdicts shall reach alike the highest and the lowest . Every one , except the criminal who tramples religion , morality , and the law under foot , must enjoy his liberty . The servant , too , must be free ; the contract which binds him to his chosen master must not deprive him of his civil liberty . Master and servant must be protected by the same law . Mental cultivation elevates a people , and the higher it is carried , the higher will be their place in the confederacy of civilized nations . Education is the condition of all progress in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this education . " No sooner had Stein accepted the difficult post which had been intrusted to him , than he devoted all the energies of his superior intellect to the execution of the reforms of which we have given the outline . He remained , however , but one year in the cabinet , and could not , of course , carry out all his plans in that time . What he did , however , was enough to entitle him to the lasting gratitude of his country . By the edict of October 9th , 1807 , all Prussian subjects were allowed to acquire and hold property of any description whatsoever . By this measure , the hereditary subjection of the peasantry to the proprietors of the estates on which they were born was suspended . Another edict removed the absurd restrictions which had until then fettered the proprietor , not only in the disposal , but even in the cultivation , of his land . These two edicts paved the way for the entire emancipation of the Prussian people . Another most important measure of Von Stein 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . This edict , known under the name of the Siddie Ordnung , was intended to give the citizens a more direct influence on all affairs relating to their community . Frederic William I. had taken from the cities almost all their privi // leges . It was the object of his narrow and despotic policy to bring every thing , as much as possible , under the ( lirect influence of the central government . All municipal magistracies were therefore confided to government officers . It was to do away with the evils resulting from such a system that the edict just mentioned was promulgated . Its object was to awaken a public spirit . The citizen was not only to take care of his own property , but to have a share in the interests of his community . The wisdom of such a measure will he readily understood . By granting to the middle classes a share in the local administration of the cities in which they resided , a stronger attachment was awakened in them for their common country . Patriotism is always developed in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration of its own affairs . Loyalty may exist under the sway of a despotic ruler ; but we can not conceive of patriotism without liberty . In thus breaking down the old feudal system , and granting to the cities a more liberal organization , as indeed in all the other reforms of the minister , his object was twofold . He wished , in the first place , to prepare the nation for that struggle with France which he felt must sooner or later decide the destinies of Prussia and Germany . He understood that a nation in which the larger proportion of the inhabitants have no interest at stake , but follow blindly the dictates of a privileged class , was incapable of resisting the invasion of a nation like the French , in which the most perfect equality reigned , notwithstanding the despotism of its chief . It was not by mere brute force that a French army could be opposed . To conquer it , it became necessary to borrow somewhat from the principles by which it was animated . It was in consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred for every thing French , followed the French Revolution as his model in many of his proposed reforms . But he had another object in view . He desired to increase the power and influence of Prussia in the conduct of the affairs of Germany . He himself has said , - " My desire to see Prussia prosper did not proceed from a blind attachment to that country , but also froin the conviction , that the divisions of Germany weaken her , destroy her national honor and feeling , and render her incapable of any good government . German princes should remember that the independence of Germany // depends on the moral and physical force of Prussia . " It was his hope , that , by giving liberal institutions to Prussia , she might become the central point round which would be collected the different nationalities of Germany . The measures of which we have spoken were bitt the first of the long series of reforms which Von Stein proposed to make in the institutions of his country . Unfortunately for Prussia , he was not permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In November , 1808 , Napoleon , having learned that Von Stein had formed schemes for the deliverance of Germany from his dominion , forced the king of Prussia to dismiss him from the public service . Previously to leaving the cabinet , he communicated to the administration a paper in which his views as to the government of the state were boldly and clearly set forth . Although he signed this document , he did not himself draw it up . To Schdn , another Prussian statesman and patriot , belongs the honor of composing this valuable scheme , known as the political testament of Von Stein . Had the views set forth in this document , which maintained that a general national representation was indispensable in order that the sovereign might become acquainted with the wants of the people , been carried out , it is difficult to say how much bloodshed and how many storms Prussia might have escaped . On Hardenberg fell the difficult task of succeeding to Von Stein . Three departments of the administration were intrusted at once to this statesman , - that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance . The work to be done in each was immense , and would have intimidated a less consummate statesman than Hardenberg . His first care , on taking the reins of government into his hands , was to provide for the payment of the sum stipulated by the treaty of Tilsit . Prussia had suffered so much , and had been so impoverished by the war , that it was a subject of serious discussion , whether the province of Silesia should not be ceded to France in paymeat of the debt . Hardenberg was not the man to accede to so humiliating a proposition . He effected a loan in Holland , which enabled him to avert the danger with which the non-payment of the French claim would have threatened his country ; and he then devoted himself to the continuation of the reform commenced by his predecessor . In his external policy , he sought for an alliance with England . In his internal // reforms , France was his model , as it had been that of Von Stein . It was his wish to attain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the result of a stormy and bloody revolution . In the following words he has himself well expressed his intentions - " My system rests on this basis , that each member of the state shall be free to develope and exercise his powers without hindrance from the arbitrary will of another ; that justice shall be administered with impartiality ; that merit , in whatever rank it is found , shall he rewarded ; and that education , true piety , and appropriate institutions shall create in our country one interest and one spirit , upon which to found our prosperity and our security . " The several edicts published during Hardenberg 's administration were of the utmost importance . The exemption of the aristocracy from taxation was suspended . All the old corporations of trades were abolished , and the trades opened alike to all Prussian subjects . This measure , which was one of the most effectual means of breaking up the old forms of society , met w-ith considerable opposition , not only on the part of those privileged families which had belonged to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who censured it on account of the increase of misery and vice which it was , in their estimation , likely to produce amongst the working classes . The number of unskilful master-workmen , said they , would augment , whilst that of the subordinate workmen would be proportionally diminished , owing to the desire which every artisan would experience to exercise his trade on his own account . Moreover , the increase of workmen and tradesmen would be entirely out of l ) roportion to the general increase of the population . Experience has proved these views to have been erroneous . Statistical returns show that , with the exception of a few trades , as those of butcher , tailor , shoemaker , baker , book-hinder , carpenter , &amp;c. , the number of tradesmen , although considerably increased , has not been so disproportionably to the increase of the general population ; and that the number of persons engaged in such trades as those of the furrier , leatherdresser , tanner , glazier , &amp;c. , has diminished . It is also shown , that the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in many cases increased ; and also that , far from being less skilfully trained than under the old organiza // tion of the trades , the improvement in labor and workmanship , as a general thing , has been quite marked . To every impartial judge , it must , we think , appear that the measure of Hardenberg was wise and politic . By opening trade indiscriminately to all Prussian subjects , competition , without which trade must always languish , was excited , and industry was gradually brought to its present flourishing condition . What had been done for trade was also accomplished for agriculture . It was freed from the shackles which had , until then , prevented its development . By the law of September 14 , 1811 , the peasantry first acquired the right of becoming hereditary possessors of the soil . Their labor was no longer to profit their masters only ; they could now work for themselves and their families . the good effects of this measure were soon felt . In the hands of a peasantry enjoying the right of possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more land cultivated than had previously been the case , hut now that it was cultivated by those who were to reap the harvests , every means was taken to make it yield all that nature had intended it should . There was much opposition to the promulgation of this edict . In the then ruined condition of the country , when the larger portion of the estates of the aristocracy were burdened with debts , to deprive the owners of the rents which they received from their peasant-tenants was in fact to deprive them of their estates . Many of these estates were sold , and frequently purchased by rich capitalists , whose wealth had been acquired in trade . Such sweeping measures , causing so much of the landed property to pass into new hands , might seem unjust , if we did not consider the peculiar circumstances under which they had been adopted . Hardenberg felt the absolute necessity of improving the condition of the finances , and he saw no other means but those which he used to attain his object . In viewing the law which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estates in order to create a new class of landholders , we should also bear in mind , that all Hardenberg 's measures were taken with a view of preparing his country for that constitution which he , as well as Von Stein , desired to give to Prussia , and which she has only just acquired by means of a bloody conflict . The new class of proprietors formed by the legislation of September , 1811 , was destined to gain every day in wealth , influence , and power ; and Hardenberg could // not but have seen , that it would soon be ready to claim its share in the government of the country . Had it not been the intention of the minister ultimately to grant a national representation , he surely would not have created so powerful a force in the very heart of the state . He was too profound a statesman not to foresee , that the day was not far distant , when not even a military power could resist the progress of the middle classes , and maintain a despotic form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms in the civil organization of the state , Dohna , Scharnhorst , Gneisenau , and Grolman were , as one may say , creating a new army . The army which had been defeated at Jena was constituted according to the principles of the old system , which Stein and Hardenberg so strenuously labored to break down . A nobleman alone could attain the rank of an officer , - doubtless in virtue of the remark of Frederic the Great , that a nobleman alone can know what honor is . The common soldier , excluded from all prospect of advancement , was a degraded being , over whom his superiors exercised the most cruel tyranny , whilst the peasant and the citizen feared him as one to whom life and honor were alike indifferent . Many foreigners were enlisted in the army . Flogging was used as a means of retaining them in the service , and of urging them on to battle . All this the distinguished military men whom we have named determined to reform . The barriers which prevented the common soldier from rising by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army were taken down . In a word , the army was thoroughly reorganized . The energy which was displayed in this work laid the foundations of that military system which was recently admired throughout Europe for its superior arrangement . Not too soon had Prussia 's statesmen commenced the difficult work of reform . Before they could complete their task as they desired , they were obliged to prepare for war . Napoleon had been defeated in Russia , and the French army was fast approaching the Prussian frontier . The government sought to gain as much time as possible ; but when war could no longer be avoided , the king - although reluctantly , such was his desire for peace - retired to Breslau , where he signed the treaty of alliance with Russia , and issued the famous proclamation , calling upon his people to struggle against // the dominion of France , and to free Germany for ever from Napoleon 's despotic sway . The long expected war broke out . Prussia , new-created since the battle of Jena , displayed in this war an energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been allowed her for preparation . The army , no longer resting its strength on slavish discipline alone , but animated by patriotism , and the desire not only of freeing Prussia from foreign dominion , but of securing liberal institutions , proved itself invincible . The French were expelled from the country . History has seldom recorded a more remarkable struggle , or a more glorious victory . But neither has history often recorded so cruel a deception as that which awaited those who had not hesitated to risk their lives for their king and country . The people had hoped to obtain their liberty by this war , which , in their enthusiasm , they called " the holy war . " Holy , indeed , would it have been , had Prussia 's monarch not deceived his subjects in order to induce them to take up arms . When we look back to the period of Prussia 's struggle for her liberties , and then call to mind the long series of disappointments which followed , only closed by the bloody revolution which has , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing of liberty , we are forcibly reminded of the mournful and prophetic words written by the patriot Arndt in 1813 : - " All will have been in vain , - so much blood , so much labor , will have been expended in vain , - if our rulers , in whose hands are our destinies , do not rise to a pure faith in God and the people . If they still continue to seek only the gratification of their petty ambition , the age will be convulsed by the most dreadful revolutions , and not until long after the earth has closed over our remains will a new world arise . " When the war was over , the government , instead of fulfilling promises already made , continued to flatter the nation by holding out to them the most cheering hopes . On the 22d of May , 1815 , the celebrated decree promising a constitutional form of government to Prussia was issued . This decree has been of such great importance in the subsequent history of Prussia , that we give it entire . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of civil liberty , and the continuance of a just government founded on order , have hitherto found as much security in the qualities of the rulers , and in the harmony which exists between // them and the people , as is compatible with the imperfection of ' human institutions . But wishing to consolidate them still more , and to give the Prussian nation a pledge of our confidence , and to posterity those principles upon which our predecessors and ourselves have carried on the government of our kingdom with true solicitude for the welfare of our people , in. the form of a written document , as a Constitution for the Prussian state , we have decided as follows : - " 1 . The people shall be represented . " 2 . For this purpose , the provincial assemblies , wherever they still exist , shall be constituted anew , and conformed to the necessities of the times ; and where none at present exist , they shall be introduced . " 3 . The representatives of the country shall be chosen from the provincial assemblies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The authority of the representative body is limited to giving counsel on all subjects of legislation which regard the personal rights of the subjects and their rights of property , including taxation . " 5 . A committee shall be appointed , to meet in the capital without loss of time , consisting of inhabitants of the provinces and enlightened officers of the state . " 6 . This committee shall occupy itself with the organization of the provincial assemblies and of the representation , as well as with the drawing up of the constitution upon the principles now established . " 7 . The committee shall meet on the 1st of September of this year . " The expectntions which this decree raised in the public mind may easily be imagined . In the Rhenish provinces , especially , the excitement produced by its promulgation was intense . It is difficult to say whether the government had not counted on so strong a display of feeling in connection . with this subject , or whether it was from a sincere desire to forward the real interests of the nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being acted upon . It was not until 1817 that a committee for the formation of the constitution was appointed . For a few months , this committee worked hard at the task confided to them ; but the king having undertaken a journey in the Rhenish provinces , their labors were suddenly interrupted . During the king 's sojourn in the western portion of his dominions , a number of petitions and addresses were presented to him , in which he was 20* // reminded in tbe most direct manner of his promises . He hastily quitted the provinces , and returned to Berlin , fully convinced by what he had seen , that the nation considered a constitution as a thing of far too much importance to make it safe for the government to grant one . Had his subjects , like good and docile children , patiently waited until it should please their royal father to fulfil his promises , they would no doubt sooner have obtained their wished-for constitution . By returning to Berlin , the king had hoped to escape the complaints and reproaches of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hardly reached his capital , when an address , drawn up at Coblentz on the 12th of January , 1815 , by Gdrres , the celebrated leader of the radical party in the Rhenish provinces , was transmitted to him . It served but to confirm the unfavorable impression which his tour on the Rhine had made on his mind ; and a cabinet order was immediately published , declaring , " that neither in the edict of May 22d , 1815 , nor in Article 13 of the Act of the Confederation , is there any time fixed for carrying the constitution into execution ; that all times were not alike favorable for the introduction of change in the state ; that whoever reminds the sovereign of the land of a promise given on his own free decision evinces criminal doubts as to the inviolability of his word , and forestalls his opinion as to the proper time for the introduction of the constitution , which opinion must be as free as the first decision was ; and finally , that the king would fix the time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suffer himself to be hurried by untimely representations . " How the hopes and expectations of the nation must have fallen , on perusing this singular document ! This was , however , but the first step in that series of retrograde measures which signalized the latter part of Frederic William 's reign . The constitution was no longer thought of , and only at distant intervals was it alluded to by some ardent and patriotic spirit , who was soon silenced . The only act which seemed at all in harmony with the liberal promises of the government was the establishment of provincial diets , which , however , never proved very dangerous to the general government . But if the king did nothing towards giving his subjects a larger share in the management of public affairs , he continued to rule them with moderation and justice , and to develope // such of the institutions of the country as he thought admitted of reform without endangering the royal prerogative . To the subject of education he gave much attention . As early as 1809 , in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded the University of Berlin . In 1 818 , he established that of Bonn , and gave to those which already existed a new importance , by organizing them on a broader and more liberal basis . There now exist in Prussia six universities , those of Greifswalde , Kdnigsberg , Halle , Berlin , Breslan , and Bonn . The condition of the public schools was also greatly improved . We need not dwell upon the important changes effected in them ; the Prussian school system has now for many years been a model for imitation both in Europe and America . Other improvements were undertaken during the reign of Frederic William III . ; roads were constructed , canals opened , public buildings erected . Even during the calamitous period which followed the defeat of Jena , a million and a half of thalers were expended on public works . But of all the events of this important reign , none , perhaps , is of greater interest than the formation of the German Customs-Union ( Zoll- Verein ) . It had been agreed at the Congress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the German Confederation should become the subject of debate at the first meeting of the Diet at Frankfort . But fourteen annual meetings of the IDiet at that place had been held without any decisive step being taken in regard to this important subject ; and the Prussian government finally determined to open direct negotiations with the other states of the Confederation , in order to regulate their commercial intercourse . It is not strange that Prussia should have felt a deep interest in this matter . As arranged by the treaties of 1815 , it is well known that the Prussian monarchy presents in its geographical configuration two great masses of territory , of unequal extent , and entirely separated from each other . The shortest distance between these two distinct portions of the kingdom is seven and three fourths German geographical miles. * The number of petty states which intervene , each of which possessed its own custom-house barriers , was a serious obstacle to the development // of Prussian commerce . A treaty was therefore concluded , in 1828 , by the Prussian government with HesseCassel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were broken down . In 1833 , other treaties were concluded , by which Bavaria , Wiirtemberg , and Saxony united with the league . Since then , some other states have joined , and the Zoll-Verein now comprises more than 29,000,000 of people. * We can not , without transgressing our limits , enter into any details on this interesting subject . The objects for which the league was formed , moreover , - the securing of a free commercial intercourse between its several members , the establishment of uniform duties , the division of the net produce of the duties among the different members in proportion to their population , - are well known . It was , as we have said , of the greatest importance to Prussia , not only in a commercial point of view , but as a means of acquiring a political ascendency over the smaller states of the league . It might be supposed that to Prussian custom-house regulations , which had already been adopted , would succeed the Prussian monetary system , Prussian post-offices , roads , weights , and measures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has , we believe , been generally understood , that she would not have viewed with so tranquil an eye the peaceful aggrandizement of her rival , if she bad not received assurances from the Prussian government , that she would be allowed to assert an undisputed supremacy in Italy . Of course , in the present condition of Europe , when nations seem to have taken their affairs into their own hands , these assurances have but little value ; and we merely allude to them as accounting for Austria 's apparent apathy in presence of Prussia 's increasing power and influence . By such enlightened measures for the internal and external improvement of the kingdom , the government of Frederic William III . earned the well-deserved reputation of having zealously espoused the interests of the nation . In the midst of the prosperity which reigned around them , the people for a time forgot that their legitimate demands for a larger share in the government of the country had not been granted . The // effects of the Paris Revolution of 1830 were , it is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excitement of the popular mind gave rise were soon put down by the governments against which they were directed , and Germany once more subsided into that quiescent state for which she has become proverbial , and from which she has but just been aroused . The latter years of the reign of Frederic William glided away tranquilly . The intellectual activity which the people could not bestow on political questions found ample room for development in matters purely literary and scientific . Prussia was gradually absorbing within herself most of the literature and science of Germany . The press , fettered as it was with regard to political discussion , continued to be the medium through which the results of the deep research and learning of her literary men were disseminated throughout the country . Ages and countries in which political liberty has been most fully attained are not always those in which intellectual culture has reached its highest development ; and we would even ask whether to the want of that liberty in Germany may not be ascribed that extraordinary development of her literature and science to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same space of time . Her whole modern literature may be comprised in a period of about one hundred years ; yet what treasures of learning , thought , and imagination are there to be found ! Far be it from us to wish to justify the sovereigns of Germany in denying to their subjects a due share in the management of the affairs of the state . We merely question whether , if her young men had been all engaged in dabbling in politics , in forming parties , or in the pursuit of empty political honors , her literature would have flourished as it has . We doubt it . After a long and agitated reign , Frederic Willian* III . died at Berlin , on the 7th of June , 1840 . A few days after his death , his political testament , which he had drawn up in 1827 , was published . The conclusion of this document is so characteristic of his policy , that we give a translation of it . " On you , my dear Fritz , will repose all the burden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their responsibility . For the discharge of them , you will be better prepared than most hereditary princes are by the position in which I have // placed you . It remains now for you to fulfil my just hopes , and the expectations of the country ; at least , for you to strive to do so . Your principles and sentiments are a security to me that you will he a father to your subjects . Guard , nevertheless , against the desire for innovation so generally spread around you . Guard also against impracticable theories , but at the same time against too exaggerated a taste for old usages ; the one is as pernicious as the other , and beneficial improvements can be attained only by avoiding these two evils . The army is in a flourishing condition . It has fulfilled my expectations , both in peace and in war , since its reorganization . May it continually bear in view its important duties ! Do not neglect , so far as in your power , to promote unity among the European powers ; but above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never separate from each other . Their union may be regarded as the key-stone of the European alliance . " We shall not pause to say much of the character of Frederic William 's government . We trust that it is sufficiently illustrated by the brief outline of his reign which we have endeavoured to present to our readers . That , under his administration , much was done for the Prussian monarchy , no one will deny . But the impartial historian , whilst he praises the monarch who encouraged the reforms of a Von Stem and a Hardenberg , will not forget that the same monarch was unmindful of the promises made to his people at a period of the utmost danger to Prussia . Naturally humane and just , his bigotry and his blind attachment to that absolute authority which he had inherited with the throne of his fathers often led him to the most arbitrary and even despotic acts , and to give his consent to the measures adopted by his powerful allies , Russia and Austria , to crush all attempts at reform . To resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen , scruple to allure his subjects by the most seductive promises , and thus to induce them to leave their tranquil homes and to struggle for the freedom of their country ; and yet , but a few years after the French had been expelled from Germany , a preacher at Berlin , and under his very eye , could assert from the pulpit , without fear of being contradicted , that the war of 1813-15 had been erroneously called a war of liberation , for the object of that war had not been to insure liberty to Germany , but merely to restore to her rulers the unlimited sovereignty of which Napoleon had for a time deprived them . Well might Byron say , - // " Gaul may champ the bit And foam in fetters ! But is earth more free ? Did nations combat to make one submit , Or league to teach all kings true sovereignty ? " Thus faithless in politics , Frederic William III . asserted in religious matters the most complete despotism over his people . The will of the sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should be the sacred tie between man and his Maker degenerated into a mere official relation between the king and the nation . In 1817 , he had by a royal decree expressed the desire , that the Evangelical Lutherans and the Evangelical Reformers should unite in one church , of which he should be the head , and which should bear the name of Christian Evangelical Church ( Cliristliche . Evangelische Kirche ) . The people quietly submitted , and although , since 1830 , there have been frequent attempts on the part of the old Lutheran party to reconquer their former independence , and to form separate churches , these efforts have for the most part proved ineffectual , in consequence of the many and vexatious obstacles thrown in their way by the government . The king , however , in pursuance of his plan of bringing all his subjects to his own narrow views of religion , persecuted not only those of his people who , although Protestants , professed a different creed from his own , but also those Catholics who form so large a proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom . The long and heated debates between the government and the Archbishop of Cologne in 1837 , during which that prelate was imprisoned in the fortress of Minden , place the king in the not very enviable light of being probably the first sovereign in Europe , since Louis XIV. , who persecuted alike his subjects of both the great Christian sects . Notwithstanding these faults , which will leave an indelible stain on his reign , Frederic William III . had done much to entitle him to the gratitude of his people , and when be died , the kingdom was in a far better condition than when he ascended the throne . Never before , indeed , had Prussia been so flourishing . The finances , although the receipts were not very great , - the whole amount in 1840 being 52,680,000 thalers , of which upwards of 24,000,000 were expended for the army , - were in perfect order , and amply sufficed for the expenses of the government . The sources of revenue in Prussia are taxation , government monopolies , // and some particular establishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp;c . The most in ) portant of the indirect taxes are those on imports , exports , and the transit of goods , and the stamp tax . Previous to the formation of the Zoll-Verein , the first mentioned of these taxes was levied yearly , according to a tariff which was revised hy the government every three years . Of course , since the commercial union between Prussia and many of the German states has been established , the common tariff adopted by them can be modified only with the consent of all the parties concerned . The only government monopolies now existing in Prussia are the salt tax and the monopoly of playing-cards . The happy condition of the finances , the improvements which had taken place in the kingdom , the situation of Europe , which had enjoyed so long a peace , but , more than all , the high estimation in which the character of the new king was held , gave rise to the liveliest hopes on his accession to the throne . As prince royal , Frederic William IV . had the reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princes in Europe . From an early age , he had been surrounded by the most distinguished men in literature , science , and art . Ancillon , Niebuhr , Schinkel , Ranke , and many others hardly less distinguished , had contributed to the education of the young prince . Full of wit and humor , as well as of imagination and fancy , - attached to the past , and yet ever dreaming of some bright future , this prince , by his kindly bearing to all who were deserving , and by his equitable character , had acquired an unusual share of popularity . Had he lived and died as prince royal , his memory would have been cherished like that of the Duke of Orl6ans in France . It was his misfortune to be called to a throne . As prince royal , all the amiable traits of his character , all the qualities of his mind , had full scope for development . He could charm a circle of friends by his brilliant and eloquent conversation , he could give full scope to his vivid imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improvement . He could do so without danger either to himself or to the people ; but as king , and with the power to will every whim or caprice which his head had conceived , the case was widely different , and since his accession to the throne , he has fully exemplified the line of the French poet - " Tel brille au second rang qui s ' *clipse au premier . " // We do not question his honesty or sincerity . During the eight years which have elapsed since he came to the throne , he has sought to promote the welfare and happiness of his people . He has devoted himself with uncommon energy to the study of their wants . He has labored hard , and passed nights in earnest discussion with his friends and counsellors . Whatever he has been able to do himself he has not left to others to do . And yet , notwithstanding all this , his power has been broken down and his pride humbled , like that of the most miserable despot . It has only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained from him those political institutions which they have so long desired , and which they so confidently anticipated that he would grant them on his accession fo the throne . If we seek , however , to account for this apparent contradiction , the explanation will be simple . In his views on the subject of the government of Prussia , the king has been altogether mistaken . Instead of entering into the spirit of his age , and favoring the development of democracy , - and by this word we mean nothing more than what it really implies , popular government , - he has constantly kept his eyes fixed on the past , and sought there for the ideal which he might realize in his dominions . He has not understood that , in our day , a sovereign , unless he imitate the despotic policy of the Czar of Russia , is but the representative of the will of the nation over which he rules , the delegate to whom they have intrusted their interests , without renouncing the supervision which every employer has over the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tie between sovereign and people is one of absolute authority on the one hand , and of blind and passive submission on the other . In his eyes , the extension of popular institutions , and respect paid to the will of the nation in the administration of public affairs , are not the natural results of an improved civilization , but favors which a sovereign may at his pleasure grant to his subjects , as a father would grant a toy to his children . Prussia was ripe for free institutions in 1840 , and a finer opportunity for giving to the world a memorable example of wisdom and moderation could not have been found than that which then offered itself to the king . Europe had enjoyed peace for a quarter of a century , when , owing to the overbearing attitude of the British cabinet , and the imprudence von . Lxviii. - No. 142. 21 // of NI . Thiers , then at the head of the French administration , she was on the very eve of being involved in a calamitous war . The motive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , but ill-disguised , rivalry between the powers of Europe not predisposed them to embrace the most paltry pretexts for taking up arms , the affairs of the East would not have excited so deep an interest . The existence or non-existence of a power like that of Mehemet Ali - founded , as M. de Lamartine so well expressed it in the Chamber of Deputies , on no more solid basis than the sands of the desert - would hardly have induced the powers of Europe to go to war . As it was , however , the danger of a general conflagration was imminent . Would it not , then , have been both wise and natural for the Prussian government to allow its subjects to enjoy the freedom for which they had been gradually fitting themselves , and thus to prepare them for the war which then seemed almost inevitable ? Twenty-five years had not been , as we have seen , lost upon Prussia . The people had acquired political information and a taste for public affairs . They were ready to take a share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat , have been the part of wisdom to encourage this growing spirit , to favor its development , and not to endeavour to crush it , but only to confine it in its proper channels ? Instead of doing so , the government simply took advantage of the impending alarm of war to flatter Prussia 's national pride , - that dangerous pillow on which so many nations have been lulled to sleep , - by reminding her of the noble deeds which had been performed in the war of 1813 . The danger of war passed away , and the condition of Prussia remained unchanged . And yet the enthusiasm displayed at Berlin on the 15th of October , 1840 , would have led one to suppose that Prussia was entering on a new era of progress and of liberty . That day had been fixed for the ceremony of the homage ( Huldigung ) to the king , a performance which in Prussia takes the place of a coronation . Thousands had assembled on the public square in front of the palace , in order to see and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stage erected for the purpose . As soon as he appeared , surrounded by his family and the great functionaries of the state , the air was filled with the most rapturous applause . After the oath of allegiance had been solemnly tendered by the orders assembled around the monarch , the king rose // from his throne , and addressed the crowd in the following apparently extemporaneous speech - " In this solemn moment of the homage of my German subjects , I appeal to God that he may fortify by his all-powerful sanction the oath which has just been pronounced , and that which you are about to hear . I swear to govern in the fear of God and the love of mankind , with open eyes when the exigencies of my people and of my times shall demand it , but with closed eyes whenever justice will admit of it . I will , so far as in my power , maintain peace , and with all my strength support the noble endeavours of the great powers who , for a quarter of a century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will , above all , seek to maintain our country in that position to which Providence , by an unexampled series of events , has raised her and made her the bulwark of Germany 's safety and rights . I will in all things strive so to reign , that my country may recognize in me the true son of a father and mother who can never be forgotten , but whose memory will endure as a blessing for ages to come . " But the ways of kings are full of tears , and worthy of compassion , when the hearts and the spirit of their people do not come to their aid . Therefore , in the enthusia*m of my love for my noble country , and for my subjects born to arms , liberty , and obedience , I address to you one question in this all-important hour . Answer me , if you can , in your own name , and in the name of those who have sent you here . Nobles , citizens , and peasants , and all of you who can hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit and in heart , with word and with deed , with the sacred fidelity of Germans , and with the still more sacred love of Christians , you will aid me in my endeavours to maintain Prussia as it is , and as it must remain , if it is not to perish for ever ? Will you aid me to develope those qualities by which Prussia , with only fourteen millions of inhabitants , has placed herself on a footing with the great powers of Europe , - honor , fidelity , striving after knowledge , right , truth , and progress , thus combining at once the wisdom of age with the heroic courage of youth ? Will you stand by me in this work , during days of prosperity and adversity ? 0 , then , answer me with that pure and solemn sound of our mother-tongue , - answer me with the word Yes ! " At this point of the king 's speech , the enthusiasm of the crowd reached the utmost pitch . Every voice gave assent to his demand . " This day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepest interest to Prussia and to the world . But your answer was for me ; it is my // property ; I shall not give it up . It binds us in mutual love and fidelity . It gives strength , courage , and confidence . I shall never forget it , not even at my dying hour . So help me God , I will maintain my oath of this day , and in witness thereof I lift my right hand to Heaven . It is now for you to accomplish the festivities of the day . May the blessing of God rest upon this hour ! " This scene , to which we know of no parallel in recent times , must , indeed , have been one of deep interest to those who had the good fortune to witness it . Nor do we wonder at the enthusiasm of the people on this occasion . The emotion of the speaker , the deep tone of conviction with which he spoke , the originality of his address , so unlike the ordinary addresses of sovereigns to their subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common hearers the liveliest hopes of a king who commenced his reign under such favorable auspices . But the reader will be wholly at a loss to conceive how men long trained in the difficult art of governing , and initiated in all the arcana of politics , should have founded very sanguine hopes on so slight a basis . He will ask himself how such men could have been dazzled by this singular speech , this medley of chivalrous and religious sentimentality , - how the vague and indefinite language of the king could have satisfied them even for a moment . And if we call to mind another speech made by the king on the same day , we shall still less be able to comprehend this wide-spread enthusiasm and confidence . In this speech , he said - " I know that I am indebted to God only for my crown , and that I have a right to say , - Let him who touches it beware ! But I know also , and I proclaim it in presence of you all , that this crown is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . I know that to him I shall have to render an account , day by day and hour by hour , of my administratioa . If any one amongst you demands a guaranty from his king , he can receive neither from me nor from any one on earth any greater safeguard . Yes ! these words bind me more strongly than any words engraved on bronze or inscribed on parchment ; for they come from a heart which beats for you , and they will take root in the convictions of your souls ! " Now , if we heard such speeches as these uttered on the stage by some feudal prince in the midst of his barons and vassals , we should doubtless think them very fine ; and if they // were well declaimed , the least enthusiastic amongst us would applaud . But in real life , in the bustle and turmoil of political contests , we want something more substantial than such indefinite phrases as these . Without distrusting the royal word , it could hardly be expected that the Prussians would long content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even had the king , in conformity with the expectations raised by his high-sounding language , granted his subjects the most liberal institutions , we question whether they would have been long contented with a liberty resting on so doubtful a basis as this . They would soon have claimed as a right what they only enjoyed as a boon . Faith in the divine right of kings , and in all the erroneous maxims of government which result from that absurd principle , has now almost entirely died out . The rights of nations must rest on more solid ground than on the word of their rulers . The precept of the Civil Law , Quod placuit principi legis vigorem habet , is an exploded principle . Rights which are founded only on the will of one man are felt to be unstable and insecure ; for who can say , that the power which to-day condescends to grant liberty to a people will not think fit to deprive them of it to-morrow ? And if one could answer for the sovereign who granted this liberty , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However strange it may seem to us that the king 's speeches should have given rise to such bright hopes , it is certain that this was the case , and that the most entire confidence pervaded all classes of society . The first acts of the new reign served to confirm this favorable impression . All the measures of the government seemed to have a liberal tendency . The king called to the capital all the literary and scientific men and artists he could prevail upon to leave their homes , and take up their residence in a more brilliant , but , as they soon found , less independent sphere . No regard was paid to political opinions in the invitations addressed by the king to such persons , and Berlin soon became the resort of many of the most distinguished men in Germany . The brothers Grimm , who had been expelled from the University of G6ttingen by the King of Hanover , Tieck , Ruckert , Herwegh , Freiligrath , Cornelius , and others , were at one time assembled in the Prussian capital , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederic William has been accused by his enemies of calling around him these distinguished men , with a view of intoxicating them with the pernicious poison of royal favor , and of thus binding them by ties of gratitude and attachment to his person . We do not believe that such was his intention . His motives were purer . He had not calculated on the ardent and patriotic resistance of some of the poets whom he had imprudently called around him . It was his hope that he might shed a new lustre on Prussia , by placing her at the head of civilization in Germany ; and perhaps , also , that he might turn towards matters purely literary and scientific the intellectual activity which was so rapidly spreading through his dominions . He did not understand that high intellectual culture can not long exist in a nation without a corresponding development of their civil and political liberties . How , indeed , can a distinct line of demarcation be drawn between what is purely intellectual and what belongs to more active life ? How can you tolerate perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and literary subjects , and yet prohibit any allusion to the living interests of the time ? The king 's eyes were soon opened ; he found that he had gone too far , and that he must either cause his liberal course with regard to the distinguished men of the day to be followed up by an equally liberal conduct in politics , or must put a check on the feelings which he had himself encouraged . Unfortunately , he preferred the latter course . Freiligrath , who was in receipt of a pension from the government , was soon obliged to leave Berlin ; and some of his poems , among others , one entitled " Freiheit und Recht , " and a translation of Burns 's song , " A man s a man for a ' that , " were prohibited by the censorship , as " addressing themselves to false ideas of freedom , or exciting the hostile opposition of the different classes of society . " Herwegh , on a visit to Berlin , was received by the king , who conversed with him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , - " Mr. Herwegh , you are the second of my enemies who has been to see me . The first was M. Thiers . But your eyes will be opened one day , like those of Paul on the road to Damascus . " The next day , Herwegh received an order to leave the city . Thus gradually were the hopes formed at the king 's accession to the throne blighted . Year after year passed by , without any thing being done to develope the political institu // tions of the country . It had been confidently expected , that Frederic William would grant a constitution founded on the principles laid down by his predecessor in the decree which we have quoted . To use the somewhat figurative language of a German writer , he was , like Solomon , to build the temple , a work on which*his royal father had considered himself unworthy to lay hands . Six months after his accession to the throne ( February , 1841 ) , an edict rather pompously drawn up was issued , granting a slight development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was far , very far , from answering the wishes of the nation . It gave rise to somewhat stormy debates in several of the provinces , and was everywhere severely criticized . The Assemblies of the provinces of Posen and Prussia Proper sent petitions to Berlin , setting forth their grievances , and reminding the king of his father 's promises . The king 's reply was haughty . The precipitation with which the decree had been judged was not , he said , the best way of exercising a happy influence on the kindly feelings which dictated it . lie stated , moreover , that the promises of his father could not be considered as binding , as they had been defacto abolished by the decree of June 5th , 1823 , constituting the Provincial Assemblies . In the course of the following year , a little further extension was given to the power of these Assemblies , and con ) mittees were formed , which met at Berlin . We have not space enough to follow closely the history of the following years , in which rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sufficient to say , that nothing was really done until the year 1847 , when , in the month of February , an edict was unexpectedly issued , providing that a United Diet should be assembled in Berlin so often as the wants of the state , new loans , the introduction of new taxes , or the increase of those already existing , should require . This diet , formed of the members of the eight Provincial IDiets , * besides the princes of the royal family , met for the * It may not be amiss to state , that the kingdom of Prussia is divided into eight provinces , viz. - Brandenburg , Pomerania , Saxony , Silesia , Prussia Proper , Posen , Westphalia , and the Rhenish Provinces . Each of these prov. inces is administered by a High President ( Ober Prasident ) , who may be c*nsidered as a royal commissary . By the law of June 5th , 1823 , alluded to above , each of these provinces has the right to assemble a diet . To have a seat in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired by other // first time at Berlin on the 11th of April , 1847 . The king opened it in person , and in a long address set forth his views as to the form of government suited to Prussia . In the manner of this address there is something not unlike the complacency with which an artist or an author points out to you the fine parts of what he considers as his master-piece . He laid great stress on his divine right and absolute power , but at the same time called upon his hearers to express their gratitude for the voluntary concessions he had made to the nation , and to admire the beautiful political structure he had raised . It was evident that Frederic William thought he had done a great work . The constitution on which he had been , it ' we may believe his own words , seven years at work , was promulgated , and was now for the first time put into operation . On the opening of the Diet he had staked all his hopes of future fame , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new play . It proved a failure . How , indeed , could this miserable pasticcio of the Middle Ages succeed in the midst of the nineteenth century ? Not even those who had been seduced in 1840 by the king 's language could again be carried away by passages like the following - " As the heir of an unweakened crown , which I must and will hand down unweakened to my successor , I know that I am perfectly free from all and every pledge with respect to that which has not been carried out , and , above all , with respect to that from the execution of which his own true paternal conscience preserved my illustrious predecessor . " And again : - " I have reserved the right of calling together these great assemblies on extraordinary occasions , when I deem it good and expedient ; and I will do this willingly at more frequent intervals , if this diet gives me the proof that I can do so without prejudice to higher sovereign duties . " He expressed in strong terms his unwillingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 know , " he said , " that with the rights intrusted to you , I grant you a costly jewel of freedom , and that you will employ it means , landed property , and to have held the same for ten consecutive years , to be at least thirty years old , to profess the Christian religion , and to be of good moral character . // faithfully . But I know also , that many will despise this jewel ; that to many it is not sufficient . Many , and among them very worthy men , look for our safety in the perversion of the natural relation between prince and people into a conventional existence , granted by charter and ratified by oaths . But the example of one happy country , whose constitution was not made on sheets of paper , but by the lapse of centuries and by an hereditary wisdom without a parallel , should not be lost upon us. if other countries find their happiness in manufactured and granted constitutions , we may admire them ; but Prussia could not bear such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I answer , Cast your eyes on the map of Europe ; look at the position of our country , - at its component parts ; follow the line of its borders ; weigh the power of our neighbours ; above all , throw an enlightened glance on our history . It has pleased God to make Prussia strong by the sword of war from without , and by the sword of the intellect from within . As in the camp , unless in cases of the most urgent danger , the command must be exercised only by one person , so can the destinies of our country , unless it is to fall immediately from its elevation , be guided by only one will ; and if the king of Prussia would commit an abomination , if he were to demand from his subjects the submission of slaves , he would commit a far greater one , were he not to demand of them the crowning virtue of freemen , - I mean obedience for the sake of God and conscience. ** In another passage , he thus strangely defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noblemen and trusty delegates , the late king , after mature reflection , called the diets into existence , according to the German and historical idea of them . In this idea alone have I continued his work . Impress yourselves , I entreat you , with the spirit of this definition . You are a German diet in the anciently received sense of the word ; that is , you are representatives and defenders of your own rights " It is not your province to represent opinions , or to bring the opinions of this or that school into practical operation . That is *vholly un-German , and , moreover , completely useless for the good of the community ; for it would necessarily lead to inextricable difficulties with the crown , which must govern according to the laws of the land and its own free , unbiased resolution , and which can not - does not - govern according to the will of the majority , if it would not cause Prussia to become an empty sound in Europe . " // the king 's intention not to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the powers with which he himself was invested . If any doubts had existed on the subject , the following words must have dispelled them - " I have appeared amongst you , and addressed you with royal freedom . With the same openness , and as a proof of my confidence in you , I here give you my royal word , that I should not have called you together , had I had the smallest suspicion that you would have any desire to play the part of what are called representatives of the people ' ; because , according to my deepest and most heartfelt conviction , the throne and state would be endangered by it , and because I recognize it as my first duty , under all circumstances and events , to preserve the throne , the state , and my government as they at present exist . " We have quoted thus largely from the royal speech , in order to show the true character of the institutions granted to Prussia , and how little they were calculated to satisfy the legitimate demands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such pomp and ostentation ? What was it more than a show , in which the actors , if ( locile and obedient to the voice of their manager , were to be recompensed by being more frequently assembled to perform their parts ; but , if disobedient , were liable to the royal displeasure ? How is it possible that the king or his advisers should not have foreseen , that to grant this unreal mockery to the nation was far more dangerous than not to grant any thing ? How could they have failed to understand , that , in seven years of trustful expectation and constant disappointment , the nation had learned how much reliance it could place on the fine speeches of its sovereign , and had found out the necessity of taking the matter into its own hands , if it ever expected to obtain any share in the management of public affairs ? This was , indeed , what happened . The members of the Diet took as a reality what had been given to them as a sport . Like that heathen actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyr , was so carried away by the sentiments to which he was giving utterance , as to have been really converted , they kindled into enthusiasm by the mere acting of the parliamentary play which had been intrusted to them , and changed it into something real and substantial . An address was voted in reply to the king 's speech , which , although consider ably modified from the one originally proposed , // was firm and decided in its tone . The Diet thanked him in respectful language for what had been granted , but expressed the desire that more might he done . To this address the king replied , that what had been done was not to he considered as final , but rather as capable of further development ( nicht als abgeschlossen , vielmehr als bildungsfiihig . ) The Diet continued in session until the 26th of June , when it was closed amidst considerable agitation , caused by the bold attitude of some of the members , who had not accepted the royal definition of their office , but considered themselves as the representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle for its rights . This first session of the United Diet was but a trial of strength , in which the members had acquired the conviction that they were not mere tools in the hands of the king , - a conviction which could not but prove fatal to the king 's dreams of absolute sway . No one , however , could have foreseen that they would not again assemble until a bloody revolution had broken down the despotic government of Prussia . The remainder of the year 1847 passed away quietly for Prussia . But last spring , the country was awakened from its apparent tranquillity by the unexpected news of the downfall of Louis Philippe , and the proclamation - some call it the establishment-of a republic in France . This news seems to have produced , from the first , the liveliest impression in Prussia , as well as throughout Germany ; and the king deemed it advisable , in closing , on the 6th of March , the session of the committee of the Provincial Diets , which had met to revise the penal code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Diet - the convocation of which , as we have seen , depended entirely upon the royal pleasure - should be assembled regularly every four years . Greater concessions would have been necessary to calm the excitement which then prevailed throughout the country . The members of the committee were dissatisfied . On the evening of the 8th , the students of the University of Berlin met in the Thier Garten , a park in the immediate vicinity of the capital , for the purpose of drawing up an address to the king , demanding the further development of the rights of the people . In the midst of their debate , the president of the police made his appearance , and after having made himself known to the principal leaders of the meeting , informed // them that he had no intention of preventing their proceedings , and if they would vote a loyal address to his Majesty , that he would pledge his honor to remit the same to the king in the course of a few hours ; but as the king had positively determined not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of sending him one . The students , however , who did not wish to be thus cheated out of the public demonstration they had designed making , broke up the meeting , and convoked a larger assembly for the following day . At this meeting , which was attended not only by the students , but by a large number of citizens , an address was adopted , demanding from the king entire liberty of the press and of speech , an amnesty for all political offences , equal political rights , trial by jury , the reduction of the standing army , and the immediate convocation of the United Diet . It was not until after a long debate , that the assembly could decide upon the proper way of transmitting this address to the king . It was finally decided , however , that it should be handed to the delegates of the city , then in session , for them to present it to his Majesty ; and in case they should refuse to do so , an audience should be demanded for a deputation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( March 11th , ) the delegates themselves voted an address to the government , in which they made very nearly the same demands , and , moreover , requested that a German Parliament might be convocated , as the only means of securing to Germany that independence without which she would be unable to hold her position and to assert her rights in the difficult crisis in which Europe had been involved by the recent events in France . They , however , declined taking charge of the popular address , and resolved to send their president to the king with the address which they had themselves adopted . The king received him graciously , and replied , that it gave him the greatest satisfaction to find that the faithful citizens of Berlin were the first to lay before him their grievances and their desires . He added , that he was fully alive to a sense of the importance of the crisis ; that he had therefore determined to convoke the United Diet , that an edict to that effect was to be issued on the following day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future destinies of Prussia . He laid particular stress on the necessity of circumspection . Courage and prudence , he said , was the // motto of every good general . A house can not be erected in a day , and if it is to last , it must have a solid foundation . The result of this interview was the convocation of the Diet for the 20th of April . Meanwhile , serious disturbances had broken out in the city . As early as the 13th , the people had assembled in front of the palace , amidst shouts for liberty and freedom of the press , and skirmishes had taken place between the troops and the citizens . The proclamation issued on the following day , reminding the people of the existing laws against riots , and enjoining on all manufacturers and shopkeepers to prevent their workmen from mingling in these tumultuous assemblies , and on all keepers of hotels or other public places to prohibit - under the penalty of forfeiting their license to keep such places - all political discussion within their establishments , failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14th , an immense multitude assembled on the great square . Their attitude was calm , and possibly no disturbances would have ensued , had not a body of cavalry thrown itself into the midst of the crowd . A large number of persons were wounded in this affair . The following day , a petition was sent from the citizens to the city delegates , demanding that the troops should be ordered not to take any further part in the disturbances , and that the guard of the city should be confided to the citizens themselves . This petition was forwarded to the government , who declared that a committee should be named to take cognizance of the events of the preceding day , and to provide such measures as should be deemed necessary for the preservation of order . This assurance seemed for a short time to calm the agitation which pervaded the city ; but when the news of the Revolution at Vienna reached Berlin , the effect of the startling intelligence on the excited multitude may readily be imagined . Crowds were again assembled in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more called out , and a bloody conflict was the result . Barricades were formed with astonishing rapidity , and the struggle continued until a late hour in the night , when the mob were finally completely driven back from their barricades . This defeat did not allay the excitement , for on the following day the streets were again thronged with people . They seemed even to have gained courage by their first attempt at // revolution , unsuccessful though it had been ; for many appeared with the German tricolored ribbon ( red , black , and gold ) in their button-boles or on their hats , and smoking , - a privilege which had not been enjoyed for many a year in the streets of Berlin . The space in front of the palace of the Prince of Prussia , the king 's brother , and well known for his absolutist principles , seemed to be the rendezvous of the crowd ; and it was feared that they entertained some sinister design on the palace . The day passed , however , without any serious disturbances . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be long remembered in the annals of Prussian history , a large number of citizens resolved to present a petition to the king , assuring him of their loyal attachment , and demanding the dismissal of the troops from the city , the immediate organization of an armed burgher-guard , liberty of the press , and the speedy convocation of the Diet . But before they had time to present this petition to the king , a royal edict was promulgated , granting liberty of the press , and convoking the Diet for the 2d of April . The citizens , full of joy at what they deemed the happy termination of the disturbances , crowded before the palace to express their gratitude to the king . Twice the king appeared on the balcony , and was hailed by the enthusiastic shouts of the multitude . After he had retired , one of the ministers came forward , and requested the mob to return quietly to their homes . This demand was received with murmurs by the crowd , and in their turn they demanded that the soldiers , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As this desire was not complied with , they pressed forward , menacing the soldiers and brandishing their sticks . At this moment a couple of shots were fired , and a scene of the utmost confusion and tumult ensued . The people , amidst cries of Treason ! Treason ! ran in every direction , to raise barricades against the troops , who were advancing on all sides . The conflict was long and bloody . For thirteen hours , the people fought against an armed force of not less than twenty thousand men . At last , towards morning , the combat ceased , and the king , finding all resistance useless , issued a proclamation to his beloved Berliners , which , after endeavouring to explain the sad events of the preceding day by attributing them to a set of lawless individuals in the crowd , who had taken advantage // of the accidental shots fired by the troops to raise the standard of revolt , ends with the following words - " Return to peace and tranquillity , break down the barricades which still remain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with words such as are becoming in presence of your king , and I promise you that the troops shall immediately evacuate the streets and the public places . Hear the paternal voice of your king , inhabitants of my beautiful and faithful city of Berlin . Forget what has passed , as I desire to forget it myself , in the interest of the great destinies which , with the blessing of God , await Germany and Prussia . Your gracious queen , stretched on a bed of sickness , your true and faithful mother and friend , joins her tearful prayers to mine. ** Had this proclamation been issued on the preceding day , much bloodshed might have been prevented . As it was , the people had suffered too much to be willing to make the first concessions ; the struggle was renewed . Finally , at about twelve o'clock on the 19th , the king at last determined to issue the order for the troops to return to their barracks . Tranquillity was thus restored to the capital . The people were triumphant , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palace , where the king was obliged to come forward himself , and contemplate the victims of his blind obstinacy . The guard of the city was confided to the citizens themselves , a political amnesty was granted , the unpopular ministry were dismissed , - in a word , all the wishes of the people were granted . Of the real cause of the sad events of the 18th there seems as yet to be no satisfactory account . Some say that a shot was fired by accident , and caused the alarm amongst the crowd ; others , that the troops fired only after they were attacked by the mob . The friends of the king maintain , on the other hand , that the government had been informed of the designs of the Republican party to overthrow the existing order of things in Prussia , and to follow the then seduc .. tive example of France , and that , when the crowd rushed forward towards the palace , it was tho*ight that the intended attempt had commenced , and that the troops alone could save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had attained their object , and despotism was crushed in Prussia . Few excesses were committed during this eventful struggle . The attempt to tear down the palace of the Prince of Prussia - // who was supposed to have given the troops the order to fire on the people - was fortunately checked by a workman , who rushed forward and wrote on the walls the magic words , " National Property . " A few days after these memorable events , the king issued a proclamation ( May 22d ) to his people and to the German nation at large , in which he declared , that , in the difficult crisis in which Germany was then placed , her only safety was in her union under one chief . " I will , " says the proclamation , " undertake this direction in the day of danger. * I have now adopted the ancient colors of Germany , and placed myself and my people under the banner of the German empire . Prussia shall henceforth be merged in Germany . " * This declaration , hailed with enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts of Germany . It was thought that the king intended to usurp the imperial crown . Many persons , even in Berlin , seemed to have viewed the matter in the same light ; for when , on the morning of the 23d , the king rode in solemn procession through the streets of the capital , he was received with shouts of " Long live the German emperor . " " No , " replied the king with vivacity ; " I bear colors which are not mine ; I do not wish to usurp any thing ; I wish for no crown , no dominion . I wish for the freedom and unity of Germany ; I wish for order . I have done only what has more than once been done in German history , in a moment of great danger to the country ; I have placed myself at the head of the whole nation ; and I am confident that the princes of Germany will sympathize with me and her people support me . " Among the many strange events which have occurred in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more strange than this singular declaration of Frederic William . We do not agree with those who think that a man must necessarily profess the same opinions throughout life ; on the contrary , we think it but natural that circumstances , and , above all , experience , should modify - nay , even entirely change - the political opinions of a man . We admire the " Justum ac tenacem propositi virum , " who retains through a long and active public life the same opinions ; but we can understand that this should not always // be the case ; and , indeed , we see no good reason why he who was a radical at twenty should not be a conservative at forty . But we confess that we can not but distrust the very sudden conversion of the king of Prussia , who , in a few days , passes from one extremity to the other of the scale of political opinions . Yesterday he was blindly attached to all the forms of the past , and to-day he is the enthusiastic admirer of free institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kings , and of royal power to be limited only by the free grants of the sovereign himself , - and to-day he not only wishes all nations'to be free , but is desirous of placing himself at the head of the liberal movement in Germany . This savors more of policy and ambition than of deep conviction . His conduct was thus viewed in some parts of Germany , particularly in the South and West , where were again manifested those feelings of jealousy and rivalry which have ever proved so fatal to the establishment of political unity throughout Germany . In the Wiener Zeitung appeared , shortly afterwards , a reply to the king 's declaration , in the name of the German nation , in which it was stated , in the boldest language , that they could not accept the position which the king offered to take . " Your Majesty , " says this striking document , " is the only German prince who granted the inalienable rights of his people only in the midst of barricades , and on the dead bodies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to totter . The German people have learnt to appreciate you , and have not confidence in you . It is with bloodstained hands , Sire , that you raise the German colors which for so many years you persecuted . rhe people recoil at your royal enthusiasm It was an Austrian prince who drank a health to united Germany , when the idea was scorned in Prussia . The House of Jlapsburg would have the history of past ages and the love of its subjects on its side , did it wish to assert its ancient rights . But Austria recognizes that by the representatives of the people alone can the choice of an emperor be made , and that this choice must be left free . " On the 2d of April , the second session of the United Diet was opened at Berlin . Not quite a year had elapsed since Frederic William , with all the pomp and splendor of absolute power , had harangued the first diet of the kingdom . How eventful that year had been ! The Diet was this time // opened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , in a very brief address , stated that the iDiet had been assembled to lay the foundations of the Prussian constitution by adopting an electoral law . A loyal address was immediately voted , and after a session of only eight days the Diet separated . In this short period , the electoral law was voted , and a grant of 40,000,000 thalers - to be levied in such manner as should be deemed expedient - was made to the government . The elections shortly after took place , and on the appointed day the first Prussian national assembly met . Here we must pause in the sketch which we have endeavoured to give of the history of Prussia within the present century . It has been our desire to show what faults on the part of the government caused those sad events which have convulsed a country that was wont to be so tranquil . We trust that we have succeeded in showing how fully the Prussians were justified in taking up arms , in order to wrest from the government those liberal institutions which the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject for within the last six months , the history of Prussia has been entirely absorbed in that of Germany , and our limits will not permit of our entering on so vast a theme as that of ' the German revolutionary movement . Had we even the space , we should hardly venture to attempt it . We should be deterred by the many difficulties which the subject presents , for we know not where to seek a guide to lead us through the dark labyrinth of German affairs . And , indeed , what a spectacle Germany now presents ! Elements of discord on every side , - a regulating power nowhere ; nation opposed to nation , and house to house , without any visible bond which can reunite them ; the fear of reaction on the one hand , and the far greater danger of anarchy on the other ; innumerable theories and plans for the regeneration of the common country , and not a man to put them into execution ; the middle classes opposed to the aristocracy , and to what remains of the feudal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all those who hold a higher place than themselves in the social scale ; the literary men and the students of the universities burning to realize their long cherished hopes of establishing a republic ; Communism , Socialism , Fourierism pouring their poisoned doctrines into the ear of the ignorant or the unwary ; - such is the picture which Germany presents ! // What is to be the result of this state of things ? Where is the arm that shall arrest this confusion , and bring forth order from such a chaos ? Where is the man possessed of virtue , wisdom , and genius sufficient to unite these discordant elements , and to create , as it were , a new society , - a new Germany ? We look in vain for such a one . Although the apparent reluctance with which he made liberal concessions to his people has greatly diminished his chance , the king of Prussia may , if he act with prudence , be called to the imperial throne . The dearth of great men in Germany , and the distracted condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that high and difficult station . But should he ever attain this goal of his ambition , we very much doubt whether he could succeed in establishing a permanent government . We believe that Germany has yet many storms to go through , many scenes of bloodshed and crime to witness , before she can reach that peace , tranquillity , and unity which she is now seeking . The accumulated errors of ages are not swept away in a day , although it be a common mistake of our time to suppose so . We are too prone to think that society can be remodelled , and states reorganized , with the same promptitude with which we erect a manufactory or lay out a railroad , and to believe that the mere formation of a government is sufficient to satisfy the wants of a people . But it is not so . We have confidence in the ultimate good which is to result from the present disturbed condition of the Old World . We can not believe that Europe is again to be plunged in the horrors of barbarism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost inclined to believe it . The ultimate result will be - it must be , if we believe that the events of history are under the control of Providence - to favor the progress of civilization . Let us not , however , be impatient for the result . We may not live to see it . Christianity , divine as it is in its origin , and aided by prophecies and miracles , has existed eighteen centuries in the world , and yet one half of mankind are not yet subjected to its beneficent sway . Why should we , then , hope greater success for institutions purely human ? As for Germany , she will , we trust , feel that revolutions only give an impetus to the onward progress of mankind , and that on time alone depends their real and permanent improvement . She will not , let us hope , be dazzled by the seductive // illusion of establishing at once a republic . Let her rather slowly prepare for that form of government which is the ultimate object of all the European revolutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our opinion , only to retard its permanent establishment ; for we firmly believe that there is but one country in Europe - and for that very reason , she is less disposed than any other to adopt the name of that which she already possesses to a considerable extent - where republican institutions would not in a very short time degenerate into despotism.
