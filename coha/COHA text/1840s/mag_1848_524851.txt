txt THE Whig Party hold at present a better position than they have ever held ; and for the following reasons They occupy , as a party , a ground perfectly defensible by the usual arguments of morality , such as are common to all nations and ages : They argue , also , from the Constitution itself , and from the Declaration of Equality arA Liberty : They are in the van of progress , while the opposite party are falling back upon the barbarous and exploded notions of antiquity : They defend our own rights and liberties , in defending those of a neighbor : They endeavor to legislate for the future as well as for the present , and foresee dangers which threaten the existence of our free institutions : They have predicted successfully the consequences of the policy pursued by the opposite party ; their predictions being also fairly recorded . The first of these enumerated advantages of the Whig Party , in its present position , need not be dwelt upon in this article . They have opposed the whole policy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present time . The Whigs opposed the annexation of Texas because of the difficulties it was to bring with it . When those difficulties were realized , they opposed the policy which aggravated them ; and always upon moral and constitutional grounds . First , on the common instinct and prejudice against inhumanities and wrongs of every description ; and second , because it is their settled conviction that free institutions can not be maintained by any but a just and equitable policy . They believe , with certain politicians , that " success is the test of merit , " and that this nation will have success in proportion to its deserts . The success of our armies in Mexico has proved that our " merit " in military and other matters is greatly superior to that of the Mexicans ; but justice , and not military prowess only , is the safeguard of the nation . Posterity , reading on the one page the history of our wars , will exclaim , " Providence is always on the side of courage and discipline ; it favors the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decline of liberty and the increase of private and public corruption , it will add , " Providence is also on the side of order and equity ; it favors the strong constitution , and deserts the uncertain and the corrupt . " The Americans VOL . I. NO . III . // are a warlike people , and know how to join action with obedience . Where the aim and purpose of a discipline is clear to every man , they organize themselves and pursue the common purpose with the greatest energy : be their aim political or military , organization is their forte , and success follows them . But , on the other hand , separate the American from his laws , his religion , and his Constitution , and who more harsh and inexorable ; his native energy , converted into a destroying power , directed against humanity , makes him the most . irresistible of pirates and the most unscrupulous of oppressors . He is the only man that dares , in defiance of all the world , proclaim doctrines peculiarly harsh and aggressive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil for his good , and instinct for his god . Constitutions of the most severe and conservative character are therefore necessary to the American , not only in military but in civil and religious matters ; his freedom is conditional , and requires heavy barriers and severe laws ; as the force of the impetuous tide that moves in his veins , so must be the laws that restrain it : conscious of this , he is a lover of law , an organizer , and takes a pride in obeying laws of his own enactment . Fearful of notbing but the excess of his own passions , he is a respecter of sincere opinion , and the consent of great minds ; he listens to antiquity , and venerates the voice of age and of wisdom . His favorite characters are those Statesmen , who have risen by the force of a real , God-given energy , to be the repositories , or the sources , of true opinion . He never inquires about their birth , or their office , but only of their ability and native grandeur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only respects them for what they can do and say : and they , on their part , when they speak , address , not the passions nor the ignorance , but the courage , the knowledge , and reason of their hearers . When they rise to speak , they consider in their minds that they are addressing free citizens , who know and can judge their sentiments , however heroic , and never appeal to the meanness , the conceit or the avarice of a rabble which they despise . Nor , in*another particular , are we , the American people , inferior to any nation that has ever existed , in referring the principles of our laws and social rights for their validity back to the common conscience and common reason of humanity , to that law which the Creator has planted in the hearts of all men . It is in this original law that we have based our free institutions . We refer back for the grounds of the Constitution  --  or rather for those rights about which it is erected as a convenient barrier  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to name it , the sovereignty of the People . We , the whole people , minority and majority , sustain the government . It protects us all , legislates for us all , and represents us all . Our only differences are on questions of opinion , as to what men shall be chosen , and what measures be pursued-who can best represent the whole , and what are the best modes of benefitting the whole . Hence , under the Constitution , and expected by it , parties arise , sustaining opposite men and measures ,  --  each party esteeming its own measures the best for the good of both : the choice is thrown , by our fundamental laws , upon the vote of a majority . Such at least is the ideal system of our government ; but the organization of this system , from various causes , some inherent in our common nature , and some accidental and temporary , is imperfect . At this very moment , a party in power have formed within themselves another party , which is rapidly corrupting the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being opposed , not to certain measures of their opposites , but to the spirit of the fundamental laws , their men and measures are alike inimical to the fundamental law , given by the Declaration of Rights and the Constitution of the Union , under which all parties are supposed to exist . The intentions and principles of this party within a party-of this rotten core - are sufficiently well known , and have been sufficiently explained by the journals of the Whig Party . That party , as we have already said , occupies a superior position , as the defender not only of the Constitution , but of the principles of popular liberty , and of all law and organization whatsoever . If ever the consent of great minds should be permitted to sway us in a question of // a purely moral nature , such as that of the right or wrong of the measures proposed by the Administration , then was there never any period when it should have more force than at the present moment . The opinions and arguments of Clay , Gallatin , Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first mark ,  --  - always valuable , is now of the utmost importance to the cause of right and of good policy ; for this nation is now about resolvin0 whether to adhere to the original grounds of the Constitution , or whether to commence a new epoch in its history , by subverting those grounds and reducing it to a mere temporary and politic formula , to be changed , wrested and distorted at pleasure , to serve the avarice or the ambition of a dominant party . The people of the Union are about to resolve whether they will admit into their fundamental law the fatal precedent of conquest , by which all the nations of antiquity were corrupted , ruined , and extinguished ; a doctrine which includes and sanctions every form and degree of despotism , and which is of so evil a nature , it not only renders the peace of the world generally insecure , but insinuates itself into every part of life , produces a corrupt and tumultuous society , and is in turn produced by a dishonest and vicious life in the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion of this nation is so far fallen as no longer to be called the voice of God ; for we know well that then only is the voice of the people the voice of God , when it declares and enforces the laws of God ; not as the executioner declares them , or as the villain who destroys another villain , or as the vicious who are strong become instruments of vengeance on the vicious who are weak ; but as declaring their adherence to those broad and universal principles of humanity and equity , which , if anything human is divine , are the divinest of human things . At separate times and with unlike arguments . our most eminent citizens have argued against the scheme of conquest suppQrted by the party in power . The arguments of Mr. Calhoun are directed against the policy of the design . He predicts from its adoption the ruin of our present institutions . He advocates the withdrawal of our troops and the occupation of a defensive line upon a boundary to be deterinined by ourselves . He protests against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and barbarous Mexicans . He affirms that they are incapable of liberty , and can not be organized like educated and disciplined white men . He contends farther against extending the power of the Executive , and predicts that the Union will not endure if the system of conquest is carried out . Mr. Calhoun does not indeed attempt to show , that a nation which violates first principles can not endure , or be endured , 01 , that it follows of necessity that if a people disregards the rights and liberties of another people , it spurns down the sole barrier it has against internal oppression and , anarchy ; but looking at the question rather in a scientific and historical light , he predicts a disarrangement of the system of the Union , either by the introduction of uncongenial powers , should new States be erected in Mexico , or by the overbalance of the Executive power in the nation as it now stands , by the dditions of conquered military dependencies and the patronage and power of a great army . To understand him better , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a false enthusiasm , and the instigation of the contrivers of the war , who have turned every accident to their own advantage , to delude and excite the ignorant , and to astonish and dishearten the good , we have reached a point from which it is equally difficult to advance or to recede . Our forces occupy the forts and cities of Mexico . We have broken both the military and the civil arm of our neighbor , and annihilated the little that remained to her of a regular government . The poor and half savage inhabitants , a corrupt , feeble people , weak in intellect and weak in courage , can not organize themselves for any effectual resistance . The question now arises , what shall be done with Mexico ? and to this , in answer , three distinct plans are offered . The first is , to persevere in conquering and subduing , until the whole people are in our hands , and at our mercy ; to reduce them to the condition of vassals , and then offer them the liberty of forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second proposition is , to fix upon a new boundary , to be determined by our- // ico and to occupy that line , until such time as a peace can be established . The third is , to retire behind the old boundary , giving up northern California and all the territory offered to be ceded to us by the Mexican commissioners , maintaining only such military posts as may defend us against marauders and guerilleros . Mr. Calhoun does not allude to this third proposition . It is entertained by those only who reason against the acquisition of new territory upon abstract principles , who do not believe in the ability of the Union to maintain itself over a territory much larger than that which it holds at present . And yet it is hard to perceive any reason why an hundred States such as Ohio , or Massachusetts , should not hold together as well as thirteen , or twentyfive . The solidity of the Union depends upon the unanimity of the States which compose it ; and that unanimity is maintained by likeness of character . Likeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the whple continent occupied by the original race of the old Colonies , it could not but be one vast Union . We dare not , therefore , oppose the extension of the territory of this nation by every just means , for it is our desire to see it grow in numbers and in power to the utmost that the bqunds of nature will allow . The nation may as lawfully desire to extend its limits as the citizen his private bounds ; nor can any objection be urged against the one , not valid against the other . The nations of the world are a community of nations . They have their properties , as individuals have theirs . The boundaries of these properties may be extended by all lawful means ; and if one nation is able to occupy more than another , none need complain . What is theirs , is theirs . Nor was it ever doubted that one nation could purchase territory of another . Purchase implies property-all the conditions of " yours and mine " - just as in private bargains . If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of course , and justified in all histories . A nation is treated by all historians , but especially by the sacred chroniclers , as if it were an individual , with but one head and one heart , doing right , , or doing wrong , misled by passion , or subject to good advice and abiding by a just conduct . Israel , Egypt , Rome , Tyre , England , France-these names have an individual character , as of moral beings , capable of right and wrong . The nations are land-owners-possessors of the soil of the globe , each with its boundaries and rights ; and whichever of them dares forget its character as a moral agent , becomes the enemy of the rest . The Law of Nations is the equity used in the fraternity of nations ; it differs not from the fundamental equity of society . Its first principles are , liberty and equality ; all the nations that enter into its League are free nations , holding , as such , equal rights before the law , and entitled to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a court to be established . This law arose from the contemplation of rights between individuals , in free States . Despotical States neither originated , nor do they abide by it . Witness the division of Poland , and the ravages committed by Algerine and Turkish despots : it was impossible for these States to originate International Law , right and wrong with them being determined by the event , or rather , not inquired about . In this knowledge of right and wrong , of mine and thine , or in other words , of the conditions of liberty and equality , the basis of common and international law , the f* thers wished to form the Constitution , and not in the vague idea that the Union would last so long as the territory of the States was kept within certain limits . Even now , then , it is a consolation to know , that while a vestige of a government remains in Mexico , a peace may be concluded , such as shall not violate the laws of nations , or the principles of equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation to any violation of the fundamental law of the nation ; the grounds of the Constitution are not yet destroyed by any deliberate act of the whole people ; and if an unhappy necessity shall compel us to occupy the territory originally offcred us by Mexico , through her commissioners , we have still left the niiserable pretext of indemnity and purchase , to save the honor of our principles . Our credit is not wholly lost . We have inflicted a dreadful wound upon our weak // just temper of mind , as to refrain from trampling upon an injured and brokenspirited people , or from insulting them and the world with offers of liberty and the extension of free institutions . As we have been unjust and violent , even for that very reason we may be the more magnanimous . The most judicious have inclined , however , to think that we have no prospect of a present peace with Mexico ; that a change of rulers will be necessary to secure one . They , therefore , occupy themselves with discussing the alternatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation of a defensive line , to be assumed by us as a line of division . It is in favor of a defensive line , to be fixed by ourselves , that the distinguished Senator from South Carolina has taken his stand , in a speech not unworthy of himself , or of his reputation : as the occasion , so was the argument ; grand , weighty , momentous ; and developing the very heart and substance of that system which he has formed to himself , out of the public and private experience of his life . Versed equally in the real and the written history of nations , and observing in their rise and decline , the action of irresistible circumstances , he predicts boldly , that as States have hitherto fallen , so they must continue to fall , through a neglect of the policy to which they owed their rise . The Senator is no fatalist , no predestinarian ; his faith in cause and effect is absolute . It is evident to him , that the moral diseases of states are no less real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation which deserts its original policy rushes to as certain decay and disorganization as a man who deserts his first principles . " Mr. President , there are some propositions too clear for argument , and before such a body as the Senate , I should consider it a loss of time to undertake to prove that to incorporate Mexico would be hostile to , and in conflict with our free popular institutions , and in the end subversive of them . " Sir , he who knows the American Constitution well-he who has daily studied its charjicter-he who has looked at history , and knows what has been the effect of conquests on free states invariably , will require no proof at my hands to show that it would be entirely hostile to the institutions of the country , to hold Mexico as a province . There is not an example on record of any free state even having attempted the conquest of any territory approaching the extent of Mexico without disastrous consequences . The free nations conquered have in time co. quered the conquerors . That will be our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so vast an amount to the patronage of this , government , that it would absorb the whole power of the States of the Union . This Union would become imperial , and the States mere subordinate corporations . " But the evil will not end there . The process will go on . The same process by which the power would be transferred from the States to the Union , will transfer the whole from this department of the government ( I speak of the legislature ) to the . Executive . All the added power and added patronage which conquest will create , will pass to the Executive . In the end you put in the hands of the Executive the power of conquering you . You give to it , sir , such splendor , such means , that the principle of proscription which unfortunately prevails in our country will be greater at every presidential election than our institutions can possibly endure . The end of it will be , that that branch of the government will become all-powerful , and the result is inevitable-anarchy and despotism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing the Senate . " Sir , let it not be said that Great Britain furnishes an ex* mple to the contrary . * * * * Let it be remembered that of all governments that ever existed affording any protection whatever to liberty , the English government far transcends them all in that respect . She can bear more patronage in proportion*to her population and wealth than any government of that form that ever existed ; nay , to go farther , than can despotism in its lowest form . I will not go into the philosophy of this . That would take me farther from the track than I desire . " But I will say in a very few words , it results from the fact that her Executive and her conservative branch of the legislature are both hereditary . The Roman government may have exceeded and did exceed the British government in its power for conquest ; but no people ever did exist , and probably never will exist , with such a capacity for conquest as that people . But the capacity of Rome to ho*ld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain , and hence , as soon as the Roman power passed from Italy beyond the Adriatic on one side , and the Alps on the other , and the Mediterranean , their liberty fell prostrate-the Roman people became a rabble-corruption penetrated everywhere , and violence and anarchy ruled the day . Now , we see England with dependent provinces not less numerous , scarcely not less populous , I believe , though I have not examined the record we see her going on // ment . " Yet the English have not wholly escaped . Although they have retained their liberty and have not fallen into anarchy and despotism , yet we behold the population of England crushed to the earth by the superincumbent weight of debt . Reflecting on that government , I have often thought that there was only one way in which it could come to an end-that the weight of the pediment would crush it . Look at the neighboring island of Ireland , and instead of finding in her identity , we find that England has to support her out of her laboring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up a peace establishment almost beyond her means . Shall we , with these certain and inevitable* consequences in a government better calculated to resist them than any other , adopt such a ruinous policy , and reject the lessons of experience ? So much then , Mr. I'i*e*.id*nt , for holding Mexico as a province . " There are some propositions , " says the distinguished Senator , " too clear for argument , and before such a body as the Senate , I should consider it a loss of time to undertake to prove , that to incorporate Mexico would be hostile to , and in conflict with , our free popular institutions : " but he is here addressing the Senate of the United States , which is the representative body of all the States ; can any man doubt the sincerity of the remark ? Does not the veteran statesman know the sentiments of that august body ? Let us then entertain no fears that Mexico will be seized upon and annexed , for we have his word for it , that the Senate know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and genius of this nation . The Senator speaks for the nation , in its past , its present and its future ; he declares the law that governs the destiny of Republics , but the grandeur of his argument is somewhat diminished by a necessary distiaction between the polity of the nation and the polity of individual States . " The next reason which my resolutions assign , is , that it is without example or precedent , either to hold Mexico as a province , or to incorporate her into our Union . No example of such a line of policy can be found . We have conquered many of the neighboring tribes of Indians , but we never thought of holding them in subjection-never of incorporating them into our Union . I know farther , sir , that we have never dreamt of incorporating into our Union any but the Caucasian race-the free white - race . To incorporate Mexico , would be the very first instance of incorporating an Indian race , for more than half of the Mexicans are Indians , and the other is composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a union as that ! Ours , sir , is the government of the white man . The greatest misfortunes of Spanish America are to be traced to the fatal error of placing these colored races on an equality with the white race . That error destroyed the social arrangement which formed the basis of society . The Portuguese and ourselves have escapedthe Portuguese at least to some extent  --  and we are the only people en this continent which have made revolutions without anarchy . And yet it is professed and talked about to erect those Mexicans into a territorial government , and place them on an equality with the people of the United States . I protest utterly against such a project . " Sir , it is a remarkable fact , that in the whole history of man , as far as my knowledge extends , there is no instance whatever of any civilized colored races being found equal to the establishment of popular rights , although by far the largest portion of the human ' family is ' composed of these races . And even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except it he our noble savages-for noble I will call them . They for the most part had free institutions , but they are easily sustained amongst a savage people . Are we to overlook this fact ? Are we to associate with onrselv*s as equals , companions , and fellow-citizens , the Indians and half-breeds of Mexico ? Sir , I should consider such a thing as fatal to our institutions . " It is the settled policy of a majority of this nation to recognize no political differences among men , excepting those ' which necessarily arise from age , sex , and mental sanity ,  --  and it is an equally established policy of a minority , to regard no race as capable of liberty but the Caucasian or white race . Because liberty did not originate with the nation as a whole , but was first recognized and established in the individual States , they were regarded-and must be regarded-as the defenders and sources of private liberty ; nor was the Constitution itself formed by slaves ,  --  its authors were the freemen of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet , the number of persons of other races to whom liberty has been granted by the States has been too small for a satisfactory proof that they are capable of liberty . It is not yet proved that Republican institutions can exist even // in all white nations of the Caucasian tribe ; Amid these reflections suggested by the qwq We , a nation derived from the Saxon , a ruin. ** Norman and Celtic races , claim to be capa- qwq to raise them on . lawless chance , and then declare the law of their continuance ? to give them first to fortune and then to the gods ? Absurd conclusion of the Senator ! This nation have fortune in their hands , and can whirl her idle wheel backward or forward at their pleasure . They have but to agree that honor and honesty shall rule , and they rule-that the Constitution shall remain , and it remains . On that side they have a divine , an omnipotent authority ; on the other they are powerless . On the one side , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason ; here favor , there honor ; here lying , there truth ; here robbery , peculation , conquest , fear , and the sinking of all in mere despond ; there law observed , credit , equity , hope , and the fruit of all the past . And yet-it was only by a figure of rhetoric that the orator appealed to Fortune , to inspire us with a salutary terror ; and when he afterward points out the true cause of our danger , and shows that it is rather through forgetfulness that we are falling ; it is evident that he is truly no worshipper of Fortune , but a firm believer in the laws of Reason and of Nature . " Sir , there is no solicitude now for liberty . Who talks of liberty when any great question comes up ? Here is a question of the first magnitude as to the conduct of this war ; do you hear anybody talk about its effect yipon our liberties and our free institutions ? No , sir . That was not the case formerly . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how to preserve liberty . The great anxiety now , is for the attainment of mere military glory . In the one we are forgetting the other . The maxim of former times was , that power is always stealing from the many to the few ; the price of liberty was perpetual vigilance . They were constantly looking out and watching for ilanger . Not so now . Is it because there has been any decay of liberty among the people ? Not at all . I believe the love of liberty was never more ardent , but they have forgotten the tenure of liberty by which alone it is preserved . " We think we may now indulge in everything with impunity , as if we held our charter of liberty by " right divine "  - -  from heaven itself . Under these impressions we plunge into war , we contract heavy debts , we increase the patronage of the Executive , and we talk of a crusade to force our institutions , of liberty , upon all people . There is no species of extravagance which our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the houris approaching-ilie*d*Y of retribution will come . It will come as certainly as I am now addressing the Senate , and when it does come , awful will be the reckoning ; heavy the responsibility somewhere . " This warning comes from no noisy declaimer , or heated enthusiast . It is the voice of years and of experience . It is not a trope , or stroke of rhetoric ; it is the plain announcement of a fact . We have secured our liberty , and believe that it will remain secure , while we are occupied in destroying that of other nations . We think that by augmenting our power we shall only perfect our freedom ; forgetful that not power , merely , but lawful forms of power , are the support of freedom . Our power may indeed fret and spend itself in vast enterprises ; but we are losing the grand privilege of freemen , to control the councils of the nation : we may retain our domestic freedom , but we are powerless in the affairs of our country . Party Organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , and skillfully employed by the other , has wrested the sceptre from our gripe ; we have allowed ourselves to believe in Public Opinion , until , too late , it is discovered that Party Organizations are manufactories of public opinion . We have neglected to manufacture a quantum of true and liberal opinion on the side of Justice and the Constitution , and the consequences are just beginning to be felt by ourselves and by the world . As it was not by fortune nor the concurrence of fortunate accidents , that we arrived at our present condition , but by strenuous and virtuous endeavor for our country and kind , so it will not be by evil fortune that we fall , if fall we must , but by the neglect of those means by which we rose . And what were those means ? The purifying first of our own , and next of other minds ; the banishment of all but the most elevated passions , the trial of all public questions by the rule of private morn.lity ; the fearless and spirited declaration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm , by all who can speak or write with force or with discretion ; the constant inculcation of the faith in principles ,  --  that principles are strictly the expression of divine laws " which execute themselves , " and must be proclaimed and obeyed by all men and nations who are ambitious of power , or of // permanent and universal wealth :  - -  - these means , well used , can not fail to effect their ends . " But it is also necessary to have faith in the people . " What is meant by faith in the people ? A question worth answering . Put the case that the same multitude were addressed by two orators , and on the same question and occasion that the first of these orators considered in his mind that the people he addressed were to be controlled by several passions , fear , vanity , admiration , interest , envy , the lust of power , and the enthusiasm of a novel enterprise ; that accordingly , having this opinion of the men he addressed , an opinion drawn necessarily from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skillful fiattery ,  --  throws in arguments to the purse , to national vanity , to the admiration of great names , to popular enmities and prejudices , the love of domination and the love of change ,  --  and rousing in his hearers ' hearts a tumultuous , uneasy enthusiasm , which then he and his colleagues direct to their ends : - this orator may be fairly said to have no faith in the people ; he rather believes that they are creatures of passion , and subject to none but base and selfish impulses . But now the second orator rises , a Chatham , a Webster , a Pendes , a Clay ; his generous spirit expands itself through the vast auditory , and he believes that he is addressing a company of high-spirited men , citizens . They see the grandeur in his eye , and before a word has escaped his lips , they are struck with an irresistible sympathy with the man . Then , he speaks . When he says " fellow-citizens , " they believe him , and at once , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the time being ; the universal voice is speaking , and every man 's soul is attuned by it ; a common purpose seizes them , a common energy ,  --   --  and by a wonderful effect , their thoughts and feelings rise to an heroical height , beyond that of common men or common times . This second orator " had faith in the people ; " he addressed the better part of each man 's nature , supposing it to be in him ;  --  and it was in him . The great problem of our politics is , to bring the minds of the majority up to a pitch of knowledge and confidence that will enable them to use their private judgment upon public questions and public men . To accomplish this end , every spirited citizen will strain every thought . If he has accumulated wealth ; he will apply his acquired knowledge of economy and finance to the consideration of the public finance . If he is a lawyer , his knowledge of the nice differences of rights will serve him to detect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a clergyman , he has the law of God , " which fulfills itself , " written in his mind in a clear and legible scripture , easily applied to all events and all actions as a rule . If he is a farmer , or an independent mechanic , he knows* that individual liberty begins with him-that representative government is sustained by him-in its original purity and force , and that in his place he is the main pillar of the state , on whom depends finally the Union and the public security ; but being no linguist nor much read in the law , he will be compelled to shape his estimate of pul2dic men and measures by those  | in rules from which all laws spring , and which come to him direct from heaven . But especially , at this crisis , when the polity of the nation is being settled for a course of centuries , by the establishment of new forms of opinion and new modes of government , it becomes the men of leisure and of letters to throw themselves into the strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wielding an unscrupulous sword , but rather firm and sure , organized , with the modern obedience and the modern discipline . If , instead of degrading themselves by idle and aimless production , the frivolous trifling of boys , they would remember that they are citizens of a Republic more magnificent than Athens , and that soon must be the irresistible power of the world-that in this Republic there is no aristocracy but that which rests in native uprightness and sincerity , no fame but that of usefulness , no respectability but in the public service ; they would cease from their trifling , and unite their exertions and labors to overthrow the ambitious man who usurps , the impostor who misleads , and the coward who sells himself . If , despising toil and resigning the poor privilege of a littk fretful originality , a thing smiled upon and pitied by the truly great , they would join as true fellow-soldiers against lying ; 225 // in less than an abe , the Union would be settled upon eternal foundations , and the men of this age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men do not respect that which is a growth of accident or fortune , and could they bring themselves to regard the institutions of their fathers as the fruit merely of happy concurrences , they would despise their very liberty , and wish to defy fortune , and let her do her will . Regarding the Union as transitory and fortuitous , we are less grieved with the thought of corruption in the general state : we become accustomed to contemplate its decay , and are less indignant when it is proposed to reduce it to an association for gain . That despair , too , which sometimes affects good men of a feeble temper , may well spring out of this opinion , that we lie at the mercy of chance . To know the obstacle is half to conquer it ; to know the danger is almost to escape it , wi% a spirit of that temper of which freemen are made . Let it , therefore , be fairly seen and defined : different men will see it differently and with different degrees of apprehension ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives his sole attention to that shape of the public danger which affects him most , and which threatens the most immediate peril . The Senator has distinctly indicated the present danger of the Republic- " the increasing power of the Executive , " its assumption of an authority and an influence beyond the spirit , if not beyond thb letter of the Constitution , its aggression upon the liberties of the States and of the nation . It is discovered at last , that in our own , as in the English Constitution , the only effectual control over an Executive backed* by a powerful minority , is by the refusal of supplies , or by the affixing of conditions to appropriations . It is necessary to thelife of all great powers , that they should tend to burst their bonds , and seem continually to threaten tyranny : the power of wrong must be coincident in them with the power of right ; and few men there are-there is no man , of a spirit fit to be the chief servant of ' the nation , who will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love Liberty , or that he means to be tyrannical , but because it is in human nature to err . It is , therefore , always necessary for a free people to watch their rulers , and check the career of their ambition . We , the private citizens , must make the man in place respect and fear our free vote , and our free opinion . On perpetual vigilance , and not on a curiously adjusted system of checks and balances , must we rely for the vindication of our rights . But first , before attempting to check or limit any power , it is necessary to know , to feel , its exact weight and importance . It is idle to argue against it , or pretend not to see it  --  to smile at , or disrespect it ; we must estimate it , measure it , take its full dimension , compare it with others and with itself , and finally , consider its growth , permanency , and tenacity of life .

We concede to it , in the economy of the whole , a power original and forever established ; it is the most efficient and unobstructed Executive Power in the world , and able , by keeping a vast number of persons in the hope , or in the fearful and conditional enjoyment , of office , to exercise a direct personal power over one half the people . * When supported by a strong minority in Congress , it can initiate any law it pleases , and suppress any which it thinks may be injurious to itself . It is not afraid of impeachment , for it will always control a strong minority in the Senate and the House . It is not disposed to encroach openly upon the Constitution , but has always advocates and excuses to defend itself a , ainst the direct charge . It is instinctively ingenious with the people , and takes care never to seem to injure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch , the liberty of the individual , or of the State , of which the northern and southern Democracy are so exclusively jealous ; but it reaches over the heads of both , and eludes both .. Its immense power rests unmoved upon the tumultuous sea of opposing interests and passions ; the small waves ( if we may so speak ) of local tumults can not overturn it . The broader the base the more securely it stands ; and should its power ever be extended over // both continents , and over the islands , it would almost inevitably perpetuate itself and rise to an imperial height . The first symptom of the rise of an imperial power is in the ambition of conquest . The ambition of the people is roused , a secret influence everywhere urges them . It emanates from the Central Power , and the body of intriguers which sustain and use it . The head wishes to feel itself the head , and out of an ambitious wantonness , puts the body in motion . The evil passions of the multitude respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of the government is precipitated upon enterprises of war . This it does without impairing the liberties of the States , or of the citizens ; but these powers forget , that as the head is exalted the body is diminished and debased . Government is in its very nature aggressive and usurping ; tending toward unlimited power and unlimited territory . The checks which hem it in and restrain it , require to be kept up with a lively jealousy . Weaken or impoverish your aristocracy , and your king becomes a despot ; yield the powers of the House and of the Senate in the least particulars , and your President has moved so far toward supreme authority . The limitation of the Presidential term to four years is no security against the steady increase of the power , in the h*nds of a succession of intriguers , usurpers , and well-managed weaklings . The party now effectually in power have maintained a succession of Presidents , who have each added a little to the power of the office .

The conflict in future is not to be that old traditional one of State Rights . What do those vast crowds of foreigners , and migratory persons that people the new , lands of the West , know or care about the old jealousies of State Rights ? They are under the protection of the Central Government , and their first desire and respect is toward the nation ; the State with them is secondary ; their sons may understand it , but they never will . Every foreigner who sets foot upon this continent , increases the importance of the Central Government , and diminishes the jeiiilousies of the States . We repeat , that it is our firm belief , that the danger with us lies not in the fear of a revolt of individual States-our Union having at length become , or fast becoming , a nation  --  but in a want of perception and foresight , to guard against the e*cessive influence of the Executive itself . Under such convictions , what are we to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and doctrines will defend U8 against evils approaching from that quar-ter ? 227 // funds , while they are creating a bank of can draw after it every individual citizen the worst character , founded on the issue as by a line of fate .

It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country in a war with Great Britain as with Mexico ; the means of exciting such a war are fully within the power of the Executive . " None but a people advanced to a very high state of intellectual improvement are capable , in a civilized sttite , " says Mr. Calhoun , " of maintaining a free government ; and amongst those who have had the good fortune , very few indeed have had the good fortune of forming a Constitution capable of endurance . It is a remarkable fact in the history of man , that scarcely ever have free popular institutions been formed that have endured . " They have lapsed first into a democratic anarchy , and then into despotism . Their destroyers begin with engaging the people in unjust wars , by which that tender and virtuous regard for liberty is sapped and destroyed : having become tyrants , they are now rehdy to become slaves , and need only a master . The despot is always ready , under the cloak of the demagogue . He is the man who confines himself theoretically within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in destroying its ground-work in the hearts of the peopleuntil he has succeeded in intoxicating them with the consciousness of freedom , and in leading them on to the commission of national crimes , under the names of patriotism , glory , and enterprise . He is no conscious destroyer , but only a godless skeptic , smooth and fluent in speech , active in talent , and simply cold-blooded and dishonest when he dares be so . His tools are , perhaps , men superior to himself in dignity of character , and in obstinacy of purpose , whose narrow understandings he knows well how to darken with sophistries and flatteries . In his own opinion the demagogue is not a bad man ; he means only to use the natural and customary means toward influence and wealth . The Union to him is a kind of firm , a combination of great powers for the purposes of defence , enrichment and aggrandizement ; in enriching and aggrandizing himself at the expense of this corporation he seems to commit no sin . The Supernal Powers have denied him the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to guide-he has not the power of guiding the nation , in the path of justice had honor ; he is unconscious of these principles-he regards them as fragile moral formularies , for the better management of fools and children . A formalist in his religion , it is very like he delights in long prayers ; a formalist in behavior , it is very like he is a man of smooth and polished address . Or if his game be of a ruder sort , he is ready for the fierce extremes-roughness , cruelty , and profanity of conduct . Yet , under all disguises , the demagogue is one and the same ; a liar in his heart , a deceiver of the people , an adroit manager of men in place , a giver of gifts , a maker of promises , a busy , smooth , eloquent , cautious , well-trained , place-seeking , wealthloving , power-grasping , upe of virtue . By one mark we are to know him-namely That he earnestly profess ! es one thing , and assiduously practices another . He professes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with expenses . He professes free trade , and advocates an indiscriminate Tariff . He professes to be jealous of liberty , and goes on to swell the power of the Executive . He professes a great tenderness of national honor , and plunges the nation into wars of mere robbery . In a word , he is consistent in his conduct with none of the principles he professes ; and he professes those which he thinks will sound best in most ears . Under favor , therefore , it seems that Mr. Calhoun has not indicated the true causes of the decline of liberal institutions when he s* ys that they are established , and must fall , by good or evil fortune . It would seem rather that not fortune but influence , is the cause of the rise and decline of free institutions . Given a people wise enough to know a demagogue from a statesman , there were no danger to be apprehended , that their institutions would ever fall into anarchy . The causes of the rise of free institutions are to be sought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . The Athenians , a tribe of forty thousand luxurious democrats , governing half a million of slaves , gradually wrested power from the hands of the few , and as gradually lost it when their 229 // manners became corrupt . The Romans , a clan of ambitious gentlemen , ruling with difficulty a rude but valiant populace , regarded their state as an engine of conquest , and themselves the predestined governors of the world . They gradually dwindled , and were dissolved and lost in the multitude of their subjects , and the power they bad organized passed into the hands of men of other nations , trained in the Roman discipline . The Greek and Roman republics cherished in their laws none of those sacred principles which can alone give duration to republics . They never dreamed of educating the people-of securing every man his perfect liberty-of the freedom of political opinion , freedom of religion , international equity . In a word , the safety of the Commonwealth is in the election of such men as represent its principles in their characters : if these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knavish , the machine of government will always work badly ; it is a moral , not a mechanical power ; its springs are in the hearts and minds of those who move it ; their integrity or dishonesty , makes the nation fortunate or unfortunate ; their wisdom and moderation saves it ; their honor keeps it pure and respectable . Let us , therefore , the people , in selecting our CANDIDATE , ask ourselves , with Jefferson , is he capable , is he honest ? Is he a man of grand ability , of tried honesty , of unquestionable courage ; open of heart and hand ; of a great reputation ; able to rule , faithful to his trust ? Above all , does he scorn intrigues and private schemes ? If he is all this , and no man more so , then is he our CANDIDATE ; and if we , the citizens , who profess Whig principles , will unite upon him , laying aside all small fears and trifling doubts , who doubts our ability to elect him ?    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
