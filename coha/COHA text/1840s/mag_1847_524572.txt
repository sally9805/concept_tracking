txt IT is proposed in this article to offer some remarks on that project of the " American Peace Society , " which is indicated by its title . The writer is sufficiently sensible of the disfavor with which the project is likely to be regarded : " Utopian , chimerical , impracticable , " are the terms doubtless which many will apply to it ; and yet , if there is a Law of Nations , is it extravagant to ask , why there may not be a Court of Nations ? The world is slowly arriving at the conviction that there must be some other method than war by which reasonable beings may settle their disputes . Indeed , what mode that is , of adjusting the fair and equitable claims of nations , which obtains the solution of difficulties by violence-which brings in the sword to cut the Gordian knot-which marshals armies , not arguments , to decide every question , let common sense judge . Clearly , it is not , in any intelligible sense , a method of settling disputes . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions after the war are just where they were before the war ; and are ready at any moment to be revived . All the difference is , that after the war , power may dictate , and weakness must submit . There is no pretence of right in the case ; nor is there now any pretence of an appeal to heaven , as there was formerly in the martial encounter of single champions . It is a trial of strength , and nothing else . It is the strongest cause which is best , and not the good cause which is strongest , before this grim and bloody tribunal of martial justice . Be it admitted , however , that war , in a sense utterly degrading to both parties , helps to a decision-that nations are willing to negotiate when they can fight no longer-tbat lost battles and exhausted finances , have a marvellous effect in clearing up the truth and right of things to the vision of kings and ministers , of governments and diplomatic agents . StilJ , if this method will not much longer do-if enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinews of national strength and prosperity ,  --  nay , and the worn and torn sinews of human heart and flesh , can not and will not forever bear it , then some other method is to be devised . Now let the reader consider , whether besides the martial trial , there is any conceiveable method of settling disputes but one . If force is to be laid aside , reason must take its place ; this is the only alternative . If reason has any thing to do with the decision , it must take the form of a judgment . If there is a judgment , there must be a reference of the cause to it . If there is a reference of the cause , there must be a hearing of it-there must be an arbitration . If there is an arbitration , there must be arbitrators ; or , to vary the statement , if there is a hearing of the cause , there must be an auditor , or umpire . We have not yet , it is true , arrived at the point proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow , to be sure , that if there must be arbitrators or an umpire , either must form a permanent Court , for the trial of causes between nations as parties . That is to say , it it does not follow as a matter of argument ; and the question is , whether it will not follow as a matter of easy transition , and as a matter of expediency . Meanwhile , we think it important to secure the position which we have thus taken , and to show that the progress of civilization and of civil liberty tends directly , if not inevitably , to this point . Before we go farther then , let us see whether the ground to which we have arrived is strong-whether it is strong enough to bear up any practical principles : or is only of scifficient firmness to sustain a useless theory . The position may seem to be very clear , but it needs probably to be insisted on . What we say is , that the only alternative to the employment of force is arbitration . Now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of this conclusion-is there any thing in the affairs of nations that must preclude them from being submitted , like other affairs , to the arbitration of disinterested persons . Nations haae resorted to this method of decision . They are doing so more frequently , as civilization advances . They can already do this without dishonor : and this I consider to be the most material point of all  --  the point of honor . Nations have frequently fought for this . They have often fought unwillingly , as individuals have : - fought only because there was no other way to savc* // their honor . But let it become by usage , as much a point of honor , or at least as compatible with honor , to submit national differences to arbitration , and one of the most prolific causes of war is removed . And such is the advance of public sentiment upon this point , that even now , if a bloody and devastating war should arise between two Christian nations from some meaner cause -- from any slight and imaginary pretences  --  the signs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not raised against it , if a thousand pens are not employed to set forth its folly and wickedness , and to stamp it as a resort , on such an occasion , fit only for barbarians . And the day has come , thank Heaven ! when the pen is no contemptible weapon . It fought for the Poles , and in the only contest in which it professes to be strong , it prevailed ; it spread a sympathy through Christendom for their character and their conflict , and it has prepared the world to cheer them in their exile . So true is this , that we do not believe there is in France , in England , or America , a sequestered hamlet , where one of that unhappy people could a.ppear , without being regarded with the deepest respect and sympathy for his sufferings , or hailed with acclamation for his heroism . Yes , the world knows their story ; the pen of indignant genius has graven it on the tablet of memory , for at least one century . Even Bonaparte , reckless as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion , pointed and graven as it was , by the pens of the free journalists of England . There was no time , though the tide of success swelled to the highest-though Europe rung beneath the steeled footsteps of his armies-though kings followed in his train-there was no time when he could not be stung to the bitterest exasperation by a London newspaper . With anger if not with fear , we may say in the words of the poet , " he did shake , t is true , this god did shake . " The artillery of a whole opposing army was not a thing he dreaded so much as a single printing-press . Facts like these are omens of indefinite good to come . The diffusion of knowledge must raise the tone of public sentimeur . Readers and literary men , the votaries of science and the liberal arts , have never as a body , possessed a high degree-have never possessed any thing like an average proportion , of the martial spirit . But the civilized world is becom ing a reading world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depths , of science . It is becoming too comfortable , moreover , easily to bear the rude and shocking transition from peace to war . When men 's houses possessed not many more comforts than the tents of a camp , the transition was less perceptible and less difficult . Life itself was an unequal contest with the warring elements , and with the rude passions of society ; and where the wild uproar of anger and excess rePined , and the tempests of heaven swept through the dwellings of men , the storm of war might follow , and seem but slightly to vary the scene . But to the eyes of a civilized and refined people , who value more and more the blessings of existence , who venerate their temples and their asylums of mercy , who prize their seminaries of learning and their own fire-sides , who live more and more in their mutual affections , and are drawing closer and closer the bonds of domestic endearment ; to the eyes of such a people , war must present itself as a ruthless destroyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not bear ! Under influences like these , both of growing knowledge and refinement , public opinion must become at once more powerful and more pure ; and in just that proportion war must become more and more unpopular , and amicable arrangement more and more popular . And if what is popular is to prevail and to have the ascendency-if the people are to reign , as every sign of the times shows that they are ; then it is inevitable that more and more frequent resort ' will be had , in national differences , to the method of arbitration . If then it is probable , that the method of arbitration will be more fully introduced , and become more common , we are led to the further question , whether it will not be found advisable to assemble periodical conventions of nations , or to establish a permanent court for the trial of national causes ? Would not that mode of adjudication very naturally pass into this ? That is to say , would it not be likely to pass into something more regular and permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among every people , have arisen , by easy transition from the rude practice of referring causes between man and man to the decision of their neighbors , or of some disinterested parties . The first method indeed of settling personal // 343 disputes was by the strong arm . The next was by arbitration . This led to the regular administration of justice . Why may not nations , which are but collections of individuals , pass through the same process ? Or , to take a case more exactly analogous , why may not nations like counties or states in an empire , adjust their difficulties in. this manner ? I say , that this is the natural progress of things . Suppose that a Court of Reference were formed by representatives from two or three friendly powers . The case of an umpire , let it be observed by the by , does not materially differ from this ; for it is not one man , after all ; it is not the head of a friendly government , that decides , but a commission appointed by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously , where it is desirable that the court should be composed , not of a commission in one kingdom , but of repr*entatives from different kingdoms . Suppose a Court of Reference , then , assembled to settle some great national controversy . How natural would it be , that other and similar questions should be submitted to it ! If the court were composed of individuals of great weight and dignity of character , we persuade ourselves that it could hardly happen but that some other causes would be brought before it . And thus in time there might grow up a great Amphictyonic Council , more worthy surely to decide between civilized nations , than the dread assize of battle . There really are some pertinent and independent reasons why such a permanent court should be established . All law needs to be carefully defined , and regularly administered . This will never be done but by learned judges and responsible tribunals . There is a law of nations ; involving immense interests and complicated relations ; and it would seem to require its own tribunal , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way , probably than by the administration of permanent and responsible courts , can the requisites of good and useful law , in any of its departments be obtaiued. * One of these requisites is certainty . This is held by civilians , we believe , to be only less important to the utility of laws , than their very rectitude . It , is important that those who are to be governed by any laws should know what those laws are , what line of conduct is conformable to them , and what will be construed as an infringement of them . Now it appears to us , though we would speak modestly , and under correction of those who are studious in these matters , that no sufficient certainty can arise from a mere codd ; that a code , however useful it may he , for other purposes , can not fully answer this purpose ; that it can only embody general principles , and that new cases constantly occurring , new relations arising , and perpetually varying circumstances , will continually require new applications and endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any received code of international law , which there is not ; if the books on this subject could be considered as codes ; if they were precise and uniform in their decisions , which they are not ; still , to fix down to a precise meaning that which is general , and to meet the ever recurring exigencies of national controversy , would require a body of authorized precedents , and a regular and uniform administration of the law of nations . If a Congress of Nations were now assembled to form a code , would not the work be left half undone if a court were not organized , to interpret and apply it ? At any rate it is not easy to see why this is not as proper and necessary for nations , as a Supreme Judiciary is for our United States ; or why a tribunal to judge between communities , is not as important as a tribunal to judge between individuals . Nay , not to say that nations are made up of individuals , and that all national controversies become unavoidably personal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth is , that they are individuals who are most frequently concerned , whether intentionally or not , in violation of international law , and whose interest it is to know what that law is . Merchants , and especially the merchants of neutral nations in a time of war , are continually taking , or wishing to take , steps in their foreign trade , for the safe direction of which they as much require an exact law , as for the steps which they take in their business at home . " The complexity of modern commerce , " says Chancellor Kent , " has swelled beyond all bounds the number and intricacy of questions of national law , and particular- The position here taken is general , and has no reference , one way or the other , to the Admiralty Courts of different nations . // ly upon the very comprehensive head of maritime capture . " How much has been suffered , for want of definiteness in this branch of law , by the citizens of every maritime nation , is sufficiently well known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and useful jurisprudence . " Law , " says Blackstone , " is a rule ; something permanent , uniform and universal . " Now , it is obvious that neither arbitrations nor the decision of Admiralty Courts in different nations , nor treatises on international law , come up to this definition . Upon the inadequacy of arbitrations to form a body of such law , it is unnecessary to insist ; they are occasional ; they have never settled any principles ; nor do they usually leave any record indeed but of the simple results . Of the very exalted terms of praise in which the decisions of the English High Court of Admiralty are spoken of by the highest authorities among us , we are aware , as well as of the eminent merits of our own Admiralty jurisprudence ; but whether the attribute of universality can attach to principles settled in a single country , whether other nations will submit to them , is questionable . Whether , in fact , such decisions are likely to possess that impartiality , which would commend them to universal adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other men-may be influenced by interest and passion . Maritime nations and their courts will be likely to decide one way ; and manufacturing and agricultural nations and their tribunals another way . It is precisely as in the case of our own Federal Union-the courts of South Carolina would be likely to pronounce one judgment on a constitutional question , and the courts of Massachusetts to pronounce another and directly opposite judgment . Can either of these judgments secure the concurrence of all the other States ? Can it become , or ought it to become , a part of the body of universal and binding law among us ? As to professed treatises on the subject , we have the highest authority for saying , that " there is no one work that combines , in just proportions and with entire satisfaction , an accurate and comprehensive view of the necessary and of the instituted law of nations , and in which principles are sufficiently supported by argument , authority , and example . " * Many questions are raised upon the most important subjects ; as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contraband of war , the extent of jurisdiction over neighboring seas , and the right of interference in the internal affairs of other nations , whether to guard against the efforts of revolutionary movements , or to assist those who have revolted against their own government-many questions are raised on these topics , which are not yet sufficiently settled , and which never can be settled , perhaps , in a manner universally satisfactory but in a Court of Nations . Such a court would possess great advantages in its position and in its permanence . From its permanence , it would be in a situation to form a body of precedents to govern its decisions . It would also secure entire devotion to it of a body of learned judges , and would naturally awaken in them the highest . ambiti2n to bring the system of international law to perfection . Such a court would have a permanent character to support ; and to support before the whole world . This would be its position ; and such a position would give the greatest possible respectability and weight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of nations with an authority most needful to it ; since it can not possess the ordinary penal sanctions of law . Its voice would be the consent of nations ; and although delinquent nations can not be punished as individual aggressors can , yet the force of public opinion can be visited upon them , and proceeding , as it then would , from the High Court of Nations , it would come with concentrated power . Let it be added , that provided the principle of arbitration is admitted as a reasonable one , in national controversies , such a court is necessary to give that method of pacification its full success . In all such controversies , it would stand before the world as the grand resort . It would thus turn away the minds of men from war . It is important indeed to observe that a Congress of nations would not propose itself as a judge of the question whether two countries should take up arms ; it would not throw itself between two armies or two kingdoms , to withstand the power of exasperated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand as the antagonist of the Kent 's Commentaries , vol. i. p. 18. // war principle . It would not offer itself to breast the shock of the angry elements . But it would silently convey away from them the principle of destruction . It would operate as courts of law do , in a civilized community . It would lessen the number of quarrels by opening another method of adjustment , and making it common and familiar . Among a rude and barbarous people , not possessing any legal tribunals , all must perceive how desirable it would be , to promote as much as possible the use of arbitration in settling quarrels ; but if arbitrators were to be chosen on every such occasion , that plan would obviously be much less effectual to the keepingof the peace , than would the establishment of a regular and permanent court of justice . Such an institution , then , do we propose as having some claims to be considered among the means for promoting the peace of nations . Our proposition is now before the reader , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as extravagant , nor to be prejudiced against it as new , nor till he has examined , to reject it as impracticable . As to the apparent extravagance of the proposition , let it be remembered , that it can not appear more extravagant , than to a rude people , did the first proposition of the trial by jury . There was doubtless the same incredulity about the plan ; there were the same difficulties attending its execution ; and there is , in fact , the same principle at bottom . What is the principle ? That something of personal right and power must be given up for security ,  --  for peace ; given up , indeed , in particular instances , but to be returned in far fuller measure to the bosom of the whole community . Can not thc same thing be done by nations ? If it can not , why can it not ? We seriously ask , why can it not ? We can not consent that the whole subject , solemn and momentous as it is in its bearings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a summary phrase of contempt . Let it be remembered that neither civilization , nor religion , nor the arts , ever took any great step in the world , but the movement was regarded with precisely the same feeling . That great step in civilization which would be taken by the establishment of a court of nations , the greatest-probably e most important that yet remains to be taken-does really not present itself in a light as extravagant as have many successful projects for the improvement of the human condition . The universal diffusion of knowledge by any means , must once have seemed more impracticable than the universal diffusion of peace , by the means that we propose ; inasmuch as to move the mass of the world must have appeared a mightier task than to influence the governors of a few nations . In short , all great projects , bearing the character of innovation , from that of Luther in the world of mind , to that of Fulton in the world of matterthe latter perhaps to exert as powerful an influence on society as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes . Twenty-five years ago , it would not have been thought by any means so extravagant to propose the assembling of a permanent congress of nations , as it would to have undertaken to devise the means of conveying them to the place of meeting by steam . Nay , had war never been known in the world , the proposition to settle national difficulties by that means would have been pronounced to be an extravagance as monstrous as it would have been unheard of . To constitute a tribunal of six or ten grave men , is it considered an extravagant proposition by those who can marshal armies of six or ten hundred thousands of men ? The muster of the military forces of Christendom in a general war , would be more than twice the largest of these numbers . And yet if such an awful crisis wereto come , and two millions of men were to be armed and clothed , and provisioned , and half of them were to lose their lives in battle , and the countries of twenty nations were to be ravaged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , it might be evident , would take twenty generations to pay off by a system of the most grievous and grinding taxation , not a word would be breathed of the extravagance of such a proposition ! In the next place , against the proposition made in this essay , no prejudice ought to be entertained , on account of its seeming novelty ; for the very good reason that it is not new . Far back in the ages of Grecian story , so far , indeed , that its origin is lost in the shadows of antiquity , flourished , at Thermopyl* , the Amphictyonic Council . " The most important business of the // assembly , " says the historian , * " and that which seems to have been with great wisdom and humanity proposed as the principal end of the institution , was the establishment and support of a kind of law of nations among the Greeks , that might check the violence of war among themselves , and finally prevent those horrors , that extremity of misery , which the barbarity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We are informed by LEschines , the Athenian orator , himself at one time a member of the Council , as the representative of Athens , that twelve nations were represented in the Assembly , and the number was afterwards increased . We have , on the same authority , the form of the Amphictyonic ( bath , which bound each member , under the most solemn pledges never to subvert any Amphictyonic city , but to appease the angry passions and to mitigate the horrors of war , and to defend the sanctity of religiont Mere , then , is a prototype  --  and an age as early , it is probable , as the 15th century before the Christian erafurnishes it-of the proposed congress of nations . Why may not Christian nations follow the humane example ? It certainly will not be pretended that the Grecian cities and territories , though within a smaller compass , had not in that barbarous age as great difficulties to encounter as any nations at the present day can have . We might go on to mention the Achean League in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maximilian in the 15th century , the League of the Hanse Towns , and especially the Swiss Confederacy . The Swiss wisely determined beforehand , observes Vattel , in all their alliances with one another , and often with other nations , on the manner in which their disputes , if any should arise , should be submitted to arbitrators ; and to this wise precaution is to be referred much of their prosp*rity and of the respect they cnjoyed abroad.t With regard to the utility of another of these institutions , we have the opinion of a distinguished civilian and statesman of our own conntry. * " History , " he says , " o'ives us a horrid picture of the dissensigns and private wars that distracted and desolated Germany prior to the institution of the Imperial Chamber by Maximilian towards the close of the 15th century , and informs us at the same time of the vast influence of that institution in appeasing the disorders , and establishing the tranquillity , of the empire . " These cases , though we do not care to insist much upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties to the various confederacies named , did not form , as our American States do , a single government or nation , but were separatQ and independent cities and states.lI They were not united under one political constitution , as is often supposed of the Greeks , Germans , and Swiss , from their common name ; but they were united simply for the prevention of internal feuds and for defence against enemies abroad . These instances show , at least , that the history of the world , from its earliest periods , is not devoid of examples of that sort of combination which is proposed under the title of a congress of nations . Nay , and the various Congresses of Nations that have appeared in the History of Modern Europe , those of Cambray and Soissons , of Aix la Chapelle , of Laybach and Vienna , prove that such things may be ; and it will not be denied that they may be used for good as well as for bad ends . There has been too an alliance within the present century , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal and imperial prerogatives against popular encroachment ; and without asking why a Holy Alliance may not be formed for the welfare of the people , by the preservation of peace , it may , at least be said , that a proposition to this effect ought not to be regarded as a strange and monstrous project , to be rejected because it is new . It is only to chabge the design , without changing the form , and the example becomes familiar . But the precise position before us is not , in fact , new . It is well known that Henry the Great , of France , formed a design of this nature , in which he was joined , if not in fact anticipated , by Elizabeth of England . The plan , though marred perhaps by some admixture of ambitious motives on the part of the king , and certainly by some things visionary and im Mitford , Vol. 1 .

See Robertson 's preliminary Dissertation to the History of Charles V. Sec . III . // practicable in the detail , was nevertheless , as it would appear , an honest project for the permanent pacification of Europe , and justly deserving the title which was given to it , of " the Great Design . " The evidence of Elizabeth 's interest in it is given in the Memoirs of Sully ,  --  the best , and indeed the only , authority on the subject ,  --  who was sent by Henry to the Court of the English Queen , to confer with her ; and who says that he found her mind much engaged upon the project , and that she had already drawn up a number of articles , conditions and different dispositions , evincing great wisdom and penetration . " The design of Henry , " says Sully , stating it in substance , " was to save himself and the neighboring powers those immense sums , which the maintenance of so many thousand soldiers , so many fortified places , and so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of those bloody catastrophes so common in Europe ; to procure them an uninterrupted repose , and finally to unite them all in an indissoluble bond of security and friendship , after which they might live together like brethren , and reciprocally visit like good neighbors , without the trouble of ceremony , and without the expense of a train of attendants . Does it not , indeed , he adds , reflect shame and reproach on a people who affect to be so polished and refined in their manners , that all their pretended wisdom has not yet guarded them from those barbarities which they detest in nations the most savage and uncultivated ? And to destroy these pernicious seeds of confusion and disorder , and to prevent the barbarities of which they are the cause , could any scheme have been more happily or more perfectly devised than that of Henry the Great ? " Sensible people , he continues , can not be blamed for being prejudiced in favor of the scheme in question , from this circumstance only , that it was formed by two potentates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the art of governing . " Without going farther into detail , we subjoin from the Memoirs , the general statement of the plan : " The model , " says Sully , " of this general Council of Europe has been formed on that of the Amphictyons of Greece , with such alterations only as rendered it suitable to our customs , climate and policy . It consisted of a certain number of commissioners , ministers or plenipotentiaries from all parts of Europe , who were to be constantly assembled was a Senate , to deliberate on any affairs which might occur , to discuss the different interests , pacify the quarrels , clear up and determine all the civil , political and religious affairs of Europe , whether within itself , or with its neighbors . " Whatever may have been the imperfections of the plan we are tempted to adopt concerning it the words of Henry , in a letter of his which still remains , and which is supposed to have been addressed to Queen Elizabeth , and to exclaim with him : " the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! - though rather divine than human ! " * But is the project feasible ? This , doubtless , is the great question . Let us at once clear it from all extraneous matter and see distinctly what it is . It may be asked , " Will nations submit to this great court of appeal ? Will the nations all on fire for war , pause before such a tribunal ? " That , let us say , is not exactly the question ; nor is it the manner in which a great moral proposition ought to be met . It is not the question ; because it is the feasibility and reasonableness only of a proposal that we are required to consider ; its compatibility with the relations and duties of nations . Whether men will submit to it , we know not ; but whether they can submit to it and prosper , and be happy , and fulfill all the purposes of national existence , is the question . If all sound , wise , and humane discussion is to be foreclosed by the consideration that human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there never had been written a book on Natural Law , or the Law of Nations . But it is doing injustice to the world to say that such discussions are useless . They do , indeed , meet the tide of human passion , but they resist it too . Propositions which commend themselves to the reason and conscience of the world slowly make their way , and at length take their place among mankind as authoritative principles , it is a striking and encouraging fact that there is such a thing as a Law of Nations , a law which no authority enacted , a law strong in nothing but its own reasonableness and justice We have always looked upon a writer // on public law as standing among his fellow men in an attitude which is scarcely less than sublime . He puts himself upon the world for its verdict , and the world without any legislation to command it , without any judge to instruct it , gives him acquittal and honor . He does not suffer the question to be asked , will the nations submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and just , and right , and calmly leaves the cause before the tribunal of reason , of conscience , and of God . Now let the project be presented in its naked simplicity , and let it be considered whether there is any thing impracticable in it . Suppose that the governments of England and France and of the United States , sincerely disposed to cultivate peace , sensible of the dreadful evils of war , and desirous of putting an end to them , should agree to refer all questions arising , or likely to arise , between them to the most august and impartial tribunal which they are able to form . Let it consist of two representatives or judges appointed by each power , either for life or for a term of years , to hold their court either permanently or periodically , and to sit in one place , or in several places , as might appear most advisable . Let the power of this tribunal be simply and solely a judiciary power . Let it be authorized to make no decrees but upon subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise up one , or to crush another , of the nations around it . Let its simple object be to promote the harmony and welfare of the nations represented in it . Leteach of these nations , in the mean time retain its entire independence . Let it retain all the powers which natural law concedes to independent nations . Let it retain , even , the abstract right to make war , or at any rate the right to break off from the general union , and to pursue its own course . Such a natural right all communities of men possess . Each one of our United States , bound together as we are , maintains it . There is a right of revolution ; there is a right of extremity . Let not this be denied . Let no Utopian bond of harmony be proposed , no plan which overlooks either human rights or human passions . Let the qualification for belonging to this confederacy of nations , be a simplh desire expressed to substitute arbitration for bloodshed . Let the simple bond of union be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple penalty of refusal to snbmit , on the part of any confederated kingdom , be the loss of its place in the Union , and of all the advantages resulting from it . This forfeiture , let it be observed , by the by , might itself prove a heavy penalty . Meanwhile , let other nations be permitted to join in this alliance , and to send their representatives , on the simple conditions above stated . Let them be invited to do so . The united influence of the governments before mentioned would be powerful with any court in Europe* The very example would be imposing , and we can not help ilattering ourselves that it would be attractive . The people , at least , if not the governments , would be in favor of it ; and governments must yet become the organs of the popular will . What now , is there in this simple plan that is impracticable ? We do not profess to go much into details . It would be for profound politicians to settle these . But it is obvious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it were assembled , might be empowered as a measure preliminary to an entrance on its judicial functions , to discuss some general measures of a pacific nature and to offer the result of their deliberations to their respective governments . They might propose a plan for the gradual reduction , in a fair ratio , of standing armies and navies . They might agree upon that humane measure of making the sea a neutral element , of making those highways of nations safe for all the purposes of simple commerce . And why , to use the words of the sage Franklin : " Why should it not be agreed to as the future law of nations , that in any war hereafter , the following descriptions of men should be undisturbed , have the protection of both sides , and be permitted to follow their employments with security ? viz : " 1 . Cultivators of the earth , because they labor for the subsistence of mankind . " 2 . Fishermen , for the same reason . " 3 . Merchants and traders , in unarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessaries and conveniences of life . " 4 . Artists and mechanics , inhabiting and working in open towns . " In other words , let the soldiers , if they desire , fight it out by themselves . " Your young military men , " says the illustrious Washington in one of his letters , " who want to reap the harvest of laurels do n't care , I suppose , how many seeds of war // are sown ; but for the sake of humanity it is devoutly to be wished , that the manly employments of agriculture and the harmonizing benefits of commerce , should supesede the waste of war and the rage of conquest ; that swords might be turned into ploughshares , and spears into pruning hooks , and us the Scripture expresses it , the nations learn war no more . " But to return ; what is there in the project , we ask again , that is impracticable ? Are the controversies of nations such as , from their very nature , refuse to submit to reason or to compromise , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and eighty-six considerable wars which have been waged in Christendom , two hundred have arisen from questions of territory , commerce , title to crowns , prerogative or precedence , or from controversies of a civil or religious nature . These surely are questions for logic , not for tactics to settle . Let , then , the nations that boast of enough civilization and intelligence to comprehend so plain a proposition , agree to submit their differences to the investigation and judgment of a common tribunal . The occasions for war that would remain would be few or none . Ebullitions and outbreakings there doubtless would be , now and then , in one quarter and for one cause and another . But this dreadful business of a solemn and authorized levying of war ,  - -  to be waged for years ,  --  to spread gloom and woe over half the world-this dreadful business , this horrible custom can , if mankind are willing , be done away . Are they not willing ? Methinks , when the spectacle of a grave and venerable tribunal presents itself before me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ruffled by violence nor spotted with blood , that it must draw to it the grateful homage of the world . If that blessed vision were turned into reality , if it were once announced that , by the intervention of friendly governments , that august court were actually established , methinks , it would not be the voice of objection which we should hear , but the voice of jubilee spreading through the nations . Men would greet one another in the streets and in the marketplaces , with a new feeling of the tie of brotherhood , and call themselves happy that they had lived to see such a day . A joy more universal than was ever before known , would be diffused through all the dwellings of civilized men . In many a land which bears the memory of war as of an indescribable horror , millions would draw a freer breath ; the aged man would rejoice that he should die in peace , and the mother would press to her bosom the child of many anxious fears , baptising it anew in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of hoped-for deliverance , from violence and blood , would spread through every valley and by every shore in Christendom . And processions would go forth ,  --  with instruments of music , with harp and psaltery , would they go forth , to celebrate the great era of a new and wonderful age . And temples would resound with the voice of eloquence and of anthems ,  --  repeating the song of angels and saying , " peace ,  - -  peace on earth ; good wiIl ,  --  good will to man . " But alas ! that era has not yet comet and we must check the words of gratulation to listen to the words of doubt and objection . There are still objections which apply not to the general organization , but to the particular action and efficiency of such a court . Some of these objections , if not all of them , will be found to be such as apply to all human institutions ,  --  . such as lie with equal weight against all form of government and social order . The great measure which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or free from difficulties , and it would certainly be unreasonable to demand of it a perfection which belongs to nothing human . It is peculiarly unreasonable , though it is common , to demand of a new and untried experiment that it should be wholly clear from all those difficulties , which nothing but long practice can remove , and which , in human affairs , even the longest practice can not remove entirely . Thus the presence of national partialities in the proposed tribunal , and the danger of bribery , may be considered as objections to the institution , but they are objections to which all earthly councils are equally liable . Nay , an equal representation with equal power , from each member of the confederacy would be a safeguard against the operation of partial interests , stronger than ever was devised for any court of law . The danger of bribery would be less than it is in ordinary cases , from the character of the parties interested . The parties are nations , or the governments of nations , and if a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to // " Contaminate their fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of their large honors , For so much trash as may be grasped thus yet the very difficulty of the transaction would operate as a check . Bribery is secret ; it can do nothing but under the veil of concealment ; but the transactions of governments must pass through the hands of several agents , and must have the privity of a number of officers and other individuals , and are therefore peculiarly liable to exposure . It has been suggested that the plan proposed might endanger the national liberty of the weaker parties to it . But it guarantees the independence and integrity of each one of the confederated kingdoms and would therefore be the special protection of the weak . And if it be said that guarantees are feeble restraints upon national ambition , yet certainly they are better than no pledge or protection . Besides , in the august and open court of nations , it would be difficult , if not impossible to carry on any unconscientious scheme for the oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some dark conclave of diplomacy that such deeds shall be done . But further , it may be said , that nations who should reduce their standing armies , who should be confederated together for the preservation of peace , and who should remain for a long time in a state of peace , would be exposed to the attack of military powers , or to the incursions of barbarous tribes around them . It is not proposed , let it be remembered , to destroy the weapons or munitions of war . Let them stand , and be carefully kept and regularly used , against the day of need ; for , in the present state of the world , we would by no means throw away the means of defence . Let them stand , dread magazines of power , harmless but to the invader . Arid that they would make a nation strong , where there are strong hearts and hands to wield them , we appeal to the example of our country . We have no standing army ; we have lived for almost half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . But let the most disciplined legions of Europe invade the land that holds every thing dear to us , and what burning heart atfong us does not exclaim , " we are ready to meet them , standing before our altars and firesides ! " And what cold philosopher looking on , and understanding human nature , would not say , " the breasts of such a people , fighting for their homes , will make a phalanx firm against any mercenary troops that war ever marshalled in the field of battle ! " It is not the muster of military forces that can save any people . The Roman Empire wanted not these in the great day of her need . " When feeble Cusars shrieked for help in vain , within their seven-hilled towers . " The northern barbarians when they poured down , in undisciplined hordes , upon the fated empire , found towers and troops , found arms and armor gleaming in every city , and the imperial eagle lifted on high above a thousand battlements ; but they met nowhere the living bulwark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own vices , and partly too , beneath vices engendered by her own military system , before she sunk beneath the arm of the barbarian invader . The example , in fact , is for us . Let those vices of the social condition , glaring inequality of lot , grinding oppression , abject poverty , dissoluteness and crime-let such views of the social condition , which war contributes more than any other definite cause to create , be done away ; let the arts of peace be cultivated , let its comforts be multiplied , which they would be in proportion as the waste and exactions of war ceased to devour the substance of industry ; let all its blessings and virtues flourish and the consequent love of country and home be fostered ; let men become intelligent and learn to value and to use the blessings of existence ; and in such a state of things , and in such a state of things alone , will nations have a permanent safeguard against domestic feuds and foreign aggression . But the greatest objection of all , perhaps , remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrees of this great court of nations ? It may decree , but who is to execute its decrees ? It can not cite a kingdom to appear before it , on a chargc of high treason ? In fine , what authority will it have ? We answer in the first place , that no earthly institution possesses any thing that can be called absolute or unquestionable authority . Take the case of our own supreme judiciary . It possesses an authority as high and august as that of any judiciary upon earth . Yet is ' it not questioned ? May it not be re // sisted ? But , it may be said , the government has power to enforce its decrees . In all ordinary cases , it is true that it has ; and in all ordinary cases , the decrees of a court of nations , too , would meet with no violent resistance . The difficulty about enforcement would arise only in extreme cases ; and for these , no human institution can provide . Suppose that the Southern States of this Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision of the Supreme Court . What would follow ? Would the other States march to enforce that decision at the point of the bayonet ? We presume not . What , then , would follow ? Simply , that the disaffected States would withdraw from the Union . And this is what disaffected nations would do . There is a point , indeed , to which the enforcing power can go ; but beyond that , it can not go , neither in our own , nor in the British , nor in any other empire . There is more in the sound of this word , authority , than in any sense that can be affixed to it . It must always be limited and imperfect ; and among liberal and enlightened nations , it must ultimately depend upon the wisdom and moderation with which it is exercised . That is to say , it must depend on public opinion ; and on this point turns my second answer to the objection we are considering . For it is obvious that in this kind of power , a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was upon this ground that the Amphictyonic Council stood for centuries . It is upon this that the law of nations stands . And if the decisions of Admiralty Courts , interpreting this law , in different countries , are quoted with respect in other countries , how much greater weight would attach to the decisions of a court established by several nations in concert ! What tribunal could contribute so much to enforce the authority of public law ! With regard to the sanction of that law we can not do better than quote the following language of one of our most distinguished jurists . " Nor is it to be understood , " says Chancellor Kent , " that the law of nations is a code of mere elementary speculation , without any sufficient sanction . It is a code of present , active , durable , and binding , obligation . As its great fundamental principles are founded on the maxims of eternal truth , in the immutable law of moral obligation , and in the suggestions of an enlightened public interest , they maintain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence may be disturbed . The law of nations is placed in the first place , under the protection of public ol ) inion . It is enforced by the censures of the press , and by the moral influence of those great masters of public law , who are consulted by all nations as oracles of wisdom : and who have attained by the mere force of written reason , the majestic character and almost the authority of universal lawgivers , controlling by these writings the conduct of rulers , and laying down precepts for the government of mankind . " * What follows is equally corroborative of the final answer which we intended to make to the objection before us , " No nation can violate public law , without being subjected to the penal consequences of reproach and disgrace . " Add to this , that expulsion from the confederacy , and perhaps also , the withdrawal of commercial privileges , might be made to any nation a most serious and sensible disadvantage . But without deciding on the expediency of coercive measures , we may say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its command , but even a penal sanction . Men seem to be able to think of nothing as penalties but blows , and fines , and imprisonments . But the severer part even of these inflictions is often the disgrace that attends them . And itis public sentiment , and that alone , which inflicts disgrace . It holds the power , then , of punishing , as well as judging . And the most powerful organ of public opinion as well as of public law , that ever was devised , would be a court of nations . In ordinary cases , no people could easily resist its decisions . And be it said again , that these are the only cases which can be provided for by any fixed and regular establishments , either of government or law . All beyond is , necessarily , force , violence , disorder . Before such agents all human institutions fall . The very power that is brought to control them , is not law , but force . But within the limits where the law holds sway , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations would operate with an authority and power , such as never perhaps belonged to any other tribunal . We have now gone through with the Commentaries , vol. i. p. 169. 1847.1 351 // principal formal objections , and we trust they appear not to be stronger than those which lie against most human institutions . They are not stronger certainly than those objections , which were opposed to the union of our own States , or of the German States , or of England , Ireland and Scotland , under one government . We believe , indeed , that they are not so strong ; for the alliance which we propose would be far less strict ; it would impose no burdens-for the expense incurred would be too slight to be seriously thought of as a burden , not to say that it would save the tremendous expenses of war ; and finally this alliance would interfere with the independence , policy and interests of the parties , far less than the union which takes place in a consolidated empire . And if the objections are not invincible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . For let it be observed , that this is one of those propositions , where almost the whole force of the opposition lies in objection ; where , in other words , it is not so easy directly to assail the plan and to show that it is , in the very elements and on the very face of it , bad , as it is to find slight and inconsiderable flaws in the plan . Or shall we not say rather , that the principal feeling of objection does not lie against the plan at all ; that there is , in fact , another sort of objection that goes deeper than any that has yet been mentioned ; and that is , a deep distrust of human nature . Nay , and there is a still deeper distrust of those vast and unwieldy masses of human nature , so to speak , called nations . There is a feeling which does not come at human nature in this shape ; which does not dissect these masses , and separate them into the individuals that compose them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  a feeling , in fine , as if nations could not be controlled by any ordinary laws or principles . There is a feeliig as if their rulers , like corporations , had no souls ; as if they were official automata , not subject , nor required to he subject , to any moral principle : as if they were expected only to act on nations , as the magicians of an eastern tale are supposed to act on a world of matter , and that the masses on which they act are , in like mysterious and unresisting manner , to roll at their bidding . This blinding delusion , this mist before the eyes of nations , is passing away ; and the time must come , when this fatal distinction between official and personal conscience , between public and private morality , will be utterly discarded from the moral code ; when it will be settled that nations ought , as far as they are able , to do for the common welfare what individuals ought to do ; and that rulers ought to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons . What are these bodies of men , composed of rulers and subjects-what are nations ? Let the interpreter of Natural Law answer . " States , or bodies politic , " says he , " are to be considered as moral persons , having a public will , capable and free to do right nad wrong , inasmuch as they are collections of individuals , each of whom carries with him into the service of the community , the same binding law of morality and religion , which ought to control his conduct in private life . " Ah ! fair and fine sounding distinction ! beautiful morality of the statute-book of nations ! - says the scorner . But for our own part , we would repeat his exclamation in good earnest , and say , this beautiful morality only is wanting in practice , to make every feasible project for the peace and improvement of the world , as welcome and easy , as it is now difficult and doubtful . For what is it , that , after all fair and formal objections are answered , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What is it , that prevents the argument from being clear , and the conclusion certain , and the way open to glorious results ? What is it , that checks every aspiration and chills every hope of philanthropy ? It is this . It is the fear that nations will not recognize their interests and duties , as individuals do . It is the fear , that rulers can not be brought to act for the people , as they would act for their own families or for themselves . It is the fear , that although it may be easy to form a court of nations , it may be impossible to create a conscience of nations . But in the spirit of that religion which Christendom professes , in the spirit of that great law of nations which knows no exemption from its bond , in the spirit of those sublime law-givers who have spoken in the court of the assembled world , let it be said to all people , to all rulers , you are bound . Religion , morality , conscience , bind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their altars . No exaltation can raise you // above this solemn judgment ; no amount of numbers , no multitude can break the supreme obligation . What you can do to help the cause of feeble and suffering humanity , struggling with its earthly load , you are bound , as men , as Christians , as citizens , as rulers , to do . As you shall give answer at the judgment bar of God , you are bound . The dread inquisition of heaven must find responsibility somewhere ; and to whomsoever among men  --  to whomsoever is owing that effusion of human blood that has dyed every shore , those tears that have flowed freely and bitterly in every land , those woes unpitied that have wrung the hearts of millions-they shall answer it to the beneficent God , and to outraged nature . It is not a humble and unknown individual that says this ; it is universal reason , it is eternal truth ; it is the all judging Deity . The great heavens look down upon us with pity ! that seeth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , passing to one common bourne ; that seeth the eye that gazes on splendor and empire fast fading into darkness ; that seeth the cloud of destiny , surer than that of the pestilence , sweeping away the whole living generation ; and yet that beholdeth our hands armed and fighting for transitory power , our garments rolled in self-avenging blood , and the children of ten thousand plundered and bereaved dwellings sitting in sackcloth ! When some happier age shall look back on this , it will look upon it with pity and wonder . When some higher state of civilization shall arise , it will class this as among the dark ages . When the record of its history shall be written , it will be written within and without , with mourning , and lamentation and woe . Might it also in the mercy of heaven , but carry down the record of one effort , one great , and honest , and strenuous effort , to turn back the overwhelming tide of these calamities ! By that pity of heaven , which we have dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human pity , do we implore the wise , the great , and the powerful to give heed to our appeal . " 0 men ! if ye be men ! - spare the world these inhuman butcheries ; spare the strength and beauty of manhood from being cut down in these disastrous battles ; spare the eye of helpless innocence and shrinking infancy from ever again gazing , horrorstricken , upon the bloody hand and the sword dyed with carnage ; save mankind , already enough oppressed and borne down with the ills of life , this ruthless infliction , this unmitigated woe , this cup of trembling and of wrath without mixture . By all that is dear to man in human welfare , do we again implore the rulers of nations , and the intellectual . guides of the world ! by all that is precious in human happiness , by the long ages of sorrow , by every holy altar of religion , by the spirit and the blood of the Prince of Peace , poured out to heal the bleeding wounds of sinful and suffering humanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , do we implore all men , and those chiefly who sit in places of influence and power , to stay this desolating plague , to save unborn millions from this unspeakable curse , to save the coming annals of the world , from being , like its past history , steeped in blood !
