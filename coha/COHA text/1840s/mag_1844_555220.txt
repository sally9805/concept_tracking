txt THE first of these works is a thick volume , printed in small type , and illustrated with a profusion of well executed engravings . It contains the history of landscape improvement in every quarter of the world , presented in a very attractive form , and treated with the same minuteness and accuracy for which the other works of its lamented author are so conspicuous . But it is not Mr. Loudon 's only work , nor , as we are inclined to believe , his best one , upon this subject . We have never seen , indeed , " The Suburban Gardener , and Villa Companion , " which is advertised in the list of his publications , or we should have included it also in the title of this article . Some idea of its usefulness , however , may be formed from the announcement on its title-page , that it " comprises the choice of a suburban or villa residence , or of a situation on which to form one ; the arrangement and furnishing of the house ; and the laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grounds ; the whole adapted for grounds from one perch to fifty acres and upwards , in extent ; and intended for the instruction of those // who know little of gardening and rural affairs . " Such a book , we think , must prove even more serviceable as a guide than the " Encyclopa*dia of Gardening , " and on this account we hope to see it soon introduced among us . Mr. Colman 's tour of observation is likely to afford matter for a highly interesting and valuable work . In the first number - the only one yet issued - are contained some excellent observations on the English parks , iron and sunken fences in pleasure grounds , and on hedges and inclosures , which induced us to include it in the present notice . It is very handsomely printed , and , judging from the list of subscrihers appended to it , is likely to he extensively circulated in this country . Of Mr. Downing 's treatises we have spoken in a former article. * Ve allude to them again , to observe , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that a supplementary volume is announced as in press . We are happy to think , that a new era in the practice of landscape gardening has fairly commenced among us , with the appearance of these tasteful works . In this respect , we are at present very far hehind the example of our English contemporaries , who , during the last half century , have certainly made great progress in this delightful art . " The taste of the present day " ( in England ) , says Mr. Loudon , " may he considered as comparatively chastened and refined by so much discussion , so many errors and corrections , and by so many fine examples . " And the adoption of the present style is owing to the labors of many eminent artists and authors , who have made it a subject of interest , and of careful study . t * V. II . Review , Vol . LVI. , p. 1 . " Milton 's beautiful descriptions in ' Paradise Lost ' had much influence in awakening a taste for natural beauty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variance with the generally entertained notions of such a spot , but it evinced a mind full of exquisite natural beauty as well as the most sublime poetry Addison and Pope , however , undoubted. ly have the merit of completely overthrowing the formal , and substituting in the minds of the British public a taste for the natural style . The celebrated essay by Addison On the Causes of the Pleasures of the Imagina. tion arising from the Works of Nature , and their Superiority over those of Art , ' was written in 1712 . And the widely read article On Verdant Sculpture , ' by Pope , appeared in The Guardian , ' in the succeeding year . In the former , the superiority of the beauty of natural expression is most effectively shown , and the philosophical principles of landscape gardening suggested ; in the latter , the absurdities of the ancient style are pointed out in a masterly manner . " - Downings Treatise , p. 16 . " Among the first examples of modern landscape gardening , were those // When the exterior of Blenheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very naturally desirous to lay out the adjacent grounds in a manner that should accord with the stately glories of the new mansion . With this view , he applied to Sir John Vanbrugh , the architect of that noble pile , who , for himself , declined to recommend any decided steps to his Grace , but advised him at once to confer with a landscape painter of acknowledged abilities , as the safest and most competent judge of what he wished to effect . It must be acknowledged , that this was a judicious course , and its results are seen to this day in beauties too obvious to be overlooked by the most careless visiter of that imposing demesne . The alternate grandeurand beauty of its approaches give rise to an infinity of picturesque combinations , and form an admirable background to this masterpiece of " the most poetical of the English architects . " * In this conclusion Vanbrugh has been uniformly supported by the practice of later times . It was not long after , that the improvers of landscape awoke to the idea of conforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local propriety , and the formal Dutch taste , imported with the Prince of Orange , was fairly eradicated from English soil . The whole country , from Cornwall to Cumberland , has at length been restored to more than its primitive beauty . But the process has of course been gradual , while the increasing want of tasteful and judicious direction long since gave rise to a new profession , and , from time to time , brought forward Kent , Gilpin , Knight , Repton , and Browne , and , more recently , the accomplished Sir Uvedale Price , whose elegant treatise upon this subject shows him to be in every way fitted to carry the art to its final perfection . Under their hands , every vestige of plantations like those of Timon 's villa , given by Pope and Addison . In so far as was practicable , on a spot of little snore than two acres , Pope practised what he wrote ; and his well known garden at Twickenham contained , so early as 1710 , some highly picturesque and natural looking scenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small retirement at Bilton , near Rugby , laid out in what may be called a rural style , which still exists with very little alteration besides that of time . " - Encyclopo3dia of Gardening . According to Sir John Soane , who was no follower of Vanbrugh , but composed his designs in a very different manner . // " And all that toil , Misled by tasteless fashion , could achieve To mar fair Nature 's lineaments divine , " has now disappeared , and the eye of the traveller is continually entertained with new and surprising landscapes , as if of nature 's own exquisite painting , upon which he can dwell with feelings of unmingled pleasure , and which call up to his mind associations replete only with interest and delight . " The taste of the English in the cultivation of land , " says Mr. W. Irving , " and in what is called landscape gardening , is unrivalled . They have studied nature intently , and discovered an exquisite sense of her beautiful forms and harmonious combinations . Those charms , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled round the haunts of domestic life . They seem to have caught her coy and furtive graces , and spread them , like witchery , about their rural abodes . " Nothing can be more imposing than the magnificence of English park scenery . Vast lawns , that extend like sheets of vivid green , with here and there clumps of gigantic trees , heaping up rich piles of foliage . The solemn pomp of groves and woodland glades , with the deer trooping in silent herds across them ; the hare , bounding away to the covert ; or the pheasant , suddenly bursting upon the wing . The brook , taught to wind in natural meanderings , or expand into a glassy lake ,  --  the sequestered pool , reflecting the quivering trees , with the yellow leaf on its bosom , and the trout roaming fearlessly about its limpid waters ; while some rustic temple , or sylvan statue , grown green and dank with age , gives an air of classic sanctity to the seclusion . " These are but a few of the features of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative talent with which the English decorate the unostentatious abodes of middle life . The rudest habitation , the most unpromising and scanty portion of land , in the hands of an Englishman of taste , becomes a little paradise . With a nicely discriminating eye , he seizes at once upon its capabilities , and pictures in his mind the future landscape . The sterile spot grows into loveliness under his hand ; and yet the operations of art which produce the effect are scarcely to be perceived . The cherishing and training of some trees ; the cautious pruning of others ; the nice distribution of flowers and plants of tender and graceful foliage ; the introduction of a green slope of velvet turf ; the partial opening to a peep of blue distance , or silver gleam of water ; - all these are managed with a delicate tact , a pervading yet quiet assiduity , like the magic // touchings with which a painter finishes up a favorite picture . " - Sketch Book , Vol. i. , p. 82 . This admirable description sets forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and much even of the practice , of landscape improvement . It is chiefly in these home scenes of rural repose and sheltered quiet , that its principal value must be developed among ourselves . But whatever may be the scale upon which we design to operate , if we are to consider the landscape as the canvass upon which a finished picture can be produced , we shall at once acknowledge the necessity of going cautiously to work . We shall find it useless to proceed without some skill in the formation of masses , the distribution of light and shade , the management of perspective , and the nice selection of color . It is believed , that there are but few persons who are competent to produce this kind of effect . The disposing and ornamenting of the various portions of an extended landscape , so that each shall perfectly accord with the natural expression of the place , or , by a pleasing contrast with it , shall mingle art with nature in its most attractive form , are certainly more closely allied to the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those simple and mechanical operations which we always as-* sociate with the idea of gardening . The title of " landscape gardening " has sometimes , therefore , been objected to as a misnomer , and one calculated to lower the dignity of the art to which it is applied . To us there seems to be good reason for the objection . In its highest achievements , this art is one of great creative power . It does not affect to deal with the rectangular plots , the stiff parterres , the box hedges and hotbeds of the " trim garden , " - though this , in reality , is almost the only plaisance to be recognized on our New England ground , - but it places woods , earth , and water in the hand of the operator , like colors upon the palette of the artist , and enables him , with these materials , to exercise his invention and embody his taste . It converts the waste and desolate hill-side into the sheltered cheerfulness of the woodland slope . It arrests the streamlet in its unnoticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silvery expanse of the artificial lake . It clothes the moor with a covering of velvet sward , and prepares it for " Flowers worthy of paradise , which not nice ArL In beds and curious knots , but Nature boon Pours out profuse on hill , and dale , and plain . " // All these changes it is strictly within its province to effect , and their delightful result can not fail to prove gratifying to every eye . But the management of such a work is only to be entrusted to skilful and practised hands ; and if he has been thought to deserve praise " who makes two blades of grass to grow where only one grew before , " by the same liberal rule , the successful landscape improver is certainly entitled to the affectionate regard of his fellow-men . It is well to understand the dignity and importance to which this fascinating art has attained . But we shall be content , for the present , to limit our speculations to a somewhat narrower view . We have as yet no occasion , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest talent ; for we boast no parks extending over acres of country , nor do we possess estates so overgrown , that they may not be easily walked over in half an hour . The theory of operation , therefore , is only to be studied as an agreeable , though perhaps unprofitable , diversion . But we have an abundance of lesser occasions , on which the principles of good taste could be applied , with an advantage equal at least in kind , if not in degree ; and on this account , it would be gratifying , if the study of them could be made to engage some share of the public notice . We need not entirely disregard the picturesque , because we have no Blenheims , Chatsworths , Clumbers , or Seaton Delavals , to exhibit its widest principles and develop its highest beauties . We might as well be satisfied to ignore the rules of architecture , because we build no minsters , club-houses , or parliament-halls . Exchanges , custom-houses , and churches we do find occasion for , and the ignominious failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are likely to remain to our lasting shame . Landscape gardening , however , is , if possible , at a still lower ebb among us ; and though it is granted that we require as yet to know but little of it , still that little has , so far , been very tardily acquired . Mr. Downing appears to be the only author among us , who has given it his attention , and he certainly deserves great credit for the sensible manner in which be has imparted his knowledge . We earnestly wish , that his tasteful projects may more frequently be put in execution . In a previous number of this Journal , we gave a free expression to our sentiments upon the subject of architecture , and we now feel no disposition to renew the task . // We candidly think , that we have done our share . We are satisfied , with Sir Lucius O'Trigger , that " the quarrel is a very pretty quarrel as it stands " ; and until the positions which we lately assumed are distinctly controverted , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not think it advisable to enlarge upon them any farther ; but in proceeding to the consideration of our present topic , we are treading upon similar ground . The two subjects are very closely united , and , as observed by Mr. Laing lVleason , in his work on the Landscape architecture of Italy , " we are influenced by a desire to raise and extend the theory and practice of architecture to all thaj we consider belongs to the art . This was the case in Jtly , when the fine arts were in perfection , and great villas were often laid out by artists who combined the practice of painting with that of architecture ; and until it be adopted with us , the designs of the architect will never have justice done to them in the execution . " We view this subject as accessory only to the other , and shall treat it accordingly , being necessarily confined to a smaller space . The first point to be observed in the . construction of a country residence is , that the outline of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenery , and harmonize with the character of the situation in which they are placed . Whatever alterations may be made in the grounds about them should be strictly managed , also , upon the same rule , and the whole should be made to accord as nearly as possible in a perfect unity of expression . The ingenious Mr. Hope has ably exposed the contradiction of " launching from the threshold of the symmetric mansion , in the most abrupt manner , into a scene wholly composed of the most unsymmetric and desultory forms of mere nature . " It is beyond dispute , that certain characters of ground and scenery have a distinct analogy with certain styles of architecture . Mr. Downing has devoted a portion of his valuable work to graphic illustrations of this idea . It certainly does not seem very difficult to understand , that an English Gothic residence , with its irregularity of plan , its endless diversity of form and outline , its " Quaint , fantastic chimneys , with their store Of twisted , carved , and lozenge-shaped device , ' // general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - and that it would seem ill at ease amid the tame or rich scenery that so charmingly befits the terraces , arcades , piazzas , and balconies of the Italian style . But we doubt if our gentry have often paid the least attention to this obvious rule . In most cases , they seem to have proceeded to lay out their villas and cottages orn*es with the most entire innocence of any definite intentions of effect , and with as little knowledge how the whole affair will turn out in the end , as Miss Pinch possessed when she compounded her maiden pie in the triangular parlour . Very little difference can be discerned in the process . The Greek-temple house , painted a staring white , and ornamented with Venetian blinds of the most intense shade of greenness , has everywhere been set down among the rich woods and varying slopes of the country ; while rows of trees have been disposed about it in exact lines , as if to extend the angularity of the mansion into direct conflict with the undulating features of external nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety with the unmeaning effect of this wretched attempt at art . I'he town house , in fact , with all its compact arrangements and concentrated accommodations , has been transplanted to the open fields ; and the incongruities , which are the unavoidable consequence , remain without remedy , if not without detection . A number of composition urns or wooden statues are perhaps placed about among the grass , - effigies of " All heathen goddesses most rare , Homer , Plutarch , and Nebuchadnezzar , All standing naked in the open air " but these , too , are most carefully placed and most exactly balanced ; and the self-satisfied proprietor then retires to his Doric colonnade , to read Thomson 's Seasons and Phillips 's Pastorais , and imagine himself in complete rural trim . No wonder , in view of these absurdities , that the matter-of-fact business man should often have forsworn the country altogether , perhaps without fully understanding the reason why , and , shutting himself up at home , with his Turkey carpets and sea-coal fire , thanked the Gods , like Audrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The universality of this inconsiderate style of building and planting is by no means an argument in its favor . Were // it admitted to have any share of real merit , we might still venture to depart from it at times , in the hope of obtaining that little spice of variety , which the proverb so strongly commends . Invention and change are not , we are well aware , always synonymous with improvement . But in an instance like the present , where to alter is immediately to benefit , and where every departure from immediate precedent is , by so much , a perceptible addition to convenience and enjoyment , it would appear that we can not too soon be emancipated from the uniformity of which we have to complain . Perhaps there are some persons who will be inclined to draw a conclusion favorable to the present system , from the fact that no other is now understood or practised among us . They do not care to oppose the example and opinion of every body about them . When the Vicar of Wakefield 's horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the worthy man acknowledges himself to have " reflected , that the number of witnesses was a strong presumption they were right , and that St. Gregory upon good works professes himself to be of the same opinion . " But little advance , however , will be made toward that degree of cultivation . which insures the display of good taste , so long as this principle is recognized or acted upon as it has been . Attention must be turned to this subject , as to every other , before excellence in it can he attained ; and when we take into view the necessity that exists for a judicious choice of situation , a pleasing and characteristic arrangement of the grounds , and a correspondent excellence in the appearance of the mansion , no one , who claims to be blessed with an ordinary share of discernment , but will confess the absurdity of taking one standard , upon trust , for every species of location , and every kind of aspect . iJr . London holds it to be necessary , that tbe builder of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to call to his assistance the taste and judgment of others who profess to practise this branch of the art of design* ' ; and we confess we do not think this excellent author at all unreasonable in the conclusion at which he has arrived . In New England , however , no such class of artists exists . The builder must , therefore , depend very much upon his own ideas , assisted only by the information to be obtained from scarce and expensive books . But we have often ob // served a diligent perusal of these to be productive , in more ways than one , of very essential service to him . We have seen , for instance , the much abused country gentleman , who had long been groping about in the primitive darkness of Ionic temples and white board-fences , all at once blessed with an unmistakable glimmering of the true picturesque , doubting whether an English cottage orn6e , or an Italian villa , were not a more appropriate as well as a more comfortable residence than his temple , and even taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paling . Ideas come to him rapidly upon a theory which had hitherto been in his mind an unformed void , and he seldom drops the new discovery until he has sought out the best sources of information , and availed himself of all that he is able to apply . It is to this laborious process on the part of their owners , that we owe the various pretty country-seats *yhich are beginning to appear in the vicinity of Boston . Nothing but individual study , in each case , would have produced the visible result ; for we have already seen , that those upon whom he might be expected to rely are , as a body , grossly ignorant of every thing but the five orders according to Benjamin , which it is their constant delight to torture and caricature . This necessity for individual application on the part of the proprietor has at least this advantage , that it continually adds to the small number of well informed gentlemen architects , and will , doubtless , in time , come to have some influence upon the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he can seldom rely upon any professional aid , and he yields to the necessity of taking up the subject thoroughly for himself . If he wants a temple , he can have a hash of Stuart from the studio , cut and dried in tetrastyle , hexastyle , prostyle , or no-style ; for these classical gentry sometimes give very little heed to propriety , and are not always found , like Tilburina in " The Critic , " to be " stark mad according to costume . " But if he will choose any thing else , he must generally superintend it himself . This practice will lead to a transition state , it is true ; and it is not difficult to see that we have alread ) i entered upon it ,  - -  a state of domestic architecture , in which the feeling and sentiment of the whole are quite correct , but which is without a corresponding excellence in the details of the various parts . // In this respect , it is the very antipodes of the style displayed in the various public buildings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervision . It will readily he owned , that these errors of technical detail are slight , when compared with a total failure to appreciate the idea of fitness , even in its most obvious manifestations ; but they are still errors , and we should be happy to see them avoided . The only sure guard against them is , either an implicit adherence to the drawings in some approved hook of designs , or , what we should prefer as the safest course , a strict and diligent search till an architect be discovered who knows what he undertakes to practise and direct . If the perplexed novice should decide upon arranging his mansion from a book of prescribed plans , we regret that we can not recommend Mr. Loudon 's work as a whole , nor , indeed , any other with which we are at present acquainted , in the light of a safe ductor dubitantium . The merit of these works is often very unequal , and it requires some discrimination to select those parts which are the best . There are several designs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory ; but they are encumbered with a load of others , which one would scarcely suspect to be the work of the same person . Goodwin 's " Rural Architecture " has also some designs of great beauty , with a still larger proportion of trash . Mr. Papworth 's little volume , published twenty years ago , is far better than either . Lugar 's " Residences , " a very rare , is also a very excellent work ; and one design for a conservatory , in the domestic Gothic style , is uncommonly simple and beautiful . The execution of Mr. Downing 's second volume , upon the architectural part of landscape , is not , perhaps , quite commensurate with his knowledge and taste in other particulars , as displayed in his previous work . The river-side villa at Burlington is by far the best thing in either of his books while the beau-ide'al villa by Mr. Davis , which he introduces in his second volume with evident satisfaction , is , to our eyes , the ideal of any thing but beauty . We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can still , in the main , cordially recommend the adoption of his plans as far as they go , they are infinitely better than any thing of the kind , which has hitherto appeared ; they are expressly adapted to the uses of this country , and many of them possess // a marked elegance of composition . They will , at least , prevent the commission of faults , if they are insufficient to insure the ready adoption of the highest order of beauty . There are some other professed guides to the architectural embellishment of rural landscape , which have had their origin in the United States . The edifices which they represent , however , would appear quite as suitahly placed on the summit of Egg Rock as amidst the lawns and pleasuregrounds of the country . " Discuss the matter as long as we may , " says the acute Candidus , " it comes to this at last , that the power of architecture , as a fine art , manifests itself only in aesthetic effect . Effect is its alpha and omega . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second is - effect ; the third is - effect . And what can be more preposterous than , in one and the same breath , to assign to architecture a place among the fine arts , and then tell us that it may be reduced entirely to the merest mechanical rules ? " If a standard like this is to be set up , our Grecians must at once go to the wall ; and the ambitious houses , whose sole merit is , that the intercolumns of their fafades are so many diameters in width , and exact to a hair , must inevitably go with them . Assuredly , we shall not fatigue ourselves to avert such a result . Perhaps the wide difference between the formal and the natural style of landscape improvement is more evident in the operations which are required upon ground , than in the plantations or the buildings . The production of an adequate effect in this department depends entirely upon the boldest and most skilful strokes . it is here , therefore , that the qualities of taste and fancy are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little judgment that might have sufficed to lay out a geometrical pleasure-ground , to " grade " and level a prim avenue , or to plant it with parallel lines of equidistant trees , will be but ill adapted to decide upon the graceful variety of the opposite method . The easy curves , the knolls and hollows , that are to form the pictorial character of the scene , appear , at first sight , only like the unknown writing of an unknown tongue . The eye which has been accustomed to a landscape laid down upon lines , and levels , and squares , would be likely to regard them with no small surprise . But to the true artist , the proposed effect is distinct and definite ; the picture , in his mind , is 27* // thoroughly finished , and even all its accessories are completely sketched in , before the first barrow-load of earth is disturbed . It is scarcely advisable to enter upon any extensive alterations until this degree of proficiency has been attained . The heavy expense which attends any great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well studied programme upon the attention of the improver who wishes to behold nature in all her heightened charms , without incurring an outlay as lavish as it is unnecessary and absurd . The problem here , then , must consist in this , - to improve and adorn the natural character of the scene , with as little actual interference as possible with the face of the soil . " The error , " observes Mr. Downing , " into which inexperienced improvers are constantly liable to fall , is a want of breadth and extent in their designs ; which latter , when executed , are so feeble as to be full of littlenesses , out of keeping with the magnitude of the surrounding scene . Their designs , like the sketches of a novice in drawing , are cramped and meagre . This is exemplified in ground by their producing , instead of easy undulations , nothing but a succession of short sweeps and hillocks , like waves in the ocean . " This will be the first defect to be got rid of , and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience that it is not , by any means , insuperable . In the flrboretum at iDerby , * planned and laid out by Mr. Loudon , undulating mounds of soil were raised , varying in height from seven to ten feet , and planted at intervals , near the summit , with groups of trees and shrubs . The effect of the mounds is thus greatly heightened , and the inequality of surface , when the trees are properly placed , appears to be much increased . It is undoubtedly true , that the elevation of these artificial slopes should correspond , in some degree , with the extent of the estate to be inclosed but in general , an elevation as great as that just mentioned will be found quite sufficient for any operations in our own vicinity . Wherever the nature of the soil is not particularly retentive , and an easy opportunity for drainage is afforded , hollows and winding valleys , as well as hills and ridges , can readily be formed . Effect is , in this way , more rapidly // produced ; because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio to the height of the adjoining elevation to which it is removed . It will he well , in moving the ground , to take care that some of the old top-soil is preserved to form the new surface ; and this new surface must also be drained where necessary , and everywhere rendered perfectly smooth and even by raking and rolling , before sowing the grass-seeds . This course is particularly enjoined hy Mr. Loudon . It is not worth while , however , to suppose that any wonderful changes of the surface can ever he effected . Any attempt to accomplish such a result must , after all , prove a disagreeable failure . " Great Nature scorns control ; she will not bear One beauty foreign to the spot or soil She gives thee to adorn ; t is thine alone To mend , not change , her features . " The most that we should expect , therefore , is to soften the expression a little , if it he too rugged , or , if too tame , to bring it by degrees into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be relied on for any surprising results . " Little change , " says Sir Walter Scott , " can he attempted by means of digging away or heaping together earth ; the levelling of rising grounds , or the raising of artificial hillocks , only serves to show that man has attempted what is beyond his powers . Trees , therefore , remain the proper and most manageable material of picturesque improvement " ; and some observations upon their planting and training may not , in the present state of the public mind , be entirely thrown away . It is certainly needless for us to expatiate upon the beauty of trees , or to point out at any great length the value which every estate acquires from their proper cultivation . Upon this point , to the honor of the public taste , we are likely to find hut few dissentient voices . In every stage of their growth , and in almost every variety of form and species , they will on all hands be admitted to constitute the delight and the glory of nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little better than that of a wilderness and the most diversified outline of swells and slopes will possess no attraction for the eye , if unadorned with those sylvan beauties so essential to the spirit of the scene . The // bill-tops , even , in the blue distance , look bare without the assistance of their " leafy garniture . " But in the immediate vicinity of the mansion , in the lawn , the pleasure-grounds , and the garden , they become the highest sources of pleasure , and are often ohjects of the strongest attachment . The planter , in the opinion of the fascinating essayist , Professor Wilson , " as he looks at the young , tender plants in his own nursery-garden , will find his heart yearn toward them with all the longing and instinctive fondness of a father . And in what one imaginable attribute that it ought to possess is a tree , pray , deficient ? Light , shade , shelter , coolness , freshness , music , all the colors of the rainbow , dew and dreams dropping through their umbrageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet , soothing , and restorative - from heaven . " After such a description , we are doubly assured that we could ill spare from the picture of our beau-ide'al homestead the overshading of their deep-green foliage , their fantastic boughs stirring to the whispers of the west wind , and the murmuring of the bees amid the rich load of their vernal blossoms . And if we should chance to find any one stolid enough to deny its justice , we should assuredly take the liberty to tell him , like Bayes in " The Rehearsal , " " that we think him a very odd fellow , and desire to have nothing more to do with him . " It is not our good fortune , in this part of the country , to have many of the primeval forests remaining in a state of full preservation . But in the deep alluvial soil of the western valleys there are monarchs of the wood that have attained a great age and an immense size , and which attest the fertility of the soil and the fitness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form an adequate idea of the beauty of a natural wood composed of such noble specimens . Walter Scott shows his hearty appreciation of the charms of such a forest in glowing language . " From its beautiful effects of light and shadow , from its lonely and sequestered character , from the variety and intricacy of its glades , and from the numerous and delightful details which it affords on every point , it makes the strongest and most pleasing impression on all who are alive to natural beauty . the ancient English poets , Chaucer and Spenser in particular , never luxuriate more than when they get into a forest ; by the acenracy with which they describe particular trees , and from their // noticing the different characters of the different species , and the various effects of light and darkness upon the walks and glades of the forest , it is evident that they regarded woodland scenery not merely as associated with their favorite sports , but as having in itself beauties which they could appreciate , though their age was not possessed of the fascinating art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom mention the good forest ' and the merry greenwood ' without some expression of fondness , arising , doubtless , from the pleasure they took in the scenes themselves , as well as in the pastimes which they affbrded. " - Miscellanies , Vol. in. p. 217 . We are not to suppose , however , that we shall soon see any thing of this kind in our vicinity . The axe of the pioneer has passed over the face of the country so recently , and has so effectually done its work of extermination , that we are not likely , in this age at least , to behold any such forests on our soil . But it is not impossible for every landed proprietor to surround himself , in a few years , with very respectable appliances for shade and shelter ,  --  to raise a wood around his habitation , which , though it may not be magnificent , will surely be beautiful , and will afford to posterity the best evidence of his refined taste and far-sighted care for the interests of his descendants . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of well studied instructions have been given by various authors . We have already taken occasion to recommend Mr. Downing 's well expressed views . They are very precise , and illustrated - though perhaps too sparingly - with appropriate engravings . The landscape improver will do well to pay a close attention to them . In truth , thorough and minute instruction is required for such an undertaking as that of planting . The sanguine proprietor will often find , that , in his earlier experiments , the stiffest and most ungainly effects will be produced , where he had looked with real confidence for a very different result . His clumps will be formal , and his groups will prove weak and discordant . This all arises from the want of a proper guide . He goes to work upon his improvements with a praiseworthy zeal , it is true , but with a very meagre idea of the connected process which his arrangements will inevitably require . But most of all things , he stands in need of some prescribed order and method in carrying out his task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be directed to these two points , - the production of a whole , and the proper connection of the various parts ; and , throughout his whole operations , these principles must be distinctly kept in view . With the house itself for the centre , - relieved in every instance by large groups and masses of foliage as a background , - a union with the ground and the surrounding scenery is to be kept up by the introduction of shrubberies and climbing plants . It will not be difficult , also , to adopt such an arrangement of the larger trees in the close neighbourhood of the mansion as will allow of agreeable vistas from it , while at the same time they conceal the offices and out-buildings , and give to the principal edifice that appearance of shelter and support , which adds so much to its air of dignity and domestic comfort . The principal front will , of course , be left comparatively open . But on each side of this central mass , the plantations are to 4weak off , in groups proportioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the more distant wood . Upon the lawn front of the house , it is recommended to place single trees of elegant forms , or small clumps of such as are remarkable for the beauty of their foliage or blossoms . These few leading principles can be applied in almost every variety of situation , with an equal degree of success . The wood that skirts the estate , when under proper management , is another source of great beauty . If it be desirable to restrict the view within the limits of the inclosed lawn , it can easily be surrounded with an impenetrable screen of foliage , that will effectually accomplish this end , and will , in itself , conduce in no small degree to the charming variety of the scene . But to do this , it is by no means necessary to dispose the trees in continuous lines . A succession of masses , irregular in their form and outline , should be scattered along the sides or advanced toward the centre of the grounds , and connected by smaller groups , or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by easy gradations , and unite them gracefully with the centre of the composition . The recesses and openings thus created will form the most agreeable variation that can be devised . " Natural groups , " says Price , " are full of openings and hollows , of trees advancing before or retiring behind each other ; all productive of intricacy , of variety , of deep shadows , and brilliant lights in walking about them , the form // changes at every step ; new combinations , new lights and shades , and new inlets present themselves in succession. ** But if a double or triple row of trees stand crowding and interfering with each other , in set and formal lines , as we have often seen them , the effect is artificial in the extreme , and quite out of keeping with any appearance which nature could possibly assume . The trees are almost invariably stunted in their growth , and but thinly provided with branches ; the tops are drawn upwards , as if in search of light and air ; and no single specimen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its proper and healthful maturity . In selecting the proper varieties of trees for planting , regard must , of course , be paid to the peculiar character of the situations to which they are to be removed . A tree can be as much out of character in a particular scene , as a pagoda or a pyramid . The rough fir-tree of the Alps would prove a sadly discordant feature in a landscape shaded mostly by smooth chestnut-trees and weeping willows . A little study of Mr. Downing 's illustrations of this point will be quite sufficient to convince the most skeptical , the contrasts produced in his engravings being so obvious as to strike every eye . The fulness and accuracy , however , with which he has described the most useful trees , and the proper treatment of them in various situations , will enable the planter to avoid any serious errors for the future . The section which he devotes to the consideration of deciduous ornamental trees extends over a hundred and twenty pages of his large octavo volume , and the account of evergreen ornamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprise almost every thing necessary to be understood in the selection of wood , and are rendered peculiarly attractive by the easy elegance of the style , and the great variety of apposite quotations which the writer has brought together . Considered merely as essays , without any immediate practical purpose , they would certainly deserve the favorable notice of the critic . But viewed in the light in which their author intended them , their value as a guide to the principles of the art is much enhanced by the pleasing dress in which they are presented to the reader . It may not be amiss to enumerate a few of the varieties of shade-trees , which are found to agree with our climate , and to produce a pleasing effect upon the landscape of New // England . The Oak , the monarch of the forest , is certainly entitled to the foremost place . From its grandeur and picturesqueness , it is a pleasing object in almost every situation ; and , whether standing alone , or planted in groups and masses , its outlines are bold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikingly effective and always agreeable to the eye . It is singular , that it is not more commonly found , in prominent situations , in our vicinity , as it is abundant in our forests ; and , being a hardy tree , if planted with ample space on every side , so as to give it a free exposure to the sun and air , it will not be so slow in attaining to a very respectable size , as is generally imagined . " When immense trees are desired , " observes Mr. Downing , " the oak should either be transplanted very young , or , which is preferable , raised from the acorn sown where it is finally to remain . This is necessary on account of the very large tap-roots of this genus of trees , which are either entirely destroyed , or greatly injured by reinoval . " Planting acorns may seem , indeed , to be looking a great way forward for the benefit of posterity ; but it should be recollected , that it is but a slight exertion , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do but to grow . All care over them ceases when the acorn is planted in the soil , and , whatever else betide , it is certain that each day will be constantly adding to their maturity . The Elm is more common in our plantations than the Oak , and is certainly unsurpassed for its elegance and gracefulness of form . It forms the chief ornament of most of the small towns and rural villages of New England that have acquired any reputation for sylvan beauties ; and , when planted in avenues , its interlacing boughs , crossing each other in graceful pendent curves , impart to the scene an expression of picturesque loveliness that can be produced in no other way . It is one of the best trees for transplanting that can be found , as all its roots lie near the surface ; and it is so hardy in its nature as to suffer comparatively little from the maltreatment to which transplanted trees are generally subjected . The Plane or Buttonwood tree , so common in our streets and environs , has hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the beauty of its appearance , and the great size to which in time it attains . But it is well known , that , within the last four or five years , these trees have been the subjects of a singular species of disease . They appear to // be vigorous and full of life , down to the extremities of the minutest twigs ; and when cut into , there is no deficiency of sap , nor any appearance of decay . But year after year , the Buttonwood is denuded of its leaves until about the end of the season , when , as if by a powerful effort , they come forth in irregular bunches , near the top of the tree . It has been suggested , that the cause of this malady is a minute insect in the stem of each leaf ; but it is doubtful what degree of weight is due to this conjecture . It would be gratifying to many others besides amateurs in natural history , to have the cause thoroughly investigated , and some remedy prescribed which will restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ash is , perhaps , the most regularly beautiful of all our deciduous shade-trees . Wben unchecked by contact with other trees , its shape is rounded and symmetrical in the highest degree ; and the light tint of its foliage , and the smoothness and compactness of its bark , give it an appearance of sound health and hardy vigor . Mr. Gilpin says of it , * " The Ash generally carries its principal stem higher than the Oak , and rises in an easy , flowing line . But its chief beauty consists in the lightness of its whole appearance . Its branches at first keep close to the trunk , and form acute angles with it ; but as they begin to lengthen , they generally take an easy sweep , and the looseness of the leaves corresponding with the lightness of the spray , the whole forms an elegant depending foliage . Nothing can have a better effect than an old Ash banging from the corner of a wood , and bringing off the heaviness of the other foliage with its loose , pendent branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil and climate , attains in time to an enormous size , and is esteemed by Mr. Downing as ranking , for its qualities in landscape gardening , " with that king of the forest , the Oak . " Its beautiful foliage can , if judiciously introduced , be turned to the greatest advantage in the production of lively and picturesque effects ; and when it has arrived at a considerable age , there is no other tree , except the Oak , that can confer so much of imposing dignity and grandeur upon the scene . In its mature state , it presents the greatest variety of shape , and * Gilpin 's Forest Scenery , p. 82. vOL . LIX. -. - *O. 125. 28 // enters with peculiar facility into the formation of bold groups , dark , shadowy masses , and spreading outlines of foliage . It is not , indeed , so rapid in its growth as many other trees , and to raise it from the nursery would be a work of time and as it forms strong vertical tap-roots in a more advanced state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when planted for posterity , it should be raised from the nut ; as the trees produced in that way are much the finest , and their growth , when young , is said to be more rapid and certain than that of the transplanted tree . The Beech is much less known and cultivated , as an ornamental tree , in this country than in Europe . In the parks and woods in England it is one of the most favorite species , and it will be noticed that it is introduced by the landscape painters with a peculiar pleasure into their finest compositions . Mr. Harding , the eminent pencil-artist , has often made it the subject of his efforts ; and several exquisite examples of his treatment of it may be found among his views in the vicinity of Windsor castle , where it abounds in a high state of perfection . When mingled with other trees of a lighter appearance , it may be introduced in plantations with advantage , - and , on account of its darkness and density , it is peculiarly adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black-walnut , the nut of which is so highly esteemed for the dessert , is a tree of most imposing appearance , and , when at its full size , scarcely inferior to the Oak and Chestnut in some of its effects in landscape . It is peculiarly admired for the boldness with which it shoots out its branches on every side , and for the amplitude and compactness of its head . It does not , indeed , possess the varied and spirited outline of the two former trees , but it is thought to be better adapted than they to some peculiar situations . When unencumbered by other trees , and on a favorable soil , it attains a size and dignity truly majestic , often growing to the height of sixty or seventy feet . The wood is very beautiful when used for cabinet-work , and seems to he rapidly superseding that of the Mahogany for a variety of purposes . For its rich color and high polish , we can not hesitate to think it decidedly superior to that long established favorite ; and we gladly take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be much more generally introduced // for the interior finishing of domestic apartments . Its effect , when thus employed , would be unrivalled even by the famous oak wainscoting of old England ; and we have no doubt , that , when the graces and amenities of domestic architecture are a little more understood , it will come into common use among us . The Lime or Linden is a neat and pleasing tree . It is frequently cultivated in most of the country towns in New England ; and though it grows freely in woody situations , it is thought to he more peculiarly suited for planting in avenues , where its somewhat formal shape is not so much out of character as in a picturesque and irregular scene . Mr. Downing calls it " a true town tree , " and thinks it can not be too much praised as an ornament for streets and public parks , where its regular outline corresponds with the formality of the houses and inclosures , while the delightful odor of its blossoms is doubly grateful in the more confined air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow well on any good friable soil , and readily endure transplantation . The Horse-chestnut is another tree which is better suited to the purposes of shade in towns and cities than for ornamental planting in the country . As a single tree , however , the unusual luxuriance of its foliage , and the splendor of its gay blossoms , render it a very beautiful object ; but it has so little variety of shape in the different specimens , that a monotonous effect would result from planting it in groups . It is easily transplanted , though it seems to be conceded that it is better to raise it at once from the seed . The Maple , in its different varieties , is one of the most elegant deciduous trees which we possess . During the spring and summer months , it is certainly quite as handsome as any of the trees before mentioned ; but in the autumn months , it assumes a beauty of appearance far beyond them all . After the first frosts , the gradations of color upon its leaves are unsurpassed by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . In the western counties of Massachusetts , the scenery at that time acquires , from this circumstance , an inexpressible charm . There are five or six varieties of this valuable tree , and as they differ materially in the tints which they assume in fading , very striking effects can be produced by arranging them with a view to that end . // The Birch , the Poplar , the Locust , the Mountain-ash , and the Willow are also common trees , and may be introduced in proper situations with great advantage and effect . None of them , however , should be made the principal material in any scene , and their value as accessories will entirely depend upon the degree of propriety with which they are used . It will not he very difficult to acquire some knowledge of the principles which should regulate their selection , while the prejudice existing against several of them has entirely arisen from the indiscriminate employment of them in situations to which they are altogether unfitted . The operation of transplanting trees , that have attained a sufficient size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a greater or less degree , occupied the attention of every landscape improver of eminence or ability . Various are the means that have been adopted for this end , and innumerable the expedients that have in turn supplanted each other . So little success , however , has in most cases been met with in removing large trees , that it is often supposed by intelligent persons to be of no use to attempt it . It is often found , that a young tree from the nursery , when placed side by side with one transplanted after it had grown to eight or ten inches in diameter , has shot up so much more rapidly as in a very few years to become the finer of the two . The results of transplanting depend on causes so occult as only to be discovered gradually , and by observation and training of a very peculiar kind . When the greatest pains , therefore , have been taken to insure success , the ignorance of a single particular , or the omission of what might seem a slight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole scheme , and thus discouraged and baffled the most persevering planter , when the object of his labors seemed to be just within his reach . Of late years , however , very successful experiments have been made abroad . The knowledge that has been brought to bear upon this subject , and the degree of perfection to which the system has now been carried , would scarcely be believed by any one who has never lost himself in the enticing pages of Sir Henry Steuart , of Allanton . His numerous experiments led him to the adoption of a system , which he has given to the world in " The Planter 's Guide , " - and which a distinguished committee of the Highland Society , after a thorough examination , declare // to be attended with complete and almost miraculous success . In several important respects , the method of practice recommended by him differs from any which had before been known . But it appears to have been taken up after a most patient and systematic series of trials , to be founded on sound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the habits and the demands of nature . Sir Henry Steuart begins with the assertion , that success can not be expected unless upon principles of selection , determining the subject to be transplanted with relation to the soil to which it is to be transferred . The soil and subsoil must be congenial to the nature of the plant , and the species of trees selected must receive as much attention as is given by the farmer in adapting his crops to the soil of his farm . The condition and properties of the individual trees are also to be nicely considered . It is well known , that the greatest difference exists between trees which have stood in exposed situations , and those which have grown in such as are sheltered . The stems of the former are always short and thick , because , from their unobstructed opening to the air and light on every side of them , they have not the same impulse to shoot up towards the free air , which is always so clearly observable in close woods . Their branches , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roots beneath the ground are exactly proportioned to the vigor and hardiness of the tree above it . Trees that have stood in unsheltered situations will have acquired , therefore , by their own efforts , thickness and induration of bark , shortness and girth of stem , numerousness of roots and fibres , and lastly , extent , balance , and closeness of branches , - properties which admirably qualify them for sustaining the risk of removal . When such trees can not be had , they must be made by previous training to acquire these properties , the treatment to which they are subjected being various according to the special quality in which the particular tree is deficient ,  - -  but all described in " The Planter 's Guide " with a fulness and accuracy that leave no possibility of mistake . The size of the trees that can be subjected to the process of transplantation is stated to be a mere question of expense . A large tree can be removed with the same certainty of success as a smaller one ; but the expense , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly progressive ratio .. 28* // Trees of about ten or twelve inches in diameter are considered by our author as a medium size , being easily manageable in their removal , and large enough to produce an immediate effect upon the landscape , and to oppose sufficient resistance to the storm . The roots of the tree to be removed having first been carefully laid bare to their minutest extremities , the common transplanting machine , consisting of a strong pole mounted upon high wheels , is then attached to it , and it is carefully pulled out of the soil . Both the roots and branches are tied up for fear of injury , and so balanced against each other , that a nice equilibrium is preserved . It is then removed with but little trouble to the pit prepared for its reception . In placing it in the ground , the former position of the tree in regard to the weather side is reversed , - that is , the lee side , where its branches have shot out more freely , and in an opposite direction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards them , so as to correct any irregular or sidelong shape which they may have acquired , and thus restore the balance and symmetry of the top . The practice of mutilating or pruning the removed tree is condemned in the strongest terms , as almost sure to prove fatal to its vigor and the most delicate nicety is recommended , in the work of r&amp;irranging the roots in their original position in the ground . This is only a slight sketch , indeed , of the process , but sufficient , perhaps , to give a general idea of the points in which it differs from those which have ordinarily been pursued . The reasons assigned for each step in this process are such , it seems to us , as must hold good in all climates , and everywhere . But it is complained by Mr. Downing , in the Appendix to his first volume , that the Allantonian system has not been attended , in this country , with even tolerable success . One of the supposed reasons which he assigns for this result is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments were made , is , in some respects , and particularly that of dampness , exactly opposite to that of the United States . But we are inclined to believe , that there is nothing in any part of Sir Henry 's process , upon which Mr. Downing could place his finger and say that it is detrimental , in any particular climate , to the vigor of the transplanted tree . We think the reason must rather be // sought in the other difficulties which he names ; a want of skill in performing the operation , arising chiefly from ignorance of the nature of the vital action of plants , and from a had or improper selection of subjects on which the operation is performed . But it should he recollected , that Sir Henry Steuart 's treatise is especially precise upon these two very points , so that we can not see the propriety of making the admissions which Mr. Downing allows to he necessary , and yet rejecting the method in question as unsatisfactory . Unless the nicest attention is bestowed upon an unimpaired preservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the choice and preparatory induration of every individual subject of removal , it can not be said , that Sir Henry 's method has been followed in its most important particulars . Any degree of carelessness in regard to either of these steps is quite enough to insure a failure ; and if it happen , there is no reason why it should he charged to the fault of the theory . Such a proceeding is like treating a patient to a thorough system of depletion , and then complaining that his course of tonics has done him no manner of good . It is assuming the inefficacy of a course of treatment the very reverse of that which has actually been followed . We can not allow our faith in the success of the method of which we have spoken to be so easily disturbed . This will require a greater degree of proof , and of a higher kind , than any which we have as yet seen adduced . When it shall be fully established , that a sound and healthy tree , standing exposed , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and air on all sides , has been delicately laid hare around its roots and their fibres , has been removed with ordinary care , and placed in a soil prepared beforehand , after the directions of Sir Henry Steuart , with its top left entirely unmutilated , and its roots carefully incorporated with the surrounding earth , - and all these operations have been carried on with that scrupulous nicety which is so strictly enjoined in " The Planter 's Guide , " and the subject of them has yet failed to live and flourish , we will at once yield to the force of the evidence , and admit that a difference of climate , or some other unknown cause , prevents the system in question from being successfully adopted in North America . But until these facts are shown , we see no just reason to doubt the unanimous opinion of the Highland Society , // that " the art of transplantation , as practised by Sir Henry Steuart , is calculated to accelerate , in an extraordinary degree , the power of raising wood , whether for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hihernicism of saying , that we believe the reason why the system has failed is , that it has never been tried among us ; and we heartily commend this point to the notice of every person possessing an interest in the question , or in whom we may have been so fortunate as to excite one . In conclusion , we can not but rejoice at the appearance of any publications which indicate that a real interest for the charms of external nature exists in the hearts of our countrymen . A lively sensibility to natural beauties will be found to lie at the bottom of the sweetest and purest poetry in our language , and of much even that is highest and holiest in the human soul . 0 , friendly to the best pursuits of man , Friendly to thought , to virtue , and to peace , Domestic life in rural pleasures passed !
