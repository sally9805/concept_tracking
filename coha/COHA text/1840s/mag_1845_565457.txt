txt ANY contest is a serious one that puts in hazard the supremacy of Law over individual will and unreasoning force . Such a hazard has given dignity to many struggles of inferior note ; and such a one now invests with their highest interest even the gravely important issues involved in the controversy between Massachusetts and South Carolina . " Is there Law in the land ? " is a question which , seriously raised , wakens the anxiety of thousands , who might care little to know which of two parties was at the outset right or which wrong . There can be no society , of nations or of individuals , recognizing absolutely no law above them . And especially , a Union such as ours , subsisting by force of a constituted and paramount law , becomes impossible , the moment it is settled that a question of conflicting rights , arising under that supreme constitution , is to be permanently decided , not by its law , but by the mere will of one of two contending states . Nor upon such conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , tending even remotely to bring a contest between sovereign states to such an issue , threatens at once the usefulness and the existence of the Union . In the present controversy , South Carolina , refusing the arbitrament of that tribunal which the supreme law of the land has provided , has chosen to assume the attitude of a combatant in a personal encounter , in preference to that of defendant in an amicable suit at law . If her example is to be follo*vcd , this contest , and others like it , can have but one result . Carried on , as it must be , by a course of hostile legislation , incompatible with any thing like authority in the Union , or friendship and peace among its members , it must end , sooner or later , in the utter subversion of both . But we dismiss such considerations . Important as they are in the present unpromising posture of the case , we cherish the hope and belief that the controversy will yet be decided upon its original and intrinsic merits . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the questions these involve , can not hinder and may promote such a result ; the solemn appeal of Massachusetts to her sister states has brought them distinctly before the people , and the response to that appeal may require of our citizens . an intelligent decision of them as a matter of individual duty . These questions are substantially the following : Do the laws of South Carolina designed to prevent the entrance into that state of free persons of color , violate the rights of Massachusetts or her citizens ? If so , do they justify the measures taken by Massachusetts to obtain redress , as being necessary and proper ? Is the subsequent action of South Carolina consistent with her obligations as a member of the Union ? The law of South Carolina out of which the controversy has arisen , is an act passed in December , 1835 , embodying the substance of similar enactments made at different periods from 1820 till that time . The second section of that act provides , " That it shall not be lawful for any free negro or person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any vessel , as a cook , steward , or mariner , or in any other employment on hoard such vessel ; and in case any vessel shall arrive in any port or harbor of this state , from any other state or foreign port , having on board any free negro or person of color , employed on board such vessel as a cook , steward , mariner , or in any other employment , it shall be the duty of the sheriff of the district // in which such port or harbor is situated , immediately on the arrival of such vessel , to apprehend such free negro or person of color , so arriving contrary to this act , and to confine him or her closely in jail , until such vessel shall be hauled off from the wharf and ready to proceed to sea . And that when such vessel is ready to sail , the captain of the said vessel shall be bound to carry away the said free negro or person of color , and to pay the expenses of his or her detention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will comply with these requisitions , and failing to do so , is to be compelled to haul off his vessel one hundred yards from the wharf into the stream , and there to remain until he shall proceed to sea , under penalty of fine and imprisonment . By the third section of the same act , it is enacted : - That any free person of color , imprisoned by virtue of the preceding section , shall have warning never again to enter the state ; and every such person who shall not depart from the state , or having departed shall ever again enter into the limits of the state , shall , by the first section of the act , be liable to seizure by any white person , and to subsequent summary proceedings , terminating in an order to leave the state , and upon failure to comply with the order , in corporal punishment , at the discretion of the court ; and if such person shall still remain in the state , or having left it shall afterwards return , " he or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With respect to these laws , Massachusetts , in her declaration and protest , charges that they assume the following principles . " First . That the state has a right to send officers *n board of the ships of other states touching at her ports , with the design of distinguishing between the persons who constitute the crew , and of seizing , at her sole discretion , and casting into prison such as she may specify , without the necessity of alleging against them the commission of any crime . " Second . That the state has a right to inflict corporal punishment , by the application of the lash , to any extent , upon the persons of citizens of Massachusetts , solely because they may be found a second time in the ships of their own state touching at her port . " Third . That the state has a right to sell into absolute slavery for life , human beings , unoffending persons , freemen of Massachusetts , entitled by her constitution and laws to the fullest security of life , liberty and property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships as when at home . " And Gov . Briggs , in his message of January 6th , 1845 , says : " The Legislature and people of Massachusetts believe that law to he in direct and palpable violation of that clause of the Coiistitution of the United States which declares that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states , ' and also of that part of the Constitution which confers upon Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations , among the several states , and with the Indian tribes . ' " South Carolina , on the other hand , Dec. 6th , 1844 , " Resolved , That free negroes and persons of color are not citizens of the United States within the meaning of the Constitution , which confers upon the citizens of one state the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . " And also , " That the right to exclude from their territories seditious persons , or others whose presence may be dangerous to their peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of South Carohina , and such the positions assumed // by the two states in respect to them . The inquiry we have proposed , leads us to examine the issue thus formed . The question is purely a legal one ; but under the peculiar circumstances of this controversy , we offer no apology for presenting in the pages of the New Englander a discussion which would otherwise be addressed more appropriately , if to any , exclusively to professional readers . We have then to consider : Whether free persons of color in Massachusetts are citizens of Massachusetts within the meaning of the Federal Constitution , Art . IV , Sec. 2 ; and if they are , Whether the law of South Carolina violates in respect to them the guaranty of that article ; and further , Whether that law assumes on the part of South Carolina a power inconsistent with the exclusive power of Congress to regulate commerce . The first question requires us to determine the legal meaning and application of the term citizen . Citizenship of a state , manifestly implies a relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen as parties , and defined by a designation of the persons who stand in that relation , and by a statement of the rights and duties which it essentially involves . As used by writers on natural law , the term designates the status of an individual considered , as a member of the state . It imports , on the part of the citizen , the duty of allegiance and obedience ; and on the part of the state , the correlative duty of protecting its members , by its force and its laws , in the enjoyment of essential fundamental rights . And all free persons , born within the limits of a state , or who , not being native born , have been duly admitted to equality of condition with those who are , are held to be members and citizens of that state , unless expressly excluded by its municipal laws . In the intercourse of nations , and in the public law which regulates it , the term citizen ' is used with respect to our own and other republican governments wherever subject ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons under the protection of such government , as owing allegiance to it . For example , the eighth article of the treaty of 1783 stipulates that " the navigation of the river Mississippi shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States . " Under such a usage , in the numerous cases of prize and capture with which , up to the close of the last war , the Federal Courts were crowded , the rights of parties in suit , under the law of nations , depended on their citizenship , and that on their allegiance . In this manner this term is used in the Constitution of the United States ; in every instance , it is believed , unless the one in dispute furnishes an exception . Thus the article defining the judicial power , declares that it shall extend " to controversies between a state , or citizens thereof , and foreign states , citizens or subjects . " In all cases arising under this clause , the character of an individual , as citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is his allegiance ; if due to a foreign state , it constitutes him a citizen or subject of that state ; if due to the United States , it constitutes a citizen of the United States , and of his particular state . And so , too , in other clauses of the same article ; it has been settled by repeated decisions that the term " citizen of a state " includes all persons " resident or domiciled in a particular state , being at the same time citizens of the United States ; *** which latter qualification again , as already stated , depends on allegiance to the United States , by // birth or naturalization . The expression citizen of the United States ' occurs in the clauses prescribing qualifications for Representatives , for Senators , and for President . In the latter , the term natural born citizen ' is used , and excludes all persons owing allegiance by birth to foreign states ; in the other cases , the word citizen ' is used without the adjective , and excludes persons owing allegiance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions in the convention furnish no indication that there was any other distinction present in the minds of its members . The word citizen , therefore , distinguishes those who are under the allegiance of one government , from those who are under the allegiance of another . As between distinct states , it is coi*xtensive with subject ; but unlike that term , it imports something more than simple subjection . Wherever used , it implies that the individual is not merely under , but of the state , and in that relation is entitled , as against the state , to the possession of certain rights . And the question which we have now to answer , in order to complete our definition of American citizenship , is , what , under our institutions , are the rights essential to that relation ? ' For , though deducible , so far as they are essential , from the principles of natural reason , as belonging of right to all men under whatever government , they can exist as legal rights , distinctive of citizens , in any particular state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its internal or municipal laws . In arbitrary governments , the rights of the state as against the individual , are not only the principal but the only objects of legal contemplation ; and in most of the European states , even the best governed of them , the correlative rights of the individual find their recognition , not in laws or constitutions , but at best in theories of political philosophy , which may or may not have an influence in producing a just administration . We are fortunate in living under a system of laws whose history for ages has been marked by a series of successful struggles to establish , on the basis of law , the rights of the individual as against the state . That important part of our legislation is of older date than our independence ; it has descended to us as the richest inheritance which , with the common law , we have received from our father-land . The rights it protects were not first acquired , but successfully vindicated , by our Revolution . We claimed them , under the provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Habeas Corpus act , of the Revolutionary Bill of Rights , and of the Act of Settlement , and under the guaranties of our Colonial charters , as the rights of free-born British subjects ; the very same provisions , transferred to our constitutions and bills of rights , and enlarged to comprehend the great principles of religious as well as civil liberty , now assert and establish the essential rights of American citizens . They declare that the very end and purpose for which the state exists , is to protect the citizens , by its force , its laws , and its tribunals , in those essential rights , in the exercise of which he manifests his individual existence ; in his rights of conscience , his rights of person , and his rights of property . The rights thus asserted , we have said , are distinctive of citizens . The simple fact that the law which declares them is expressly intended to define the rights of individuals considered as members of the state , is in itself decisive on this capital point . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , member of a state . ' " The citizens , " says Vattel , " are the members of the state . " The words civis ' and civitas , ' correlative in form , // stand also for ideas which are in their nature correlative . And their mutual relation is something beyond that of individuals to an aggregate or mass . The citizens are the primary elements upon which the state , an ideal , but distinct and organized body , exercising sovereign powers , is , by free and mutual recognition , constituted . They are the persons by whom , and for whom , the state exists . The recognition of rightful authority in the state , is the essence of the citizen 's allegiance . The recognition by the state , in word or deed , of the origin and end of its authority , as from and for the citizen , establishes his claims upon it , and so defines his legal and distiactive rights . And we say here too , his distinctive rights ; since there may in fact be persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises an arbitrary and self-assumed power , limited only by its own will , and against natural right ; such are slaves ; and there may and must be persons , without its territorial limits , external to it and not members in it , and having no natural right to put themselves in that relation and to claim a participation in its privileges . Unless , therefore , words are more important than things , that part of our fundamental law which declares the rights of individuals , considered as members of the state , defines the essential and distinctive rights of citizens , even if that particular word is not once used in such declaration . But that it is actually used , and for that specific purpose , is indicated by such articles as the following The preamble to the constitution of Massachusetts declares , that the body politic is formed by " a social compact , by which the whole people covenants with each citizen , and each citizen with the whole people , that all shall be governed by the same laws for the common good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representatives of the people of the state in convention assembled , to secure to all the citizens thereof , the right of life , liberty , and property , and of pursuing happiness , do ordain and establish , " &amp;c . The constitution of New York , Art . VII , Sec. 1 , declares , that " No member of this state shall be disfranchised , or deprived of any rights or privileges secured to any citizen thereof , unless by the law of the land , or the judgment of his peers. *** The bill of rights of New Hampshire , Art . XIV , declares that " Every citizen of this state ought to find a certain remedy , by having recourse to the laws , for all wrongs or injuries which he may receive , in person , property , or character . He ought to obtain right and justice freely , without being obliged to purchase it , - completely , and without any denial ,  --  promptly , and without any delay ; conformably to the laws . " * That of Massachusetts contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this commonwealth ' is used instead of citizen of this state . ' Nearly all the state constitutions declare , that " Every citizen may freely write , speak , and publish his sentiments on all subjects , being responsible for the abuse of that privilege . " * These articles are borrowed substantially from the famous twenty-ninth chapter of Magna Charta , which Blackstone calls " the foundation of the liberty of Englishmen . " It is , being interpreted , in these words : " No free man ( liber homo ) shall be taken , or imprisoned , or disseised of his freehold , or privileges , ( libertatibus , ) or free customs , or be outlawed , or exiled , or in any manner destroyed , neither will we pass upon him , nor condemn him , unless by the lawful judgment of his peers , or by the law of the land . To no man will we sell , to no man deny , or delay , right orjustice . " This guaranty , in some form or other , enters into the fundamentat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . The expression hiber homo ' has been variously rendered by the words freeman , citizen , subject , member of the community , person , and man . In the Southern constitutions , for obvious reasons , the term freeman ' has been generally preferred .. // By the constitution of Alabama , Art . I , Sec. 27 , " Emigration from this state shall not be prohibited , nor shall any citizen be exited . " There is no force in the objection , that these are asserted as the rights of men , of human beings , and not of citizens . They are most truly the rights of men ; but nevertheless of men under government ; and the declaration of them has force as law only against the particular government whose laws declare them . Our laws declare that they are rights which all men ought to enjoy , and which our citizens shall enjoy . It may be further said , though the objection has been in substance anticipated , that the possession of such rights is not distinctive of citizens , inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dictates of courtesy towards friendly nations , of a wise and liberal policy , and , in the absence of especial cause taking them out of that category , of natural reason and justice , we in some measure do ; but by no means as matter of unqualified right . In common with all other nations , we assert the prerogative , belonging to us as a distinct community , and essential to our national sovereignty , of admitting to our territories or excluding from them , at our sole discretion , foreigners , the subjects or citizens of other states . We determine at what point of time , if at all , and upon what conditions , they shall acquire the right to be considered members of the state . Up to that point , their enjoyment of natural personal rights is limited by conflict with the perfect rights of the state and its proper members ; of the extent of which conflict , and of its limiting effect , the state itself is from the nature of the case the sole judge ; its sovereign powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by virtue of which their members may have acquired rights recognized by the natural or conven tional law of nationsA* As a matter of fact , our treatment of aliens has been marked by a liberality of which history has furnished few examples . Yet even here , most if not all of our states have at some period of their history found it necessary to exercise their acknowledged power of putting aliens under a different law from that which governs their own citizens . In many of them , the common law restriction as to the power of holding real estate is in some modified form to this day continued.t And in case of a war , the subjects by birth of a hostile power , not being naturalized , might be compelled to quit the United States , or if permitted to remain , to comply with such requirements as the policy of the nation might dictate . But against all such exercise of discretionary power , our bills of rights protect and secure , distinctively , the rights of citizens . Furthermore , the rights thus asserted are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of their allegiance . For the fact , as it exists in our law , is not more clearly recognized than the reason of the fact . The doctrine of allegiance and its incidents , though it has come to us as positive law from the mother country , is not a mere relic of English feudalism ; in all that is essential , it only affirms and adopts the principles which enlightened reason discovers in the unwritten code of nature . And both agree in declaring , that the duty of protection on the part of the government in respect of fundamental rights , and of allegiance and obedience on the part of the subject ,  - -  obedience especially to the laws defining his active duties to the state , in the way of service and contribu * It may be observed , that in making these statements we have omitted to notice , since it is not necessary to our main purpose , the divisum imperium between the general and state governments .

Our inquiries , therefore , conducted through the several departments of natural and international law , the law and practice under the Constitution , and the municipal law of the states , lead to the conclusion , that the rights and duties which distinguish the status of the citizen , appertain to all free persons born in a state , and so owing allegiance by birth to the state and the United States ; - unless indeed we venture on the desperate alternative of calling in question that cardinal doctrine of the natural and the common law , the doctrine of natural allegiance . In a somewhat noted case in this state , * involving the question whether free blacks are citizens , it was urged , apparently to show that the doctrine of allegiance , and of course citizenship , by birth , was not universal ; that slaves and Indians , though born in our territories , are confessedly not citizens . The exception , if it can be called one , is only apparent . It is such an exception as is said to prove the rule ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails , and no where else . The slave , it is universally conceded , is not and can not be a member of the state . lie is a mere appendage to a member . Deprived , by the mere will and force of the state , of essential personal rights , he is by his condition legally incapable of allegiance , as of any other personal duty . Even obedience is not to him a duty , but a necessity . Under no theory of government does his subjection to the state depend upon any consent of his own , express or implied ; unless it can be implied from unresisting submission to irresistible power . The laws which determine his relation to the state are to him simply commands , as much so as the fiat of his or his ancestor 's conqueror , whose mere will and force , subverting his own , first consigned him to a distant servitude. * A person in such condition , though born within the territorial limits of a state , is to that ideal body a thing altogether foreign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not members of our states .

The master perhaps has nothing more ; but the laws can not give him that right , without asserting , in the state itself ; an arhitrary and absolute power over the slave . That power may he very mildly and humanely exercised , but it is there , and practically asserted , in the enlightened and Christian state , as fully as in the veriest despot . Its actual exercise , being discretionary , by no means limits its potential exercise . Under the Federal Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an existing fact under state laws . To the United States , considered as a distinct sovereignty , acting directly upon all persons within its limits , the slave , in common with all others , sustains only a personal relation .

( See remark of Chancellor Kent hereafter quoted at page 426 . ) To this residuary right we may refer the power claimed for the United States , in a case of the last nccessity , as in the perils of war , to emancipate slaves and employ them in its armies .

It must be observed , that in the various kinds of legal usage to which we have appealed , to determine what is involved in the word citizen , the nature of the case requires scrupulous accuracy in the use of that term . For in every instance it is possible , and in many the fact is of constant occurrence , that legal rights , litigated between parties , may depend on the construction to be given to it . And obviously , it is only such a usage that can determine its legal force and application . The essence of the status of citizenship consists in the rights and duties it involves . What these are , mere dictionary authority can not decide . Popular usage has given to the term in question various meanings more or less extensive ; and we should seek in vain to derive from these any definite , safe , or consistent conclusions as to its meaning and effect in law . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term is used with little regard to strict accuracy . But it may be observed , that in such cases , legal accuracy is not requisite , and is not professed. rfh , js , the constitution of Pennsylvania , Art . I , Sec. 2 , provides , that " The representatives shall be chosen annually by the citizens of Philadelphia and of the respective counties . " In this case , and in a few others of like character , the term is used in a loose sense to distinguish the body of ' actual voters . It is merely a convenient designation , borrowed from popular usage , of a particular class of persons , whose rights as such do not however depend upon the use of that term , but upon the possession of certain known qualifications , expressly pointed out by the law . Nor was it ever supposed that these are the only persons in Pennsylvania who can sue as citizens of that state in the Federal Courts , or who are protected by the guaranty of the article in discussion . We conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the law , depend upon the use of the term citizen ,  --  whether in the law of nations , as received and applied in this country , in treaties , in the Constitution of the United States , in the practice of the Federal Courts , or in the constitutions and bills of rights of the states ,  --  it applies to all persons , who , being born under the jurisdiction of a state or the United States , or having been duly naturalized , owe allegiance and its incidents according to the doctrine of the common law . We state this broad proposition , declaring what we conceive to be the legal application of the term , with entire confidence , and challenge the production of an instance , in the whole range of law to which it refers , in which it has a different use , unless the contested clause in the Constitution furnishes such an instance . But an exception to a usage so uniform and universal , is not to be taken for granted without the most positive and convincing proof , establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the necessity for it , by evidence at least as decisive as that which establishes the general rule . We know of but two attempts , in any reported cases , to define and apply the term in a different way ; and we propose now to examine the reasoning upon which the judgments in those cases , that free persons of color were not citizens within the meaning of the contested clause , were respectively based . The first arose in Kentucky , and was decided by the Court of Appeals in that state in the year 1823. * We quote nearly the whole opinion of the court : - " The term citizen is derived from the Latin word civis , and significs in // its primary sense one who is vested with the freedom and privileges of a city . " " If we go back to Rome , whence the term citizen had its origin , we shall find in the illustrious period of her republic , that citizens were the highest class of subjects to whom the jus civitatis belonged , and that the jus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all rights and privileges , civil , political , and religious . " " At an early period after the subversion of the Roman empire , when civilization had begun again to progress , the cities in every part of B orope , either by usurpation or concession from their sovereigns , obtained extraordinary privileges in addition to those which were common to the other subjects of their respective countries ; and one who was invested with these extraordinary privileges , whether he was an inhabitant of the city or not , or whether he was born in it or not , was deemed a citizen . " " When the term came to be applied to the inhabitants of a state , it necessarily carried with it the same signification with respect to the privileges of the state ; and it is in this sense that the term is believed to be generally if not universally understood in the United States . This , indeed , evidently appears to be the sense in which the term is used in the clause of the Constitution under consideration ; for the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object intended to be secured to the citizens of each state in every other , plainly import , according to the best usages of our language , something more than the ordinary rights of personal security and property , which , by the courtesy of all civilized nations , are extended to the citizens or subjects of other countries while they reside among them . No one can , therefore , in the correct sense of the term , be a citizen of the state who is not entitled , upon the terms prescribed by the institutions of the state , to all the rights and privileges conferred by those institutions upon the highest class of society . " Now we do very much doubt whether the whole compass of our law furnishes an instance in which the term citizen can be proved to have the meaning here given to it . It has sometimes a larger , sometimes a more limited meaning , but never , to our knowledge , this meaning . The larger is the signification we have assigned ; the other includes merely the body of legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances in which , beyond all pretense of doubt , the former meaning obtains , in treaties , in constitutions , and in reported cases , may be numbered by thousands ; we have yet to be shown the first in which there is room for a conjecture , that possibly the term may import only the possession of corporate privileges , after the manner in which a person is said to acquire the freedom of a city . And yet , " it is believed that this is the sense in which the term is generally if not universally understood in the United States ! " Taken as a statement of a fact , it has no shadow of foundation ; taken as an analogy , to illustrate the general statement , it must go for what it is worth . But it is by no means true that the term has been introduced into our law by any such historical progress . That it has been so used as is here stated , is not questioned ; t and particularly to distinguish a more favored , notof * Penn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ( eridinly mistaken in supposing that the tins was hy the Roman law , always and necessarily entitled to the possession ( if all rights and privile*es , civil , political and r l*inus Tho.e who were so entitled were undoubtedly called , ser i*% , the citizens , as they are sometimes wit Ii us , but there were persons , excluded fioin the suifra. glum and ihe honorer , whe were aevertheless cives , though ci as not optimo jure . ' This fact is clearly stated by Savigriy , who was called by Mr. Legare , ( 2 Howard 's U. S. Rep. 522 , ) " ihe greatest // course the most favored , class of persons in aristocratic republics ; upon which usage is based the idea of citizenship , which we find in some of the older treatises on natural and politic law. * Modern authorities on these subjects , such as Montesquieu , Vattel , and iRutherforth , taking a more correct and liberal view of the essential relations of the individual to the state , have used the word citizen ' as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as including , in general , all persons in free condition , under its proper power and protection . From them we borrowed it , when we threw off the yoke of Great Britain , and have ever since used it instead of the term subject , as being , in the language of Chancellor Kent , t " more appropriate to republican freemen. ** But further , and more positively , we object to the definition here given , as utterly untenable , and for two sufficient reasons : First . That it excludes persons who confessedly are citizens , within the guaranty of the Constitution , and whom it ought to include . Second . That it includes persons who confessedly are not citizens , and whom it ought accordingly to exclude . First . Women , and all persons under age. , whether male or female , are not entitled to certain rights and privileges , to wit , those of voting and holding office , upon any terms . Yet if South Carolina should pass a law forbidding Massachusetts women to enter that state , or subjecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not imposed on other persons , natives of South Carolina ; or if Connecticut jurist of our day , " and who is cer inJy the highest modern authority in Roman political law . ( See Dict . Gr. and Rom . Antiq. , Art . CsviTAs , and authorities there cited ; Ani . edit . by Dr. Anthon , 1843 . ) Aristotle 's Politics , Lib . HI , Cap . 1 . Puffendorf 's Law of Nature and Nations , 13 . VII , Chap . 2 , Sec. 20. should prohibit young men , natives of South Carolina and under twenty one years of age , from coming into the state with the purpose of seeking admission to Yale College , no one would hesitate to say that such enactments would be in violation of rights guarantied to those persons as citizens under the Constitution . This objection is thus met by the Kentucky judges : - " It is true that women and children do not possess personally those rights and privileges in any state in the Union ; but they are generally dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " - Through whom , then , does the single woman , of full age , and completely sui juris , enjoy this benefit ? Or the women and children whose kinsmen are not voters ? Or the nulliusJilius ? Persons of this description are not entitled to enjoy , and do not enjoy , political privileges , in any manner , whether in person or by proxy , nor on any terms . And such cases disclose the impossibility of making the possession of such privileges the test ofcitizenship. - It is further said : " It is a rule of common law as well as of common sense , that females and infants should in this respect partake of the quality of those adult males who belong to the same class and condition in society , and of course they will or will not be citizens according as the adult males of the same class are or are not . " -A difficult test of citizenship to be applied in some of the states ; for in Connecticut at least it is understood that the law knows no difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possession of civil rights . But we waive this point. - If the question at issue were merely the appropriateness of a name , we certainly might " call them citizens or not , " just as we might call them Yahoos or not , " aceordino ' as the adult males of the same class were or were not . " But we question whether it is really the doctrine of // the common law that women enjoy essential rights because they happen to be the wives or daughters of men that do . Women born in this country , though of parents who are aliens , acquire and hold real estate , pursue their remedies in court , and claim and receive in every respect the protection of equal laws , in their own right as members of the state , owing allegiance to it by birth , and contributing to its support by the payment of such taxes as its laws may impose . So too in England . And being thus entitled , suo jure , to such privileges , they enjoy them personally , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and are wronged by being deprived of them , though their fathers and husbands are no ways hindered or restricted in the enjoyment of theirs . In like manner , a woman excluded from political privileges , is none the less excluded though all her male kindred vote and hold office . Numberless questions arise , very easy to ask and very difficult to answer , on the supposition that the citiz@nship of women and children depends upon that of the adult males of the same class . Concede that a free man of color is not a citizen , and suppose a white woman , a foundling perhaps , whose parentage has never become known , chooses to marry him ; she may lose caste , but does she lose citizenship , with her quasienjoyment of political rights and all ? It would seem to follow that a native woman marrying an alien is no longer a citizen , and that an alien woman marrying a natural born citizen acquires rights of citizenship ; yet it has been expressly decided that her status as alien or citizen is noways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is , citizenship depends on a relation to the state , and not to other persons ; on a personal , immediate possession of its attributes ; if the enjoyment of political as well as civil rights is one of these , as the definition given would make it , then those who are not themselves entitled to such enjoyment , are themselves no citizens . Women and children , then , are not citizens within the definition of the Kentucky court ; but they nevertheless are citizens , beyond all question , within the meaning of the Constitution . Furthermore , the definition excludes naturalized citizens , who may not be entitled to rights of suffrage and eligibility on equal terms with natural born citizens . A person naturalized under the law of Congress , and domiciled in any state , becomes immediately a citizen of that state ; is entitled to sue as such in the Federal Courts , to hold real estate in any state in the Union , and to claim the benefit of the article now in discussion ; yet if he goes to Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being elected governor ; and if he happens to be domiciled in Rhode Island , he can not vote noi* hold office on the same terms as the most favored class of society , but only on a property qualification , not required of natural born citizens under similar circumstances . And it is as clearly within the competency of any state entirely to exclude by its constitution citizens who are not native born from the exercise of the elective franchise , as it is to restrict them in it by requiring two , five , twenty one , or a hundred years residence . Moreover , if this definition be correct , a person naturalized nez'er becomes a citizen of the United States , though Congress has done its best to make him one ; for he is not entitled to the right and privilege of being a Senator or Representative in Congress on the same terms as a more favor d class , nor to the right and privilege of being President or Vice President on any terms . Persons so restricted and excluded certainly are not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' U. S. Reports , 242. // equal terms , to all the rights and privileges conferred by law upon the highest class of society ; " they are not , therefore , citizens within the definition of the Kentucky court ; nevertheless , they are undoubtedly citizens within the meaning of the Constitution . Again . By the constitution of Connecticut , * it is declared that " The privileges of an elector shall be forfeited by conviction of bribery , forgery , duelling , " &amp;c. , " or other crimes for which an infamous punishment may be inflicted by the laws of the state . " And there are similar provisions in other states . Persons of this description are absolutely deprived of all political rights ; yet they are beyond question still citizens of Connecticut ; and if , one of them going to New York , that state should , by a special law , exclude him from her courts , or impose extra taxes on his property , or refuse to perfect his title to land by forbiding the recording of his deeds , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every undoubted citizen of Connecticut . Such persons , therefore , are not entitled to all the rights and privileges enjoyed by the most favored class of society ; they are not citizens , if the definition contended for be correct : but they are citizens within the guaranty of the Constitution . On the other hand , the constitution of North Carolina , t before its revision in 1835 , admitted aliens to the exercise of political rights on the same terms as any other persons coming into the state from abroad ; forbade all restrictions upon their right to acquire and hold real estate and other property , and expressly declared that after one year 's residence and taking the oath of allegiance , they should be in all respects free citizens4 Their rights as such , therefore , became vested and absolute the moment they brought themselves within this description . From that moment , they were " entitled to all the rights and privileges conferred by law upon the highest class of society . " They were therefore citizens , according to the Kentucky decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North Carolina , could hold lands in Connecticut only upon the terms which the law of the state prescribes in the case of aliens . Nor could he avail himself of the guaranty of the clause in question to defeat the application of that law to his case , as he could do if he were r*ally a citizen of North Carolina . That is , he is not a citizen within the meaning of the Constitution . This test of citizenship then fails , by reason both of defect and excess . Applied through our whole population , it would produce some singular results . Including , prior to the year 1835 , some thousands who were not citizens , and excluding to thts day about ten millions out of the fourteen who are , it does not quite satisfy the inquirer who aspires to some slight degree of accuracy . And such must be the fate of any definition framed with a view to exclude the free blacks from the status it describes . It would task the ingenuity of any , even of a Philadelphia lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in the man deprived of political rights for crime , and leave out the man deprived of them for color . The truth is , the latter can be excluded , not by describing his status , but only by describiiig him . You must say , " Every person possesing such and such legal attributes is a citizen ; - unless his cuticle is blackish. , in which case he is not a citizen . " And then the first difficulty will be to prove the rule , and the next , to prove the exception . The other case to which we alluded , as ascribing to the term citi * Art . VI , See , . 3 . Adopted 1776 . See Articles 5 , 6 , 7 , S and 15. * Art . 40. // zen in the article in question a meaning different from its ordinary legal meaning , is one decided in Tennessee in the year 1838. # In that ease the court said , " The citizens spoken of are those entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privileges of citizens , and consequently were not intended to be included when this word was used in the Constitution . " And further , " The meaning of the language is , that no privilege enjoyed by , or immunity allowed to , the most favored class of citizens in said state , shall be withheld from a citizen of any other state . " - So far as this language is intended to declare the general meaning and effect of the article in the Constitution , it must be examined in another place . Taken as a definition of the citizenship intended therein , it means one of two things : either the citizens spoken of are those entitled to all the privileges and immunities enjoyed by any persons whatever who are citizens ; ' or else , they are those entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizenship . ' If the former be meant , it is open to all the objections already made to the definition in the Kentucky case ; if the latter , it is as if we should say , the triangles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Euclid , are those possessing all the properties of triangles . ' That is , the term as here used includes all citizens whatsoever , whether more or less favored in respect to privileges not essential to that character . We know of but one other reported case in which the question has been raised , whether free persons of color are citizens or not , within the meaning of the constitutional guaranty ; which is the case in this state already alluded to.t That case arose under a law making it a penal offense to instruct , in any school in this state , colored persons not inhabitants of the state , without the previous consent in writing of the selectmen of the town in which such school was situated . Upon the trial of Miss Cran* dalI , who was charged with violating this law , she was defended on the ground that the law was void , as prohibiting the exercise of a fundamental right , guarantied to the persons she had instructed , as citizens of the states in which they respectively belonged . Judge Daggett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of the Constitution . Miss Crandall was convicted , and the case went up to the Supreme Court of the state , where it was fully argued but a defect in the legal proceedings made it unnecessary for the Court to examine the constitutional question . It may not be improper , however , to say , that it is well understood at the bar , that , had it been necessary to decide the point , the charge of the Judge at the jury trial would have been overruled , perhaps by a unanimous Court , at most with the single dissent of Judge Daggett . Any opinion of that eminent Judge is certainly entitled to high respect ; but he does not appear , in that case , to have examined the great question at issue with his usual care ; and his reasons for his judgment , the most important of which we have already quoted , were abundantly shown by he distinguished counsel before the Court of Errors , Judge Goddard and Gov . Ellsworth , to be quite inadequate to sustain his conclusions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon afterwards repealed . And now , in opposition to all such attempts to restrict and narrow in this particular case what we have shown to be the general usage of the disputed term , we not merely urge the negative objection , that they are not sustained by proof , but we under State vs . Claiborne , 1 Meigs , 331-340. t Miss Crandalls case , 10 Conn. 340. // take to show , by positive and independent evidence , that free persons of color , were directly , and we might almost say expressly , within the purview of this guaranty , when it was originally given . The article of the Constitution which embodies it , was adopted , with no change of purpose , from the fourth of the Articles of Confederation , which is in these words. - " The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different states in this union , the free inhabitants of each of these states , paupers , vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted , shall be entitled to all privileges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of each state shall have free ingress and egress to and from any other state , and shall enjoy therein all privileges of trade and commerce , subject only to the same duties , impositions , and restrictions as the inhabitants there respectively , provided such restrictions shall not extend so far as to prevent the removal of property imported into any state , to any other state of which the owner is an inhab. itant ; " &amp;c . The article in the Constitution is , " The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . " It will be seen that only the general and governing clause of the guaranty has been retained , omitting those containing specific precautions . Now whatever may be said of the article in its present form , there is no mistaking its original comprehensiveness . More general words could not have been used , to denote that each state was making that important covenant , not in behalf of any favored class , but of its whole population . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property , conveying no distinction of black or white , applied to free persons of color , would seem too plain for proof . But yet there is proof . For the fact that four classes of persons , to wit , slaves , paupers , vagabonds , and fugitives from justice , are cx industria excepted , is , by all rational rules of construction , conclusive as to the fact that no others were intended to be excepted . The further and important fact that an attempt was made to except also , in express terms , the free colored inhabitants , and failed , puts the matter beyond all possible doubt . For , when the Articles of Confederation , having been submitted to the state legislatures , were before the Congress for final action , the delegation from South Carolina , under instructions from that state , moved to amend the clause now cited , by inserting the word white , so as , to read the free white inhabitants , ' &amp;c. , and the amendment was REJEcTED , by a decisive vote. * Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the privileges and immunities of citizens . Has that guaranty been withdrawn ? At first sight , it would seem tobe a suspicious circumstance , that in the article as it now stands , the word citizens ' is substituted for free inhabitants . ' We can easily imagine how a plausible and quite natural , but very harmless speculation , might be built up on this basis . The change was obviously made in order to exclude some class of free inhabitants who were not citizens , but who had become entitled , under the provisions of the former article , to all the privileges of citizens . And what class should that be , if not that inferior and degraded caste which South Carolina was so anxious to put in the category of slaves , paupers , vagabonds and fugitives from justice , and which from that day to this has been found so notoriously " dangerous to her peace ? " And then might rise up , like a great rock in a // weary land , such a sentence as this , from the Federalist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those who come under the dcnomination of free inhabitants of a state , though not citizens of such state , are entitled in every other state to the privileges of free citizens in the latter . " But alas ! the great rock is only an optical illusion . The inhabitants not citizens ' of which Mr. Madison was speaking , were aliens ! They were persons who not being by birth inhabitants , any state might have allowed to become inhabitants . " The framers of the original article , in their zeal for making the terms of the mutual grant large enough , had made them too large . They were too large , simply as including under the word inhabitants , ' aliens resident but not naturalized ; who , though confessedly not citizens , were thus declared to be entitled to the rights of citizens . It is unnecessary to dwell on the inconveniences , as detailed by Mr. Madison , which might have arisen from this oversight . To guard against any possible evils from that source , and to simplify the expression by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' free citizens , ' and the people , ' all obviously referring to the same persons , the change in question was made . To complete the remedy , the exclusive power of naturalizing foreigners was given to Congress ; a measure " by which , " says Mr. Madison , " provision is made against these and all other consequences , proceeding from the defect of the Confederation upon this head ; " a measure , nevertheless , which could possibly affect no class of persons but aliens . These facts we gather , fairly as we thiuk , from the number of the Federalist which we have quoted ; the journals of the Convention , the Madison Papers , and so far as we know , the debates in the state conventions , disclose no * No. 40. other reason for the change of lan .. guage . These are clearly sufficient ; if any thing more was intended , the evidence of the fact is no where to be found ; and it is incredible , that with the diversity of views in the Federal Convention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government it formed encountered in every part of the country , assailing even its minutest features , any change in the operation of an article which Mr. Hamilton calls " the fundamental basis of the Constitution , " as it had been of the Confederacy , could have been effected in silence in the Convention , and adopted through out the country without a syllable of comment . The free inhabitants , ' therefore , of 1778 , aliens excepted , were the citizens ' of 87 . But the three cases to which we have attended , do not exhaust the legal authorities upon the construction of the article . It was decided in Missouri , hy Judge Mullanphy , some two or three years ago , that free persons of color are citizens and protected by the constitutional guaranty . We know this only by a newspaper notice of the trial and decision which we remember to have seen at the time ; and it has since been stated that the case was appealed to the highest state court , and the decision affirmed ; but we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume which would contain it has not yet appeared , or at least not in the eastern market . Mr. Hamilton , in the eightieth number of the Federalist , speaks of the word citizen in this clause , and the same word in the clause giving jurisdiction to the United States Courts in cases between citizens of different states , ' as precisely similar in meaning and application ; justifying such jurisdiction on the ground that it ought to be colixtensive with that guaranty , and competent to enforce its provisions . Now it is ab // solutely impossible , as we conceive , under the decisions upon this clause , to shut out of the Federal Courts a free colored man who should bring a suit there in the usual form against a citizen of a different state . And we believe no lawyer would think of advising a client , so sued by a colored man , to resist his action , if he had no other defense than a plea to the jurisdiction , on the ground that the plaintiff was not , as he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he resides . The question , so far as we know , has never been raised , and in the usual course of private litigation probably never would be ; it might be , very easily , if any thing would be gained by a decision of it ; and that , too , without going to South Carolina for the purpose , or incurring the ban of the empire either from its chivalry ' or its sovereignty . ' Judge Story expresses himself in a similar manner in repeated instances throughout that part of his Commentaries , in which he speaks of the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts. * In the Kentucky case which we have considered , the court was divided in opinion , two against one . rrhe opinion of Judge Mills , dissenting , clearly and ably exposes many of the perplexities which must arise from applying the definition of citizenship given by the majority of the court . We quote his own , as commending itself at once to our ideas of reason and right , and as confirming and strongly fortifying every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , is one who owes to the government allegiance , service , and money by way of taxation , and to whom the government in turn guaranties liberty of conscience and person , the right of acquiring and possessing property , of marriage and the social relations , of suit and defense , and of security in person , estate , and reputation . To aliens we extend these privileges by courtesy , to others secure them . ' 7* And in further support of our conclusions , we take pleasure in citing the authority of Chancellor Kent . " The privilege of voting , and the legal capacity for office , are not essential to the character of a citizen , for women are citizens without either. - Citizens , under our constitutions and laws , mean free inhabitants , born within the United States , or naturalized under the act of Congress . If a slave born in the United States , be manumitted or otherwise lawfully discharged from bondage , or if a black man be born in the United States , and born free , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of the states respectively deem it expedient to prescribe to free persons of color . " t We hold it , therefore , to be proved that free persons of color are citizens within the general meaning of the term , and can not be excluded from its comprehension in the second section of the fourth article of the Federal Constitution . To show that this is no novel doctrine , we cite the following as a few of the instances in which , either expressly , or by unavoidable implication , they are designated as citizens . 1st . The Act of Congress , passed 1803 , to prevent the importation of certain persons , prohibits the importing of " any negro , mulatto , or other person of color , not being a native , a citizen , or registered seaman of the United States . " 2 Story 's Laws U. S. 886. 2d . The constitution of New York , Art . II , Sec. 1 , gives " colored citizens " a right to vote upon a property qualification ; and by the Revised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , offering to be made voters , are required to swear " that I Littell , 342. * See particularly , Arts . 1654 , 1687 . Comm . Vol . II , 258 , note . // they have been three years citizens . " 3d . In nine of the states in which colored men are not entitled to vote , they are excluded by prefixing to the word citizen , ' in the clause of their constitutions prescribing the qualifications of voters , the word white , ' showing that in the absence of that adjective they would be included ; and in five of the states in which they do vote , they are entitled to the privilege , in common with all others , under the description of citizens . ' 4th . The Act of Virginia , passed Dec. 20th , 1785 , prescribing the qualifications of electors , says , " Every male citizen , ( other than free negroes or mulattoes , ) of this commonwealth . " 5th . On the 11th of April , 1783 , the eighth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charges of war and other expenses should " be defrayed out of a common treasury , which should be supplied by the several states , in proportion to the whole number of white , and other free citizens and inhabitants , of every age , sex , and condition , including those bound to service for a term of years , and three-fifths of all other persons not comprehended in the foregoing definition , except Indians not taxed in each state . " We give the whole , for the sake of its history , as showing the origin of the famous three-fifths clause in our constitution . To show that the expression white and other free citizens , ' was not adopted at random , we find that it appeared in three different forms while the amendment was pending . It was first reported by a committee on the 20th March , as , " in proportion to the number of inhabitants of every age , sex , and condition , except Indians not paying taxes in each state ; " recommitted and reported March 28th , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and adopted in com mittee , April 1st , in the form in which it finally passed . The language of this article was embodied in various propositions submitted to the Federal Convention in 1787. * On the 11th of June , it was moved by Judge Wilson of Pennsylvania , " that the right of suffrage in the lower house , ought to be in proportion to the whole number of white and other free citizens ' and inhabitants , " &amp;c . The mgion was seconded by Mr. Pinckney of South Carolina , who it seemed did not hesitate to admit that there were citizens other than white . ' On the 15th of June , Mr. Patterson of New Jersey , moved " that the requisitions upon the states ought to be in proportion , " &amp;c. as before . The seventh resolution , agreed upon in committee of the whole , June 19th , regulated the suffrage in the lower house in the language already quoted . On the 6th of August , a draft of a constitution was reported , an article in which provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formally accepted , and then with the other articles , referred to a committee of style , by whom the expression was shortened to the form in which it now stands in Art . I , Sec. 2 , of the Constitution , using the single word person , ' instead of white and other free citizens , and in habitants . ' The committee were not authorized and did not profess to make any alteration iii substance . Thus it appears most fully that the CONVENTiON which framed the Constitution , recognized the fact that there were cirizxus OTHER THAN WHITE . ' 6th . The right of free persons of color , as " citizens " of any state , to sue " citizens of other states " in the Federal Courts , as we have already remarked , has never been called in question . 7th . It has been expressly decided // by the Supreme Court of North Carolina , * that free blacks are citizens within the meaning of a general law protecting slave property belonging to citizens of the state . ' And finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1792 , entitled " An Act declaring who shall be deemed citizens of this commonwealth , " &amp;c. enacts " that all free persons horn within the limits of this commonwealth-shall be deemed CiTIZENS of this commonwealth ; " t a declaration of more than local authority , since it was apparently intended to be , as it in fact is , merely in aflirmation of the common law doctrine of allegiance and of course citizenship by birth . There remains one important source of evidence to which we have made but a partial appeal . The inquiry in which we are engaged would he of little moment , if it were to terminate merely in deciding that particular persons are or are not to be designated by a particular name ; it takes all its importance from the rights depending on that decision . Our object thus far has been to prove that whatever those rights may be , so far as they depend on the term citizen ' employed in the guaranty , they are , by th guaranty , secured to free persons of color as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had occasion , in general terms , and by reference to our fundamental laws , to point out those rights . We propose now to show , by facts and arguments independent of the preceding , that the intention and effect of the article in question , as gathered from its history , its language , and judicial decisions upon it , isto protect and secure those very rights ; and in whatever persons , not being aliens to the United States , they may be vested as rights . A well established rule of law and of common sense for interpreting the provisions of a new enactment , directs our inquiries to the old law , the evil , and the remedy . The guaranty , the history and proper construction of which we are now to examine , first became the law of the land under the Articles of Confederation . The articles containing it , in its original and in its present form , we have elsewhere quoted at length . It has always been conceded that with a single exception already explained , the two were identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guard against certain evils which had been experienced before the states confederated . What was , then , the evil in the former condition of things which this covenant was intended to remedy , and what was the remedy which it furnished ? The states before confederating , were separate and complete political bodies , each independent of the others and foreign to them . The members of one were not in that capacity members of any other , and had no legal right , any more than other aliens , to put themselves in that relation . Each state assumed and exercised the right to declare , by laws of its own , framed with exclusive reference to its own interests , what rights strangers should enjoy within its jurisdiction , and to what disabilities they should be subject . The sense of mutual dependence , and the strong pressure of external danger , proved inadequate to prevent , in many instances , the unjust and arbitrary exercise of these soverei * , n powers . Obeying the dictates of a short-sighted and selfish policy , the states shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; each for itself and its citizens , a monopoly in the benefits of their mutual intercourse and dealings . The property of non-residents was burdened with peculiar taxes . The transit trade through the importing states was harassed by vexatious discrimmna * 4 Devereux , 340 . I Laws of Virginia , Richmond , 1792. // tions . The right of suit in courts was extended to inhabitants of other states only on unequal and onerous conditions ; and the collection of debts , by this and other means , made to them difficult and expensive . These evils were aggravated by counter-legislation , working injury to the rights of individuals , and sowing dissension and hostility among neighboring states. * Such were the particular grievances ; but they all had their origin in this-that each state might , and to a greater or less extent did , subject the inhabitants of the others to the civil disabilities of alienage . That is , in short , the old law was that each state had the power to treat the people of the others as aliens ; the evil was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mutual surrender of that power and practice . The obvious operation of such a surrender , as between the states , must have been precisely that of a general and mutual law for instant naturalization . It destroyed at once throughout the confederate states , the legal consequences of separate allegiance , as affecting individual rights . It stopped the operation of state laws based on the alienage of the persons upon whom they acted . It vested in the persons in each state to whose benefit it enured an unconditional right to enter and reside in any other state ; and when there , put them in the same situation as if they had been born there ; bringing them within the protection , as well as the power of the state law . From this simple statement of the general nature of the evil and the general nature of the remedy , we derive , by obvious inference , a single but important proposition , the * This description would perhaps apply to the actual state of things after the Ar . tides of Union were adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of the war . ( See Madison Pa. pers , pp. 711 , 712 , 898 . Story on Const. 1684 . ) The defect then was not in the law itself , but in the means of enforcing it . truth of which we believe to be beyond the reach of denial , question , or cavil . Whoever may have been the persons , in any given state , protected by the mutual convenants , the RIGHTS intended to be secured to such persons in other states , were neither more nor less than those rights to which as strangers they had , under the law of nature and the common law , only a qualified and contingent title , hut to which , if born in the state , they would have had , under the same law , an ABSOLUTE and UNQUALIFIED title . With this general description of the rights intended to be guarantied , we proceed to examine the language in which the guaranty was embodied , with the view to determine , more specifically , the nature and extent of those rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gathered from words of doubtful import . Its language was chosen apparently for the very reason that it set forth , in apt and legal phrase , sanctioned by previous usage and understood by the contracting parties , exactly such a covenant as we have shown they must have intended to make . We wish to call especial attention to the fact , no less interesting as matter of history than important to our present purpose , that the operative words of the original guaranty , were , mutatis fllUtandis , the very words which in our colonial charters secured to our ancestors the essential rights of English freemen . In the former , were guarantied to the free inhabitants of each state , " all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states : " in the latter , were guarantied to the king 's subjects in the colonies , " all liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects in any of his dominions. *** This language had become * See Charters of Conn. , Mass. , R. I. , &amp;c . The word libertie&amp; here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Ante , page 415 , note . ) The true meanfamiliar , // as household words , to the men of the Revolution . Upon it had mainly turned , at least in the colonies which were under charters , the exciting discussions which preceded the separation from the mother country . As to its proper force and effect , there was no doubt then , and there can be none now . The liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects , ' were those essential rights belonging , under the fundamental law of England , to all persons born in the realm and owing free and natural allegiance to the sovereign power therein . They were the rights , the recognized possession of which , as incident to their allegiance and free condition , distinguished the status of such subjects from that of the alien , from that of the subject by conquest , and while villainage lasted , from that of the serf . In other words ,  --  since in England there were no subjects by conquest , and since every subject by birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the meaning of Magna Charta ,  - -  the rights conveyed by the language above quoted were precisely those rights to which strangers to the British state had only a qualified and contingent title , but to which persons born in the rcalm had , by the cardinal doctrines of the common law , an absolute and unqualified title . ' That is to say ,  --  of the two guaranties , the former was designed to have , as we have seen , precisely ing of the term in that and similar instruments , is better expressed , according to more modern usage , by the word privileges , ' which has therefore generally taken its place . For example , in the charter of Connecticut , as published in connection with its laws before and about the time of the Revolution , the side note against the provision we have quoted , is , " guaranties the privileges of natural born subjects . " We might well insist therefore on the completeness of the verbal coincidence , in the two forms of guaranty , if it were ait all necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , as it is , that the one was borrowed from the other . such an effect as it was well understood the latter did have ; in pursuance of which design , the language of the latter , with the single change of natural subject ' into citizen , ' was adopted as the language of the former . Is it possible to add to the proof that the privileges and immunities of free citizens were understood to be identical with the recognized and essential rights of free subjects and free men in England ? These facts , therefore , while they give to our former argument intended to fix the meaning of the term citizen , as used here and elsewhere in the law , the force of demonstration , clearly refer us again , for the further definition of these privileges and immunities , to that important part of our common and constitutional law which declares the rights of individuals considered as members of the state . These rights have been classified on a previous page , as the rights of conscience , of person , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection of which in the citizen the STATE exists , and in the exercise of which lie manifests HIS individual existence ; ' which the state is therefore bound to protect , by its force , its laws , and its tribunals ; ' or in other words , by the exertion of all its powers , legislative , judicial , and executive . In the language of Sir William Blackstone , * " they may be reduced to three primary articles : the right of personal security , the right of personal liberty , and the right of private property ; the preservation of which may be justly said to include the preservation of our civil immunities in their largest and most extensive sense . " In the language of Judge Mills , already quoted , t they consist in " the liberty of person and of conscience , the right of acquiring and possessing property , of marriage and the social relations , of suit and defense in court , and security in * i Comm. 129. t Ante , page 42G. // person , estate and reputation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a case hereafter to be cited , they are " comprehended under the following general heads : protection by the government ; the enjoyment of life and liberty , with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind , and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety ; subject , nevertheless , to such restraints as the government may justly prescribe for the general good of the whole . " Such , therefore , are the privileges and immunities of citizens ; ' and we proceed now to notice , very briefly , the language of the two following clauses in the original article. * Those clauses guarded specially important personal rights and privileges , and rights of property ; by expressly prohibiting any restrictions by the states upon the enjoyrnent of those rights not equally imposed upon their own inhabitants . They were omitted when the article was transferred to the Constitution , simply because they were plainly included within the general guaranty.t It has never been doubted , therefore , that the restraints they imposed on the states are as fully in force now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our present purpose in two particulars : first , as exemplifying the general nature of the rights intended to be protected , and so fortifying the construction we have given to the controlling clnuse ; and second , as marking , in very emphatic language , the evils felt or feared , before the states confederated , from the absence of such restraints upon them as this article imposed , and so confirming our account of its general object and of its intended operation . The states , therefore , intended to secure absolute and unqualified ' protection for " civil immunities , in their largest and most extensive sense . " On the other hand , it was * Ante , page 424. t Federalist , No. 40. plainly not within the scope of their intention to secure , in the same absolute manner , the merely political rights of voting and holding office . If South Carolina should forbid citizens of other states to acquire a title to land within her limits till after ten years actual residence therein , her law to that effect would be clearly unconstitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the whole of that term of residence , the privilege of holding the office of governor , and her right to do so can not be questioned . In like manner , a law of any state confining the right to commence actions in its courts to such persons as had been residents in the state not less than three months , would clearly deny to persons thereby excluded essential privileges of citizenship ; yet there is no state in the Union which does not limit , at the very least to that extent , the right to vote at its elections . Laws imposing such restraints in respect to the rights of suffrage and eligibility , though in force in all the states at the time they confederated , formed no part of the evils which the covenant in question was designed to remedy , and were no ways affected by its adoption . They were based , not on the alienage of the persons upon whom they acted , ' but on the undoubted power of the state over all persons within its limits , whether native or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as might be adapted to the purpose , in respect to their fitness to exercise an important trust .

A person from any one state entering any other must take these laws as he finds them , and will be entitled or not to vote and hold office according as he is or is not within the general description by which they designate the persons to whom // the enjoyment of political rights shall be limited . rro say more , is to say that he is in better condition than if he had been born in the state . In one sense only can he be said to receive absolute and unqualified protection in the enjoyment of such rights . If they are vested in him by the general laws of the state , he can not , any more than a native born citizen , be defeated in their exercise by any other authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such then was the intended and the actual effect of the constitutional guaranty , as we gather it from its history and its language ; TO PROTECT ESSENTIAL RIGHTS a high and important purpose which takes no cognizance of accidental distinctions between the persons possessing such rights , and admits no restrictions which can not be positively proved to have been expressly intended and clearly declared . It is not , however , to be concealed that this exposition , as well as the conclusion which rests upon it , must inevitably fail , if the construction put upon the article by the Tennessee Court* is to stand as law . That remarkable decision made no appeal to history , or to precedent decisions by courts of equal dignity in other states , and by tribunals of high authority under the Federal Constitution . It professed to appeal merely to the internal evidence furnished by the language of the article itself . Yet in the very act of making that appeal , it was found necessary , in order to justify a state law depriving an unfortunate class of persons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words no where to be found in that article . The Constitution declares that " the citizens of each state shall be entitled " to certain privileges in every other ; the court , as we have seen , found it necessary to say that only " the most favored class of citizens , * Ante , page 423. were so entitled . The Constitution guaranties " the privileges and immunities of citizens ; " the court interpreted that language as if it were , " the privileges and immunities of the most favored class of citizens . " We may well ask , therefore , upon what authority it assumed thus to " add to the words written in the book of the prophecy ? " The sources of evidence to which the court did not appeal , and which should reveal the necessity , if any existed , for such an addition , we have examined fully , and as we think , fairly ; and pursuing the method we have proposed , we proceed now to cite two important decisions , sufficient , even without the strong proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the mere weight of judicial authority . The first case arose in Maryland , within a few years after the Constitution was adopted ; a fact which gives it a peculiar value in settling the meaning of both parts of the contested article . Through the whole case , it was conceded that the term citizen ' in that article had as broad a meaning and upplication as in any other part of the Constitution ; and that the privileges and immunities of citizens consisted in " protection to property and person in the same manner in which citizens of the state are protected . " The court said , * " It is agreed that this does not mean the right of holding office , the right of election or of being elected . " - " It means that the citizens of all the states shall have the advantage of acquiring and holding real as well as personal property , and that such property shall be protected and secured by the laws of the state in the same manner as the property of citizens of the state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On appeal to the highest court in the state , it was further // said : * " The object of the Convention in introducing this clause was to invest the citizens of the different states with the general rights of citizens , so that they should he , not foreigners but citizens . " And also , and very emphatically- " The inquiry as to the effect of a law of any state "  --  to determine whether it violates the guaranty of the Constitution or not ,  --  " will be , whether it infringes any civil right , which a man as a member of civil society must enjoy . " In the other case to which we alluded , t one of the most distinguished judges of the U. S. Supreme Court , Judge Washington , uses the following language : " We feel no hesitation in confining these expressions to such privileges and immunities as are in their nature fundamental ; which belong of right to the citizens of all free governments , and which have at all times been enjoyed by the citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehended under the following general heads , " &amp;c4 The judgment in this case , proceeding from the highest tribunal which has yet pronounced upon the meaning of the language in question , till overruled by a superior authority , must be considered as decisive . We base upon it , and upon the facts before dduced , our protest against the attempt to restrict the protection any snore than the possession of such rights to any favored class of citizens . We hold the proof to be complete , that those primary , essential rights , in respect to which the most venerable principles of English law , our own Declaration of Independence , and every state constitution in the land , declare the absolute equality of all men , are the very * Campbell vs . Morris , 3 Harris and MeHenry , 563. t Corfield vs . Corycll , 4 Wash . Cir . C. *ep. 471 . See the passage , ante , P. 431. rights which each state , by her solema covenant with her sister states , was seeking to protect . To protect IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons whose equal right to such protection at her hands was so explicitly acknowledged ? If we are to believe that there were any persons , like that unfortunate class whose rights we would maintain , within the natural scope and reason of so high a purpose , but whom , nevertheless , that purpose did not contemplate , we ask for the express words , in the body of the covenant itself , which directly exclude them from its benefits ; in the absence of such words , we ask for extrinsic evidence , plain and positive , adequate to prove in the contracting parties the common intention to exclude , and at the same time to account for the fact that that common intention was no where manifested in words . Till that evidence is produced , we continue to insist on an inference , founded in reason and justice , and fortified in advance by an array of undeniable facts , showing that the class of persons in question were directly within the purview of the guaranty when it was originally given . There is but one possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been brought . Every attempt to establish a definition of citizenship different from that which we have given , must inevitably fail . Every effort to derive any different conclusion from the history and language of the article itself , must prove equally unavailing . Both branches of our argument converge upon this single result ; to compel those who would exclude the free blacks from the privileges of citizens , ' to deny that that class of persons have any rights which our states hold themselves bound to recognize and protect . Reluctance to state in plain words so odious a proposition , has led to the various attempts which we have noticed to reconcile that purpose of exclusion // with some sort of a meaning of the term citizen , with some sort of construction of the words privileges and immunities of citizens ; ' but every speculation of the kind , and every possible objection to any part of our reasoning or the application of it , falls back upon and resolves itself into a mere ; downright , naked negative . " All this is very true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not hold . They are an inferior , degraded race , and it can not be that they are citizens. ** This prevalent habitual prejudice , for it is nothing more , ensures a welcome reception for arguments in themselves no better than absurdities , and prevents the access to the mind of truths which otherwise no sane man would ever have dreamed of calling in question . Upon such an arbitrary , obstinate negation , direct argument can make but little impression ; but if we are not mistaken , it is pregnant with an affirmation , which needs only to be disclosed to be abhorred . If the free negro is not a citizen , what is he ? If he can not claim protection as an absolute and unqualified right at the hands of the state which holds him in allegiance and subjection , what are his rights , how are they defined and how secured ? We may gather an answer to these grave questions from the language of the court and counsel in the Tennessee case . It was said , arguendo ,  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed usually by tacit consent , sometimes by special enactment , certain specific rights ; but their status and that of the citizen are not the same . " And by the court ; " An emancipated or otherwise free black is not a freeman in the sense of Magna Charta or of our Constitution . " - That is to say , if this language really speaks the law of Tennessee , * a constitutional enactment * Judge Catron , now ofthe U.S. Supreme Court , speaking of the importance of the declaring that " no freeman shall be imprisoned , disseized of his liberties or privileges , outlawed , or in any manner deprived of his life , liberty or property , " does not protect the freeman who happens to be black from any one or all of these acts of tyranny , proceeding from the legislative power . The judges were perfectly correct in deducing from their decision , that the free negro is not a citizen , these abominable consequences . They were perfectly correct in supposing that they could not declare him no citizen , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scope of a fundamental law protecting essential rights . No other language can describe the condition of a person , born in a state but disowned by it as a member . It is a condition in which he is entitled to no rights whatever , and is exposed without remedy or redress to all possible wrongs . For he can not be said to be entitled to rights which he holds merely at sufferance . Whatever they may be , if his title deed is nothing better than tacit consent ' or special enactment , ' they may be swept away at any moment by an open denial or by an equally special and arbitrary act of repeal . It is the very essence of the condition of a natural born citizen , of one who is a member of the state by birth within and under it , that his rights are not derived from the mere will of the state . For the state and the citizen spring at once and together from the ordicontrol which that state exerts through its courts over emancipation by deed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave is an imperfect right until the State , the community of which such person is to become a member , assents to the contract-It is amlopting into the body politic a new member-It is an act of sovereignty , just as much as the naturalization of the foreign subject . The highest act of sovereignty a government can perform , is to adopt a new member with all the privileges of citizenship . " 6 Yerger , // nance of nature , and from this natural relation between them result the essential rights and essential duties of both . The highest and most solemn enactment , even the fundamental , organic law of a state , does not by its proper force as positive law create , but only acknowledges this relation . Such a recognition , implied where it is not expressed , limiting the extent and modifying the exercise of powers otherwise absolute as well as sovereign , is inseparable from the very idea of a free state . Upon it is based that concurrent recognition , by the citizen , of rightful authority above him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which as we have seen is the essence of his free and natural allegiance . The moment these cease to co-exist , the free state and the free citizen or member of it vanish at once and together . The sovereign power , whether administered by one or many , has become a despot , and the citizen a subject , or it may be a slave . And the same result follows whenever that free and mutual recognition ceases to define and characterize the relation between the state in its sovereign capacity and any portion of those who naturally , that is , by birth , would be members in it . The moment the governing power in a state disowns , as to any persons or class of persons , born under its jurisdiction , its essential obligations , assumes to treat them as strangers to the state , or puts their claims upon it on any other basis than that of an absolute , unqualified and original right , growing out of their free and natural allegiance , it subverts in respect to them the natural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them , and reduces them by its mere force to the condition of subjects . Such , undoubtedly , is the condition of the whole colored race in some at least of the slaveholding states . They are under , but not of the state . The authority exercised over them is not regarded as in any sense dependent on their free recognition of it as rightful , or as limited by the inseparable conditions of such a recognition . In the language of a prevalent theory , they are not parties to the social compact in which the state originates , and from which all political power results . The community , distinct from them , in which that ultimate sovereignty inheres , has assumed over them an arbitrary power , competent to do any act or make any law which may subserve its separate and peculiar policy and interests ; and will permit no declaration of rights to restrain , beyond the limits of its own discretion , the actual exercise of that power . And we say the same thing , with regard to all the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free persons of color are no where citizens of the United States , or of any state . The assertion means this , or it has no meaning at all . No analysis can be given of the essential relations between citizen and state , under our theory of government , that will not lead , directly and inevitably , to precisely these results . Let us attend to some of these more in detail , and see whether it was not truly said , that they need only to be exposed to be abhorred . In affirming it to be the law of the land that no free negro is a citizen , we say , substantially , that each state has power , as against its free colored population , to restrain , in any manner and to any extent whatsoever , their enjoyment of the rights of person and property ; as for instance , By withholding from them the privileges of education , making it a crime to instruct them By limiting the accumulation of property in their hands , and preventing their acquiring a right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code , creating peculiar crimes and imposing peculiar punishments ; // By restraining their equal right of resort to courts of justice , and depriving them of the established muniments of individual liberty ,  - -  the right of trial by jury , and the privilege of the writ of habeas cor-pus ; By putting in a state of outlawry , or by banishing from its territories , any or all of them ; or finally , By reducing them into absolute slavery for life . Laws inflicting on the free blacks many and even the most gross of these outrages , and expressing the settled policy of the state towards them , disgrace the statute books of more than one of the slaveholding states ; laws obviously based on an assumption of power as arbitrary as that which actually enslaves their brethren who are in bondage . Such is the unhappy condition of the men whom a state , by a high manifestation of sovereign will , binding all the ministers of its power , executive , judicial and legislative , excommunicates from membership in it . Persons in this condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as objects of ownership , are said with peculiar propriety not to be freemen within the meaning of a fundamental law , declaring essential rights , and gu arantying their protection against all invasion , whether by individuals or by the state . We recognize , therefore , in the language of the Tennessee Court , that " the word citizen , ' as used in the Constitution , is co-extensive with the word freeman , ' in Magna Charta , " the very doctrine which it has been our aim to establish . We accept the alternative thus proposed , that the free black man is either a FREEMAN and a CITIZEN , or NOT a freeman and NOT a citizen ; and we appeal to all that is sacred and venerable in our history and in our law to decide the issue . We are well aware indeed that prior to our Revolution the whole colored race were to no small cxtent the victims of the same harsh legislation which in most of the colonies oppressed the enslaved portion of it . Especially in the earlier part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose to treat them not only as a degraded and socially inferior , but as a subject race . That purpose was as manifestly changed , except perhaps in the extreme southern states , at the era of the Revolution . The great principles of civil liberty , with which in the progress of that struggle our ancestors became so thoroughly imbued , received at their hands no limited application . In Massachusetts it was judicially declared , that every slave was at once enfranchised by force of the article in her revolutionary constitution recognizing the natural equality of all men in respect to essential rights . Under the influence of similar principles , within ten years after the declaration of independence , measures were taken in six of the remaining states for the abolition of slavery . And this , it must be observed , with no other purpose or expectation than that the persons thus set free were , with their brethren and descendants , to make a part of our permanent population , and to share as matter of right in the efficient and complete protection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced or purchased deportation , which , we can not but think , has , within twenty years past , given such an impulse to the feeling that they are mere " inmates , sojourners in the land , " had not then been suggested. - They fought in our armies ; they were even in some cases emancipated by law in order that they might enlist ; they took the oath of allegiance in common with the whole free population , under laws of the several states , in many instances prefaced with the declaration that allegiance and protection were in their nature reciprocal . The bills of rights adopted by all the states in // organizing their governments , contained no exception for the case of free persons of color ; it was reserved for the wisdom of a later generation to discover that those instruments protected only the natural and inalienable rights of white men . Though depressed to the lowest depths of social degradation by a prejudice against which they could not rise ; though condemned to feel , through long years to come , in their ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servitude ; though regarded in consequence in many of the states as unsafe depositaries of political power , and even as incapable of some of the simplest duties of citizens : their right , absolute and unqualified , to partake in the beneficial agencies of our free governments was never called in question ; and he would have been deemed a bold man who should assert an arbitrary power in any state to deprive of life , liberty or property even the humblest and poorest of that degraded race . But our limits forbid us to pursue this inquiry further , nor does our purpose rcquir'e it . Our argument can only be overthrown by proof , positive and complete , not only that free persons of color when the Constitution was adopted were every where in the anomalous condition we have described , but that this was so notoriously the fact that the word citizen was every where recognized to be inapplicable to them , and whenever used to exclude them . And when we recur to the fact , already well established , that they had been placed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were so designated in public acts of the revolutionary Congress , and even by the Convention which framed the Constitution ; that in six of the states , including Massachusetts and North Carolina , they actually exercised the right of suffrage ; and that in Virginia they had been expressly declared to be citizens by a law in force at that very time ; * we may well pronounce such proof impossible . Our general proposition , therefore , that free persons of color are citizens within the meaning of the Constitution , we believe to be established on a basis that can not be shaken . But after all , the question at the bottom of the controversy is , whether such persons in Massachusetts are citizens of Massachusetts . That in fact they are , under any possible definition of the term not altogether arbitrary-that they have been so , at least from the adoption of the state constitution in 1780 , and that that fact was well understood when the Federal Constitution was framed , can not admit the slightest doubt . But we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Massachusetts . We have , however so far occupied the space at our disposal that we are obliged to be content with the mere statement of a proposition , the demonstrable truth of which would be sufficient , unaided by our previous argument , to vindicate every claim she has made in behalf of her citizens . Whatever be the definition of the term citizen , and whether free persons of color in general are or are not within that definition , we hold that the declaration of Massachusetts , by her constitution and laws , and by special act of her legislature , that such persons within her limits are citiznes of Massachusetts , is conclusive upon all other powers , and upon every tribunal before which the fact may be called in question . In our next number we shall endeavor to establish this proposition , and then proceed with the remaining topics which we have proposed to consider.
