txt THEORIES of human rights , of society , of law and government differ according to the stand-points of their authors . On such subjects men commonly reason back from their own systems , prejudices , commitments , plans , in the present , and endeavor to find the counterparts of these in the original constitution of things ; or moved by some general impulse , they frame a theory which gives perhaps to the most visionary project the sanction of an original law of the Creator . But the well-bal // anced mind , trained under a sound philosophy and a pure religion , will examine these subjects in the light of such fac.ts and principles as are presented in the constitu Lion of man and in the word of God ; a theory so framed will be apt to accord both with reason and the Scriptures . The works placed at the head of this article illustrate these remarks . The first gives us the view of a prominent and zealOtis abolitionist on the rights of society and government ; the second that of an intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third that of an able jurist and a Christian reformer , of Great Britain . The speech of Mr. Phillips , it will be noticed , was delivered on the 3d of August  --  the day observed as a day of national fasting and humiliation . It opens with these words , * Tl1*5 is Zachary Taylor 's fast for the cholera . If the Lord has sent the cholera here for any sin , I suppose the great sin of the American people is slavery . Those who feel guilty of it may fast-I do not . To me , therefore , it is a feast , and not a fast . Let the sinners fast , the saints rejoice . Let the galled jade wince* our withers are unwrting . ' We have nothing to do with the great sin of the American people , for we have spent our lives in protesting against it . Doubtless it would be well for the American people to fast , in sincerity , for this great national iniquity ; but we have other employment more attractive , on this day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But we do not intend to follow Mr. Phillips through his speech . We have given this extract because it defines his position towards the national government and the great commonwealth of these United States ; a position of isolation ,  --  for not only does he stand aloof from the sin of slavery , but also from the whole social compact of these states which he regards as implicated in that sin . " I have no regard , " he says , " for what it called constitutional law . " . . . . " Why lie any longer bound by obligations which are fetters only to us , and weapons to our foes ? Come , fellow citizens , let us rise up , and make clean the statute book of our fathers ! What if this course be unconstitutional ? IVe mean it to be so . We too , are living men , and can make con*titutions as well as our fathers . " It is a little curious to find this zealous and eloquent advocate of human equality-with whom the fundamental doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will scarce suffice-standing side by side with the treacherous and usurping representation of the Hotise of Jlapsburg in setting aside " constitutional law " when it conflicts with his individual purpose , and disregarding the most solemn compacts of the state . Indeed , if we understand him , the state has no right to make a compact with a view to permanence , and any constitution of the // past may be-not amended , not repealed in the prescribed manner-but disregarded altogether , set at nought by a deliberate and avowed violation . Here extremes meet . rplle radical strikes hands with the despot , the champion of the slave and the champion of slavery , Massachusetts and South Carolina , go hand in hand for nullification . Mr. Hurlbut takes quite another view of the rights and functions of government . Viewing man as a gregarious animal , he says , " the state of civilization is the true natural condition of the human race " Man is so constituted " that his true nature can be fully exhibited only " in general society . " . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as necessary to his moral nature as food or atmospheric air is to his physical ; there are many deep demands of his higher nature that can only be answered in the midst of men , and which , unsatisfied , leave such an aching void in his soul , that life becomes a burden out of human society . " " Government emanates from the moral attributes of mankind . It . is a thing of moral necessity and its power and obligation are of a moral kind . In the social state there is aggregated a stim of moral feeling , which in some form will control the actions of individuals . there is a natural necessity for government , arising from the disparity which exists in the powers and faculties of the different individuals of the human family Government is necessary in order that there may be imposed upon the actions of each individual in society , such moral restraint as is felt by a man having the best moral and intellectual endowment and culture . In other words , government ought to prescribe such limits to individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The author then proceeds to apply these principles to the forming of constitutions , to the elective franchise , to rights emanating from the sentiments and affections , the rights of woman , and the right of property . But his standard of rights and of morality is neither the law written on the heart , nor the revealed word of God . That system which " has given to each native desire , to each emotion and faculty of the human mind , a local habitation and a name , ' presents to the philanthropist and statesman the means of defining human rights , and of conforming human legislation to the eternal standard of tru'th and nature . " According to this theory , government must be set up and administered by the craniometer . The anonymous author of the tract on criminal law thus defines the origin of government . " The right of abridging the liberty of our fellow men by the establishment of social law , springs out of the very constitution of our nature , which , having a certain end to accomplish , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any attempt to impede this fulfilltnent . " He denies the doctrine of " the natural liberty of mankind , " because , // " from the time that a child is born into the world its weakness and inexperience necessarily place it under the control of its parents ; " and he traces government from the parent up through the patriarch and the prince to the constitution and the written code . From these several quotations it is plain that the question of the origin and functions of Civil Government is by no means settled . It enters into almost every question of social and political reform , and even into questions of science and of morality . It becomes us therefore as Christian philosophers to give it a thorough and impartial investigation . And recent events-particularly the suppression of a riot in New York , not long ago , by a military force , at a cost of upwards of twenty lives-have given new interest to the question of the right of government over life . has government that right ? If so , whence is it derived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used ? These questions lead at once to the fundamental inquiry as to th&amp;origin and functions of Civil Government . The various theories of civil government may all be reduced to two ; the theory of the social con-tpact , and the theory of divine institution . These we purpose to consider in their order . It is the favorite view of certain political theorists that society exists by virtue of a compact in which each individual concedes some portion of his rights in order to preserve the rest , and that society has no rights beyond the limits of such concession . This doctrine is thus stated by the Marquis l3eccaria . " It was necessity that forced men to give up a part of their liberty ; it is certain then that every individual would choose to put into the public stock the smallest portions possible ; as n-inch only as was sufficient to engage others to defend it . The aggregate of these , the smallest portions possible , forms the right of punishment : all that extends beyond this is abuse not justice . " Applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " Did any one ever give to others the right of taking away his life ? Is it possible that in the smallest portions of the liberty of each , sacrificed to the good of the public , can be contained the greatest of all good , life ? If it were so , how shall it be reconciled to the maxim which tells us , that a man has no right to kill himself ? which hecertainly must have if he could give it away to another . " * The same reasoning is current among those modern reformers who are aiming to abolish capital punishment . How often is it reiterated that " no man ever bartered away his original right in his own existence ; " that no man ever entered into a compact to give to others control over his life ; that the right to life is " a reserved right which was never surrendered to society . " In fact , // by many of the opponents of capital punishment this argument is considered final . Says Mr. Rantoul , * " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our liberty , to enable us the better to retain the aggregate of rights which xve did not surrender , did we concede our title to that life with which our Creator has endowed us ? Is it to be conceived that we have consented to hold the tenure of our earthly existence at the discretion or the caprice of a majority whose erratic legislation no man can calculate beforehand ? While our object was to preserve , as little impaired as might be possible , all our rights , which are all of them comprehended in the right to enjoy life , can we have agreed to forfeit that right to live , while God shall spare our lives , which is the essential precedent condition of all our other rights ? Have we entered into any such compact ? rJhe burden of proof is wholly upon those who affirm that we have so agreed . Let it be shown that mankind in general , or the inhabitants of this commonwealth in particular , have agreed to hold their lives as a conditional grant from the state . Let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being free to dissent from it , ever voluntarily placed himself in such a miserable vassalage . Let there at least be shown some reason for supposing that any sane man has , of his own accord , bartered away his original right in his own existence , that his government may tyrannize more heavily over him and his fellows , when all the purposes of good government may be amply secured at so much cheaper a purchase . In no instance can this preposterous sacrifice be implied . It must be shown by positive proof that it has been made ; and until this is undeniably established , the right of life remains among those reserved rights which we have not yielded up to society . " Similar language might be quoted from the writings of Mr. O'Sullivan , Mr. Burleigh , and other opponents of capital punishment . The theory that civil govern merit exists merely as the result of asocial compact-an agreement among independent , isolated individuals to form a social state-lies at the foundation of much of the current declamation against the rights of society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defectiVe . It proves too much . It can not be followed out consistently without running into absnrdity . Did any man , we ask , ever stirrender to society his entire liberty for life ? Did any man ever give to the community absolute control over his person and property ? What right then has society to imprison or fine any of its members ? All that a criminal needs to escape any penalty whatever , is to show that neither he nor his father , nor his grandfather , nor // any one who could in any way be considered his representative , was ever a party to a compact which involved the snrrender of personal liberty or of the right of property . Nay , he has but to deny being a party to such a compact , and the burden of proof is thrown upon those who affirm it . In short the right to inflict any penalty must be derived from the original consent , given or ightfully presumed , of the offender himself . And this being denied , from the nature of the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves the quandary of a judge who should attempt upon this theory to give his authority for the sentence of the court . The criminal at the bar has been found guilty of murder in the first degree . The judge congratulates the criminal that the bloody code of a barbarous age has been repealed , and that society n* longer usurps the inalienable right of life ; that he is in no danger of being hung by way of retaliation , a measure to which he could never by any possibility have given his consent when he entered the social compact . But that in consideration of his weakness , and his inability to resist temptation through a vicious education or the mal-adjustment of his cerebral organs , the court sentences him to be imprisoned for life or for a term of years in a building where society has made every provision for his comfort and reformation . " Ah , " quoth the prisoner , " may it please your honor , I never gave my consent to that . I deny the right of society to shut one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool as to agree to be deprived for life of his liberty . I never did . " " But , " replies the judge , " society certainly has the right to protect itself by punishing offenders . " " Ah , but there you shift your ground . I never consented to go to jail , any more than I consented to be hung for the good of society . It is an outrage on my personal liberty . " Such an imaginary discussion serves well to test the doctrine tinder review . A theory which by fair inference leads to such absurdities must be essentially false . It renders the bonds of society mere ropes of sand . If put into practice it would resolve society not into its original elements , for these are elements of order and union , but into a chaotic state to which we can sca*e find a parallel in the animal creation . It would send man back not to a state of nature or a savage state , for there we find society and government , however rude , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to this theory , society is based upon " a mutual agreement between the government and the governed . " This idea of the origin of government is a mere theory . There is no trace of any such original contract in the history of any people on the globe . Besides it is contrary to the historic evidence of the Bible . flume , while he does not rest the right of government as now constituted upon any such con- // 536 Civil Government . tract , assumes that all government must have been founded on a contract at the first . " When we consider , " he says , " how nearly equal all men are in their bodily force , and even in their mental powers and faculties , till cultivated by education , we must necessarily allow , that nothing but their own consent could at first associate them together , and subject them to any authority . The people , if we trace government to its first origin in the woods and deserts , are the source of all power and jurisdiction , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned their native liberty , and received laws from their equal and companion . The conditions upon which they were willing to submit , were either expressed , or were so clear and obvious , that it might well be esteemed superfluous to express them . If this , then , be meant by the original contract , it can not be denied , that all government is , at first , founded on a contract , and that the most ancient rude combinations of mankind were formed chiefly by that princij ) le . In vain are we asked in what records this charter of our liberties is registered . It was not written on parchment , nor yet on leaves or barks of trees . It preceded the use of writing , and all the other civilized arts of life . But we trace it plainly in the nature of man , and in the equality , or something approaching equality , which we find in all the individuals of that species. *** The fallacy of this hypothesis lies here . It conceives of man as an isolated being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then brings together a number of these independent , isolated beings , naturally jealous of and hostile to each other , to form a social compact for their mutual advantage . This they do by surrendering the least possible fragment of their birthright . But man never was and never can be the isolated , independent being here supposed . It was a just observation of Montesquien , that " man is born in society and there he remains . " This is a prime condition of man 's existence in this world . Where man exists , there is society . Says Blackstone , t " We can not believe with some theoretical writers , that there ever was a time when there was no such thing as society This notion , of an actually existing unconnected state of nature , is too wild to be seriously admitted ; and besides it is plainly contradictory to the revealed accounts of the primitive origin of mankind , and their preservation two thousand years afterwards ; both of which were effected by the means of simigle families . These formed the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limnits , and when it grew too large to subsist with convenience in that pastoral state , wherein the patriarchs appear to have lived , it necessarily subdivided itself by various migrations into more . Afterwards , as agriculture increased , which employs and can maintain // a much greater number of hands , migrations become less frecluent ; and various tribes which had formerly separated , re-uriited ; sometimes by compulsion and conquest ; sometimes by accident , and sometimes perhaps by compact . " From the beginning then , ever since the first pair were created , man has existed in society ; and that without any choice of his own . His very existence , his being introduced into the world , depends on the preexistence of society . Society grows out of man 's constitution and the circumstances in which God has placed him . But where society exists , there also in some sense does the state exist . " For when society is once formed , government results of course , as necessary to preserve and to keep that society in order . " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term STATE . And yet the idea of the state is ever present . rrhe state is not a voluntary association , nor a joint stock company . It is not the mere existing form of government . " I am the state , " said Louis XIV . in the Parliament of Paris , when a mere boy . " The People are the state , " exclaims the advocate of republican principles . But the state exists prior to the institution of any specific form of government , and continues to exist notwithstanding the changes of government . It exists also through all the fluctuations of population . It is a necessary thing ; a permanent , an historic entity . The state may exist in various stages of development ; it may exert itself through various forms ; but where men are , there is society , and where society is , there is the state  --  a political organism to preserve the interests of that society . A condition of mutual obligation precedes and is the basis of civil government . The state does not exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are its exponents . When the Pilgrims sat down in the cabin of the May-Flower to form an instrument for their &amp;iture government , they did not create the state . The state came with them across the sea . The powers with which they had sailed Were rendered void by their arrival at a different place from that for which these were intended . But they did not need to send to England for new powers ; for the state the source of all government , was in that cabin . The compact did not make the state , the state made the compact . The state might have continued to exist without a compact , and would of necessity have exercised its functions in some mode without it . To realize this , we have but to suppose that a crime had been committed on hoard the May-Flower , or that a mutiny or conspiracy had been planned ; and instantly we discover in that company a right to punish the crime or to suppress the mutiny , which the civilized world would have acknowledged . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . By virtue of this , on entering the harbor at Plymouth , they did combine into a body politic , and VOL . VII . // 538 Civil Government . solemnly engage submission and obedience to the laws , ordinances , acts , constitutions and officers , that from time to time should be thought most convenient for the general good of the colony. * There was as near an approximation as history has recorded , to the fiction that an original contract between independent individuals is the foundation of society . And yet what do we behold ? The state , that indestructible , historic entity , developing itself in a new form as the exigency requires , and exercising its right of making laws and constitutions , and of giving shape to the body politic . The pilgrims did not leave the state behind them , though they did leave corrupt forms of state government , any more than they left the church behind them in leaving a corrupt religious establishment . They did not create the state anew , though they did organize a new form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by forming a new association for the worship of God . The state came with them , was in them as it ever must be in all society . It exists by the necessary constitution of things . It is a condition of man 's existence in this World as a being under mutual obligations to his fellows . " Political control in some form , or of some sort , is essential to the conception of a state , and wherever such control is seen to exist-wherever political authority , however inartificial , feeble and imperfect , is seen to be exercised-there we know that a state exists . And who has ever seen , or heard , or read of a people , few or many in ntimber , who were for one moment without political control of some sort ? A people may pass through strong convnlsions and revolutions , and political authority may be greatly relaxed , and held by an uncertain and hazardous tenure , and may change hands with every rising and setting sun , or as often as the clock strikes the revolving hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when that authority shall not be held and exercised by somebody . So it was in France , in spite of all the efforts which that nation made to resolve itself into " original elements "  --  to dissolve the state , in the madness of their pride , that they might have the satisfaction of reconstructing it for themselves , on new and sublimated principles ! They might change the government as they did , but they could not dissolve the state . They could as well have made time stand stiH , while they changed the mode of dividing and computing it . " t The generations of men flow on in a continuous stream . One does not pass off the stage at once , and another succeed it by a distinct interval ; society the*efore arid the state are permanent . And when , in extraordinary cases , men come together to organize * Mather 's Magnalia , B. 1 , Chap . II , Sec. 8. * Daniel D. Barnard , LL.D. ,  --  Address before the Phi Beta Kappa Society , New Haven , 1846. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May-Flower and the planters of the New Haven colony , the question is not shall we form a state , but what form shall we as a state assume ? Even those who shut themselves out from civilized society , the buccaneers for example , or pirates in general , do nevertheless constitute a society themselves in which there is some law-making power . When the captain has been murdered by a mutinous crews another must of necessity take his place . In short , men can not be placed together in any circumstances where society shall not exist , and wherever there is society there also is some sort of governing power . Where society exists , there are mutual obligations and a necessity for the state . " Human society exists of necessity , and the state being part of the human society it exists likewise of necessity The state is aboriginal with man ; it is no voluntary association , no contrivance of art , nor invention of suffering , no company of shareholders ; no machine , no work of contract by individuals who lived previously out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity which will be cured in time and by civilization ; no accidental thing , no institution above and separate from society , no instrument for one or a few-the state is a form and faculty of mankind to lead the species toward perfection-it is the glory of man. *** That a formal compact is not necessary to the existence of the state , is further manifest from the fact , that by far the majority of states and governments have existed without any such form . The British empire to this day has no parchment called a constittition ; and yet in fact it has a constitution more firm than many which have been formally established . The state lies back of all compacts and may exist without them . The oath of a witness does not create the obligation to speak the truth ,  --  it only recognizes that obligation . The fifth commandment does not create the duty of filial obedience , nor could the obligations growing out of a natural relation be increased by any compact between father and son . The basis of the state is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as moral and social beings . If then the state exists of necessity , whence came that necessity ? By the design of God as mamfest in the nature of mctn . He has made man such a being , and has placed him in such circumstances . that to fulfill the end of his existence in this world he must live in society , and in the state , under obligations to his fellows . We are happy under this point to quote the following just sentiments from Hume . " That the Deity is the ultimate author of all government , will never be denied by any , who admit a general providence , and allow , that all events in the universe are conducted by an uniform plan , and directed to wise // purposes . As it is impossible for the human race to subsist , at least in any comfortab4e or secure state , without the protection of government , this institution must certainly have been intended by that beneficent Being , who means the good of all his creatures ; and as it has universally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all ages , we may conclude with still greater certainty , that it was intended by that omniscient Being , who can never be deceived by any event or operation. *** This is the very doctrine of Paul . We have now traced civil government to its true origin , in the will of God , as shown in the nature arid condition of man . Here the scriptures place it . " Let every soul be subject to the higher powers . For there is no power but of God ; the powers that be are ordained of God . Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God . " ( Romans xiii , 1 , 2 . ) Government exists by divine appointment ; and every existing form of government has come into being through the providence of God . We do not believe in the divine right of kings , nor in the divine right of republics . But there is a sense in which we do believe in the divine right of government . The powers that be are ordained of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing is said here of the form of government to which we owe our allegiance ; nothing of the manner in which it originated . It is not the character or the title of the government , but the existence of it as a bonajide government , exercising the proper functions of government , which invests it with this moral dignity , and which determines our duty to it . It was God 's purpose that there should be government in the world , and the existing government in any community , even though it may have been established by violence or fraud , is established in fulfillment of that purpose , and those who are in actual power , are in some sense " God 's ministers . " This is abundantly declared by the Apostle Paul in the passage to which we have just referred . " Let every soul be subject to the higher powers , " i. e. the magistracy ,  --  for the comparative " higher " refers to official elevation and not to grades in office : - i5rie*- 7ouuat , the actually existing authorities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person be subject to the constituted civil authority ; arid this , as a general rule , without inquiry either as to the origin or the rightfulness of that authority . " For there is no power but of God ; " civil government , even when but " provisional " in its form , is of divine appointment , for it is the will of God that order and government arid riot anarchy should exist among men . " The powers that be are ordained of God " - the government actually subsisting was constituted by God ,  --  not // 541 as to the form of it , nor as to the principles on which it is administered , nor as to the character and qualifications of those who administer it , but as to the fact of its existence ; it was established in the course and under the control of His providence , and in accordance with a great law of human society . " Whoso therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God . " Let it be remembered that these strong assertions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by an inspired Apostle of the New Testament under the reign of Nero , and after an infamous succession of such emperors as Tiberius , Caligula and Claudius ; and there can be no question as to the fundamental doctrine of Christianity on this subject . In the eloquent language of Dr. Pusey , " It is only the particular application of a general principle . In religion it is faith ; under misfortune , resignation ; tinder trial , it is patient , waiting to the end ; amid provocation , it is gentleness ; amid affronts , meekness ; amid injuries , it is endurance ; towards enemies , non-requital ; towards railing , it is not answering again ' ; to parents , it is filial obedience ; to superiors , respect ; to authorities , unquestioning submission ; towards civil government , it is obedience upon principle , not only when it costs nothing ( as obedience to it ordinarily does , and so can hardly be called the fulfillment of a duty ) , but when it costs something . " * Civil Government as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governed . Though the form of government may emanate from them , yet there is a governing power above the in* dividual and the conventional  --  a power inherent in society ; and society , in which this political control is vested , is a part of the divine constitution of things in this world . Society , governmen t , law , are all appointed of God . " Of law , " says Hooker , L* there can be no less acknowledged than that her seat is the bosom of God , her voice the harmony of the world ; all things in heaven and earth do her homnage ; the very least as feeling her care , and the greatest as not exempt from her power ; both angels and men , and creatures of what condition soever , though each in different sort and manner , yet all with uniform consent admiring her as the mother of their peace and joy . " Man can not exist in any of the conditions of human society without law , or , in other words , without some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charm and value here attributed to it , must not exist as a mere abstraction , but must be bodied forth in some visible , tangible form . " We have been looking over the day-sky ; and all throughout its expanse the eye has found no resting-place . Presently from out it , a feathery little cloud puts forth ; it enlarges , unrolling itself , fold after fold ; and there it lies , steady as // 542 Civil Government . the land , a mighty pile of dazzling splendor ! Now the eye is fixed , the soul filled , and our thoughts go up to it , like incense , to mingle with its glory . Yet a little before , this cloud had been an infinitely rare , invisible vapor ; our eyes saw nothing , our souls felt nothing . So law pervading as it does the universe of God , comes not upon us in its power , till it takes hold upon our senses , and sits robed on its seat in human form. *** It is a necessary tendency of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shall give shape and utterance to this invisible , this universal principle of law . Even were it possible , society could have no right to exist without government . rrhat would be rebellion against the will of God as manifested in the constitution of man , and in the whole system of moral obligation under which man is placed in this world . Civil Government is a provision of the Supreme Ruler for the wants of man ; it is also , in its highest conception , a type of his own moral government and a preparatory school for that government . But while we hold that civil government is a divine institution , we can not go to the extreme of denying the right of resistance to authority under all circumstances . We can not fully subscribe to the view which Olshausen , one of the most profound and discreet of German Commentators , takes of the passage in the 13th chapter of Romnans-where he says , " This only it the Scripture maintains without reserve , that the fundamental character of the Christian must always be endurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in opposing the subsisting authority by act , whether in a negative or a positive shape . " The very passage in the epistle to the Romans , which enjoins obedience to government , declares , that the end for which government was instituted is the well-being of the community over which it is established . " For rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil . " When therefore a government utterly fails of the design for which it was appointed , and there is no peaceable means of redress , and no prospect of relief from endurance , then there is without doubt a right of revolution inherent in society , to be put forth for the public good . But that measure is to be used with extreme caution : since when resistance is hopeless it becomes a greater evil than endurance , and even a bad governmen ( is to be preferred to anarchy . Hence the success of a revolution may be the only sure criterion of its propriety . The cases are rare in which resistance to the established authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of subjection which the Apostle lays down . But it has been truly said , that " to maintain that non-resistance is a universal duty , may be to put God on the side of absolute tyranny . " There are limitations to the duty // of obedience to the secular power , as there are limitations to the duty of children to obey their parents , and of wives to obey their husbands . We must always obey God rather than man . Civil government has no right to prescribe laws to conscience . The rightfulness of a government rests upon the evidence it gives that it exists for the true ends of government . This may be either that it is established and administered in a constitutional way , or that having come into being , it matters nor how , it now sustains itself as a government of order and law , in the main protecting the right and punishing the xv rong . With us the question is narrowed down to this- " Is the government administered according to the constitution ? " We may resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and therefore we may resist usurpation on the part of those in authority , whenever they transcend their powers and violate the constitution , written or natural , upon which their authority stands ; only in our country there can hardly be an occasion for doing this by violence . For example , the constable who should seize an inoffensive person in the street , or the officer of one town , county or state , who should make an unauthorized arrest in another , would be guilty of an assault . He might be lawfully resisted . And the same principle is applicable to those higher in authority . In such a case of the abuse of power , the STATE  --  the governing power inherent in society-rights itself by revolution if necessary , and visits with pains and penalties the mal-administrators of government . " Wherever law ends , " says Locke , " tyranny begins , if the law be transgressed to another 's harm ; and whosoever in authority exceeds the power given him by the law , and makes use of the force he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law allows not , ceases in that to be a magistrate ; and acting without authority , may be opposed as any other man who by force invades the right of another . " The term law should be taken here in its radical meaning ; for a statute and a written constitution may be made the instruments of tyranny to an extent which would justify a revolution . But these cases of lawful resistance to authority are , as we have said , extreme exceptions to the general duty of submission . From the view now taken of the origin and ends of cfvil government , it follows that government should have all the power necessary to answer the end for which it exists . The power of the state is , and of right ought to be , supreme in all matters pertaining thereto . The supreme power in any society must be vested somexvhere . There must be , both over the individual and the community , an authority whose decisions and acts are final , or all will be confusion and anarchy . There must in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despotism of one or of the many . It is indispensable to the preservation of individual rights and the // peace and order of society , that there be a government established upon known principles . But what is a government without power ? How shall it command respect , how protect society , how maintain its own existence , unless it has ever at command a force sufficient to execute its xviii ? Civil government can not rely for support upon moral influence alone . Advice , recommendation , is quite another thing from authority . Law does riot request , it commands . But its commands are empty without penalties , and these are nothing without power to inflict them . Without the power to enforce obedience or to punish disobedience , government is a farce , a mockery . It must have all the power requisite to answer the ends of its existence , or it does not exist to any purpose . this power must extend to the taking away of life when that is necessary for the protection of society , or for the security of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The ruler beareth not the sword in vain . " God has not given him an unmeaning symbol . It is the emblem of power , of power over life , intended to excite a salutary fear and to restrain the wicked from deeds of wrong . It is not a toy , nor a relic ; but a sword ; and that not of leather or of wood , but of truest steel . Every civil community should cherish a deep conviction of the duty of sustaining the constituted authorities in the exercise of all their lawful functions . The late riot in New York developed a public sentiment on this subject which was wholesome and refreshing . To abandon the government when its power is needed for the protection of society ,  --  to shrink from employing force in its support  --  to censure the magistracy for using their power to the utmost for the suppression of violence and the maintenance of public peace and order-this is at once treacherous and suicidal . It is to abandon the city or the state to be sacked and pillaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the assassin , and property to the robber and incendiary ; it is to throw away the only safeguard of society ; to tear down the barrier that shields it from anarchy and crime . Especially is it incumbent on Christians to uphold laws made for the protection of society . This is a moral duty , a religious duty ;  --  to neglect it is to sin against God . It is one part of Christ 's own teaching , enforced by his own example , tha*'his followers shall be obedient to civil government , and shall give it their support as an institution of God . Christians should always be on the side of order and law , and that not merely from personal interest . but because obedience to government is a duty . " Without the spirit of subordination there is no liberty ; without the restraints of order no freedom ; without the awful presence of law man is every body 's slave , and far worse a slave to himself . " The view which we have taken of government as a divine institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ au // thority a deep sense of their accountability to God for this sacred trust . They have not in themselves a divine right to rule , for the divine ordinance pertains to the office , and to rulers in their official , not in their personal character ; they are but stewards . Their office is never to be used for selfish ends . They are not to tyrannize over others , nor to employ their power for any purpose contrary to the general good . Neither should they enjoy the honors and emoluments of office while they slight or evade its duties . Though they are " ministers of God , " they are ministers of the people also . When the public peace is threatened , for those in authority not to take all necessary measures to preserve the peace would b* treason against the community . They would stand in the way of the very thing which they were commissioned to do . If magistrates are not willing to risk their own lives even for the protection of the public , they are unworthy of their trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob in Astor Place , had they connived at outrages which threatened property and life , had they courted popularity , and with an eye to future votes refrained from interfering , had they even hesitated to use whatever force was necessary to suppress the riot , their conduct would have been execrated by the friends of order everywhere . It was their solemn duty to make themselves feared by*evil-doers even at the sacrifice of life . And in this they should be , as they have been , sustained by all law-abiding citizens . Those who " resist the power , " who trample on the rights of others and disturb the public peace , should be frowned upon as enemies of the state . They deserve no sympathy . All mobs , all combinations against law and order , all conspiracies against the lives , the property , the liberty , the occupations or the amusements of citizens must be put down . Every citizen is alike interested in suppressing them . The mob that to-day destroys a theater , to-morrow may destroy a church , a bank or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . All interests are jeoparded when any interest is assailed by a mob . The sacred rights of property and of speech for every citizen of New York were vested in the Opera House on Astor Place , when the rabble attempted to drive an actor by violence from the stage and to demolish the building . We have no sympathy with the actor or his profession ; no respect for the house or its uses . But we would not have had either injured though torrents of blood must have flowed for their defense . It was not to protect a theater and a play-actor , that deadly bullets whistled through the crowded streets of the city ; it was to vindicate the majesty of the law , the supremacy of the state , outraged by deeds of violence . The act was timely and effectual . It will not need to be repeated . The government is stronger in the confidence of all classes for // that demonstration . It is a terror to evil doers . It beareth not the sword in vain . But civil government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surest support . Mobs are not made up of pious , God-fearing men , if the proprietor of a theater should advertise a play caricaturing religion , he would have no reason to apprehend a mob of Christians threatening to pull down the building . If a play should hold up a minister of the gospel by name to ridicule and abuse , the friends of that minister would not be found hooting about the theater and pelting the windows with stones . And certainly Christians do not mob philanthropists and churches . Mobs , whatever their occasion , are the fermentation of the sinks of vice  --  the dram-shop , the gambling-house and the stew-not the effervescence of pious zeal . The fear of God  --  the habit of obedience to his will , inspires a respect for government and law . In the great insurrection of June , 1848 , in Paris , there were not found among the insurgents , any who were accustomed to attend the schools and the religious meetings held by the Evangelical Society in the Faubourg , where the head quarters of the rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ChrisPan principle teaches men to respect government as an institution of God . While the governments of the old world are shaken and some of them are broken before the rising blast of revolution , we in this land are blessed with stability , order , peace ; because here the state  --  the governing principle-has evolved itself in that form of government which best meets the conditions of human progress . Here Freedom , Order , Law are combined . Yet there are those who fret against our federal constitution and cry for a dissolution of the Union . A dissolution of the Union ! The thing is impossible in the very nature of the case . For on the principles now laid down , what is it that must be dissolved ? Shall we abrogate the Federal Constitution ? the Articles of Confederation ? the Declaration of Independence ? the doings of the Continental Congress ? Still we have not reached the point . The Union in its essence lies back of all these its successive modes of expression . We must " dissolve " or annihilate a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be one in origin , in language , in spirit , in principles , in institutions , in historic associations , in literature , in religion and in destiny . We must cut in sunder the rivers and turn their channels ; we must divide the everlasting hills and range them in opposing barriers ; we must build out dikes and breastworks into mid-ocean ; we must tear up the iron track and sever the magic wire . Nor then can we dissolve the Union till we can stop the ceaseless flow of lakes and rivers and gulfs and oceans that surround us with their liquid bands and blend us into one . Not more surely . is the state // ordained of God , than the people of these United States are ordained to be ONE people , one body politic , by Him who " bath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth , and bath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation.
