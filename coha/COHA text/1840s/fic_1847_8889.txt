Main text Scene Present , Victor . Enter Pedrillo , with a Newspaper . VICTOR . Victor How now , Pedrillo ? Pr'ythee , what 's the matter , That thus you tramp the room , and chafe , and pant , As if to madness baited ? PEDRILLO . Pedrillo Look at that ; And wonder at my equanimity ! VICTOR . Victor A very Stoic , truly ! mild as moonbeams , Reluctant as gun-cotton to take fire , And quiet as a ribbon in a whirlwind ! Patience personified ! PEDRILLO . Pedrillo Read that , I say ! VICTOR . Victor An if you roar so loudly , my Pedrillo , You 'll wake the watchman snoring on the doorstep . Compose yourself PEDRILLO . Pedrillo I shall go mad indeed ! What ! you have seen it  --  read it  --  laughed at it  --  Retailed it , at the club , as a good joke ! But , as the moon 's above us , I 'll have vengeance ! VICTOR . Victor Well done ! The action and the word well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravos ! Othello , Hotspur , Gloster  --  say , what part Shall be selected for your first appearance ? PEDRILLO . Pedrillo Torture ! I thought you were my friend . Farewell ! VICTOR . Victor Stay , till you prove me otherwise . Explain : What direful , strange affliction hath o'erwhelmed you ? Have you been plundered , cuffed , knocked down , and stamped on ? Perhaps your uncle 's dead , and , in his will , Has left you but a halter ? No ? Has Laura Eloped with that long-haired , black-whiskered bandit , Count Loferini ? PEDRILLO . Pedrillo Pah ! he 's her abhorrence . Read  --  read that paragraph in that vile print ! Behold me dragged before a grinning public ; Pointed at , squibbed , traduced , and ridiculed  --  Made the town 's butt ; the mockery of my friends ! ' Sdeath ! I 'll be no man 's butt ! The lying caitiff ! The inky cutthroat ! The pen-stabbing footpad ! The paltering , prying , prostituting pander ! I 'll have his ears or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regalia . Can it be Abuse from such a one can stir your choler ? Wait till the blackguard praises you , and then , Curse , if you please , the fellow 's impudence . PEDRILLO . Pedrillo What ! shall I take no notice of the knave And his base lies ? VICTOR . Victor By all means notice him , If you would flatter . Challenge  --  flog  --  demand Instant retraction  --  sue him for a libel ;  --  So may his aims be answered , and the kicks Of a true gentleman may do him honor , As royalty dubs knighthood  --  with a blow ! PEDRILLO . Pedrillo Would you not have me show a due resentment ? VICTOR . Victor Tell him his sting is felt , and he 'll rejoice : Let it strike harmless on the triple mail Of conscious honor ; and the baffled viper Will writhe and hiss , to find his venom wasted . PEDRILLO . Pedrillo Ah ! but the public scorn ! VICTOR . Victor The public scorn ! Tell me what scorn the public can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can not repay tenfold ? The public scorn ! O paroxysm of most insane conceit , To think a ribald gazetteer 's worst spite Could pull upon your head the public scorn  --  Could raise you half an inch above the mass , For public contemplation ! Ah , my friend , Time will reverse thy telescope ; and objects , Which strike thee now as monstrous , will appear Ridiculously dwarfish : it will teach thee That , in this jostling , struggling , whirling world , The most notorious are but little known , The observed of all observers little seen , The loftiest low , the noisiest little heard ; And that attacks like this , conceived in envy ,  --  False , flippant , venal , venomous , and vulgar ,  --  By the judicious are at once despised , By the unthinking are at once forgotten . O , shallower than the ostrich 's device , Who buries in the desert sand his eyes , That no one may discern him , is the folly , Which could persuade you that the public gaze , From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frail slander on yourself ! So , never fear to walk the street to-morrow :  --  The boys will not hoot after you ; the ladies Will not ejaculate as you pass by . My life upon it , you will go unharmed , Unpersecuted . But I 'll flout no more ; Though , sooth to say , this sensitive alarm , This prurient shyness , and unmeasured anger , Spring merely from egregious self-conceit , Or grosser ignorance . Yet have I known Mistakes us marvellous  --  have seen a man  --  A high-souled , honorable , valiant one  --  Sickened and blasted by a slanderous breath . And I have witnessed , too , a sadder sight  --  A maiden in the bloom of youth and beauty , And good as fair , and innocent as gifted , By the same pestilence struck down and killed ; While he , the spotted wretch , who did the murders , Was  --  O , the puniest of all creeping things ! The press ! What is that terrifying engine In hands of fools and knaves ? An empty scarecrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin trumpet ! O , piteous the delusion , that could fancy The minds of men , of veritable men , Were swayed by such impostures ! PEDRILLO . Pedrillo Are they not ? VICTOR . Victor No ! Dupes and fools may be ;  --  for such I care not : Their good esteem is worthless as their hate ! PEDRILLO . Pedrillo True , every word ! You have prevailed , my friend ;  --  The smart is over , and the anger vanished . Henceforth , these slight and slimy paper-hoppers Shall less annoy than that superior insect , The shrill cicada of our summer pathways , Which harmless springs before us from the grass , Sinks at our feet , and straightway is forgotten .
