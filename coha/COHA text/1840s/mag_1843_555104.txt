txt IN the present age of high literary activity , travellers make not the least importunate demands on public attention , and their lucubrations , under whatever name , - Rambles , Notices , Incidents , Pencillings , - are nearly as important a staple for the " trade , " as novels and romances . A book of travels , formerly , was a very serious affair . The traveller set out on his distant journey with many a solemn preparation , made his will , and bade adieu to his friends , like one who might not again return . If he did return , the // results were embodied in a respectable folio , or at least quarto , well garnished with cuts , and done up in a solid form , which argued that it was no fugitive publication , but destined for posterity . All this is changed . The voyager now-a-days leaves home with as little ceremony and leave-taking , as if it were for a morning 's drive . He steps into the bark that is to carry him across thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning in a fixed week , almost at a particular day . Parties of gentlemen and ladies go whizzing along in their steam-ships over the route , which cost so many weary days to the Argonauts of old , and run over the choicest scenes of classic antiquity , scattered through Europe , Asia , and Africa , in less time than it formerly took to go from one end of the British isles to the other . The Cape of Good Hope , so long the great stumblingblock to the navigators of Europe , is doubled , or the Red Sea coasted , in the same way by the fashionable tourist , who glides along the shores of Arabia , Persia , Afghanistan , Bombay , and Hindostan , further than the furthest limits of Alexander 's conquests , - before the last leaves of the last new novel which he has taken by the way are fairly cut . The facilities of communication have , in fact , so abridged distances , that geography , as we have hitherto studied it , may be said to be entirely reformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we find ourselves next door neighbours to those whom we had looked upon as antipodes . The consequence of these improvements in the means of intercourse is , that all the world goes abroad ; or , at least , one half is turned upon the other . Nations are so mixed up by this process that they are in some danger of losing their idiosyncrasy and the Egyptian and the Turk , though they still cling to their religion , are becoming European in their notions and habits more and more every day . The taste for pilgrimage , however , it must be owned , does not stop with the countries , where it can be carried on with such increased facility . It has begotten a nobler spirit of adventure , something akin to what existed in the fifteenth century , when the world was new , or newly discovering , and a navigator , who did not take in sail , like the cautious seamen of Knickerbocker , might run down some strange eontinent in the 4ark . For , in these times of dandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hitherto defied the most adventurous spirits , have been performed ; the Himmaleh mountains have been scaled , the Niger ascended , the burning heart of Africa penetrated , the icy Arctic and Antarctic explored , and the mysterious monuments of the semi-civilized races of Central America have been thrown open to the public gaze . It is certain that this is a high-pressure age , and every department of science and letters , physical and mental , feels its stimulating influence . No nation on the whole has contributed so largely to these itinerant expeditions as the English . Uneasy , it would seem , at being cooped up in their little isle , they sally forth in all directions , swarming over the more cultivated and luxurious countries of the neighbouring continent , and sending out stragglers on other more distant and formidable niissions . Whether it be that their soaring spirits are impatient of the narrow quarters which nature has assigned them ; or that there exists a supernumerary class of idlers , who , wearied out with the monotony of home , and the same dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures or whether they go abroad for the sunshine , of which they have heard so much , but seen so little , - whatever be the cause , they furnish a far greater number of tourists than all the world beside . We Americans , indeed , may compete with them in mere locomotion ; for our familiarity with magnificent distances at home , makes us still more indifferent to them abroad . But this locomotion is generally in the way of business , and the result is rarely shown in a book , - unless , indeed , it be the leger . Yet John Bull is on many accounts less fitted than most of his neighbours for the duties of a traveller . However warm and hospitable in his own home , he has a cold reserve in his exterior , a certain chilling atmosphere , which he carries along with him , that freezes up the sympathies of strangers ; and which is only to be completely thawed by long and intimate acquaintance . But the traveller has no time for intimate acquaintances . He must " go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - for they will also be his last . Unluckily it rarely falls out that the first impressions of honest John are very favorable . There is too much pride , not to say hauteur in his composition , which , with the best intentions in the world , will show itself in a way not particularly // flattering to those who come in contact with him . He goes through a strange nation , treading on all their little irritable prejudices , shocking their self-love and harmless vanities , in short , going against the grain , and roughing up every thing by taking it the wrong way . Thus he draws out the bad humors of the people among whom he moves , sees them in their most unamiable and by no means natural , aspect , - in short , looks on the wrong side of the tapestry . What wonder if his notions are somewhat awry as to what he sees ! There are , it is true , distinguished exceptions to all this ; English travellers , who cover the warm heart , - as warm as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind and sometimes cordial manner . But they are the exceptions . The Englishman undoubtedly appears best on his own soil , where his national predilections and prejudices , or at least the intimation of them , are somewhat mitigated in deference to his guest . Another source of the disqualification of John Bull for being a calm and philosophic traveller , is the manner in which he has been educated at home ; the soft luxuries by which he has been surrounded from his cradle , until luxuries have become necessaries , - and accustomed to perceive all the machinery of life glide along as noiselessly and as swiftly as the foot of Time itself , he becomes morbidly sensitive to every temporary jar or derangement in the working of it . In no country since the world was made , have all the appliances for mere physical , and we may add intellectual indulgence , been carried to such perfection , as in this little island nucleus of civilization . Nowhere can a man get such returns for his outlay . The whole organization of society is arranged so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an Englishman , with the golden talisman in his pocket , can bring about him genii to do his bidding , and transport himself over distances with a thought , almost as easily as if he were the possessor of Aladin 's magic lamp , and the fairy carpet of the Arabian Tales . When he journeys over his little island , his comforts and luxuries cling as close to him as round his own fireside . He rolls along roads as smooth and well-beaten as those in his own park ; is swept onward by sleek and well-groomed horses , in a carriage as soft and elastic , and quite as showy as his own equipage ; puts up at inns , that may vie with his // own castle in all their comforts and accommodations , and is received by crowds of obsequious servants , more solicitous , probably , even than his own to win his golden smiles . In short , wherever he goes , he may be said to carry along with him his castle , park , equipage , establishment . The whole are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but changes nothing else ; for travelling , as it occurs in other lands , hard roads , harder beds , and hardest fare ,  --  he knows no more of it , than if he had been passing from one wing of his castle to the other . All this , it must be admitted , is rather an indifferent preparation for a tour on the Continent . Of what avail is it , that Paris is the most elegant capital , France the most enlightened country , on the European terra-firma , if one can not walk out in the streets without the risk of being run over for want of a trottoire , nor move on the roads without being half smothered in a lumbering vehicle , dragged by ropes , at the rate of five miles an hour ? Of what account are all the fine music and paintings , the architecture and art of Italy , when one must shiver by day from want of carpets and sea-coal fires , and be thrown into a fever at night by the active vexations of a still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to feel nothing but raptures and ravishment at the fine scenery through which he is riding . It is probable he will think much more of his own petty hurts than of the beauties of nature . A travelling John Bull , if his skin is not off , is at least so thin-skinned , that it is next door to being so . If the European neighbourhood affords so many means of annoyance to the British traveller , they are incalculably multiplied on this side of the water , and that , too , under circumstances which dispose him still less to charity in his criticisms and constructions . On the Continent he feels be is among strange races , born and bred under different religious and political institutions , and , above all , speaking different languages . He does not necessarily , therefore , measure them by his peculiar standard , but allows them one of their own . The dissimilarity is so great , in all the main features of national polity and society , that it is hard to institute a comparison . Whatever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the science of living , he comes to regard them as a distinct race , amenable to different laws , and therefore // licensed to indulge in different usages , to a certain extent , from his own . If a man travels in China , he makes up his mind to chop-sticks . If he should go to the Moon , he would not be scandalized by seeing people walk with their heads under their arms . He has embarked on a different planet . It is only in things , which run parallel to those in his own country , that a comparison can be instituted , and charity too often fails , where criticism begins . Unhappily , in America , the Englishman finds these points of comparison forced on him at every step . He lands among a people speaking the same language , professing the same religion , drinking at the same fountains of literature , trained in the same occupations of active life . The towns are built on much the same model with those in his own land . The brick houses , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all , in short , are near enough on the same pattern to provoke a comparison . Alas ! for the comparison . The cities sink , at once , into mere provincial towns , the language degenerates into a provincial patois , the manners , the fashions , down to the cut of the clothes , and the equipages , all are provincial . The people , the whole nation , - as independent as any , certainly , if not , as our orators fondly descant , the best and most enlightened upon earth , - dwindle into a mere British colony . The traveller does not seem to understand that he is treading the soil of the New World , where every thing is new , where antiquity dates but from yesterday , where the present and the future are all and the past nothing , where hope is the watchword , and " Go ahead ! " the principle of action . He does not comprehend , that when he sets foot on such a land , he is no longer to look for old hereditary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that have vegetated on the same soil since the Conquest . He must be content to part with the order and something of the decorum incident to an old community , where the ranks are all precisely and punctually defined , where the power is deposited by prescriptive right in certain privileged hands , and where the great mass have the careful obsequiousness of dependents , looking for the crumbs that fall . He is now among a new people ; where every thing is in movement , all struggling to get forward , and where , though many go adrift in their wild spirit of adventure , and a temporary // check may be sometimes felt by all , the great mass still advances . He is landed on a hemisphere , where fortunes are to be made , and men are employed in getting , not in spending , - a difference which explains so many of the discrepancies between the structure of our own society and habits , and those of the old world . To know how to spend , is itself a science ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by the same hand . In such a state of things , the whole arrangement of society , notwithstanding the apparent resemblance to that in his own country , and its real resemblance in minor points , is reversed . The rich proprietor , who does nothing but fatten on his rents , is no longer at the head of the scale , as in the Old World . The man of enterprise takes the lead in a bustling community , where action and progress , or at least change , are the very conditions of existence . The upper classes , - if the term can be used in a complete democracy , - have not the luxurious finish and accommodations , to be found in the other hemisphere . The humbler classes have not the poverty-stricken , cringing spirit of hopeless inferiority . The pillar of society , if it want the Corinthian capital , wants also the heavy and superfluous base . Every man , not only professes to be , but is practically on a footing of equality with his neighbour . The traveller must not expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which grow out of distinction of castes . This is an awkward dilemma for one , whose nerves have never been jarred by contact with the great profane ; who has never been tossed about in the rough and tumble of humanity . It is little to him , that the poorest child in the community learns how to read and write ; that the poorest man can have , - what Henry the Fourth so good-naturedly wished for the humblest of his subjects , - a fowl in his pot , every day for his dinner ; that no one is so low , but that he may aspire to all the rights of his fellowmen , and find an open theatre , on which to display his own peculiar talents . As the tourist strikes into the interior , difficulties of all sorts multiply , incident to a raw and unformed country . The comparison with the high civilization at home becomes more and more unfavorable , as he is made to feel that in this land of promise , it must be long before promise can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he would look // beyond the surface , he would see that much here too has been performed , however much may be wanting . He would see lands over which the wild Indian roamed as a hunting-ground , teeming with harvests for the consumption of millions here and across the water ; forests , which have shot up , ripened , and decayed on the same spot ever since the creation , now swept away to make room for towns and villages , thronged with an industrious population ; rivers , which rolled on in their solitudes , undisturbed except by the wandering bark of the savage , now broken and dimpled by hundreds of steamboats , freighted with the rich tribute of the country thus rescued from the wilderness . He would not expect to meet the careful courtesies of polished society in the pioneers of civilization , whose mission , to use the cant word of the day , has been , to recover the great continent from the bear and the buffalo . He would have some charity for their ignorance of the latest fashions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what , in the old country , is considered as the decorum , and it may be decencies , of life . But not so ; his heart turns back to his own land , and closes against the rude scenes around him . For he finds here none of the soft graces of cultivation , or the hallowed memorials of an early civilization ; no gray , weather-beaten cathedrals , telling of the Normans ; no Gothic churches , in their groves of venerable oaks ; no moss-covered cemeteries , in which the dust of his fathers has been gathered since the time of the Plantagenets ; no rural cottages , half smothered with roses and honey-suckles , intimating that even in the most humble abodes the taste for the beautiful has found its way ; no trim gardens , and fields blossoming with hawthorn hedges and miniature culture ; no ring fences , inclosing well-shaven lawns , xvoods so disposed as to form a picture of themselves , bright threads of silvery water , and sparkling fountains . All these are wanting , and his eyes turn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all her rough accompaniments , - from man almost as wild ; and his heart sickens as he thinks of his own land , and all its scenes of beauty . He thinks not of the poor , who leave that land for want of bread , and find in this a kindly welcome , and the means of independence and advancement , which their own denies them . He goes on , if he be a splenetic Sinbad , discharging his // sour bile on everybody that he comes in contact with , thus producing an amiable ripple in the current as he proceeds , that adds marvellously , no doubt , to his own quiet and personal comfort . If he have a true merry vein and hearty good-nature , he gets on , laughing sometimes in his sleeve at others , and cracking his jokes on the unlucky fate of Brother Jonathan , who , if he is not very silly , - which he very often is , - laughs too , and joins in the jest , though it may be somewhat at his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Tory in his own land ; if the latter , he returns , probably , ten times the conservative that he was when he left it . If Whig , or even Radical , it matters not ; his loyalty waxes warmer and warmer with every step of his progress among the republicans ; and he finds , that practical democracy , shouldering and elbowing its neighbours , as it " goes ahead , " is no more like the democracy , which he has been accustomed to admire in theory , than the real machinery , with its smell , smoke , and clatter , under full operation , is like the pretty toy , which he sees as a model in the Patent-Office at Washington . On the whole , there seems to be no people better constituted for travellers , at least for recording their travelling experiences , than the French . There is a mixture of frivolity and philosophy in their composition , which is admirably suited to the exigencies of their situation . They mingle readily with all classes and races , discarding for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antipathies . Their pleasant vanity fills them with the desire of pleasing others , which most kindly reacts by their being themselves pleased " Pleased with himself , whom all the world can please . " The Frenchman can even so far accommodate himself to habits alien to his own , that he can tolerate those of the savages themselves , and enter into a sort of fellowship with them , without either party altogether discarding his national tastes and propensities . It is Chateaubriand , if we are not mistaken , who relates , that , wandering in the solitudes of the American wilderness , his ears were most unexpectedly saluted by the sounds of a violin . He had little doubt that one of his own countrymen must be at hand ; and in a wretched enclosure , he found one of them , sure enough , teaching Jllessieurs les // sctuvages to dance . It is certain , that this spirit of accommodation to the wild habits of their copper-colored friends gave the French traders and missionaries , formerly , an ascendency over the Aborigines , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most comprehensive and truly philosophic work on the genius and institutions of this country , the best exposition of its social phenomena , its present condition , and probable future , are to be found in the pages of a Frenchman . It is in the French language , too , that by far the greatest work has been produced on the great Southern portion of our continent , once comprehended under New Spain . To write a book of travels seems to most people to require as little preliminary preparation as to write a letter . One has only to jump into a coach , embark on board a steamboat , minute down his flying experiences and hair-breadth escapes , the aspect of the country as seen from the interior of a crowded diligence , or a vanishing rail-car , note the charges of the landlords and the quality of the fare , a dinner or two at the minister 's , the last new play or opera at the theatre , and the affair is done . It is very easy to do this , certainly ; very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by no means easy to make a good one . This requires as many and various qualifications as to make any other good book ; qualifications which must vary with the character of the country one is to visit . Thus , for instance , it requires a very different preparation and stock of accomplishments to make the tour of Italy , its studios and its galleries of art , or of Egypt with its immortal pyramids and mighty relics of a primeval age , the great cemetery of antiquity , - from what it does to travel understandingly in our own land , a new creation , as it were , without monuments , without arts , where the only study of the traveller , - the noblest of all studies , it is true , - is man . The inattention to this difference of preparation , demanded by different places , has led many a clever writer to make a very worthless book , which would have been remedied had he consulted his own qualifications , instead of taking the casual direction of the first steamboat or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country more difficult to discuss in all its multiform aspects , than Mexico , or rather the wide region , once comprehended under the name of New Spain . Its various // climates , bringing to perfection the vegetable products of the most distant latitudes ; its astonishing fruitfulness in its lower regions , and its curse of barrenness over many a broad acre of its plateau ; its inexhaustible mines , that bave flooded the Old World with an ocean of silver , such as Columbus in his wildest visions never dreamed of , - and unhappily , by a hard mischance , never lived to realize himself ; its picturesque landscape , where the volcanic fire gleams amid wastes of eternal snow , and a few hours carry the traveller from the hot regions of the lemon and the cocoa to the wintry solitudes of the mountain fir ; its motley population made up of Indians , old Spaniards , modern Mexicans , meztizoes , mulattoes , and zambos ; its cities built in the clouds ; its lakes of salt water , hundreds of miles from the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in keeping , as we may say , with its extraordinary scenery ; its stately palaces , half furnished , where services of gold and silver plate load the tables in rooms without a carpet , while the red dust of the bricks soils the diamond. *sprinkled robes of the dancer ; the costly attire of its higher classes , blazing with pearls and jewels ; the tawdry magnificence of its equipages , saddles in* laid with gold , bits and stirrups of massy silver , all executed in the clumsiest style of workmanship ; its lower classes , - the men with their jackets , glittering with silver buttons , and rolls of silver tinsel round their caps , the women with petticoats fringed with lace , and white satin shoes on feet unprotected by a stocking ; its high-born fair ones crowding to the cockpit , and solacing themselves with the fumes of a cigar ; its churches and convents , in which all the sombre rules of monastic life are maintained in their primitive rigor , while they have died away before the liberal spirit of the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Uperos , the lazzaroni of the land ; its hordes of almost legalized banditti , who stalk openly in the streets , and render the presence of an armed escort necessary to secure a safe drive into the environs of the capital ; its whole structure of society , in which a republican form is thrown over instItutions as aristocratic , and castes as nicely defined , as in any monarchy of Europe in short , its marvellous inconsistencies and contrasts in climate , character of the people , and face of the land , - so marvellous , as , we trust , to excuse the unprecedented length of this sentence , - undoubtedly make modern Mexico one // of the most prolific , original , and difficult themes for the study of the traveller . Yet this great theme has found in Humboldt a writer of strength , sufficient to grapple with it in nearly all its relations . While yet a young man , or , at least , while his physical as well as mental energies were in their meridian , he came over to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only heightened by obstacles , and with stores of it already accumulated , that enabled him to detect the nature of every new object that came under his eye , and arrange it in its proper class . With his scientific instruments in his hand , he might be seen scaling the snow-covered peaks of the Cordilleras , or diving into their unfathomable caverns of silver ; now wandering through their dark forests in search of new specimens for his herbarium , - now coasting the stormy shores of the Gulf , and penetrating its unhealthy streams , jotting down every landmark that might serve to guide the future navigator , or surveying the crested Isthmus in search of a practicable communication between the great seas on its borders , - and then again patiently studying the monuments and manuscripts of the Aztecs in the capital , or mingling with the wealth and fashion in its saloons , - frequenting every place , in short , and everywhere at home " Grainmaticus , rhetor , geometres oronia novit . " The whole range of these various topics is brought under review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ray , sometimes a flood , of light . His rational philosophy , content rather to doubt than to decide , points out the track , which other adventurous spirits may follow up with advantage . No antiquary has done so much towards determining the original hives of the semi-civilized races of the Mexican plateau . No one , not even of the Spaniards , has brought together such an important mass of information in respect to the resources , natural products , and statistics , generally , of New Spain . His explorations have identified more than one locality , and illustrated more than one curious monument , of the people of Anahuac , which had baffled the inquirics of native antiquaries ; and his work , while embodying the results of profound scholarship and art , is , at the same time , in many respects , the very best manuel du voyageur , and , as such , has been most freely used by subsequent tourists . It is true , // his pages are sometimes disfigured by pedantry , ambitious display , learned obscurity , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is without its blemishes ? His various writings on the subject of New Spain , taken collectively , are one of those monuments , which may be selected to show the progress of the species . Their author reminds us of one of the ancient athleta* , who descended into the arena to hurl the discus with a giant arm , that distanced every cast of his contemporaries There is one branch of his fruitful subject , which M. de Humboldt has not exhausted , and , indeed , has but briefly touched on . This is the social condition of the country , especially as found in its picturesque capital . This has been discussed by subsequent travellers more fully , and Ward , Bullock , Lyons , Poinsett , Tudor , Latrobe , have all produced works , which have for their object , more or less , the soc*tl habits and manners of the people . With most of them this is not the prominent object ; and others of them , probably , have found obstacles in effecting it , to any great extent , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to the sympathies of a people ; without which a traveller is as much at fault , as a man without an eye for color in a picture-gallery , or an ear for music at a concert . He may see and hear , indeed , in both , but cui borto ? The traveller , ignorant of the language of the nation whom he visits , may descant on the scenery , the roads , the architecture , the outside of things , the rates and distances of posting , the dress of the people in the streets , and may possibly meet a native or two , half denaturalized , kept to dine with strangers at his banker 's . But , as to the interior mechanism of society , its secret sympathies , and familiar tone of thinking and feeling , he can know no more , than he could of the contents of a library , by running over the titles of strange and unknown authors packed together on the shelves . It was to supply this deficiency , that the work before us , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was composed under circumstances , that afforded every possible advantage and facility to its author . Although the initials only of the name are given in the title-page , yet , from these and certain less equivocal passages in the body of the work , it requires *o *IEdipus to divine , that the author is the wife of the // Chevalier Calderon de la Barca , well known in this country during his long residence , as Spanish minister , at Washington , where his amiable manners and high personal qualities secured him general respect , and the regard of all who knew him . On the recognition of the independence of Mexico by the mother country , Sei*ior de Calderon was selected to fill the office of the first Spanish envoy to the Republic . It was a delicate mission after so long an estrangement , and it was hailed by the Mexicans with every demonstration of pride and satisfaction . Though twenty years had elapsed since they had established their independence , yet they felt as a wayward son may feel , who , having absconded from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks back to it with a sort of reverence , and , in the plenitude of his prosperity , still feels the want of the parental benediction . We , who cast off our allegiance in a similar way , can comprehend the feeling . The view minister , from the moment of his setting foot on the Mexican shore , was greeted with an enthusiasm , which attested the popular feeling ; and his presence in the capital was celebrated by theatrical exhibitions , bull-fights , illuminations , fites public and private , and every possible demonstration of respect for the new envoy and the country who sent him . His position secured him access to every place of interest to an intelligent stranger , and introduced him into the most intimate recesses of society , from which the stranger is commonly excluded , and to which , indeed , none but a Spaniard could , under any circumstances , have been admitted . Fortunately the minister possessed , in the person of his accomplished wife , one , who had both the leisure and the talent to profit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work before us , consisting of letters to her family , which , it seems , since her return to the United States , have been gathered together , and prepared for publication . On the 29th of October , 1839 , Madame de Calderon embarked with her husband in a vessel for Havana , on her way to Mexico . The voyage was checkered by no remarkable incidents or perilous adventures . On entering the West Indian seas , the thoughts of the voyager naturally turned to the great navigator , whose sails were first spread on their bosom . // " It is well to read the History of Columbus at sea , but especially in these waters , where he wandered in suspense , high . wrought expectation , and firm faith ; and to watch the signs which the noble mariner observed in these latitudes ; the soft serenity of the breezes , the clear blue of the heavens , the brilliancy and number of the stars , the sea-weeds of the gulf , which always drift in the direction of the wind , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frequency of the shooting stars , and the multitude of flying-fish . " As the shades of evening close around , and the tropical sky glitters with the light of innumerable stars , imagination transports us back to that century , which stands out in bold relief amidst other ages rolling by comparatively undistinguished , and we see , as in a vision , the Discoverer of a World , standing on the deck of his caravel , as it bounded over the unknown and mysterious waste of waters , his vigilant eyes fixed on the west , like a Persian intently watching the rising of his god ; though his star was to arise from whence the day-god sets . We see him bending his gaze on the first dark line , that separated the watery sea from the blue of the heavens , striving to penetrate the gloom of night , yet waiting with patient faith until the dawn of day should bring the long wished-for shores in sight . " Vol. i. p. 6 . Preparations had been made for their reception by the authorities of Havana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government vessel could be got ready to transport him to Mexico . Cuba has been visited by so many thousands of Americans , that one might imagine nothing new could be told us of it . But our countrymen go there mostly for business or health , rarely acquainted with the language , and see little or nothing of the higher society of the island . We have room only for one extract from the description of this , which shows , that the aristocracy of Cuba emulate that of the mother country in the splendor of their way of living . " I can speak with more decision on the subject of a great ball given us by the Countess F-.  - -  a , last evening , which was really superb . The whole house was thrown open , - there was a splendid supper , quantities of refreshments , and the whole select aristocracy of Havana . Diamonds on all the women , jewels and orders on all the men , magnificent lustres and mirrors*and a capital band of music in the gallery . " The Captain-General was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very agreeable , in good French . About one hundred couple stood up in each country dance , but the rooms are so large and so judiciously lighted , that we did not feel at all warm . Waltzes , quadrilles , and these long Spanish dances succeeded each other . Almost all the girls have fine eyes and beautiful figures , but without color or much animation . The finest diamonds were those of the Countess F- a , particularly her necklace , which was undeniable . " Walking through the rooms after supper , we were amused to see the negroes and negresses helping themselves plentifully to the sweetmeats , uncorking and drinking fresh bottles of Champagne , and devouring everything on the supper-tables , without the slightest concern for the presence either of their master or mistress ; in fact , behaving like a multitude of spoiled children , who are sure of meeting with indulgence , and presume upon it " Towards morning we were led down stairs to a large suite of rooms , containing a library of several thousand volumes , where coffee , cakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gold plate . We left the house , at last , to the music of the national hymn of Spain , which struck up as we passed through the gallery . " - Vol. i. pp. 24 , 25 . After passing a fortnight amidst the elegant hospitality of Havana , our travellers embarked in a Spanish vessel of war of twenty-five guns , manned by a crew of one hundred and fifty men . In a few days they made the coast of New Spain . But the voyager to that country must take his choice of the vomito , or yellow fever , in the hot months , or of the norte , the north wind , which sweeps over these latitudes in the autumnal and winter seasons . Our voyagers chose the latter , and got the full benefit of it . For several days they were tossing about in sight of the coast , and , though in a fast-sailing vessel , consumed more than three weeks in the voyage , which a steamship would perform in half a one . At length they landed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vera Cruz , the city of the True Cross , on the same spot , then a desolate sand-bank , where Hernando Cortes had first set his foot , more than three centuries ago . But our author shall speak for herself . " Any thing more melancholy , d#*labr* , and forlorn , than the whole appearance of things , as we drew near , can not well be imagined . On one side , the fort , with its black and red walls ; on the other , the miserable , black-looking city , with hordes of // large black birds , called spilotes , hovering over some dead carcass , or flying heavily along in search of carrion . Still , as the goal of our voyage , even its dreary aspect was welcome , and the very hills of red sand by which it is surrounded , and which look like the deserts of Arabia , appeared inviting . " A boat , full of cocked hats , was now seen approaching from the city , containing the Consul in full uniform , and other authorities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor , to I ) erL*it the Jason , contrary to established usages , to anchor beneath the castle , a salute of twenty guns was fired from our ship . Being upon deck , I was nearly suffocated with smoke and powder . A salute of the same number of cannon was then fired from the castle , in honor of the first Spanish man-of-war , that has appeared in this port since the Revolution . " And now we prepared , before the sun went down , to leave our watery prison ; and the captain 's boat being manned , and having taken leave of the officers , we , that is , C n , the commander , and I , and my French maid , and her French poodle , got into it . Then came a salute of twenty guns from the Jason in our honor , and we rowed off amidst clouds of smoke . Then the fort gave us welcome with the same number of guns , and , amidst all this cannonading , we were landed at the wharf . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the eye could reach , of all ages and sexes of Vera-Cruzians ( and a very curious set they seemed to be ) were assembled to witness His Excellency 's arrival . Some had no pantaloons ; and others , to make up for their neighbours ' deficiencies , had two pair , - the upper slit up the side of the leg , Mexican fashion . All had large hats , with silver or bead rolls , and every tinge of dark complexion , from the pure Indian , upwards . Some dresses were entirely composed of rags , clinging together by the attraction of cohesion ; others had only a few holes to let in the air . All were crowding , jostling , and nearly throwing each other into the water , and gazing with faces of intense curiosity . " But a plume of colored feathers was seen towering above the copper-colored crowd , and immediate passage was made for an aid-de-camp from the Governor , General Guadalupe Victoria . He was an immensely tall man , in a showy uniform all covered with gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainbow-colored feathers . He brought to C a the welcome and congratulations of the General , and those Spanish offers of service and devotion which sound agreeably , whatever be their true value . " - Vol. i. pp. 37- 39. // Madame de Calderon gives some particulars of this commander , famous in the revolutionary history of Mexico . One , however , more extraordinary than any she states , is mentioned by Ward , who says , that the General , when secreting himself in the deserts for a year , learned to live without food for five days at a time , and that ever since it has been exceedingly annoying to him to eat more than once in twenty-four hours . Some of our dyspeptics might learn a wholesome lesson under this abstemious chief . Our author gives a fuller account of a much more distinguished personage , the present president of the Republic , Santa Anna ; which , as it presents a novel picture also of the way of life among the great proprietors of the tierra caliente , or warm region , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give in extenso . " Yesterday morning , at two o'clock , we rose by candle-light , with the pleasant prospect of leaving Vera Cruz and of seeing Santa Anna . Two boxes , called carriages , drawn by mules , were at the door , to convey us to Manga de Clavo . Seiior V -- o , C -- n , the commander of the Jason , and 1 , being encased in them , we set off half asleep . By the faint light , we could just distinguish as we passed the gates , and the carriages ploughed their way along , nothing but sand ,  --  sand ,  --  asfaras the eye could reach ; a few leagues of Arabian desert . " At length we began to see symptoms of vegetation ; occasional palm-trees and flowers , and , by the time we had reached a pretty Indian village , where we stopped to change mules , the light had broke in , and we seemed to have been transported , as if by enchantment , from a desert to a garden . It was altogether a picturesque and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thatched with palm-leaves , the Indian women with their long black hair standing at the doors with their half.naked children , the mules rolling themselves on the ground , according to their fa . vorite fashion , snow-white goats browsing among the palm-trees , and the air so soft and balmy , the first fresh breath of morning ; the dew-drops still glittering on the broad leaves of the banana and palm , and all around so silent , cool , and still . " The huts , though poor , were clean ; no windows , but a certain subdued light makes its way through the leafy canes . We procured some tumblers of new milk , and , having *hanged mules , pursued our journey , iiow no longer through hills of sand , but across the country , through a wilderness of trees and flowers , the glowing productions of tierra caliente . We arrived aboi4 // five at Manga de Clavo , after passing through leagues of natural garden , the property of Santa Anna . " The house is pretty , slight-looking , and kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform , and by several officers , and conducted to a large , cool , agreeable apartment , with little furniture , into which shortly entered the Seiiora de Santa Anna , tall , thin , and , at that early hour of the morning , dressed to receive us in clear white muslin , with white satin shoes , and with very splendid diamond ear-rings , brooch , and rings . She was very polite , and introduced her daughter Guadalupe , a miniature of her mamma , in features and costume . " In a little while entered General Santa Anna himself ; a gentlemanly , good-looking , quietly dressed , rather melancholy-looking person , with one leg , apparently somewhat of an invalid , and to us the most interesting person in the group . He has a sallow complexion , fine dark eyes , soft and penetrating , and an interesting expression of face . Knowing nothing of his past history , one would have said a philosopher , living in dignified retirement , one who had tried the world , and found that all was vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were ever persuaded to emerge from his retreat , would only do so , Cincinnatus-like , to benefit his country . It is strange , how frequently this expression of philosophic resignation , of placid sadness , is to be remarked on the countenances of the deepest , most ambitions , and most designing men . C -- n gave him a letter from the Queen , written under the supposition of his being still President , with which he seemed much pleased , but merely made the innocent observation , How very well the Queen writes ! * " It was only now and then , that the expression of his eye was startling , especially when he spoke of his leg , which is cut off below the knee . He speaks of it frequently , like Sir John Ramorny of his bloody hand ; and when he gives an account of his wound , and alludes to the French on that day , his countenance assumes that air of bitterness , which Ramorny 's may have exhibited , when speaking of ' Harry the Smith . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of the United States , and of the persons he had known there , and in his manners was quiet and gentlemanlike , and altogether a more polished hero than I had expected to see . To judge from the past , he will not long remain in his present state of inaction , besides having within him , according to Zavala , a principle of action for ever impelling him forward . ' " En attendant , breakfast was announced . The Seiiora de Santa Anna led me in . C-n was placed at the head of the table , I on his right , Santa Anna opposite , the Se7iora on my // right . The breakfast was very handsome , consisting of innumerable Spanish dishes , meat and vegetables , fish and fowl , fruits and s*veetmeats , all served in white and gold French porcelain , with coffee , wines , &amp;c . After breakfast , the Seilora having despatched an officer for her cigar-case , which was gold with a diamond latch , offered me a cigar , which I having declined , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gentlemen followed her good example . " We then proceeded to look at the out-houses and offices ; at the General 's favorite war-horse , an old white charger , probably a sincerer philosopher than his master ; at several game-cocks , kept with especial care , cock-fighting being a favorite recreation of Santa Anna 's ; and at his litera , which is handsome and comfortable . There are no gardens , but , as he observed , the whole country , which for twelve leagues square belongs to him , is a garden . The appearance of the family says little for the healthiness of the locale ; and indeed its beauty and fertility will not compensate for its insalubrity . " As we had but a few hours to spare , the General ordered round two carriages , both very handsome , and made in the United States , one of which , conveyed him and C -- n , the Seiiora and me . In the other were the little girl and the officers , in which order we proceeded across the country to the high road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Miguel 5 --  , were to overtake us . The diligence not having arrived , we got down and sat on a stone bench , in front of an Indian cottage , where we talked , while the young lady amused herself by eating apples , and C -- n and the General remained moralizing in the carriage . " Shortly after , and just as the sun was beginning to give us a specimen of his power , our lumbering escort of Mexican soldiers galloped up , ( orders having been given by the government that a fresh escort shall be stationed every six leagues , ) and announced the approach of the diligence . We were agreeably disappointed by the arrival of a handsome new coach , made in the United States , drawn by ten good.looking mules , and driven by a smart Yankee coachman . Our party consisted of ourselves , Don Miguel , the captain of the Jason and his first lieutenant , who accompany us to Mexico . The day was delightful , and every one apparently in good-humor . We took leave of General Santa Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainer , Seilor V --  ; got into the diligence , - doors shut , - all right ,  --  lash up the mules , and now for Mexico ! ** - pp. 47- 52 . Madame de Calderon was not mistaken in supposing that // this Mexican Cincinnatus only bided his time to leave the philosophic retirement of the country for the glittering seals of state . The route of the travellers led them through more of this delicious scenery , which is reflected , with all its bright flush of coloring , in our author 's page , as vividly as in a mirror . " It was difficult to believe , as we journeyed on , that we were now in the midst of December . The air was soft and balmy . The heat , without being oppressive , that of a July day in England . The road lay through a succession of woody country ; trees covered with every variety of blossom , and loaded with the most delicious tropical fruits ; flowers of every color filling the air with fragrance , and the most fantastical profusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flinging their bright blossoms over every bough . Palms , cocoas , oranges , lemons , succeeded one another , and at one turn of the road , down in a lovely green valley , we caught a glimpse of an Indian woman , with her long hair , resting under the shade of a lofty tree , beside a running stream , - , an Oriental picture . Had it not been for the dust and the jolting , nothing could have been more delightful . As for Don Miguel , with his head out of the window , now desiring the coachman to go more quietly , now warning us to prepare for a jolt , now pointing out every thing worth looking at , and making light of all difficulties , he was the very best conductor of a journey I ever met with . His hat of itself was a curiosity to us ; a white beaver with immense brim , lined with thick silver tissue , with two large silver rolls and tassels round it . " One circumstance must be observed by all who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being or passing object to be seen that is not in itself a picture , or which would not form a good subject for the l ) encil . The Indian women with their plaited hair , and little children slung at their backs , their large straw hats and petticoats of two colors , the long strings of arrieros with their loaded mules , and swarthy , wildlooking faces , - the chance horseman who passes with his sarape of many colors , his high , ornamented saddle , Mexican hat , silver stirrups and leather boots , - all is picturesque . Salvator Rosa and Hogarth might have travelled here to advantage , handin-hand ; Salvator for the sublime , and Hognrth taking him up where the sublime became the ridiculous . " - pp. 52 - 54 . After climbing up the steep sides of the table-land , amidst scenes checkered with beauty and sterility , but always in the highest degree picturesque , the party descended the mountain // slopes towards the Valley of Mexico . We regret that our limits will not allow us to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Montezuma . The whole population of the city , all who could command a carriage or a horse , came out to welcome the ambassador , who brought the olive branch in his hand . Most unfortunately , it was becoming late in the afternoon , and the rain fell in sheets of water , such as are met with only in tropical climates . It certainly was a damper to their brilliant entr4e into the capital . The bright sun of the next day dispelled the gloom of their first impressions , and for some weeks the diplomatic train found abundant amusement and occupation in the magnificent entertainments given in honor of their arrival . In the brilliant gallery of pictures , which our fair author has sketched , sometimes of the city and its inhabitants , embracing all classes and descriptions , at others of its beautiful environs , we know not which to select . We will take at hazard her visit to Chapultepec , the favorite retreat of the Aztec princes , not a league from the capital . " We have spent the day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most haunted by recollections of all the traditionary sites of which Mexico can boast . Could these hoary cypresses speak , what tales might they not disclose , stand . ing there with their long gray beards , and outstretched venerable arms , century after century ; already old when Montezuma was a boy , and still vigorous in the days of Bustamante ! There has the last of the Aztec emperors wandered with his dark.eyed harem . Under the shade of these gigantic trees he has rested , perhaps smoked his tobacco mingled with amber , ' and fallen to sleep , his dreams unhaunted by visions of the stern traveller from the far-east , whose sails even then might be within sight of the shore . Jn these tanks he has bathed . Here were his gar. dens , and his aviaries , and his flsh.ponds . Through these now tangled and deserted woods , he may have been carried by his young nobles in his open litter , under a splendid dais , stepping out upon the rich stuffs which his slaves spread before him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rock where the Castle stands , he may have looked out upon his fertile valley , and great capital , with its canoe-covered lakes , and outspreading villages and temples , and gardens of flowers , no care for the future*darkening the bright vision . " Tradition says , that now these caves and tanks and woods // are haunted by the shade of the Conqueror 's Indian love , the farfamed Doiia Marina , but I think she would be afraid of meeting with the *vrathful spirit of the Indian emperor . " The Castle itself , modern though it be , seems like a tradition . The Viceroy Galvez , who built it , is of a by-gone race The apartments are lonely and abandoned , the walls falling to ruin , the glass of the windows and the carved work of the doors have been sold ; and , standing at this great height , exposed to every wind that blows , it is rapidly falling to decay . We were accompanied by Count C a , and received by a Mexican governor , who rarely resides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Chapultepec is not a show-place . One must go there early in the morning , when the dew is on the grass , or in the evening , when the last rays of the sun are gilding with rosy light the snowy summits of the volcanoes ; and dismount from your horse , or step out of your carriage , and wander forth without guide , or object , or fixed time for return . " XVe set off early , passing over a fine paved road , divided by a great and solid aqueduct of nine hundred arches , one of the two great aqueducts by which fresh water is conveyed to the city , and of which the two sources are in the bill of Chapultepec , and in that of Santa F* , at a much greater distance . When we arrived , the sleepy soldiers , who were lounging before the gates , threw them open to let the carriage enter , and we drew up in front of the great cypress , known by the name of Montezuma 's Cypress , ' a most stupendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches unmoved as the light wind played amongst them , of most majestic height , and forty-one feet in circumference . A second cypress standing near , and of almost equal size , is even more graceful , and they , and all the noble trees which adorn these speaking solitudes , are covered with a creeping plant resembling gray moss , hanging over every branch like long gray hair , giving them a most venerable and druidical look . " We xvandered through the noble avenues , and rested under the trees , and walked through the tangled shrubberies , bright with flowers and colored berries , and groped our way into the cave , and stood by the large clear tank , and spent some time in the old garden ; and then got again into the carriage , that we might be dragged up the precipitous ascent on which stands the Castle , the construction of which aroused the jealousy of the government against the young Count , whose taste for the picturesque had induced him to choose this elevated site for his summer palace . " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most striking features in Mexican society is the ambition of ornament , reaching from the peasant to // the noble , and displayed in the latter by such a prodigal show of jewelry , as is probably not surpassed in any court in Europe . Some of the old Spanish nobles found the means for this in the vast wealth derived from their mines . Among these , we are informed by our author , " The Count de Regla was so wealthy , that when his son , the present Count , was christened , the whole party walked from his house to the church , upon ingots of silver . The Countess having quarrelled with the Vice-Queen , sent her , in token of reconciliation , a white satin slipper , entirely covered with large diamonds . The Count invited the King of Spain to visit his Mexican territories , assuring him that the hoofs of his Majesty 's horse should touch nothing hut solid silver from Vera Cruz to the capital . This might be a bravado ; but a more certain proof of his wealth exists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , of the largest size , to be constructe*X in Havana at his expense , made of mahogany and cedar , and presented them to the King . The present Count was , as I already told you , married to the beautiful daughter of the Gilera Rodriguez. " - Vol. i. p. 264 . After this we may not be surprised to find , that the ruling passion , strong in death , should affect the same lavish display , even where such magnificence becomes a mockery . Madame de Calderon tells a whimsical anecdote in relation to this . " A lady of high rank having died in Mexico , her relatives undertook to commit her to her last resting-place , habited according to the then prevailing fashion , in her most magnificent dress , that which she had worn at her wedding . This dress was a wonder of luxury , even in Mexico . It was entirely composed of the finest lace , and the flounces were made of a species of point which cost fifty dollars a vara ( the Mexican yard ) . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at certain intervals with bows of ribband very richly embroidered in gold . In this dress , the Condesa de was laid in her coffin , thousands of dear friends crowding to view her beautiful costume de mort , and at length she was placed in her tomb , the key of which was intrusted to the sacristan . " From the tomb to the opera is a very abrupt transition ; nevertheless , both have a share in this story . A company of French dancers appeared in Mexico , a twentieth-rate ballet , and the chief danseuse was a little French damsel , remarkable for the shortness of her robes , her coquetry , and her astonishing pirouettes . On the night of a favorite ballet , Mademoiselle Pau // line made her entr*e in a succession of pirouettes , and , poising on her toe , looked round for approbation , when a sudden thrill of horror , accompanied by a murmur of indignation , pervaded the assembly . Mademoiselle Pauline was equipped in the very dress in which the defunct Countess had been buried ! Lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Hardly had the curtain dropped , when the little danseuse found herself surrounded by competent authorities , questioning her as to where and how she had obtained her dress . She replied , that she had bought it at an extravagant price from a French modiste in the city . She had rifled no tomb , but honestly paid down golden oupces , in exchange for her lawful property . To the modiste 's went the officers of justice . She also pleaded innocent . She had bought it of a man who had brought it to her for sale , and had paid him much more than d poids d'or , as indeed it was worth . By dint of further investigation , the man was identified , and proved to be the sacristan of San - . Short-sighted sacristan ! He was arrested and thrown into prison , and one benefit resulted from his cupidity , since , in order to avoid throwing temptation in the way of future sacristans , it became the custom , after the body had lain in state for some time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placing the coffin in the vault . A poor vanity after all . " 1 was told by a lady here , that on the death of her grandchild , he was not only enveloped in rich lace , but the diamonds of three Condesas and four Marquesas were collected together and put on him , necklaces , bracelets , rings , brooches , and tiaras , to the value of several hundred thousand dollars . The street was hung with draperies , and a band of music played , whilst he was visited by all the titled relatives of the family in his dead splendor , poor little baby ! Yet his mother mourned for him as for all her blighted hopes , and the last scion of a noble house . Grief shows itself in different ways ; yet one might think that when it seeks consolation in display , it must be less profound than when it shuns it . " - Vol. i. pp. 134- 136 . In the midst of this pomp of ornament and dress , one is particularly struck by the contrast afforded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - or rather compound of beggar and bandit , - who swarm the streets , making it not only annoying , but oftentimes dangerous , to go abroad without an escort , particularly in the less frequented avenues and suburbs . The book contains many striking stories of this anomalous class of personages , as well as of the more daring marauders , for which we can not find space , but which show such a total // absence of a police , as seems scarcely compatible with the existence of society . The following little anecdote shows the amiable terms on which the gentlemen of the road and of the robe stand with one another in Mexico . It is certainly very much i l'Espagnole . " Apropos to which , the Consul told us the other day , that some time ago , having occasion to consult Judge - upon an affair of importance , he was shown into an apartment where that functionary was engaged in conversation with some suspicious-looking individuals , or rather who were above suspicion , their appearance plainly indicating their calling . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pistols , and *l1 sorts of arms . the Judge requested Monsieur de to be seated , observing , that he was investigating a case of robbery committed by these persons . The robbers were seated , smoking very much at their ease , and tbe Judge was enjoying the same innocent recreation ; when his cigar becoming extinguished , one of these gentlemen , taking his from his mouth , handed it to the magistrate , who relighted his puro ( cigar ) at it , and returned it with a polite bow . In short , they were completely hand and glove . " - Vol. i. pp. 239 , 240 . Among the objects of greatest interest in the capital , are its religious houses , still continued in all their primitive rigor , and the more curious from the difficulty now of meeting with similar specimens in Europe . They , indeed , seem to carry us back to the twilight of the sixteenth century , in the early part of difficult to natives , still more so to foreigners . Our author 's position secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in every other quarter . In one of these convents , she witnessed the ceremony of taking the veil . It has been often described ; but we have never seen a picture of the domestic distress , occasioned by the separation of the destined " bride of Christ " from her family , painted with such touching interest , as in the following passages . " I had almost made up my mind to see no more such scenes , which , unlike puique and bull-fights , I dislike more and more upon trial ; when we received an invitation , which it was not easy to refuse , hut was the more painful to accept , being acquainted , though slightly , with the victim . I send you the printed note of invitation . // " On Wednesday , the - of this month , at six o'clock in the evening , my daughter , Dofia Maria de Ia Concepcion , P-e - , will assume the habit of a Nun of the choir and the black veil in the Convent of Our Lady of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , intreating you to cooperate with your presence in the solemnity of this act , a favor which will he highly esteemed by your affectionate servant , who kisses your hand . " MARIA JOsEFA tiE " Mexico , June - , 1840 . ' " Having gone out in the carriage to pay some visits , I suddenly recollected , that it was the very morning of the day in which this young girl was to take the veil , and also , that it was necessary to inquire where I was to be placed ; for , as to entering the church with the crowd on one of these occasions , it is out of the question ; particularly when , the girl being , as in the present case , of distinguished family , the ceremony is expected to be peculiarly magnificent . I accordingly called at the house , was shown up stairs , and , to my horror , found myself in the midst of a goodlie companie , ' in rich array , consisting of the relations of the family , to the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purple robes and amethysts , a number of priests , the father of the young lady in his general 's uniform ; she herself in purple velvet , with diamonds and pearls , and a crown of flowers ; the corsage of her gown entirely covered with little bows of ribband of divers colors , which her friends had given her ; each adding one , like stones thrown on a cairn in memory of the departed . She had , also , short sleeves and white satin shoes . " Being very handsome , with fine black eyes , good teeth , and fresh color , and , above all , with the beauty of youth , for she was but eighteen , she was not disfigured , even by this overloaded dress . Her mother , on the contrary , who was to act the part of Madrina , who wore a dress fac-simile , and who was pale and sad , her eyes almost extinguished with weeping , looked like a picture of misery in a ball-dress . In the adjoining room , long tables were laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fite about to be given on this joyous occasion . I felt somewhat shocked , and inclined to say , with Paul Pry , Hope I do n't intrude . ' But my apologies were instantly cut short , and I was *velcomed with true Mexican hospitality repeatedly thanked for my kindness in coming to see the nun , and hospitably pressed to join the family feast . I only got off upon a promise of returning at half past five , to accompany them to the ceremony , which , in fact , I greatly preferred to going there alone . // " I arrived at the hour appointed , and , being led up stairs by the Senator Don , found the morning party , with many additions , lingering over the dessert . There was some gayety , hut evidently forced . It reminded me of a marriagefeast , previous to the departure of the bride , who is about to be separated from her family for the first time . Yet how different in fact this banquet , where the mother and daughter met together for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , the mother may hear her daughter 's voice , speaking to her as from the depths of the tomb ; but she may never more fold her in her arms , never more share in her joys or in her sorrows , or nurse her in sickness ; and when her own last hour arrives , though but a few streets divide them , she may not give her dying blessing to the child , who has been , for so many years , the pride of her eyes and heart . " I have seen no country , where families are so knit together as in Mexico , where the affections are so concentrated , or where such devoted respect and obedience are shown by the married sons and daughters to their parents . In that respect , they always remain as little children . I know many families , of which the married branches continue to live in their father 's house , forming a sort of small colony , and living in the most perfect harmony . They can not bear the idea of being separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave theirfatlterland . To all the accounts , which travellers give them , of the pleasures to be met with in European capitals , they turn a deaf ear . Their families are in Mexico , their parents , and sisters , and relatives , and there is no happiness for them elsewhere . The greater , therefore , is the sacrifice , which those parents make , who , from religious motives , devote their daughters to a conventual life . however , was furious at the whole affair , which , he said , was entirely against the mother 's consent , though that of the father had been obtained ; and pointed out to me the confessor , whose influence had brought it about . The girl herself was now very pale , but evidently resolved to conceal her agitation , and the mother seemed as if she could shed no more tears , - quite exhausted with weeping . As the hour for the ceremony drew near , the whole party became more grave and sad , all but the priests , who were smiling and talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . She kept walking hastily through the house , taking leave of the servants , and naming , probably , her last wishes about every thing . She was followed by her younger sisters , all in tears . " But it struck six , and the priests intimated that it was time // to move . She and her mother went down stairs alone , and entered the carriage , which was to drive them through all the principal streets , to show the nun to the public , according to custom , and to let them take their last look , they of her , and she of them . As they got in , we all crowded to the balconies to see her take leave of her house , her aunts saying , Yes , child , despidete de tu casa , take leave of your house , for you will never see it again ! Then came sobs from the sisters , and many of the gentlemen , ashamed of their emotion , hastily quitted the room . I hope , for the sake of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish , which the poor girl threw from the window of the carriage at the home of her childhood . " They drove off , and the relations prepared to walk in procession to the church . I walked with the Count S-o ; the others followed in pairs . The church was very brilliantly illuminated , and , as we entered , the band was playing one of Strauss*s waltzes ! The crowd was so tremendous , that we were nearly squeezed to a jelly in getting to our places . I was carried off my feet between two fat Sei*ioras in mantillas and shaking diamond pendants , exactly as if I had been packed between two movable feather beds . " They gave me , however , an excellent place , quite close to the grating , beside the Countess de S-o , that is to say , a place to kneel on . A great bustle and much preparation seemed to be going on within the convent , and veiled figures were flitting about , whispering , arranging , &amp;c . Sometimes a skinny old dame would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veil , bestow upon the pensive public a generous view of a very haughty and very wrinkled visage of some seventy years standing , and beckon into the church for the major-domo of the convent , ( an excellent and profitable situation by the way , ) or for Padre this or that . Some of the holy ladies recognised and spoke to me through the grating . " But , at the discharge of fireworks outside the church , the curtain was dropped , for this was the signal , that the nun and her mother had arrived . An opening was made in the crowd , as they passed into the church , and the girl , kneeling down , was questioned by the Bishop , but I could not make out the dialogue , which was carried on in a low voice . She then passed into the convent by a side door , and her mother , quite exhausted and nearly in hysterics , was supported through the crowd to a place beside us , in front of the grating . The music struck up the curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , as in the convent of Santa Teresa , but not so lugubri // ous . The nuns , all ranged around and carrying lighted tapers in their hands , were dressed in mantles of bright blue , with a gold plate on the left shoulder . Their faces , however , were covered with deep black veils . The girl , kneeling in front , and also bearing a heavy lighted tnper , looked beautiful , with her dark hair and rich dress , and the long black lashes resting on her glowing face . The churchmen near the illuminated and magnificently-decked altar , formed , as usual , a brilliant background to the picture . The ceremony was the same , as on the former occasion , but there was no sermon . " The most terrible thing to witness , was the last , straining , anxious look , which the mother gave her daughter through the *ratino She had seen her child pressed to the arms of stran * a. gers , and welcomed to her new home . She was no longer hers . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had been forced to consign her , in the very bloom of youth and beauty , at the very age in which she most required a mother 's care , and when she had but just fulfilled the promise of her childhood , to a living tomb . Still , as long as the curtain had not fallen , she could gaze upon her , as upon one , on whom , though dead , the coffin-lid is not yet closed . " But , while the new-made nun was in a blaze of light , and distinct on the foreground , so that we could mark each varying expression of her face , the crowd in the church , and the comparative faintness of the light , probably , made it difficult for her to distinguish her mother ; for , knowing that the end was at hand , she looked anxiously and hurriedly into the church , without seeming able to fix her eyes on any particular object ; while her mother seemed , as if her eyes were glazed , so intently were they fixed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down fell the black curtain , like a pall , and the sobs and tears of the family broke forth . One beautiful little child was carried out almost in fits . Water was brought to the poor mother ; and , at last , making our way with difficulty through the dense crowd , we got into the sacristy . I declare , ' said the Countess - to me , wiping her eyes , it is worse than a marriage ! I expressed my horror at the sacrifice of a girl so young , that she could not possibly have known her own mind . Almost all the ladies agreed with me , especially all who had daughters , but many of the old gentlemen were of a different opinion . The young men were decidedly of my way of thinking ; but many young girls , who were conversing together , seemed rather to envy their friend , who had looked so pretty and graceful , and so happy , ' and whose dress suited her so well ' ; and to have no objection to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 300 - 307. // The situation might well have excited commiseration , if we can judge from the interior discipline of another convent , Santa Teresa , visited by Madame Calderon . " We found that the nuns had permission to put up their veils , rarely allowed in this order in the presence of strangers . They have a small garden and fountain , plenty of flowers , and some fruit ; hut all is on a smaller scale , and sadder , than in the Convent of the Incarnation . The refectory is a large room with a long narrow table running all round it ; a plain deal table with wooden benches ; before the place of each nun , an earthen bowl , an earthen cup with an apple in it , a wooden plate and a wooden spoon ; - at the top of the table a grinning skull , to remind them that even these indulgences they shall not long enjoy . " In one corner of the room is a reading-desk , a sort of elevated pulpit , where one reads aloud from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare . They showed us a crown of thorns which , on certain days , is worn by one of their number , by way of penance . It is made of iron , so that the nails entering inwards , run into the head , and make it bleed . XVhile she wears this on her head , a sort of wooden bit is put into her mouth , and she lies prostrate on her face till dinner is ended ; and while in this condition , her food is given her , of which she eats as much as she can , which probably is none . " We visited the different cells , and were horror-struck at the self-inflicted tortures . Each bed consists of a wooden plank raised in the middle , and on days of penitence , crossed by wooden bars . The pillow is wooden , with a cross lying on it , which they hold in their hands when they lie down . The nun lies on this penitential couch , embracing the cross , and her feet hanging out ; as the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her waist she occasionally wears a band with iron points turning inwards ; on her breast a cross with nails , of which the points enter the flesh , of the truth of which I had melancholy ocular demonstration . Then , after having scourged herself with a whip covered with iron nails , she lies down for a few hours on the wooden bars , and rises at four o'clock . All these instruments of discipline , which each nun keeps in a little box beside her bed , look as if their fitting place would be in the dungeons of the Inquisition . They made me try their lied and board , which I told them would give me a very decided taste for early rising . " Yet they all seem as cheerful as possible , though it must be confessed , that many of them look pale and unhealthy . It is said , that , when they are strong enough to stand this mode of // life , they live very long ; but it frequently happens that girls who come into this convent , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expiration of their noviciate. " - Vol. ii . pp. 10 , 11 . Yet the penance of the unfortunate recluse was not more severe , than that voluntarily incurred at certain seasons by the gay inhabitants of the capital , as the following thrilling description will show . " But the other night I was present at a much stranger scene , at the discipline performed by the men ; admission having been procured for us by certain means , private but powerful . Accordingly when it was dark , enveloped from head to foot in large cloaks , and without the slightest idea of what it was , we went on foot through the streets to the church of San Agustin . When we arrived , a small side door apparently opened of itself , and we entered , passing through long vaulted passages , and up steep winding stairs , till we found ourselves in a small railed gallery , looking down directly upon the church . The scene was curious . About one hundred and fifty men , enveloped in cloaks and sarapes , their faces entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A monk had just mounted the pulpit , and the church was dimly lighted , except where he stood in bold relief , with his gray robes and co*vl thrown back , giving a full view of his high bald forehead and expressive face . " His discourse was a rude but very forcible and eloquent description of the torments prepared in hell for impenitent sinners . The effect of the whole was very solemn . It appeared like a preparation for the execution of a multitude of condemned criminals . When the discourse was finished , they all joined in prayer with much fervor and enthusiasm , beating their breasts and falling upon their faces . Then the monk stood up , and , in a very distinct voice , read several passages of Scripture descriptive of the sufferings of Christ . The organ then struck up the Miserere , and all of a sudden the church was plunged in profound darkness ; all but a sculptured representation of the Crucifixion , which seemed to hang in the air illuminated . I felt rather frightened , and would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been impossible in the darkness . Suddenly , a terrible voice in the dark , cried ; My brothers ! when Christ was fastened to the pillar by the Jews , he was scourged ! ' At these words , the bright figure disappeared , and the darkness became total . Suddenly , we heard the sound of hundreds of scourges descending upon the bare flesh . I can not conceive of any thing more horrible . Before ten minutes had passed , the sound became splashing , from the blood that was flowing . // " I have heard of these penitences in Italian churches , and also that half of those who go there , do not really scourge themselves ; but here , where there is such perfect concealment , there seems no motive for deception . Incredible ns it may seem , this awful penance continued , without intermission , for half an hour ! If they scourged each other , their energy might be less astonishing . " We could not leave the church , but it was perfectly sickening ; and , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  s hand , and feel something human beside me , I could have fancied myself transported into a congregation of evil spirits . Now and then , but very seldom , a suppressed groan was heard , and occasionally the voice of the monk , encouraging them by ejaculations , or by short passages from Scripture . Sometimes the organ struck up , and the poor wretches in a faint voice tried to join in the Miserere . The sound of the scourging is indescribable . At the end of half an hour , a little bell was rung , and the voice of the monk was heard , calling upon them to desist ; but such was their enthusiasm , that the horrible lashing continued louder and fiercer than ever . " In vain he entreated them not to kill themselves ; and assured them that Heaven would be satisfied , and that human nature could not endure beyond a certain point . No answer , hut the loud sound of the scourges , which are many of them of iron , with sharp points that enter the flesh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound grew fainter , and , little by little , ceased altogether . We then got up in the dark , and , with great difficulty , groped our way in the pitch darkness through the galleries and down the stairs , till we reached the door , and had the pleasure of feeling the fresh air again . They say that the church floor is frequently covered with blood after one of these penances , and that a man died the other day in consequence of his wounds . " I then went to the house of the  --  Minister , where there was a reunion , and where I found the company comfortably engaged in eating a very famous kind of German salad , composed of herrings , smoked salmon , cold potatoes , and apples , ( salma. gundi ? ) and drinking hot punch . After the cold , darkness , and horrors of the church , this formed rather a contrast ; and it was some time before I could shake off the disagreeable im pression left by the desagravios , and join in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from scenes of penance to scenes of pleasure in this motley capital , where merry mummeries and mortifications , fastings and fetes , chase one another in continual circle , converting the city alternately into a carnival // scene , and a house of correction . This may be well for the stranger , who sees novelty succeeding to novelty , xvhile he is present at one long but ever-shifting spectacle . But for the people , thus eternally occupied with the pantomime rehearsal of the events of Scripture history , instead of the real and practical duties of the life before them , their days pass away in a round of busy idleness , in which ceremony takes place of conduct , and empty form of substance . With all their show of penitence and voluntary penance , the higher classes of Mexico are as frivolous , and the lower as corrupt , - probably more corrupt , than in any capital in Christendom . But we are already exceeding our limits , which we regret will allow us no room for further quotation . Enough has been done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . We have given , however , but a faint idea of the richness and singular variety of its topics , which , far from being confined to the capital , embrace various excursions in the environs and in distant parts of the country , - two of them of a bold and singularly romantic character , made on horseback for the distance of near a thousand miles . The work contains , moreover , the account of two stormy revolutions in the capital , the stirring events of which quicken the interest of the narrative , and prevent any of the languor stealing over it , which might grow out of a picture , too prolonged , it might be , of unbroken tranquillity . The present volumes make no pretensions to enlarge the boundaries of our knowledge in respect to the mineral products of the country , its geography , its statistics , or , in short , to physical or political science . These topics have been treated with more or less depth by the various travellers , who have written since the great publications of Humboldt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their productions . And we may safely assert , that for spirited portraiture of society , - a society unlike any thing existing in the Old World , or the New , - for picturesque delineation of scenery , for richness of illustration and anecdote , and for the fascinating graces of style , no one of them is to be compared with Life in Mexico@@184059109.txt IT has always been a defect of the social system , that a part of the population is dependent upon the rest for the means of subsistence . It is as true in the nineteenth , as it was in the first century , " The poor ye have always with you " ; and the question , which has been asked by statesmen of all ages and of all countries , " What can best be done with them ? " remains as yet without a satisfactory answer . In its early stages ; society disposes of the question summarily , ridding itself of the old and the helpless by violence or exposure ; but with advancing civilization better feelings are developed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They preserve the feeble in life , and pauperism appears . The first efforts for the relief of the dependent , are generally the dictates of blind feeling , unenlightened by intellect , and therefore they often fail of their object . hence we see private charity , and charitable institutions , often disappointing the hopes of the benevolent ; and vast and expensive systems for the relief of the poor are entailed upon society , which are of doubtful efficacy , if they do not act as positive premiums upon pauperism . At any rate , so many difficulties surround the subject , and so manifest has been the failure of public systems for the support of the poor , that many wise and good men question their expediency ; and they adduce powerful arguments to show that society , as such , should never step forth to relieve want , which could have been foreseen and provided against , or to assume responsibilities and cares , which should devolve upon individuals . It is maintained , and with much plausibility , that private charity is the natural source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it would be sufficient for all purposes , if society , by assuming the charge of the poor , did not prevent its exercise , and thus check its developement . Be this as it may , it is certain , that theye are many cases of want or suffering , which in the present state of society could not have been foreseen or avoided by the victims ; which private charity is not competent to relieve ; and the care of which certainly // devolves upon society , especially as some of them are caused by its defective organization . Hence arises the obligation of society to provide for , and instruct helpless orphans , the blind , and the deaf-mutes , and to take care of the insane . It is of this last class that we propose to say a few words in the following article . Of all the ills which flesh is heir to , there is perhaps none so dreadful as insanity . Utter poverty , hideous deformity , mutilation of limbs , deafness , blindness , all these , sad as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consolations of sympathy and love ; while insanity not only makes man utterly dependent upon others for the supply of his physical wants , but it strips him of the noblest attributes of humanity . It so utterly sears bis heart , that no affection for another can grow upon it , no love from others can penetrate within it ; and the unhappy victim sinks into apathetic indifference to common decency , or is so excited as to crush the life out of the mother who bore him , as coolly as he would trample upon a worm . Of insane persons and idiots , there are , in the United Statos , according to the census of 1840 , 17,434 ; in New England 3,576 ; and in Massachusetts , 1,271 . Of these last , 644 are at public charge , and 627 at private charge . But , appalling as this statement is , it is unfortunately short of the truth , for the Pauper Abstract , published by the State authority in the same year , gave 887 as the number at public charge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town officers , besides a personal acquaintance with all the individuals in their neighbourhood , have the means of knowing , from the town records , how many insane are at public charge ; while the United States Marshals , embracing larger sections , and taking hearsay evidence , miss those cases in which persons are ashamed to own they have an insane relative . The same discrepancy has occurred in other States , whence local returns have been made ; so that we are safe in putting down the insane and idiots of Massachusetts , who are at public charge , to be at least 887. * There are no * It is to be regretted , that the United States census is vitiated by carelessness in regard to the statistics of insanity . For instance , the number of insane , among colored people of certain towns , is put down as greeter tka*s the whole number of colored people in the same towns ; this is the case with nine towns in Maine , twelve in Michigan , one in Iowa , ten in Illinois , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ census in regard to the number of those at private charge , which it states to be 627 ; but , the same causes for concealment operating still more strongly than in the case of the paupers , we may safely add to it in the same proportion , and compute the real number to be at least 862 ; which , added to that of the paupers , gives us the number of 1749 insane and idiots in this Commonwealth . AThat is the duty of the State towards these its unfortunate children ? With regard to the paupers it is clear and imperative ; it is what should be the duty of every Christian government , - to provide the best means for the cure of the curable , and to take kind care of the incurable . This duty of society , besides being urged by every consideration of humanity , will be seen to be more imperative if we consider that insanity is in many cases the result of imperfect or vicious social institutions and observances . Most writers assert , that insanity is not known among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly true , it can not be denied that civilization , in its progress , is rife with causes which over-excite individuals , and result in the loss of mental equilibrium . We have hardly space to allude to all of these ; but among them are revolutions , party strifes , unwise and capricious legislation , causing commercial speculations and disasters ; false standards of worth and rank ; undue encouragement of the propensities and passions ; social rivalry ; social intemperance ; some fashions and conventional usages ; religious and political excitement . These , and a variety of other causes , for which society is in fault , are productive of a large proportion of the cases of insanity which exist in its bosom . But if to these we add the still larger number , which arise from ignorance of the natural laws , which ignorance society should enlighten by providing proper public instruction , we can fairly lay at its door almost all of the cases of insanity which occur . There is , of course , some uncertainty about the proportion in Indiana , thirty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticut ; three in Vermont ; sixteen in Ne*v York ; and nine in New Hampshire ; nevertheless , the sums total of the whole State , are less than the more careful returns by local authorities of pauper statistics . We have found some errors also , though not important ones , in the return of blind persons . // of the insane to the whole population in large countries ; but the researches of scientific men have been sufficiently accurate for pretty near approximation to the truth ; and from these we learn , that , as a general rule , insanity is unknown among savage , and rare among barbarous nations , and that among civilized people it is most frequent where there is , if not the highest civilization , the greatest intensity of mental action . In Holland the insane are in proportion to the whole pop ulation about as . . 1 to 1233 . " France . . . . 1 " 1000 . " England . . . . 1 " 793 . " Scotland . . . . 1 " 563 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut . . . . 1 " 425 . " Massachusetts . . . 1 " 421 . This proportion , drawn from recent authorities , may not be exact to a fraction ; but we believe it to be about the true one . It would not seem , at first , to correspond with the difference of national character ; and yet in reality it does . An incident , which in a town of France or Italy would gather an eager , animated , excited crowd , would , in New England , attract the attention of a few quiet , cold , and silent observers ; but , long after the former had forgotten it , tbe latter would be pondering it deeply , and drawing from it a subject for moralizing or speculating . The Bourse of Paris , and the commercial marts of other European cities , will be filled with a bustling throng of agitated men , whose flashing eyes , shrill voices , and violent gesticulations would seem to indicate an intense anxiety about some daring speculation , or some momentous enterprise ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , you shall see men of the same class , engaged in bolder speculations , and more important enterprises , who yet are cool , and taciturn , and cautious . But follow the same groups to their evening occupations , and you will find the former enjoying a convivial dinner , or laughing at a comedy , while many of the latter are leaning their feverish heads upon their hands , and still pondering , with intense thought , upon the means of carrying on their bold schemes . We , of the North , are called a cold-blooded people ; and it may be so ; but the blood rushes with the momentum , as // well as the coldness , of quicksilver , through our veins . We live upon the high-pressure principle within , and pile on additional atmospheres of caution and reserve without , in order to prevent an explosion . Men walk the streets with measured gait and solemn aim , looking as stiff as a steamboat boiler , but , like that , perhaps , are heaving with an inward force just ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no dogma so contracted , no scheme so wild , but cold and iron men will embrace and cherish it , with " all the zeal , Which young and fiery converts feel . " They wait not until a cloud , as big as a man 's hand , shall portend that it is to cover the firmament , but the very specks on their finger nails , steadily regarded , soon grow big enough to exclude every thing else from their mental horizon . Then , the general and exciting struggle for wealth , with all its exhilarating hopes , its sudden reverses , its constant fluctuations ; and the more general anxiety for the good opinion of others , which twists so many into false positions , represses so many natural impulses , and gives so much care and anxiety ahout appearances . But , be the causes what they may , here , within the precincts of Massachusetts , are more than seventeen hundred human beings , our felloxv-citizens , who are insane or idiotic and of these , eight hundred and eighty-seven are entirely dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of keeping out of fire and water , and for restraint from imbruing their hands in the blood of their fellows . And how does the public discharge its duty towards them ? The State makes provision , in its noble establishment at Worcester , for 229 patients , but the poor do not have the sole benefit of this ; and the County of Suffolk provides for 100 more , in its commodious and excellent Hospital at South Boston . The others , over 500 in number , are , for the most part , in the almshouses and the jails . We select , for description , the establishment at South Boston , as we knew it under the excellent management of Dr. Butler , because its patients are wholly of the pauper class . The building is a commodious and pleasant one , constructed expressly for the purpose , with all the modern improvements , and pleasantly situated upon the seashore , with a garden in front . Its inmates were of the worst and // most hopeless class of cases ; they were the raving madmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of the inspectors , * we had formerly seen , " tearing their clothes amid severe cold , lacerating their bodies , contracting most filthy habits , without self-control , unable to restrain the worst feelings , endeavouring to injure those who approached them , giving vent to their irritation in the most passionate , profane , and filthy language ; fearing and feared , hating and almost hated " Now , they are all neatly clad by day , and comfortably lodged in separate rooms by night . They walk quietly , and with self-respect , about the spacious and airy halls , or sit in listening groups around the daily paper ; or they dig in the garden , or handle edge-tools , or stroll about the neighbourhood with kind and careful attendants . They attend soberly and reverently upon religious exercises , and make glad music with their united voices . Such is the situation of the insane and idiots of the city of Boston ; and although only 28 out of 171 have been cured , and the rest will probably wear out their lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessing the great amount of animal happiness they enjoy , in seeing the kind regard paid to prostrate humanity , - the respect shown to the deserted temple of reason . It is only , as it were , twining fresh flowers on the graves of the dead ; still it is a grateful sight to the humane , and a more certain indication of high civilization , than the most refined taste in literature and the arts , or the most fastidious observance of social etiquette . But , alas ! such is not the picture presented by the insane in most other parts of our Commonwealth ; for , saving those at Worcester , they are incarcerated in the same prisons with criminals ; they are immured in narrow and cheerless cells they are under the charge of ignorant and sometimes of depraved persons ; or they are in the almshouses , shut up in cold and cheerless rooms , sometimes chained to the walls , often confined in narrow cages , without a chair or bed , and with nothing but the straw on which they lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey an adequate idea of the utterly forlorn and degraded condition , to which scores and hundreds of our brethren are reduced ; we will , therefore , give some particular cases , which we have ourselves // witnessed , during the last three months , in places within thirty miles of Boston . In one of these towns we approached a large old building , like a farmhouse , and were about to inquire for the poorhouse , when our attention was attracted by a sort of cage or pen , constructed at the end of a wood-shed , facing upon the road . The thought occurred , that it might be the cage of an insane person . We dismounted and approached the place , and , looking through the bars , found it was a cage about six feet square . The floor was covered with trampled straw ; and we saw only an old , ragged , and filthy coverlet , in one corner ; but , as we looked more narrowly at this , a sudden motion of one side of it disclosed the head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as soon as the glaring eyes had been fixed for an instant upon us . The first shock was too painful to be described ; to find humanity so utterly degraded , to see a human being crouching , like a wild beast in his lair , caged up by the side of the public road , exposed to the gaze of every passer by , unwashed , unshaven , unshorn , with no covering but a filthy coverlet , with not even a cup of water by his side , was revolting beyond measure . Having found the keeper of the house , we unfastened the door of the cage and entered it . There was no article of furniture at all ; nothing but the straw , with here and there a stale crust of bread . The poor inmate was crouching in a corner , and drawn up in the smallest possible space ; he would not speak nor niove , except when we attempted gently to uncover his head , which he would bury in the folds of his rotten coverlet , and by his motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiries concerning his history , and found , that he was about forty years old ; that he had once been the owner of a small farm in the neighbourhood ; that he had suffered , or supposed he had suffered , grievous wrong , and had become a maniac ; he had been sent to a hospital , but was returned upon the town as incurable , and put into this den , probably for life . The keeper did not seem to be an inhuman man , but was ignorant , and utterly unfit for the care of the insane . On being asked , how he managed him , he replied , that h'e had now no difficulty , and " had not licked him for over a year ! " - that at first he " had a fight with him , and had to knock him down four times // before he could master him ; " and that " since then he had been obedient . " He added , however , that the overseers of the poor had charged him never to strike the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in a shed adjoining the almshouse , and in an inclosure twelve feet long by about eight feet wide , made with oak plank and without any window , a middle-aged man , stark mad , and in a state of entire nudity . His condition was about the same as that of the poor creature last described , except that his pen was larger , and was not exposed to the gaze of every passer-by ; but he was in a state of entire privation of all the comforts , and even of the common decencies , of life . The almshouse was clean , and the keeper 's family seemed worthy , humane people , who took good care of all the inmates , except the poor wretch in the shed ; for him , they seemed to think they had done all , when they thrust through the narrow opening in his cage , his daily allowance of food and drink . In another town , the keeper of the almshouse conducted us to a small out-building , where we found a young man of fair complexion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a statue against the wall , and his eyes cast sadly down upon the trampled straw , which was the only furniture of his solitary pen . Around his bare neck was an iron collar , from which hung a heavy iron chain , by which he was fastened to the wall . He had been crossed in love had become a maniac ; was pronounced incurable , sent back upon the town , and chained up , for life , perhaps , like a wild hyena . Yet he seemed not to be dangerous ; we approached him , spoke to him , lifted his chain , and examined his condition . The keeper seemed to be a respectable farmer , and was disposed to do what he could for the sufferer , but that was nothing . In another town , on inquiring at the almshouse , we were informed that there was one insane woman confined there . On requesting to see her , some reluctance was manifested , and a person was sent up stairs to make her decent , and to give her some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was naked . We followed the attendant and found , in a large room , an old woman lying in bed , apparently near her end , and , on the other side of the room , a woman about forty years of age , extended upon the floor and covered with an old rug . This was the insane person , whom we found to be not // furious , but quiet and timid . She was reluctant to rise ; but , when she did so , we found that she was chained by the leg , and fastened to the wall . And this because the town would not afford the gentle sufferer an attendant to keep her out of harm ; for we were told that she was not dangerous , but that she would wander about , or divest herself of her clothes , and perhaps hurt herself , and therefore they chained her up . On a visit to the prison and almshouse in yet another town , we found twenty-two lunatics in the former , and three in the latter . Those in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lodging ; but were mixed up without any regard to classification , and without any proper care , so that the mild and curable might soon become as bad as the worst . At the almshouse , far away from the inhabited part of the building , in a sort of shed , were built up three cages , in one of which was confined a poor drivelling idiot , - cold , filthy , and neglected . Opposite to him was a strong middle-aged man , storming up and down in his dismal and dirty pen , brandishing his naked arms , and blaspheming at the top of his voice . In the next enclosure , separated only by coarse plank , which hardly obstructed vision , was a poor , trembling , comely girl , scarcely seventeen years old . She was not insane , nor entirely idiotic , they said , but only silly . And for this she was confined in a pen , far away from any of her sex ; in close proximity with a half naked , yelling maniac , and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sad sights we saw in that town , the image of this poor girl will rest longest on the memory . As we unfastened the door of her wretched apartment , and entered it , she slunk trembling away , and crouched whining in a corner and , as we stretched out a hand toward her , she screamed , as if anticipating a blow ; but , when we placed it gently on her head , and spoke in kindly tones to her , the screams subsided into a giggling laugh , which was not so silly but that it indicated pleasure , and we thought gratitude , for unexpected kindness . We could furnish many other cases of almost equal horror , which we have ourselves witnessed ; and , should we be allowed to make extracts from the journal of a friend , who has traversed every part of Massachusetts on an errand of mercy , and taken note of the condition of the inmates of jails and almshouses , we could fill a volume ; but enough has been // said , we trust , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in behalf of the effort now making to provide comfortable accommodations for all the insane of this State . And , if there be any whose zeal should wane , after they have closed these pages , let them think of that poor girl whom we have described , - not indeed as we have feebly portrayed her , but as she is now , when night comes on , and she is left in darkness , and crouches down trembling upon her straw , and stops her ears as she hears the strong maniac howling in the next pen , and perhaps smiting with heavy fists upon the boards which make their only separation ; and let them reflect that there are many such cases of misery among us ; that they themselves , or , what they would account worse , some sister or friend , may one day be brought into the like situation . It may be asked , Is it possible that the inhabitants of Massachusetts are so ignorant or so inhuman as to allow such treatment ? We answer they are neither ignorant nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion of their insane than any other large community in the world ; and a careful investigation would show , that in other States of this Union , and in other countries , the condition of the insane , out of the public hospitals , is quite as bad , if not worse than it is in our almshouses and jails . Indeed , from cases which have fallen under our observation , we are inclined to think it is worse ; and we could give some descriptions that would shock every sensitive mind . We shall , however , insert only one case in this country , described by Dr. Jarvis , who says he once saw in Pennsylvania , in 1837 , a poor female confined in a restraining chair made of plank ; one strap confined each arm , another the waist , and another passed over the thighs and held her down to her narrow prison . This girl was in a state of furious excitement ; she was using the greatest struggles to extricate herself ; she was kicking up her feet , endeavouring to strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spat on any one within reach ; she was the very image of a ragmg fury ; and we were told that she had been in this excitement for three years , and the same means of straps and chairs had been as long used to calm her ! We trust a similar instance can not be found elsewhere in America . " * And this was in the great Blockley Almshouse Hospital , // under the care of the medical professors of the University of Pennsylvania , who take their crowds of students round to teach them practically the treatment of disease . What then must be the condition of the insane in remote and small almshouses . In Great Britain , it is well known how deplorable was the condition of the insane a few years ago . Browne , a writer of authority , says , that " the accommodations in the Asylum at Limerick appear to be such as we should not appropriate for our dog-kennels . " In the mass of evidence elicited by a Parliamentary Report , it is said , one victim was confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had evidently not been in the open air for a considerable time ; for , when I made them bring him out , he could not endure the light . Upon asking him , how often he had been allowed to get out of the trough , he said , perhaps once a week , and sometimes not for a fortnight . ' He was not in the least violent ; he was perfectly calm . " Miss Martinean , in her account of the Hanwell Asylum , gives some instances of prejudice and inhumanity , which it would be hard to match in this country . Not only were the convalescent patients forbidden to worship in the church , but they could not ride out in the neighbourhood , lest the delicate nerves of the inhabitants should be shocked . " A pony chaise had been procured by the superintendent of the insane asylum , in order to present a temptation to many of the patients to prolong their excursions to a distance , and to enable the weak or indolent to diversify their walks within the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against such an invasion of their rights , such a destruction of their comforts . They could not , forsooth , so delicate was their sensibility , bear the sight of mad people . The circumstance was again attended to , and the lunatic is again deprived of his transient glimpses of happiness , of his visits to what is literally to him another world . " * Esquirol says , of the insane in France , " I have seen them naked or covered with rags , with nothing but a layer of straw to protect them from the cold dampness of the ground upon which they lay . They were kept upon food of the coarsest kind ; they were deprived of fresh air to breathe , // and of water to quench their thirst , and even of the most necessary things of life . I have seen them given up to the brutal supervision of jailers . I have seen them in their narrow cells , filthy and unwholesome , without air or light , chained in such dens as one might hesitate to confine ferocious beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the less civilized countries of Europe , the condition of the insane is no better ; for although , in most of the capitals , asylums have been established upon scientific or humane principles , yet , in the remote districts , all the old horrors are still practised . The Turks have obtained great credit for humanity to the insane , upon as small capital as for other kinds of humanity . We remember to have known a party of them , closely besieged in a castle , and suffering for water , to let down their donkeys and mules by ropes from the walls , and permit them to fall into the hands of their besiegers rather than to kill them or let them feel the want of water ; and we should have supposed them to be merciful , had we not known that they retained their Christian captives , and saw them going round at daybreak , licking from the stones the little moisture that had been deposited in the night , and gradually perishing with thirst . As for their alleged respect for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about , and they pay them a certain superstitious attention , which is sometimes respect , and sometimes mockery . But , the moment they suppose them dangerous , they chain them up ; and this not out of regard to the insane , or to others , but to themselves ; for the infidels do not chain up their fierce dogs , which , in the time of our perigrinations , at least , were more to be feared than the lunatics , by all but their own masters . As for the medical attention , which they pay to their confined lunatics , we never heard of any other than the administration of a broth made of snakes at every frill moon ; while for the moral treatment , that is told by the clanking of chains , the cracking of whips , and the shrieks of the inmates , which may be heard without the walls of the hospital of Cairo , and of the Timarhane of Constantinople . But the short-comings of others are no excuse for our own ; and although we believe , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth has made comfortable provision for so large a proportion of the insane , as has the State of // Massachusetts , still far be it from the citizens of that liberal Commonwealth to say , pharisaically , in extenuation of any fault , " We are not as other men . " The evil is before them it is in their power to remove it ; it is clearly their duty to remove it ; and , although no provision at all were made for the insane out of their territory , they should not leave one unprovided for within it . To say nothing , then , of the 813 insane who are not paupers , and for whom society should provide proper receptacles , although the State is not strictly bound to do so , there are 887 lunatics and idiots who are pauper dependents upon the public . Of these , 250 can be received at Worcester ( hy crowding ) , 125 at South Boston , and perhaps 25 at the McLean Asylum . What shall be done with the remaining 487 ? It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the number that can he cured , and thus taken from public charge , the expense of keeping them in hospitals would soon be less than under the present system ; for , in the words of the Inspectors of the Boston Hospital , " although a patient costs more in a hospital , than in a house of correction or house of industry , yet the smaller number remaining at one time in a hospital , will , before long , cost much less than the larger number of incurable cases accumulating in a house of correction , or house of industry , under the former system . " But we are not inclined to urge the argument of economy , in the matter of duty so sacred , that , until discharged , we have no right to erect monuments to battles , or public works of art , or even costly temples to God . Under the name of economy , the insane and idiots of our own country , have been , and are now , kept in a state of physical degradation which is painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns their keeping for one year is hired out at public auction , in town meeting , to the man who will agree to keep souls and bodies together for the smallest number of dollars and cents ; and in many others , the selectmen or overseers of the poor of each year , strive to gain popularity by keeping them in the almshouse for a few mills , or cents , cheaper than their predecessors did . Is it not strange , that Christian men can make it a matter of boast , that , with the public purse-strings in their hands , they have kept town paupers alive three hundred and sixty-five days *upon eight cents and five mills per day ? And yet some have done it , and will // do it , so long as people shall look in every thing to others for approval . We maintain , that , in the present state of society , the insane and idiots can not be kept in the almshouse without physical suffering and abuse , and degradation ; without becoming worse themselves , and presenting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much might be said upon the demoralizing influence , upon our children , of thus treating our fellow-creatures . The Spartans , when they made their Helots drunk in public , at least extracted from humanity , which they degraded and crushed , a moral on temperance , for their children ; but we , when we show them a man made in God 's image , degraded below the brutes , less cared for than the horse and the ox , exhibit our own shame , and teach them a lesson of unmitigated immorality . Hence , it is no uncommon thing to have a crowd of boys about an almshouse cage , trying by mockery , and perhaps by throwing stones , to rouse up the unhappy insane man from temporary quiet , or sleep , into raving fury . There are objections equally strong against confining the insane , even those who are incurable , in jails and houses of correction . In answer to a query on this subject Dr. Woodward , of the Massachusetts Lunatic Asylum at Worcester , writes to us thus ; " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition than in the almshouses ; they are crowded together in apartments badly warmed and ventilated ; or they are secluded in some solitary room , cold , dirty , ragged , without society , with bad air to breathe , and scanty and bad food to eat . " Besides , the sense of justice revolts at the thought of incarcerating innocent victims of misfortune in the receptacle of guilt ; and the voice of experience tells us , that when so confined they grow more violent , or sink into dementia , are neglected , and ill treated . The jailers and keepers of houses of correction , may be men of humanity ; but they do not know how to treat insanity any more than they know how to treat scarlet fever ; nor have they the means to do so , provided they did know . County hospitals have been proposed ; but against them every one who is acquainted with the subject will protest , unless indeed they can be so large , and so well endowed as to form independent establishments , with a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who should be exclusively devoted to them . An establishment for the insane // must be a thing by itself ; must have its own peculiar organization , and not be part of , or an appendage to , another institution ; else it will degenerate into a place of mere safekeeping . The County of Essex is now building a house of correction at Ipswich ; and one wing , with six rooms , is to be devoted to lunatics . This we look upon as a misfortune , because we feel confident , that , as a part of the house of correction , this establishment will not be a proper place for the insane . Their treatment will not form , as it should , the sole object of the establishment . It will be a very poor receptacle for the insane , and yet it will make them so much more comfortable than they are now , in a merely physical point of view , that a half-century will elapse before fully adequate provision will be made for them ; because the cost of this building will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no county in Massachusetts ( except perhaps Suffolk ) , where the insane would be deemed numerous enough , or important enough , to require a separate establishment , and the undivided care and attention of a man of eminent talents . Even in that county , indeed , the superintendent is physician to all the other city establishments ; and , we are sorry to add , that there has appeared a disposition on the part of some to curtail this beautiful establishment of its present fair proportions , to reduce its expenses to the minimum cost of keeping soul and body together , and to sink it to a mere receptacle for the safe-keeping of paupers , lunatics , and idiots . On this subject Dr. Woodward writes to us thus ; " The proposed county institutions for the insane , can only be of the nature of insane poor-houses , and can not , in the small counties of the Commonwealth , be provided with the necessary officers , and other means of making them comfortable , without involving an expense greater than that of supporting them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell of the I1*v1cLean Asylum says , " I regard county asylums , and private madhouses , as wholly out of the question. ** What then shall be done ? It seems to us , that several steps are to be taken ; but that the first one should be , to devote the State Hospital to the exclusive accommodation of paupers , in preference to patients who pay . In the last Report from this Institution , it was stated , that one hundred pa // tients were town paupers , thirty were State paupers , and one hundred were paying patients . The total number at this time is two hundred and forty-one , of whom thirty-four are State paupers , seventy-seven town paupers , and one hundred and thirty are paying patients . It is true , that some of this latter class may be indigent , that the towns may now pay part , and hereafter pay all their expenses ; but it is equally true , that some are fully competent to pay their own expenses at other asylums . Now the hospital is full to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Judge of Probate must be received , others must be sent out to make room for them . The trustees discharge such as are selected by the superintendent ; and sometimes it happens , that a pauper , who has no earthly friend , is torn away from what had become to him a comfortable and happy home , and thrust back into the noisome and filthy cage , which had been his prison long years before . We said , he had no earthly friend , but we were wrong . He has what should be a mighty , and kind , and watchful friend of the innocent poor . He has the State , who built this hospital for him , and who should keep him in it , though the wealthiest in the laud were knocking for admission at its doors . Nevertheless , although one hundred and thirty paying patients are now in the hospital , there have been discharged for want of room since December 1st , 1841 , no less than seventy-eight paupers , as incurable ; of whom seventeen would be confessedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been sent to almshouses , and several of them to jails. * The following case , which has just come to our knowledge , will show the fate of many of these poor creatures . Elizabeth Stevens , aged about forty years , was formerly confined as a lunatic , in a jail ; and was as wretched , wild , and ungovernable as such persons usually are , in such places . Five years ago , she was sent to Worcester , where she was quiet and comfortable , decent and happy . She kept her room and her person tidy ; was never violent would employ herself in knitting ; attended church regularly , and , * These numbers are taken from a letter of Dr. Woodward . We have since then seen the returns for the year , up to December 1 st , and find some slight discrepancies , which it is too late to rectify ; they do not , however , affect the principle . // up to the 9th of October last , behaved with propriety . On the 12th of October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carried to the jail of the town . The sight of this roused her to fury , and she refused to enter ; but she was carried in by force , and became again a raving maniac . Since then she has been furious ; has broken up her bucket , burned her straw bed , smashed her bedstead and her windows , stripped off her clothes , attacked the keeper with an iron grate , and committed every possible outrage ; the result probably will be , that she must be chained up , or confined in a cage Far be it from us , to say one word in detraction of the Worcester Hospital , that bright ornament of Massachusetts , among the brightest of those tributes to humanity , of which she has paid so many . Founded as it was , mainly by the disinterested efforts of that philanthropic citizen , who is now so freely expending his remaining energies for the education and elevation of future generations ; and administered , as it has been , with extraordinary energy , benevolence , and skill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has been a haven of rest , and comfort , and joy , to 1557 unfortunate wrecks of humanity , whose rudder of reason was broken , whose mental compass was lost , who were tossed upon the stormy ocean of life , under a darkened sky , and blown about by every gust of passion ; of these , it has sent forth 667 repossessed of their reason , capable of continuing their voyage of life , and of being the guides and protectors of their once fatherless children . High honor then , and thanks , and gratitude , be accorded to the founders and managers of this truly noble charity ; but if , by any means , it can be made to confer its benefits more exclusively upon the poor and destitute , and less upon those who have money and friends , let it be done . We are aware of the difficulties in the way . The law requires , that the furiously mad , who are dangerous to be at large , shall be first admitted ; but , even here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can pay for his care should be obliged to send him to some other hospital , if this be full . It is sometimes difficult to tell who can pay , and who can not ; and it is clear , from the statistics of the establishment , that many poor are excluded , to make room for those more blessed with worldly goods ; but , at // the same time , it is certain , that there is a looseness about the mode of admission . Patients are sometimes carried to Worcester , with a view of being entered as private pay patients ; but when it is found , that they can not be received , unless committed by a judge , the friends then apply to one ; the Judges of Probate can not , or do not , discriminate well in all cases ; and many patients arc doubtless committed as dangerous , who are not so , and whose relatives would send them to other establishments , were it not that the State opens them an asylum of the first class , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That this is the case , is apparent from the statistics , not only of the State Hospital , but of the McLean Asylum . That establishment , which has always been conducted without ostentation , but upon the highest moral principles , and in the most scientific manner , was founded for the benefit of the insane of this State , giving them the preference over strangers . It received , during the five years preceding the establishment of the State Hospital , 409 patients , of whom only 51 , or one-eighth , were from without the State ; while , during the last five years , it received 702 patients , of whom 237 , or one-third of the whole , were from without the State , no application having been refused in either period . Now it would be a waste of words to show , that many patients from Massachusetts , who would have gone there , and paid three or four dollars per week , have been sent to Worcester , not because their chance of cure was any better , but because they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very time , pauper patients were every month sent away from the State Asylum for want of room , and consigned to the cages and chains of almshouses and jails . It may be said they were incurable , but that matters not to us ; the first duty of the State is to the pauper , and he should not be consigned to a cage , though he be incurable , to make way for a curable paying patient . We do not know the views of the Trustees of the McLean Asylum , but we beJieve , that , should the State Hospital be closed to all paying patients , there would be a steady demand for admission by patients from Massachusetts , and that provision for 50 more would be made , which ( by changing on an average once in six months ) would accommodate 100 yearly . This , however , would be but one step ; for , when the // Worcester Hospital and the South Boston Asylum shall be full of pauper lunatics , there will still be between four and five hundred unprovided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 per cent . are the entirely demented and merely vegetating idiots , there will remain over 200 unprovided for ; and what shall be done with them ? Believing , as we do , that the number of patients in one establishment should never be so large , that the superintendent can not make himself acquainted with the daily condition of every curable patient , and bring the influence of his own sane mind to bear upon the deranged ones , we should dislike to see overgrown establishments . Dr. Woodward , in his last Report , says " Every year , since the Hospital was established , we have had applications enough to fill a good-sized establishment . While it may be doubtful , whether this institution should be enlarged , it is greatly to be desired , that all the insane should find a retreat in an institution designed for their benefit , and especially , that all recent cases should have the means of cure . rrhe appropriations for the accommodation of such should be liberal , and the means of support ample . Humanity , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best plan , then , would be , to build a second State Asylum , in some other place , and provide it with accommodations for 200 or 250 patients . There is another consideration in favor of a separate hospital , and that is , the advantage it would offer for classification , with reference , not to the actual condition of the insane , but to their previous character . Every insane pauper becomes the ward of society ; but prostitutes , criminals , foreign vagabonds , inebriates , &amp;c. , have a claim altogether secondary and inferior to that of the virtuous poor . They should be separated from them , and , if possible , kept in a different establishment ; for , be it remembered , even the insane do not lose their self-esteem , and this is often sadly wounded by the necessary herding together in public establishments . If , however , it should be urged , that the financial situation of the State will not allow the hope of a new hospital , there is still a way by which , without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new hospital , additional accommodations may be had for 200 patients , and that is , by adding wings to the Worcester Asylum . Indeed , this may // be done without encroaching much upon the treasury ; for the fund left by Mrs. Johonnot , for the benefit of the insane , amounts to about *40,000 , and it is burdened with annuities amounting to only $ 2500 . The State may assume these annuities , for the time they have to run , and apply the principal to enlarging the Worcester Hospital . It will theii embrace all the worst cases ; and , provided that grand-juries and citizens will do their duty , there will be a general almshouse and jail delivery of all the unfortunate victims confined in them . It may be necessary to put the price of supporting town paupers very low ; perhaps even some legislation may be necessary , to prevent the confinement of lunatics in almshouses and jails ; but these would be minor difficulties , and would be soon overcome . Massachusetts would then have done , what no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as much her duty , as though every nation in the world had performed it before her . She will have provided every possible means for the cure , or the comfort , of the unfortunate insane , who , in the course of events , are thrown upon her care . The arrangement which we have proposed will furnish only a partial remedy ; for , besides the paupers , there will be over five hundred insane unprovided for . But the pressure will fall mainly on the paying patients , and for these we care less , because they have friends to care for them . They can be sent out of the State , or , if any must be sent from the State hospital to the jails and almshouse-cages for safekeeping , let it be the rich man 's son or daughter , and not the poor man 's child . Indeed it might not be ill , that the rich should suffer a little what the poor have been and are still suffering ; for one or two cases only would raise a clamor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are excellent hospitals recently established in Maine and in Vermont , which are not yet full ; and , should they not suffice , new establishments would start up at once . It is true , there are great objections to private madhouses ; the recent developements in England show what horrid abuses are there committed , even at this day ; and we fear , that there are some in this country where a grand jury might find matter for presentment . It is certainly highly desirable , that the State should furnish a place , where all its lunatic // 1843.1 Insanity in Massachusetts . 191 subjects might be treated for a moderate compensation ; but this , we repeat , is not strictly a State 's legal duty , while the care of the paupers is both a legal and a moral duty . Let that then be first discharged , and let us trust , that , when the present generation of incurable cases shall have passed away , better treatment will prevent such an accumulation again while stricter temperance , and a more general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let all then , who , by word or deed , can command any influence , exercise it to discharge this duty , *ud to confer this blessing upon those whom misfortune has made dependent upon them . Let them visit the almshouses and prisons , and see for themselves the deplorable condition of their brethren ; their visits will at least have the effect of causing greater vigilance , cleanliness , and attention on the part of the keepers . There is room here for all to work , women as well as men . Come , then , ye whose bosoms heave with just indignation at the oppression of man in distant lands here are victims of dreadful oppression at your very doors . Come , ye who lament the heathenish customs of ignorant pagans , and would fain teach them Christianity ; here are worse than heathenish customs in our very towns and villages .

Finally , let the State government be urged to make immediate and ample provision for all the indigent insane , cost what it may cost . Massachusetts is not too poor to do any thing that can be shown to be her duty@@184059120.txt 1TR . ALIsoN 's History has many excellent qualities , and some striking faults . It is the elaborate and highly finished work of an able and conscientious writer , who has given to it the patient toil of many years , and who may be considered as having staked his reputation upon its success . It is not a brilliant production ; it does not hear the marks of genius ; it is not imbued with any profound philosophy . But it is frill of interest , and it embodies a great amount of information , carefully collected , and admirably digested and arranged , and presented in a way that can not fail to absorb the attention of the reader . It is conceived on a comprehensive plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without violating its unity ; and it is executed with a care , fidelity , and spirit , that can not be too highly appreciated . The author endeavours to be strictly impartial , and he is generally successful in the attempt . His work contrasts very favorably , in this respect , with the Life of Napoleon , by Scott , which is so full of English prejudices and unfairness , that , notwithstanding the great merits of its execution , it can hardly be said to possess any historical value whatever . This remarkable book always appeared to us like a sort of high Tory romance , or a plea in favor of Castlereagh politics , illustrated by a half fabulous account of French Jacobinism and the crimes of Napoleon . Mr. Alison 's work has far higher claims to consideration and trust . Yet his Tory principles are as violent , and carried as far* as // were those of Scott , and he has written this history with a purpose , but half concealed , of checking the spirit of innovation , and applying a corrective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , are the grounds of our confidence in his general fidelity as a historian ? They are found in the abundant evidence , which the book affords , of the honest intentions and ingenuous spirit of the writer , - in his sincere conviction that the story , if fairly and fully told , without artifice , concealment , or falsification , would answer all the purposes which he had in view . He seems to have been aware of the bias which existed in his own mind , and of the suspicion that it would throw upon his narrative , and he therefore goes honestly to work to counteract it , and to afford the reader , at every step , the means of verifying his statements and testing his conclusions . His plan , as he remarks in the preface , " was to give on every occasion the authorities , by volume and page , from which the statement in the text was taken " ; and this is done not only for every paragraph , but in many instances for every sentence . He has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , in every instance where it was possible , from writers on the opposite side from that which an English historian , surveying the events with the feelings which attachment to a constitutional monarchy produces , may be supposed to adopt ; and the reader will find every fact almost , in the internal history of the revolution , supported by two Republican and one Royalist authority ; and every event in the military narrative drawn from at least two writers on the part of the French , and one on that of their opponents . This plan , which is fully carried out , affords satisfactory proof of the integrity and conscientious spirit of the writer . It is evident that he intended to tell the truth , without reserve , exaggeration , or undue coloring , and , if he has failed to do so , be has afforded abundant means , at every step , whereby his departures from strict veracity may be detected and exposed . And the result is xvhat might be expected from such a plan , when ably and fairly executed ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , that this is the most complete and honest history of the French Revolution which has yet appeared either in England or France . Certainly , no work by a British pen deserves to be com // pared with it ; and we think every reader will accord it the preference , in point of fulness and impartiality , over the early narratives by the French Royalists , Bertrand de Molleville , Lacretelle , and others , and the more recent and popular works of Mignet and Thiers . Mr. Alison has had the advantage of coming after these writers , and he has made good use of the fruits of their labor , and of the vast store of other materials , respecting the history of the French Revolution , which have been accumulating with great rapidity for half a century . The various publications on this subject would now fill a library by themselves , arid most of them possess intrinsic , though partial , interest and value . Besides the great collection of Revolutionary Memoirs , " filling sixty-six volumes , which contain the authentic narratives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe , there is a multitude of contributions to the general history of the period , both civil and military , most of them coming from very trustworthy sources , which furnish an inexhaustible mine of information . Mr. Alison can not he too highly praised for the diligent and effective use which he has made of these copious materials . It would be difficult to mention a single publication of any note relating to his subject , which is not quoted or referred to in the course of these volumes . French , English , and German authorities have been consulted with equal attention , and some Spanish and Italian writers have afforded collateral and subsidiary information , of which our author has availed himself to the great advantage of his work . The time has gone by for viewing the eventful history of Europe , from the commencement of the revolution in France , to the second restoration of the Bourbons , with the rancor of political feeling and national animosity . Another generation has come upon the stage , who have had no share in the exciting events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the false coloring and distorted pictures , the forged narratives and unfair suppressions of the truth , with which party writers , during the heat of the contest , sought to animate the zeal of their own faction , and to disable their opponents . The truth is elicited from a comparison of opposite statements , and the publication of letters and official documents , and , when the facts are known , it is an idle attempt to resist // or evade the conclusions which may fairly he drawn from them . Whatever may he the predilections or wishes of historians and political writers , they are now forced to do justice to the characters and measures of the several leaders and parties in the great contest . Colonel Napier 's recently published History of the War in the Peninsula is a striking instance of this impartiality , which writers are now compelled to manifest , on account of the subdued tone of public feeling , and the multiplication of authorities , which leave no shelter for error or prejudice . It is written by a British officer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone is calm , temperate , and discriminating , and it bestows nearly as much praise on the military abilities and administrative talent of Soult and Suchet as on the transcendent genius and energy of Wellington . What a wide difference there is , in point of temper and fairness , between this work and Southey 's history of the same war , the first volume of which was published some twenty years since ! Mr. Alison 's work affords another happy instance of this great improvement in candor and liberality of judgment , on the part of English historians . Even his estimate of the character of Napoleon , though marked with some traces of the exasperated feelings with which the English conducted the war against him , is , in the main , candid and just . The preparations of our historian for his task were not confined to the careful examination of every thing that has been printed in relation to his subject . He has visited the several places where the great battles between the French and their opponents were fought , and , in most cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general theatre of the war , from personal observation . His style being sufficiently perspicuous , this intimate knowledge of the ground imparts much force and clearness to his descriptions , and the account of the military movements and events is at once animated and intelligible . His summary of the political events , and other internal transactions , in each kingdom involved in the contest , is drawn up with great perspicuity and completeness , and combines an amount of information respecting the finances , and the state of parties , in each country , which it would be difficult to find elsewhere in such a condensed form . Supplementary chapters are given , at intervals , on the history , general condition , and internal // resources of each nation , and the character of the people , which leave nothing to be desired in the way of subsidiary information for understanding the influence which each power exerted on the course of events in Europe . Great labor has evidently been bestowed on these digressions , so that they present a full and succinct digest of facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a copious and lively style that they are among the most agreeable and instructive portions of the book . Mr. Alison has adopted so broad a plan , that some of these chapters - the general sketch of British India , for instance - seem to have only a remote connexion with the principal topic ; but they are so well executed that we fancy no reader will complain of their presence . This very chapter on India is admirably done , and there are others , which are but little inferior to it , on St. IDomingo , Poland , Turkey , Russia , and France at different periods . The one on America is the most unfortunate in the book , as it is full of errors , some of them very serious , which we shall have occasion to expose in another part of this article . In the general distribution of his subject , and in the arrangement of particulars so as to preserve clearness and continuity of interest , without violating chronology or interrupting the thread of events , Mr. Alison 's history may sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his subject is hardly inferior in splendor , magnitude , and importance , to the " Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. ** He is quite a master , also , of what may be called historical perspective , by which leading events and characters are brought forward with due prominence , while the minor occurrences and personages are left in the background . We could wish that he did not remind us of Gibbon in another respect , - the most exceptionable peculiarities of his style . The imitation is here quite obvious , though it is not a happy one , and we object altogether to the choice of a model so faulty and vicious , even in its copiousness and magnificence. 1*Ir . Alison 's style is always stately , artificial , and ornate but it wants the richness of illustration and the epigrammatic turns which lend attraction even to the glaring faults of Gibbon . It is too uniformly balanced and modulated , with sentences " of formal cut , " the different members of which are often helped out with superfluous epithets , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flowing , and , for the most part , perspicuous ; but it is sadly deficient in ease , grace , and naturalness . It betrays labor . The writer is evidently thinking of his garb , and doing his utmost to appear at advantage ; and , consequently , the reader 's attention is continually diverted from the narrative to the language . Mr. Alison has not a very fertile imagination , but he is ambitious of ornament , and his favorite metaphors and comparisons , which are neither novel nor striking , are repeated till the reader loathes their presence , and are often huddled together with little regard to sense or correctness . It is remarkable that a style , which is evidently studied and elaborate , should be so frequently loose and incorrect . We need not go far in search of faults , for there is hardly a page that does not contain them . The following may be taken as a sample of their quality . " It was not the ripple of a minute that burst upon the shore , but the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heaved on the bosom of remote antiquity . " - Vol. i. p. 14 . The long swell of the . ltlantic , heaved on the bosom of remote antiquity , " is a figure quite worthy of Mr. Robert Montgomery , or , as he is usually called , Satan Montgomery . Another extraordinary application of metaphorical language is found in the following sentence . " A connected chain of words , which float unchanged through the otherwise forgotten floods of time , may be traced from the tribes of the Caucasian range to the Cordilleras of Mexico and Peru . " - Vol. x. p. 279 . " Mr. Liume has said , that fanaticism was the disgrace of the great rebellion , and that we shall look in vain among the popular leaders of England at that period for the generous sentiments which animated the patriots of antiquity ; but , without disputing the absurdity of many of their tenets , and the ridiculous nature of much in their manners , it may safely be affirmed , that such fervor was the only effectual bridle which could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and order were at an end , and that , but for that fanaticism , they ( ? ) would have been disgraced by the proscriptions of Marius , or the executions of Robespierre . " - Vol. i. p. 213 . It is not easy to see what kind of fervor is here spoken of ; and any excitement of feeling is usually regarded rather // as a spur than a bridle . We can not perceive how the patriot leaders of England , under any circumstances , could have been disgraced by proscriptions that were made centuries before , or by executions which took place centuries after , the period of their own existence . The whole sentence is loose , awkward , and incorrect , to the last degree . " It is such men , in every age , who have ultimately obtained the lead in public convulsions ; like the vultures which , invisible in ordinary times , are attracted , by an unerring instinct , to the scene of blood , and reap the last fruits of the discord and violence of others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " invisible in ordinary times , " nor that they were wont to " reap the fruits " of the discord of " other " - vultures , as the writer seems to assert .

In the British Isles , the plant has become deeply rooted , and expanded widely , in its native air ; time will show whether the French have not wasted their endeavours in training an exotic unsuited to the climate , and unfruitful in the soil . " - Vol. i. p. 121 . These are marked instances of incorrectness and bad taste in composition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they not balanced by some excellent qualities of style . The narrative is generally clear and animated , and the descriptions are often vivid and picturesque . The moving story of the trial and execution of Louis is finely told ; and the pictures of most of the great battles fought by Napoleon , particularly those of Eylau , Friedland , and Wagram , are drawn with great vigor , distinctness , and effect . The fearful history of France , during the Reign of Terror , which has so often tasked the descriptive powers of the most eloquent writers of our age , was never presented in a manner more forcible and impressive than that of Mr. Alison . Indeed , when he is simply carrying forward // 370 April , the narrative , and relating the various events as they occurred , his style is generally clear , vigorous , and in good taste . It is only when he stops to moralize on the several occurrences , and when he is beset by the pestilent ambition of fine writing , that his language becomes tumid , labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he . had kept in mind the remark of an able critic , that " half of the affectation and offensive pretension we meet with in authors , arises from a paltry ambition of being eloquent and ingenious out of place . " We could wish that the reflections , with which Mr. Auson has loaded his narrative , were not open to more serious objections , - that they did not so frequently rest on preconceived opinions , on national and party prejudices , - that they were not so generally superficial and commonplace . Many lessons are taught with terrible effect by the great events of the French Revolution , and the observer is sadly deficient in sagacity and penetration , who can find in them nothing but a solemn warning against the evils of democracy . We do not object to this moral of the story , so far as it goes . Every friend of free institutions , every loud-tongued advo* cate of the rights of the people and of their capacity to elect their own rulers and manage their own affairs , may learn wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Jacobins , and the delusion and sufferings of the French people . But the same history gives a warning quite as impressive to the favorers of aristocratic governments , and the prejudiced opponents of all reform . It shows that oppression and misrule , the obstinate retention of old customs , and the bigoted support of the privileges of the few against the rights and the wants of the many , may be equally destructive to both parties in the state , - to the ruling powers , who may be exposed ultimately to every species of injury and outrage from an exasperated populace , and to the uninstructed people , who may be taught by mournful experience what a sad and difficult task it is to govern themselves . I*'Ir . Alison reads but half the lesson , and thereby commits as great an error as if he had never opened the book . He has not coolness and judgment enough to weigh all the facts on the record , and to draw a conclusion which shall harmonize with all , and be applicable with certainty to future cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the // aspects and bearings of his subject , nor sufficiently acute to pei4ceive how often his story contradicts the moral that is drawn from it . He is fair and candid as a narrator , but not as a reasoner , and he very ingenuously supplies the materials for contradicting his own theories . There are different modes of considering the great drama of the French Revolution , according to the several points of view assumed by the different historians , or the bias which is given to their reflections by their preestablished opinions on the nature of various governments . The French republican writers have inclined , of late , to speak of the whole course of events as directed by an irresistible fatality , by which the actors in them were impelled to do a work that was often repugnant to their feelings and wishes , and which produced results that they had never contemplated . They were passive agents in the hands of a terrible Destiny , and , therefore , were not accountable either for the follies or the crimes which they committed . Fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should go on and prosper , - though disorder , suffering , and criminality of every kind , were the attendants or the means of its progress . The nobles were exiled , religion was suppressed , prisoners were butchered , the King was murdered , cartloads of men and women , of all ranks and classes , were dragged daily to the guillotine , because it was necessary that these things should be , in order that a reaction should not take place in favor of tyranny , and that France should not be overrun by the armies of the stranger . No detestation is expressed of the character and motives of the agents in this fearful work , but only admiration and respect for the terrible energy and audacity which they showed , in vindicating the rights of man and saving their country . Many innocent victims fell , but their sufferings and death , and the general misery and anarchy that prevailed , ought not to be regretted , since all was necessary for the safety of the republic . This is the theory of the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some other popular writers of the day , and certainly a more detestable one was never framed . It is quite a prevalent one in France , where extravagant speculations on history and politics meet with a more favorable reception than in most other countries . We have ourselves conversed with intelligent Frenchmen who openly // defended these views , saying that the Reign of Terror was indeed a terrible thing , but it was inevitable , and the only mistake committed was in putting a stop to it too soon , for many political calamities thereby occurred ; which might have been averted , if a few more thousand heads had fallen . Mr. Alison is a conscientious and pious man , and he rejects this theory , as repugnant alike to all moral and humane feelings , and0to common sense . Unluckily , he puts one in its place , which varies quite as widely from the truth , by going to the opposite extreme . We shall have occasion to consider his views at length ; but , meanwhile , we must say a word on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which finds some upholders in this country . This doctrine is , that the crimes of the Jacobin party in France , however atrocious in themselves and melancholy in their consequences , ought not to draw down general indignation on the direct authors of them , but rather on the privileged classes in France , whose contempt for popular rights and continued oppression of the lower orders finally brought upon their own heads a long delayed and righteous retribution . We do not suppose , that persons who look at the subject in this light wish to justify all the acts of IDanton , Marat , and Robespierre ; but they desire to call off our attention from the infernal proceedings of these men , and to fix it on the noble object which they had in view . But we do not believe in the propriety of hiding such crimes from notice , nor in the justice of the plea which is set up in order to palliate them . The people who can not vindicate their personal rights and national independence , except by such means as these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , that a salutary warning to all oppressive governments is offered by the terrible seventies practised by the French Revolutionists ; but these same acts have brought a reproach on the whole cause of freedom and reform , and go far to justify the arbitrary proceedings of rulers , who may stop the first outbreak of popular spirit , and allege their motive to be a just regard to the rights of humanity and the welfare of their subjects . It must be remembered , that the Revolutionary tribunal was set up , and the Jacobin party began its inhuman career , long after the real contest was decided , and the first object of the struggle was gained . The battle of freedom was fought and won in 1789 . After the capture of // the Bastille , on the 14th of July in that year , the whole power was virtually taken from the hands of the King , and lodged in the National Assembly . All the privileges of the nobility and the feudal burdens were destroyed in a single night , on the motion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property was seized for the benefit of the state ; the trial by jury was fixed by law , lettres de cachet were done away , the national guard was organized , the most oppressive imposts were abolished , and , to crown all , a right of suffrage , as liberal as that which now exists in Massachusetts , was determined by the constitution , and thereby the principle of universal equality was recognized , and all authority was admitted to flow from the people . The free government established with these provisions and safeguards existed for three years , till the fatal 10th of August , 1792 , when the populace of Paris established the sacred right of insurrection , and anarchy and butchery began . The Jacobins then ruled France with a rod of iron for nearly two years , and a more cruel and tyrannical government never existed under the worst of the Roman emperors or the despots of the East than in their " free and indivisible republic . " We see not how it is possible to find either cause or palliation for their proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were contemporary with , the establishment of their power . It is an outrage on common sense , to affirm that they were rendered necessary either to vindicate or preserve the liberty of the country . Besides , most of the victims during the Reign of Terror were neither the persons who opposed the Revolution , nor those whose crimes had brought it on . Many of them had had nothing to do with the course of public events ; many others were among the earliest advocates and defenders of the rights of the people . By their fate , the terrible prophecy of Vergniaud was accomplished , and " the Revolution , like Saturn , devoured its own children . " If some of the nobles were rightfully put to death , because the order to which they belonged once exercised odious privileges , and had been guilty of oppressive acts , surely , no similar consideration justified the execution of Bailly and Brissot , the first apostles of French liberty . If it was necessary to visit the sins of former monarchs on the head of their innocent descendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were expiated // by the death of NI . de Malesherbes , his aged and eloquent defender at the bar of the Convention , if it was right to execute the Queen , in order to terrify the royalists , and because she once incited the King to oppose the Revolution , we can not perceive why Madame Roland , also , was sent to the guillotine . The truth is , the Committees of Public Safety and of General Safety , in whose hands the whole power was lodged during the period of Jacobin rule , were opposed by other factions , equally ambitious and reckless with themselves ; and , knowing that their own immediate adherents were few and weak , they sought to strike down opposition , or to silence it through terror , by causing blood to flow in torrents . Meanwhile , they had the address to persuade the ignorant people , that only aristocrats and royalists were sent to the guillotine , and that their death was necessary in order to save the country . Among these aristocrats were such men as the half insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royalists were Danton , who planned the massacres of September , and Westermaun , who commanded the mob when they attacked the Tuileries on the 10th of August . Robespierre was never supported but by a small minority in the Convention ; but the success of his system of terror was evident enough , for the majority dared not vote against him , until he was about to send them , also , to the scaffold . Then , indeed , they gained courage for a desperate effort , and the monster fell . It may appear strange , that the people could be so far deluded as to support the miserable and cruel faction that wielded , for so long a time , the destinies of the country . But the explanation of the fact is obvious enough . The better portion of the community , the intelligent and the educated , had been driven into exile , or were shut up in prisons , or were rendered dumb through terror . The lower classes , composed of the vile populace of the most corrupt of European cities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power , and alarmed by exaggerated reports of foreign invasion , could not be pacified except by immediate and striking proofs of the boldness and efficiency of their government . The war raged upon the frontiers , out of their view and hearing ; but they could imagine that it was ably conducted , when every unlucky general was brought home and guillotined before their own doors . They could // believe that the persons at the head of affairs were active and earnest in the cause of the people , when crowds of victims were daily sacrificed under the denomination of aristocrats and traitors . Distress and famine prevailed , for the crops were short , and the ruin of commerce and manufactures , consequent on the destruction of confidence , and the withdrawal or concealment of capital , threw vast numbers out of employment . Irritated by suffering , and unwilling to believe that the country could he reduced to so unhappy a state from natural causes , when its political condition was so much improved , they ascribed all their misfortunes to the machinations of the banished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already immured in their dungeons , or of traitors within their own councils . The Convention and the Committees could not give them bread , but they could deliver up victims in abundance , as objects of popular vengeance . When the proceedings of the revolutionary tribunal were not speedy enough for the impatient ferocity of the multitude , the cry of a conspiracy within the prisons was raised , and the wretched inmates of these dwellings were dragged forth without a trial , and butchered at the doors . r1*he revolutionary passions of the people were kept constantly awake by the display of new objects to be obtained by their activity and daring ; the present misery which they endured was represented as the effect of the opposition offered by the royalists to the progress of innovation ; and the populace were dazzled by the prospect of boundless felicity , when the liberty and equality for which they contended should be fully established . There has been some dispute respecting the extent to which blood was shed in France , while it was under the sway of the Jacobins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer , whose prepossessions certainly would not lead him to exaggerate the horrors of that period . According to his account , 18,603 persons were guillotined by order of the Revolutionary Trihunal . This number is definitely ascertained . The other statements are more vaguely given , being formed in part from conjecture . Thirty-two thousand fell victims at Nantes , when the Jacobin agent , Carrier , visited that city ; and , of this number , more than twenty-seven hundred were women or children , who were either shot or drowned . Thirty-one thousand perished // at Lyons , under Fouch6 , Couthon , and Collot d'Herbois . This estimate does not include those who were killed at the Abbaye , the Carmes , and the other prisons , on the 2d of September , or the victims of the Glaci*re at Avignon , or the inhabitants of the little town of Bedoin , all of whom perished . If we take into the account those who fell during the protracted and bloody struggle in La Vend6e , the aggregate will be swelled to more than a million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hot blood , during the fury and excitement of a civil war , and ought not , therefore , to be reckoned with the others , who may be considered as the proper victims of the Revolution . The whole number of these can not fall far short of eighty thousand . It is not a very appalling amount , say some writers ; more have fallen in two or three great battles ; more perished by violent means every year during Napoleon 's career of destructive conquest . We can not reason on the matter thus coldly , for death on the battle-field is quite a different thing from death on the scaffold . War is a great game , played by soldiers , in which life is the stake , and is cheerfully surrendered , when fortune goes against them . They are prepared for their fate , for the chances of its occurrence enter into the deliberate estimate which they form of the good and evil attached to their unhappy profession . But the victims of civil disturbances , sacrificed hy popular frenzy , or by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a deliberate massacre , are called upon to surrender life under circumstances most fearful to them , and most revolting to humanity . IDeath is embittered by the consciousness that it is undeserved , and by the want of preparation , which unguarded innocence fails to make . The heart is not steeled against the coming of the king of terrors , in a dungeon , or in a popular tumult , as it is in the presence of assembled armies , and in the excitement of a charge or an assault . A general who had braved all the dangers of war might well be unmanned at the prospect of being seized by a mob in the streets , and hung up at a lantern-post . The proper distinction between such cases is made by the very instinct of nature . The fall of a single head by an unjust sentence is felt to be a greater wrong , it shocks our moral feelings more , than the slaughter of hundreds in a military contest . We do not seek to palliate the enormities of war , // but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a massacre in cold blood , than we do with the sufferings and deaths caused by a famine , a pestilence , or any other of the judgments of God . From the tenor of these remarks , Mr. Alison may well infer , that we are not disposed to conceal or excuse the extravagances and crimes committed by the Revolutionary party in France . But we are still less inclined to adopt the lesson which he derives from them , and to inculcate which seems to be the leading purpose of his History . In his eyes , the French Revolution was a great experiment to test the sufficiency of popular rule , and the expediency of making any innovations in a form of government ; and his conclusion is , that the evils which marked its rise and progress , the iron despotism to which it was reduced hy Napoleon , and the final conquest of France by the Allies , with the consequent wreck of all the hopes which the movement party had entertained , have for ever decided the question against the cause of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks , have proved what fatal consequences must ensue from the progress of democracy ; for he seems despondingly to admit , that this progress is inevitable , and that the cause of the people must ultimately triumph , though by the ruin of all the higher interests of humanity . " Experience in every age , " he observes , " has abundantly proved that the fervor of democracy is fatal to the best interests of mankind , and rapidly leads to the greatest miseries to all classes , because it subjects society to the guidance of those who are least qualified to direct it ; but yet that it is of all passions the most difficult to eradicate from the human heart , and , when once it is generally diffused , whole generations of political fanatics must be destroyed , before it can be reduced to a degree consistent with order . " " The successive ambition and passions of the different bodies who rise to eminence soon occasion that frightful effusion of blood , or those wild and anarchical measures , which , by involving whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful process , to a restoration of the natural order of society . This it is , which , in every age , has made democratic madness terminate in military despotism ; this is the great moral to be derived from the history of the French Revolu " tion " - Vol. ii . p. 226. // Mr. Alison appears to have been haunted by the spectre of democracy , till it has nearly unhinged his reason . In no other way can we explain the extravagance of his language respecting it , the frequency and earnestness with which he returns to the topic , or the contradictory assertions which he makes in his eagerness to point out all the mischiefs and dangers to which it leads . To illustrate his manner of handling this theme , we quote a few paragraphs , which might be multiplied at pleasure , for kindred passages are thickly scattered throughout the ten massive octavos of his History , and seem to contain , in his opinion , the whole philosophy of the subject . " The reasonings of the learned , the declamations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rather directed against the oppression of sovereigns or nobles , than the madness of the people . This affords the most decisive demonstration that the evils flowing from the latter are much greater and more acute than those which have originated with the former ; for it proves that the former have been so tolerable as to have long existed , and , therefore , have been long complained of , whereas those springing from the latter have been intolerable , and speedily led to their own abolition . The evils of democracy , when intrusted with the direction of public affairs , have in every age been found to be so excessive that they have immediately produced its overthrow ; and thus the experience of individuals does not in every age present the same numerous examples of democratic , that it does of aristocratic oppression just because the former species of government is so dreadful , that it invariably in every old community destroys itself in a single generation , while the latter often maintains its dominion for hundreds , or even thousands of years . History , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy never fails to light up in society ; and it is a secret consciousness of the damning force with which it overturns their doctrines , that makes the popular party everywhere treat its records with such contempt . But how many of the great body of the people , even in the best-informed community , make themselves masters of historical information ? Not one in a hundred . Thus , in a period of political convulsion , history points in vain to the awful beacons of former ruin , to warn mankind of the near approach of shipwreck ; while perfidious democracy , ever alive to the force of falsehood , or misled by the deceitfulness of sin , again for the hundredth time allures the unsuspecting multitude by the exhibition of the forbidden fruit ; and popular change is eagerly // longed for by the simple masses , just because its evils are so excessive that they invariably quickly terminate the republican regime ; actual personal experience can rarely be appealed to as to the effect of a contagion which almost always consigns its victims to the grave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very magnitude of the falsehoods on which its promises are founded , and the universally felt impossibility of bringing them , for any considerable time , to the test of actual experience . " - Vol. x. pp. 510 , 511 . " The reason why , in every age of the world , the triumph of democracy has immediately , or at least shortly , been followed by the destruction of all the best interests of society , and the total ruin in particular of the whole principles of freedom for which it itself contended , is clearly illustrated by experience ; and the moment it is stated , it must be seen to be one of universal application . It is not that the working classes of the community are in themselves more depraved or more corrupted than the classes who possess property and have acquired information . It is probable that all men , in every rank of life , when exposed to the influence of the same temptations , are pretty nearly the same . But there is this difference between them , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of mankind that , though the dispositions of the Aristocratic or Conservative party may be just as selfish at bottom as those of the Democratic , there are several causes which permanently retain them in a comparatively fixed , safe , and beneficial course of government , and which , as they depend on general principles , may be expected to be of universal application . " - Vol. x. pp. 511 , 512 . " The rule of a mob , ' says Aristotle , is the worst of tyrannies ' ; and so experience has proved it , from the caprice of the Athenian democracy , to the proscriptions of the French Revolution . The reason is permanent , and must remain unaltered while society holds together . In contests for power , a monarch has , in general , to dread only the efforts of a rival for the throne ; an aristocracy , the ascendency of a faction in the nobility ; the populace , the vengeance of all the superior classes in the state . Hence , the safety of the first is usually secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate adherents ; the jealousy of the second , extinguished by the proscription or exile of a limited number of families ; but the terrors of the last require the destruction of whole ranks in society . Measures , dictated by the alarm for individuals , become necessary when they have perished ; those levelled against the influence of classes require to be pursued till the class itself is destroyed . // " It was not a mere thirst for blood which made Marat and Robespierre declare and act upon the principle , that there could be no security for the Republic till two hundred and sixty thousand heads had fallen . Hardly any men are cruel for cruelty 's sake ; the leaders of the Jacobins were not more so than the reckless and ambitious of any other country would be , if exposed to the influence of similar passions . Ambition is the origin of desperate measures , because it renders men sensible only of the dictates of an insatiable passion ; terror is the real source of cruelty . Men esteem the lives of others lightly , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed against the whole aristocratic and influential classes , their vengeance was felt to be implacable , and no security could be expected to the democratical leaders , till their whole opponents were destroyed . " - Vol. ii . pp. 31 , 32 . " The professed object of the Decemvirs was , to establish a Republic in France , after the model of the ancients , to change the manners , the habits , the public spirit of the country . Sovereignty in the people , magistrates without pride , citizens without vice , simplicity of manners , fraternity of relations , austerity of character ; such were the basis on which their institutions were to rest . There was one objection to them , that they were utterly impracticable , from the character of the great body of mankind . To accomplish this object , it was indispensable to destroy the whole superior classes of society , to cut off all those who were preeminent among their neighbours , either for fortune , rank , talent , or acquirement. this was the end accordingly proposed in the indiscriminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been its consequence , if completely carried into effect ? To sink the whole human race to the level of the lowest classes , and destroy every thing which dignities or adorns human nature . Such was the chimera which they followed through these oceans of blood . Politicians have no right , after such proceedings , to reproach religious enthusiasm with the reign of the saints , or the approach of the mill&amp;nnium. " - Vol. n. p. 179 . What opinion , by way of contrast , Mr. Alison has been led to form of aristocratic and monarchical governments , will appear from the following extracts . " It has been often observed , ' says Mr. Hume , that there is a wide difference between the judgment which befalls the conduct of others and that which we ourselves pursue when placed in similar circumstances . The reason is obvious ; in judging of others , we are influenced by our reason and our feelings ; in acting // for ourselves , we are directed by our reason , our feelings , and our desires . ' In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both to the fatal corruption which democratic ascendency never fails to produce in the state , and to the more effectual check which , in conservative ascendency , is provided at once against its own tendency to selfish projects , and the dangerous encroachments of the other classes of society . When the holders of property are in power , and the masses are in vigilant but restraincd opposition , the majority of the community , who give the tone to public thought , necessarily incline to the support of virtuous and patriotic principles , because they have no interest to do otherwise . Hence , although doubtless in such communities some abuses do prevail , and will prevail to the end of the world , from the universal tendency to corruption in mankind , when acting for themselves , and actuated by their own interests , yet , upon the whole , the administration of affl*irs is comparatively pure and virtuous , and the community obtains a larger share of good government than has ever yet been obtained under any other form of human institutions . Above all , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public spirit is general , and forms the mainspring of national action ; and this invaluable temper of mind , more precious far than all laws or political institutions , not only preserves the heart of the nation entire , and forms a salutary control upon the measures of the holders of power , but , by influencing the very atmosphere which they breathe , imparts a large share of its glorious spirit to those in possession of its reins , and open to its seductions . And hence the long-continued public spirit and greatness of the British and Roman empires , arid of all communities in which power has been for a long period in possession of the holders of property , and the general thought has been directed by the aristocracy of intellect . " But all this is totally reversed , when the popular leaders get themselves installed in power , and the democratic party are in possession of an irresistible preponderance in the state . The moment that this fatal change occurs , a total revolution takes place , not merely in the conduct of government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched by the great body of the people . The holders of power , and the dispensers of influence , find themselves surrounded by a host of hungry dependents , to whom necessity is law ; and who , impelled hy a secret consciousness that their political ascendency is not destined to be of long duration , because they are disqualified to maintain it , strive only to make the best use of their time , by providing for themselves and their relations at the public cxpense , // without the slightest regard to any consideration of the public advantage . On the other hand , the great body of the people , formerly so loud in their clamors against corruption , and their demand for a virtuous and patriotic administration of public affairs , now quietly pass hy on the other side , and either openly and with shameless effrontery defend every species of abuse , because they profit by it , or preserve a studious silence , and endeavour to huddle up those nefarious , and to them beneficial excesses , under the cry of a reformation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the power from which their leaders derive such considerable benefit . Thus , not only is the power and influence of government immediately directed to the most corrupt and selfish purposes , but legislation itself becomes tainted with the same inherent and universal vice . In the general scramble , where every one seems on the look-out for himself , no other object is attended to but the promotion of separate interests , or class elevation ; the public press seldom denounces , in general cordially supports , all such abuses , because their leaders , and the writers in its columns , are benefited by them ; and , what is worst of all , public feeling becomes universally and irrevocably corrupted , because the great body of the people profit , or hope to profit , by the abuses in which the leaders of their party indulge . " - Vol. x. pp. 515 , 516 . " Since the creation of man , a vast majority , probably at least nine tenths , of the human race have existed under the government of single monarchs or chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not to mention other examples that must be familiar to every reader , the whole of Asia , embracing six hundred millions of inhabitants , or nearly two thirds of the whole human race , has , from the earliest period to the present hour , been uniformly governed by the absolute power of a single individual . Certain restraints upon the uncontrolled exercise of human power have no doubt existed in Asia as well as in other parts of the world ; but they consist not in any limitation of power in the sultan or chief , but in his occasional dethronement ; the remedy against the evils of oppression is , not the limitation of authority , but the murder of the despot . Great as have been the evils which in every age have flowed from the selfishness , the rapacity , and iniquities of these arIAtrary governors of their species , it is yet evident that there must be some general and substantial benefits which have resulted from their rule , or it would long ago have been terminated by the common consent of mankind . Lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not despise a system of government under which two thirds of the // human race have subsisted from the beginning of time ; and which is so firmly rooted in universal consent that no amount of tyranny on the part of individual sovereigns , and no changes resulting from religion or conquest , have ever made them for one moment think of altering it . Whatever is found to have existed to a great extent among mankind for a very long period must necessarily have been attended with great practical advantages which have overbalanced its evils ; and the sagacious observer of such institutions , if he can not discover their utility , will rather suspect that his powers of observation have been defective , than that mankind , for so long a period , and over so great a surface , have obstinately persisted in what was destructive to themselves .

" - Vol. x. pp. 508 , 509 . These are long extracts , but we have made them in order that the views of the historian may be fully placed before our readers , and in the hope that they will be read attentively , in connection with the following remarks . We might object to such sweeping conclusions respecting the character of men in general , and the influence of political institutions upon this character , on the ground that they rest on too narrow a basis , that they are deduced from a single experiment , which is quite insufficient to support so broad a theory . The pernicious effects of democratic power , and the general incapacity of men to govern themselves , are inferred from one trial , made in France , in 1792 , under circumstances , according to 1ir . Alison 's own showing , most unfavorable to success . But we prefer to insist on the more general objection , that our author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any reference to the character of the people who are to be governed ; that he seems to have no idea of such a thing as fitness and adaptation in matters of politics , or that one set of institutions may work admirably in one country , while it would produce nothing but confusion , discord , and unhappiness , in another . He appears to maintain , that a democracy , or a monarchy , is a good or evil thing in itself , irrespective of the habits , condition , and general intelligence of the people among // whom it is established . To take an instance mentioned in the last of the foregoing extracts , Mr. Alison seems to think that perfect despotism is an excellent thing in central Asia . Does he believe that it might be safely introduced into the west of Europe ? Is be quite sure that it would work equally well in England ? He is bound to answer these questions in the affirmative , if he is entitled to argue against democratic institutions in general , on the ground that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excesses , in France , ahout half a century ago . No man , in the possession of his reason , would wish to establish a popular government for the serfs of Russia , the lazzaroni of Naples , or the licentious and degraded populace of Paris . And no man , except Mr. Alison , would suppose that the crimes of the populace last mentioned , when maddened by previous suffering , and suddenly emancipated from all external control , were fairly imputable to the cause of democracy . Not the most earnest advocate of free institutions , we presume , xvould claim for them any power of modifying the whole national character , of rendering men better or wiser than they were before . This character may be more widely developed , and fully manifested , from the absence of the restraints imposed by a harsh and arbitrary government . But it will not be altered , except through the slow influence of improvements gradually introduced , of systems of education more widely diffused , and moral lessons more faithfully taught and scrupulously followed . The doctrine of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alison prefers to call it , of political innovation , is simply that , supposing men to be already wise and good enough for this particular end , freedom will make them happier . It will enable them to take care of their own interests , and , as they have the greatest stake in the matter , it is to be presumed that they will do this better than any person who is appointed , by the mere accident of birth or fortune , to do it for them . It is necessarily presupposed that they know already what these interests are , and how they will be affected by the measures of a government . The argument which our author uses will be found , unluckily for him , to work both ways , and to be quite as destructive to the theory of the divine right of kings , as to the // defence of the rights of the people . It is , surely , quite as reasonable to charge upon the cause of monarchy all the folly and wickedness of particular kings , as to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Alison has made out a long and heavy indictment against the people , recounting all the offences committed by the French revolutionists . No great knowledge of history is necessary in order to make out an equally black list of the sins of monarchs , and of a privileged nobility . There is little to choose between a Tiberius , a Louis the Eleventh , a Henry the Eighth , or a Venetian oligarchy , on the one hand , and a Danton , a Marat , a Robespierre , or a Parisian populace , on the other . " The martyrdom of Louis the Sixteenth , " says our author , " has thrown a sainted light over the fall of the French monarchy . " The death of Hampden , and Sidney , and Warren , and Bozzaris , has placed an imperishable halo over the cause of freedom and national independence . Such historical instances may be multiplied at will , but , unless they are investigated with a cautious reference to all the attendant circumstances , as many may be adduced on the one side as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left quite undecided . Our author is certainly the last person to weigh them with fairness . The failure of the hopes of the liberal party in France is to be ascribed as much to the extravagant expectations which they entertained , as to the unwise measures by which they sought to effect their purpose . Mr. Alison has successfully exposed the folly of some of their wild theories , and seems to imagine , that , having done so , he has effectually proved the inexpediency of any political reform . But we are not disposed to burden the cause of freedom with the necessity of defending the wild speculations and strange hopes , which were held out by the philosophers of the French Revolution . These men possessed genius , learning , taste , eloquence , philanthropic intentions , in fine , almost every high quality of heart and intellect , excepting piety and common sense . They did nearly as much injury to the cause which they had most at heart , by the delusions which they fostered in their writings and speeches , as by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free government implies equality of political privileges , but it can not create - what these men claimed as a consequence of it - equality of social condition . De // 386 April , mocracy will bake no bread for the people ; it will not remove the necessity of labor . It will not take away those original and unequal endowments which are the primitive cause of the ordinary distinctions of society , and which seem to establish the principle , as a law of God and nature , that there must be an aristocracy of talent , and a consequent unequal distribution of the goods of this life . Attack the institution of property , if you will ; but , unless you effect a new distribution of wealth every month , be sure that , before the end of the year , there will be as great a difference as ever between the fortunes of individuals . All the political changes , which the most prolific theorist can conceive , will not obviate this result , for they can not do away with the fundamental difference in men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark , in passing , that Mr. Alison is a little unfair in charging the leaders of the Revolution , even at its worst period , with a direct attack upon property . They resorted to forced requisitions , it is true , and graduated the compulsory loan on their estimate of the wealth of the individual , making it increase in a rapidly ascending ratio , according to his supposed power to bear it . But in so doing , they only adopted - carrying it a little farther , perhaps - a principle of taxation which has been put in use by every civilized government on the globe . England is practising upon it at this moment , in her property tax . But the French patriots committed nearly as great an error as that charged upon them by our author , when they encouraged the populace to expect , that the reforms which they were introducing into the government would bring about a political millennium ; that social equality would be established , and equal means of happiness be placed in the hands of all , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not true , what Mr. Alison and the doctrinaires of French politics , though with very different motives , have maintained , that democracy presupposes either the perfection or the perfectibility of the human race . It does not require that the whole people should be absolutely wise and absolutely virtuous , but only that the majority of them should be as intelligent , as well-informed , and as well-disposed , as are the majority of kings . This is not claiming much for them , considering the character of many who have occupied // a throne in Europe . The dream about the perfectibility of the species has visited the imaginations of philosophers and speculative men in every age , and , it must he confessed , with little profit either to themselves or others ; hut we are quite sure , that this fanciful speculation is as valid for all purposes of political discussion , as are the theological considerations , through which Mr. Alison seeks to disprove the capacity of men to govern themselves . " It is not difficult to see , " he observes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the speedy discomfiture of every project formed for the improvement of human institutions based on democratic principles . It is the principle of HUMAN CORRUPTION . " This doctrine he explains , according to his own view of it , as follows " That every individual is born innocent , but with dispositions to evil , and dispositions so strong that in no instance whatever is their effect altogether avoided " ; and he goes on to assert that " an insensibility to this doctrine , or determination to resist it , is the real cause of the whole of the innumerable disasters which , in every age , have made democratic ascendency terminate in misery , bloodshed , and ruin. ** We respect the motives which may induce a writer to employ an argument of this character , although we may wonder at his simplicity . Is it possible he does not see , that this principle , like every other Scriptural doctrine , introduced in such a discussion , and for such a purpose , is a two-edged sword which cuts in both directions ? In our eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as formidable as total depravity among the people . Nay , it is rather more so ; for , as selfishness is a great element of human depravity , and as , by common consent , the " greatest good of the greatest number " is the object to be attained , it would seem that the selfishness of the greatest number , if they had the power in their own hands , would be an incentive and a help for the accomplishment of this purpose ; whereas , the selfishness of kings and nobles , they being the smaller number , tends directly to defeat the happiness of the multitude . The superior acquirements of a race of monarchs , or of a privileged class , arising from their superior education , can not obviate the effects of the evil motives and dispositions by which , according to this theory , all men are actuated . This supe // April , riority will only add to their capacity of doing wrong , and enable them more effectively to pursue their own interests , to the neglect or injury of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still more faulty , when , in drawing a comparison between the different kinds of government , he comes to speak of the greater cruelty of a democratic power , proceeding from the greater number of enemies whom it has to encounter or to fear . A monarch , he observes , aims to destroy only a single rival for the throne ; a nobility has nothing to dread hut the existence of a faction in its own body ; while the populace fears the vengeance of all the superior classes in the state , and , therefore , endeavours to banish or extirpate them all . In the first place , this reasoning does not apply , except during the period of a revolution ; for , after the popular sway is permanently established , there are no bodies of men whose privileges or rights are disturbed by its continuance . In this country , for instance , we have no kings or nobles to dread or to persecute , since the institutions to which they belong never fairly took root in American soil . It is idle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which almost necessarily attend any great political change , against the character of the government which is formed and established by such violent means , but which exists long after the necessity of using them is done away . We do not estimate the excellence of an individual 's constitution from the height to which the delirium rises , when he is in the crisis of a violent fever , hut from the vigor and powers of endurance which he displays , when he is in an ordinary state of health . The character and tendency of different political institutions must he inferred from the effects produced during a long series of years , after the excitement of revolutionary passion has died out , and when the ordinary workings of the machine of state show how the interests of humanity are to he affected by it in the long run . IPortunately , some republics have lasted long enough to afford the necessary data for settling the question in this way , and the result may be quite unlike the conclusion adopted by Mr. Alison . A little reflection would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consigned to history , to correct the erroneous premises upon which he has argued the question . After the fall of the Jacobins in 1794 , and till the establishment of the Consular power in 1799 , a purely // republican government existed in France , under the Directory ; and , though faulty enough in other respects , it is no more open to the charge of cruelty than any of the aris tocratic or monarchical governments with which it contended . But we go further in our objections to the extraordinary argument here used by the historian . We wholly deny his proposition , that a democracy is more cruel than a regal or an aristocratic government , because it has more enemies to fear . Rival candidates for the throne are not the only or the most formidable foes which disturb the security of monarchs . They have also to dread the hostility of their people , and it is not often hy lenient means that they attempt to suhdue the insurrectionary spirit . It is as much the interest , and it has been as much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe measures , as of a revolted people to take a bloody revenge for the misery and oppression which they have suffered . Charles the First and Louis the Sixteenth perished on the scaffold , victims , it may be of the unjust resentment of those whom they formerly governed . But we can not think only of them , or of other murdered kings ; for a noble army of martyrs in the patriotic cause , as distinguished and far more numerous than they , also claim our sympathies . Nor is the case much better for INIr . Alison 's assertion , if we compare the clemency of the nobles with that of the people . The detestable oligarchy of Venice became a byword among the nations for its cruelty . Has our author never heard of the " Bridge of Sighs , " or of the " Lion 's mouth " in the ducal palace , or of the hundred stories connected with them , as terrible as any relating to the Revolutionary Trihunal of Paris ? The history of the Roman Patriciate is that of one long-continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , but also of the whole order with the Plebeians , or the mass of the people , whom they oppressed ; and the fate of the Gracchi proves that the victory of the nobles was not always a bloodless one . And this leads us to remark on another of the extraordinary applications of historical facts , which Mr. Alison makes in support of his reasoning . We refer to his allusion to the devastating conquests of other countries by the Roman legions , and to the oppression practised upon the subjugated provinces , as instances of " the evils which republican ambi // tion brings upon mankind . " We refer our readers to a passage , ( Vol . X. page 510 , ) which we have not room to quote . We have read history differently . Most of the foreign wars undertaken by the misnamed republic seem to us to have grown out of the crimes or the fears of the nobility . Their aggressive conduct provoked hostilities , and they welcomed the war as a means of draining off into the army the overflowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , feed and keep in subjection at home . The people often refused to enlist , till they bad obtained a redress of grievances from the Senate , and that body frequently saw with pleasure the progress of a foreign enemy , which relieved them from more formidable domestic foes . The enmity of other countries was provoked , and insurrections excited in the conquered provinces , by no cause so frequently as by the unjust , rapacious , and oppressive conduct of those scions of the Patriciate who were sent abroad as proconsuls and generals of the armies . Besides , the most extensive foreign conquests were made , just at the time when even the poor semblance of a republic was tottering to its fall , and by the very men who caused its overthrow . Julius Cesar carried the eagles of the legions much farther than they were ever borne by his predecessors , and by this success prepared the way for a victory over the aristocratic faction which supported his rival , and over the liberties of his country . It is true , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so skilfully checked and balanced by the distribution of electoral power , and by the art , wealth , and influence of the nobles , that it existed less in reality than in name . Our historian is welcome to all the illustrations , which be can gather from Roman history , of the evil effects of popular power , even when the state was considered free . He may even push his researches further , and , from a comparison of the history of the Empire with the annals of the Republic , gain some new light respecting the tendencies of different forms of government . Whatever oppression and cruelty were practised by Rome under the consuls , or to whatever party in the state these unjust acts may be attributed , we fancy no one will consider them as equal , in respect of their injurious effects upon the xvell-being of mankind , to the manifestations of wickedness and folly by many of the Roman emperors . But the most striking illustration of his argument , because // it is the best known and the easiest to be studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of this country . Mr. Alison 's chapter on America is an elaborate and interesting one , though it is so slenderly connected - through the late war with England - with his main subject , the history of Europe during the French Revolution , that we suspect it would hardly have found a place in his work , if it had not been for its intimate bearing on the political discussion , into which he enters with so much earnestness . It is quite apparent , then , that a strong bias existed in his mind , when he first undertook a general summary of information respecting the condition , politics , and prospects , of the United States . The lesson taught by American experience of a popular government was previously determined hy his feelings and prejudices , and he investigated the subject in order to discover evidence only on one side . In such a case , it was inevitable that he should make blunders , but we were not prepared to find them so numerous and glaring as seriously to impair the credibility of other portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given the authorities in the margin for the principal statements in the text , and therefore it is only in the incidental and unguarded allusions to facts , made in the middle of a sentence , that he falls into the gross errors in which he is wholly unsupported by the testimony of others . But Mr. Alison 's experience ought to have taught him , that further precautions were required ; that it was necessary , not only to accumulate , but to weigh authorities , in order that he might not go on merely repeating the blunders or the calumnies of other writers . De Tocqueville and Chevalier were tolerably safe guides , though even into their works , the theoretical and generalizing spirit peculiar to a Frenchman has led to the introduction of some unfounded or exaggerated statements . But what persuaded our author to follow with implicit credence in the track of the whole herd of English tourists , - to trust such observers as Captain Hall and Miss Martineau ? Most of the tinfavorable statements respecting the working of the institutions , and the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the authority of these two writers ; though the ardent loyalty of the one , and the speculative Jacobinism of the other , rendered them equally unsafe and treacherous // guides . Ve have a great respect for the abilities and the character of Miss Martineau , but , while in this country , she had neither eyes nor ears for any thing that was not connected either with her views of theoretical democracy , or the abolition of slavery , and her work , therefore , as a whole , is as prejudiced and unfair as the most libellous productions of the English press respecting the United States . Having examined her volumes at length , at the time of their publication , we need refer now to only one of her statements , which is adopted without hesitation by Mr. Alison , as a proof of what is here advanced . Alluding to the character of the clergy in this country , she speaks with some respect of those members of the profession who are the most " secular in their habits of life . " But " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the vicious . " What must be thought of the temper , judgment , or discrimination , of the writer who would hazard such an assertion as this , respecting a large and most respectable body of men , not one in a hundred of whom she , probably , ever saw or heard of ? And , because no one ever ventured to insult the clergy , by undertaking to refute such a ridiculous assertion , Mr. Alison gravely adopts it , and consigns it to history , as a proof of the low ebb to which religion has sunk in this country Of the errors for which our author alone is responsible , the following is one of the most curious , in which one would think that any schoolboy might have corrected him . " The two Statcs of Massachusetts and JVew England continued to refuse to send their contingents to the war . " * He evidently supposes that New England is a separate State ; and , in order that there may be no doubt about the matter , the blunder is twice repeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he speaks of " the Northern States of Massachusetts , Connecticut , and . N'cw England . " This mistake is a ludicrous one , but it is not of much importance for the narrative or the arguments of the writer . As much can not be said for the next blunder that we notice , as it has a serious effect on his reasoning and conclusions . " All the State judges , from the highest to the lowest , are elected by the people , and are liable to be displaced hy them . // Their tenure of office is sometimes for three , sometimes for four , sometimes for six years , but never for life . " - Vol. x. p. 305 . We were on the point of saying , that it was but justice to Mr. Alison to mention the fact , that he was , probably , led into this blunder by M. de Tocqueville , who , in a passage quoted by our author , is made to affirm of all the judges , - even without distinction , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state judiciary , - that " they are elected by the majority , and hold their offices at their pleasure . " But what was our astonishment to find , on recurring to the original , that the proper qualification of Al . de Tocqueville 's remark was inserted in the very sentence here cited , but omitted in Mr. Alison 's translation , while the words italicized in the translation are not found in the original The following is the passage from the French writer , which is correctly translated by our author , ( Vol. x. p. 300 , ) excepting the clause in small capitals , which is omitted , and the clause above quoted in italics , which is an interpolation . " Lorsqu'un homme ou un parti souffire d'une injustice aux L'tats Unis , * qui vouiez vous qu'il s'adresse ? A l'opinion publique ? c'est elle qui forme la majorite ' ; au corps legislatif ? ii repr*sente la majoriu* , et iui ob*it aveughiment ; au pouvoir executif ? il est nornm* par la majorit* , et lui sert d'instrument passif ; * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la rnajorit6 sous les armes ; au jury ? le jury , c'est la majoriui rev*tue du droit de prononcer des arr6ts : les juges eux-m*mes , DANS CERTAINS ETATs , sont *lus par la rnajorit6 . Quelque inique ou d*raisonnable que sod la mesure qui vous frappe , ii faut done vous y soumettre. " - Tocqueville , De la D*niocratie en . flm4rique . Ciaqui*me Jidition . Paris . 1836. pp. 143 , 144 . In the common English translation by Mr. Reeve , the sentence is thus correctly rendered ; " The jury is the majority invested with the right of hearing judicial cases ; and , IN CERTAIN STATES , even the judg'es are elected by the majority . " * We are unwilling to accuse a writer , who shows so much apparent candor and fairness as Mr. Alison , of wilfully misstating facts , and deliberately falsifying the authority cited in support of them ; but , when we remember * Reeve 's translation of Tocqueville 's Democracy in . fhnerica . London . 1835 . Vol . II . p. 155. // that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forms an important point in his reasoning , and is referred to , again and again , in order to prove the general insecurity of life and property in the United States , it must he admitted that his character as a historian is subject to a very serious imputation . The deception could affect only a few of his English readers , for , of course , none in this country , and not many in Great Britain , need be informed , that the independence of the judges of the national courts is secured by an express provision in the Constitution , which requires , that the offices shall he held " during good hehaviour , " and the compensation attached " shall not he diminished during their continuance in office . " With respect to the State courts , in thirteen States , the judges hold office during good behaviour ; in eight others , they are appointed for periods not less than seven years , and , in some instances , these periods are for twelve or fifteen years . In two States , only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one instance , are they elected directly by the people , and they can never be removed hy the direct action of the people . In thirteen States , they are appointed by the legislatures ; in twelve , by the governors , with the advice of a senate , or a council . They are removable only by impeachment , or , in some instances , by an address of both branches of the legislature , for which , usually , the votes of two thirds , or three fourths , of the members of each house must concur . Let Mr. Alison compare these facts with the statement quoted from him on the preceding page , and then , perhaps , he will be able to explain his extraordinary perversion of the language of M. de Tocqueville . We have still to notice a few misstatements by our author , which are not of so much importance , except to show the hurried and careless manner in which he prepared the chapter on America . Speaking of Washington , he observes , that " one of the last acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casting vote in Congress , a commercial treaty with Great Britain . " * Does Mr. Ahison need to be informed , that the President has no vote in Congress , and that Washington never was a member of that body after the adoption of the Constitution in 1788 ? He evidently refers to the // ratification of Jay 's treaty by precisely a constitutional majority in the Senate , in 1795 ; its ratification , in spite of great opposition among the people , being due mainly to the firmness and great personal influence of Washington . Our author seems to be very ill informed respecting the powers and duties of the President , for the following blunder , one would think , could not have been committed by any one who ever read the Constitution of the United States . Any one of the authorities , that he cites in such profusion , would have put him right upon this point . " The President carries the laws into execution , but he has no share in their formation ; be can refuse his sanction , but , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not prevent them from being laws , and carried into effect , when a more pliant chief of the republic is elected . " * A singular anomaly , indeed ! The supposition appears to be , that , when the Executive refuses to sanction any bill passed by Congress , the law only falls into a sort of trance , from which it is awakened when any future President favors its enactment . In speaking of the banks in this country , 1Ir . Alison makes the following assertion . " The law allows any rate of interest agreed on by the parties to be taken , and it is often excessive ; one per cent . is a usual , three per cent . a month no uncommon occurrence . " t The law fixes the rate of interest in every State and territory in the Union ; in not one instance is it more than 8 , and , in twenty-one cases out of twenty-nine , no more than 6 per cent . a year is allowed , the penalty being usually a forfeiture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America , our author adduces the names of Cooper , Channing , and Washington Irving , as proof that " the American soil is not wanting in genius of the most elevated and fascinating character ; but their works are almost all published in London , - a decisive proof that European habits and ideas are necessary to their ( ? ) due development . " Let us turn this reasoning the other way . The names of Scott , Wordsworth , and Dickens , indeed , amply demonstrate that the * Vol . X. p. 297. t Ibid. , p. 285. * See the . Irnerican . *1lmanac for 1842 . Boston . pp. 106 , 107 . Vol . X. p. 306. // English soil is not wanting in genius of the most elevated and fascinating character ; but their works are all published in Boston , - a decisive proof that American habits and ideas are necessary to their due development . ' Does Mr. Alison perceive into what an absurdity he has fallen , or does he need to be informed farther , that the justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvest of applause on American ground , that all their works are published here , and ten copies of them are circulated here while one is sold in London ? We are sorry to notice these instances of carelessness , or of something worse , for they throw suspicion on other portions of the work , which were probably executed with more diligence and fidelity than this unlucky chapter on America . They show , at any rate , how dangerous it is for the historian to enter upon his task with a preconceived theory firmly established in his mind , which prevents him from seeing any thing but one class of facts , or arguments affecting but one side of the question . The democratic tendency of the age , the spirit of innovation and reform* , is the spectre which our author would fain exorcise by any charm , but " it will not down at his bidding . " It is evident , that he intended his work should produce an immediate effect upon public opinion on subjects not directly connected with his principal theme ; for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allusions are very frequent to events that have occurred since the French Revolution , and to the political aspect of things at the present day . This ulterior purpose has exerted a great influence , also , as we have already remarked , on his account of the institutions , and the character of the inhabitants , of this country . It has frequently betrayed him into the error , which even M. de Tocqueville has not always avoided , of attributing to our political situation many peculiarities which ought rather to be ascribed to physical circumstances , the nature of the country , the origin of its inhabitants , the religion of the first settlers , previously acquired habits , and a hundred other causes , which , independently of democracy , have bad an immense influence on the tone of American thought and feeling . He is often guilty of the blunder committed by the Hamiltons and the Trollopes , who went among the pioneers of civilization , - men whose office it is to level the forests and subdue the wilderness , // and whose lives are passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there uttered loud complaints , because they could not find the luxuries of an English drawing-room , or the intelligence and decorum which are shown in an English fashionable assembly . We pray all foreign tourists , especially English conservatives , who may hereafter visit this country , to remember that there are other influences here at work , besides a popular government , to modify the feelings and the prosl ) ects of the people . We have no fault to find with the summary account given by our author of the events of the last war between England and this country . The narrative is , in the main , a fair one , justice being done to both parties in the contest , and the blame for the commencement of hostilities being laid pretty equally on the English and American governments . Our business is , chiefly , with the writer 's general sketch of the condition and prospects of the American people , as affected by their political institutions . With xvhat feelings Mr. Alison approached this portion of his labors may be inferred from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which , if they ever had on earth , republican principles have enjoyed the fairest ground for trial , and the best opportunity for establishing their benefits . The land was boundless , and , in the interior , at least , of unexampled fertility . The nation began its career with all the advantages and powers , and none of the evils or burdens , of civilization . They had the inheritance of English laws , customs , and descent ; of the Christian religion , of European arts , and all the stores of ancient knowledge ; they had neither a territorial aristocracy , nor a sovereign on the throne , nor an hereditary nobility , nor a national debt , nor an established church , which are usually held out as the impediments to the blessings of freedom in the Old World . How , then , has the republican system worked in this , the garden of the world , and the land of promise ? " - Vol. x. p. 300 . The direct answer which is made by our author to this question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no security whatever either for life or property in America . " The spoliation of the commercial classes , he thinks , has already been effected ; and " the period , when the attack on landed property , if the present system of governrnent continues , will commence , may be predicted with cer // tainty . " Is life secure , then , he asks , when property is placed in such imminent peril ? " Experience , terrible experience , proves the reverse ; and demonstrates that not only is existence endangered , hut law is powerless against the once excited passions or violence of the people . " Such wild assertions as these are harmless , for they can deceive no one , and we might pass them over in pity to the individual whose prejudices could so far overcome his judgment as to induce him to consign them to the pages of sober history . But the alleged facts on which the charges rest , may deserve a moment 's consideration . Will it he believed , then , that the only support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances , related by Miss Martinean , of the practice of " Lynch law " in the western and southwestern States , about as many cases of riots in some of our cities , and the political warfare against the late Bank of the United States , which l'vlr . Alison chooses to consider as a revolt of the indigent classes , and as an organized attack upon property ? We might as well cite the dreadful murders committed , a year or two since , by Courvoisier and IDaniel Good , to prove the general insecurity of life in London . Has not England had recent experience of riots and insurrections in her manufacturing towns and districts , far more serious than any which have occurred in the United States during the present century ? A hitter contest , often giving rise to popular commotions , is going on at this moment between the manufacturing and the landed interest in England , and ever and anon the cries or convulsive struggles of the starving Chartists are heard , yet no one thinks of saying , that the institution of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as 1tr . Alison himself tells us , there was a concerted opposition to the Bank of England , very much like the present political contests about banking institutions in this country , the cry there being , " To stop the IDuke , go for gold " ; yet our author does not maintain that there was then an insurrection of poverty against wealth in London . These instances , although enough to expose the extravagant absurdity of the charges made against America in particular , will not suffice to disprove all that our historian has said of the evil consequences of democratic institutions in general ; for most of the events referred to have happened // since the passage of the Reform bill , when , according to Mr. Alison , the evil principle of democracy was enthroned in the British Constitution , and all the evils which have since visited England must be ascribed to its fatal influence . Co back , then , to an earlier day , to the time when the Manchester mob was trampled down under the hoofs of the dragoons , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riots , in 1780 . London was then the scene , for several days , of more frightful excesses , committed by a maddened populace , than have ever disgraced an American city , even during the troublous period of the Revolution , and the excitement of a civil war . The elegant mansion of the Chief Justice of England was sacked and burned , the prisons were delivered of their inmates and then committed to the flames , many of the intoxicated rioters perished in the conflagrations which their own hands had kindled , nor were the tumults quelled till a strong military force had reduced the city , as it were , to a state of siege . And the supposed leader of this mob was no vulgar and low-born demagogue , but a peer of the realm . These things took place in aristocratic England , before the crown had been shorn of its brightest beams by the encroachments of the people ; and no historian in those times ventured to say , that the government was , therefore , powerless , and the persons and fortunes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruffians . Yet , because a crowd of persons in Boston , some eight years since , seized an obnoxious individual , and conducted him in triumph through several streets , without offering any other violence , 1'Jr . Alison declares , that life and property are not safe in the United States . Of the two stories borrowed by our author from Miss Martineau , we can only say , that the one relating to an occurrence at Mobile rests on very doubtful authority ; she did not witness the event ; the newspapers , according to her own account , never breathed a syllable about the matter ; and we never heard of it till the appearance of her book . It was an article of American news that came to us by the way of England ; and we have always believed , that , in this case , as in some others , some wicked wag , knowing the lady 's appetite for the marvellous , especially in tales of such a class , made a very bold experiment upon her credulity . And does Mr. Alison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel // lers ' stories " of this description , to establish on the pages of history so grave a charge against the character of a whole nation ? The report of a dreadful affair at St. Louis , unhappily , is too true ; but even this account , as given by Miss Martineau , and quoted by Mr. Alison , has all the effect of falsehood , for it is but half told . An individual committed a most atrocious crime , which excited the liveliest indignation among the people , and an impatient and furious mob tore him from the hands of the officers of justice , and put him to a most cruel death on the spot . Humanity and reason forbid , that we should justify or palliate such an action ! It was a crime as abominable as that of which it formed the penalty . But it showed no indifference to right and wrong on the part of its perpetrators ; it was a wild and terrible act of revenge for outraged right , which we might praise among savages , though we execrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law . As such , it was everywhere reprobated ; and , as a similar event might occur under any government , it leaves no peculiar stain on the character of our institutions , or of the whole people . Even in the streets of London , the minions of the law have often had a struggle with the excited populace , who would fain have torn the criminal from their grasp , and inflicted vengeance on him more speedy than that of the courts . About a century and a half ago , a Lord Chancellor of England was exposed to great peril in this way , and he died in a few weeks , from the injuries and fright that he had actually received . Such an act manifests a strong , but ignorant and licentious , zeal for justice , and , though we deplore its occurrence , we may even proudly say , that the degraded subjects of an Eastern despotism would not be capable of such a crime . But it is really a pitiful business to scrutinize the two or three instances of popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that " the atrocities of the French Revolution , cruel and heart-rending as they are , have been exceeded on this side of the Atlantic . " Mr. Ahison himself suggests the unanswerable plea to be offered by American writers in such cases , " that it is unjust to hold their institutions responsible for acts common to them with all mankind . " A longer catalogue may be formed of riot and crime , occurring during any given period , in France or England , than in the United States . And is no allowance // to be made for the fact , that popular outbreaks in those countries are kept down by a large armed force , while , here , there is nothing to restrain the people but their own sense of right ? Take away from Paris the ten thousand troops of the line ; remove from London that large body of armed and disciplined men in uniform , not called soldiers , - oh , no freeborn Englishmen would not tolerate the presence of soldiers in such numbers , - but " the Metropolitan Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those cities , and in unguarded Boston or New York . We would not taunt Europeans with the precautions which they find necessary , in order to preserve the peace in their large cities . But do not let them seize on every instance of a trivial disturbance here , in order to show by contrast the admirable order and security which they enjoy , under the protection of the bayonet . We all know , that a price is to be paid for liberty , and , for our own part , we are not inclined to chaffer about the sum , so that we may be relieved from the necessity of meeting a soldier or a policeman at every corner . What is called " Lynch law * is as little known in New England and the Middle States as in Great Britain ; and , if some lamentable instances of it have occurred in the new settlements , let any reasonable person decide , whether they are to be ascribed to the fact , that a great tide of emigrants , from all parts of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks ago , was a wilderness , and where as yet they have hardly had time to organize tribunals of justice , or to the pernicious effects of democratic institutions . The very fact , that this flood of immigration continues , is enough to show how baseless are the charges which we are now considering . Men do not remove their household gods from a place where they are protected by a strong and just government , to one where neither life nor property is secure . The English , Scotch , and Irish do not emigrate to Turkey , though some of her fertile plains are nearly as destitute of population as our western forests . But we have something better than indirect testimony to the peaceful , humane , and orderly character , in general , of the people of the United States . We appeal from Philip drunk to Philip sober , - from Mr. Alison reasoning against democracy , to Mr. Alison , the historian , candidly narrating facts . The following are some of the admissions that escape // him , when , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparition of popular rule . " These principles bave not been abandoned by the descendants of England , in their transatlantic possessions . When the Americans threw off the yoke of Britain , they retained its laws , its religion , its institutions ; no massacres or proscriptions , no confiscations or exiles , disgraced the rise of their liberty ; no oblivion of the past was made the foundation of their hopes for the future . The English Church is still the prevailing religion of the land ; ( ? ) the English decisions still regulate their courts of justice ; and English institutions form the basis on which their national prosperity has been reared . Amidst the exasperation of a civil war , they have never deviated from the usages of civilized life . " - Vol. i. p. 49 .

" - Vol. x. p. 280 . " This marvellous rapidity of increase has hitherto not only been unattended with any addition to human suffering , but it has taken its rise rather from the prodigious extent to which , owing to the combined bounty of nature and efforts of man , general prosperity has been diffused through all classes of the community . Among the many marvels which strike an European traveller on his first approach to the United States , one of the most extraordinary is the general well-being which pervades all classes of the community .

But , enterprising as it is in Great Britain , it is not influenced by such a restless spirit of activity , such a perpetual fever of exertion , as // appears among its descendants in the New World . rPhe vast facilities for the acquisition of fortune , which the prodigious increase of population , and boundless extent of fertile land , afford the entire absence of all hereditary rank or property , which opens the career of power and distinction alike to every citizen the engrossing thirst for gold , which springs from its being the only source of distinclion and the only durable basis of power , have combined , with the active and persevering habits which they have inherited from their Anglo-Saxon ancestors , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enterprise , to which nothing comparable has ever been witnessed among mankind , it is the fervor of Roman conquest , turned only to war with the desert ; the fever of French democracy , yet ' guiltless of its country 's blood . ' " - Vol. x. p. 290 . But Mr. Alison fears that we shall soon lose the good character which he has here given us . He fears that the poor , who form the majority , will soon attack the rich , and even declares that the time for the spoliation is fixed . " As soon as the majority of electors , in any of the States , have come to be persons without any interest in the soil , and when the back settlements have become so distant , by the advance of civilization , that it is less trouble to take their neighbour 's fields than to go to the Far West to seek possessions of their own , " then the attack on property in land will commence , commercial wealth having already fallen a prey to the spoiler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become thieves , then men 's purses will be in danger . There is nothing new in these lugubrious warnings ; the Halls and the Hamiltons have dinned them into our ears a thousand times . The great mistake committed by these prophets of ill , lies in supposing that , when men have the power , they will also have the will , to rob their neighbours . They either overlook , or wholly deny the fact , that there is any thing like a sense of justice or of moral obligation in man , and appear seriously to maintain that the only reason why , in any country , the many do not seize the possessions of the few is , that they are not strong enough to commit so open a robbery . We have already avowed that we are no disciples of the doctrine of perfectibility ; but we have still less faith in the opposite gloomy theory of Hobbes , - that man is a wild beast , fit only to be chained in a cell , lest he should prey upon his fellow-brutes . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re // ligion were but a name , if there were no punishment to be feared in this world , and no retribution hereafter , selfishness would still teach man , that it was bad policy to plunder his brother , for his ill-gotten gains would only become the prey of the next ruffian that was stronger than he . Who does not see that , before a reckless and unprincipled majority can even begin the work of spoliation , they must be not only miserably poor , but must have lost all hope of becoming rich by any means ? And what human being was ever reduced to such destitution ? The majority do not rob now , says Mr. Alison , because the majority is still composed of those who have some wealth , and each one fears for himself the rule which he would fain apply to his neighbour . But a man will guard his hopes with as much vigilance as he shows in watching over his possessions . If a general system of plunder were instituted , a man must renounce the last expectation of ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sense than that ; the old proverb says , that there is honesty even in that community . But it is idle to go about controverting a theory by argument , which is already confuted by experience . The politcal power in this country is already in the hands of those who have the least to lose and the most to gain by an attack upon property ; and what indications are there , that they are inclined to use their strength in this way ? Mr. Alison appeals to " the violent outcry which has been raised in every part of the Union against the paper credit and the commercial aristocracy . " He might as well cite the present existence of a " corn-law league " in England , as a proof that the property of the landholders there is endangered . Whenever the capital and industry of a country are divided among several great interests , it is natural that jealousy should grow up between them , and that each should endeavour to gain for itself the patronage and support of the government . Each tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to rob , the other ; for capital is vested in all , and he who attacks one form of property , does his best to destroy the institution itself . In this age , neither in the United States , nor in Europe , can the jealousy existing between the various professions drive either of them to such an act of madness . Experience teaches them better . The failure of the banks and the stoppage of credit , which Mr. Alison considers as // the effect of blows aimed at the commercial classes alone , have nowhere been felt more severely than in the agricultural States . And his fears for the landholders are quite as unnecessary as his sympathy with the merchants . His theory is , that property in land is less secure in proportion as it is farther removed from the back settlements , where land can be had for little or nothing . Yet the farmer in Massachusetts sleeps not a whit less soundly than his brother in the west of New York , although he is much farther off than the latter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Alison 's reasoning depends on the false assumption , that , when men can not buy western farms at a low price , they will steal those of their eastern neighbours . We do not seek to conceal either the evils or the dangers that wait on a popular government , He must be a resolute advocate of it , who can not learn prudence and caution from the moral of the terrible story , which is told in the first two volumes of the work before us . But do not let these evils be confounded with others , which are common to all forms of government , because they are inseparably connected with the imperfections of human nature . In this vague talk about a pure democracy or a pure aristocracy , we must not lose sight of the proper character of our own institutions , which is , perhaps , as far removed from the one as from the other . From many of the dangers peculiar to the former we have been secured by the wisdom and foresight of the founders of the Constitution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , by accepting the instrument which they framed , the people submitted to those restraints , and voluntarily tied their own hands . The frame of government under which we live is a system of checks and balances , nearly as complicated and artfully arranged as that which forms the British constitution . The independence of the judiciary , the guaranty of the perpetual obligation of contracts , the division of the legislative power into two chambers , the peculiar formation and functions of the senate , the members of which are elected by the State legislatures , and not by a direct popular vote , the qualified negative upon legislative acts accorded to the President , the long term of office granted to the executive and the senate , and many other provisions , are skilfully devised and efficient limitations of the power of the majority . Many of these provisions // were copied into the State constitutions , or borrowed from them , and thus a double barrier was erected between the rights of the individual and the tyrant will of the multitude . Without these checks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey as of the United States for the essence of despotism consists in the action of a sovereign without the restraint of law , no matter whether that sovereign be one man , or a privileged class , or a majority of the people . The want of such salutary restraints as these in the constitution adopted in France , in 1791 , is justly considered by Mr. Alison as the chief cause of the lamentable failure of the government which the Revolutionary party sought to establish . Miss Martineau , in the ardor of her attachment to the purest form of democracy , objects to the admission of such articles into the American constitution . " The senate is an anomaly , " she observes ; " the appointment of the judges for life is another departure from the absolute republican principle . " We are quite of her mind . These provisions are wholly at variance with the theory of a purely democratic government ; and the founders of the Constitution who proposed them , and the people who ratified them , and have quietly enjoyed the protection which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thereby declared that they would not trust an unmixed democracy , but would establish in its place a constitutional government . We commend our fair theorist to the attentive study of the French constitution of 1791 , which had no provision for a senate , and which limited the judges ' term of office to three years . The history of the three years which followed the adoption of that instrument , may give her some new views respecting the comparative wisdom of the measures adopted by the friends of liberty in France , and in the United States . But these are uncertain guaranties , it may be said , since the Constitution may be altered , and these salutary limitations of the popular power be repealed . So they may , but not at the will of a mere majority . A concurrence of two thirds in both houses of Congress , or of the legislatures of two thirds of the several States , is necessary before an amendment to the Constitution can be formally proposed , and then it must be ratified by not less than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the instrument . This provision // is so complicated that it can scarcely ever take effect , and it is now justly regarded as quite a visionary thing to propose any amendment to the Constitution . The wisdom of throwing so great impediments in the way of making any alterations has been acknowledged in a high quarter ; for not many years since , the " Quarterly Review " - no mean authority in Mr. Alison 's eyes - regretted the want , in the British Constitution , of " that powerful conservative principle , so wisely emhodied in the original frame of the American Constitution . " With the exception of a few amendments proposed when the instrument was ratified , and immediately accepted , and which ought , therefore , to he regarded almost as a portion of the original draught , and excepting also an unimportant alteration , adopted in 1804 , respecting the mode of voting in the election of a president , the Constitution has remained unchanged from 1788 till the present hour . It would be difficult to mention any state in Europe , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , during the past half century . The continuance of this form of government during so long a period , and with so little change , whatever may be its fate in future , is a proof that free institutions are practicable . In reply , then , to our author 's question , " How has the republican system worked in this , the garden of the world , and the land of promise ? " - we say , that the experiment has fully succeeded . It has worked well with a generation that has passed away ; and , if it fails in another , the only proper conclusion will he , not that republican institutions are impracticable , hut that the men of the present day are not equal to their fathers . In accounting for the comparatively bloodless character of the English revolutions of 1640 and 1688 , contrasted with the French revolution of 1789 , Mr. Alison justly lays great stress upon the fact , that the English patriots were wont to regard liberty , " not as a boon to be gained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invasion of the constitution , but a restoration of its pristine purity . The love of freedom came thus to be inseparably blended with the veneration for antiquity . " " The passion for liberty , " he continues , " was thus divested of its most dangerous consequence , by being separated from the desire for innovation . " By the inestimable inheritance of a Constitution , now consecrated by the lapse of more than half a century , // the Americans of the present day are placed in an equally fortunate position , and their love of the instrument itself has come to be mingled with the reverence due to the memory of its authors . Age is thus every day strengthening its hold on the public mind . Already is it hallowed in some degree with the moral power and interest , which attach to an ancient institution . Already is it the object of that love and veneration , which are due to the expressed will and the embodied wisdom of an elder generation . Party spirit at times may attack its most important provisions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delude themselves with the vain conception of a more perfect instrument ; illjudging philanthropy and enthusiasm may aim serious blows against it , under the false impression that it injures some of those high and sacred objects , of which it is , in reality , the strongest bulwark and support . But these various assaults , exaggerated in appearance by the noisy zeal and intemperate language of those who make them , can not upheave the broad foundation on which the instrument rests . The Constitution stands like an oak already of mature growth , and , though the tempests of faction may assail it , till the branches creak and even the solid trunk quivers in the furious gust , it remains firmly rooted in the affections of the community ; for it is at once the palladium of their liberties , and the safeguard of the people against themselves . We had purposed to say something of the character of the remarkable man , the account of whose career necessarily occupies so large a portion of the volumes now before us . But our remarks have already exceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have commented with perfect freedom on the mistakes which Mr. Alison has committed , and the prejudices which have so evidently warped his judgment in respect to the nature and effects of free institutions , and the condition and prospects of the people of this country . But the most objectionable portions of the work have been selected for this purpose and we should be very sorry to leave the impression on the minds of our readers , that the whole is equally tainted with error . It is , in the main , an able and elaborate performance , the history of an important period skilfully told ; and there are few persons who may not find interest and instruction in its pages@@184059123.txt IT is one of the fortunate results of modern civilization , and of the clearer understanding of international law which goes hand in hand with it , that the differences between nations are more easily adjusted , and the causes of them less frequent , than in former times , when this law was not so perfectly defined , and when war was the pastime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fame , or an extension of power . Discords among nations have their origin in two sources , opposite interests and contested rights . By a reasonable exercise of candor , clashing interests may he reconciled on the common principles of justice and mutual advantage ; hut where a right , or a supposed right , is involved in the dispute , it is then encumbered with new difficulties , because it touches the spring of national honor . Unhappily , the late misunderstanding hetween Great Britain and the United States , respecting the Northeastern Boundary , partook of this character . Hence , the longer it was discussed , the more vehemently each party insisted on its claims , and the more were the obstacles to an amicahle arrangement enlarged and multiplied . It is not our purpose to investigate the details of this controversy ; nor to reiterate the arguments which have been so often repeated . We shall confine our remarks to such a statement of the case , as may show on what grounds the // question stood at the time when the negotiation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Treaty itself . Vhen it is considered how extremely little was known of the geography of the country in 1783 , it can not be a matter of surprise , that the framers of the treaty of peace should fail to define a boundary line of nearly two thousand miles in extent , with such precision as to leave no room for doubt and difference of opinion in the interpretation of their language . The part of the treaty , which has given rise to the dispute , and nearly brought the two nations into a conflict of arms , is contained in the following words . It is said that the boundary shall proceed " from the northwest angle of Nova Scotia , namely , that angle which is formed by a line drawn due north from the source of the St. Croix River to the highlands , along the said highlands , which divide those rivers that empty themselves into the St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean , to the northwesternmost head of Connecticut River . " And , in another part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a line to be drawn along the middle of the River St. Croix , from its mouth in the Bay of Fundy to its source , and from its source directly north to the aforesaid highlands , which divide the rivers that fall into the Atlantic Ocean from those which fall into the River St. Lawrence . " The meaning of these words has been the great point at issue . As a proof of the deficiency of geographical knowledge at this time , it needs only to be stated , that , almost immediately after the ratification of the treaty , a dispute arose as to the identity of the St. Croix River . It appeared , that there were three rivers emptying themselves into the Passamaquoddy Bay , which had respectively been called by that name . The British claimed the most western , and the Americans the most eastern , as the one intended by the treaty . The difference was important , because it affected not only the line of boundary formed by the river itself , but the position of the northern line throughout its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till , by the Treaty of London , commonly called Jay 's Treaty , it was provided that commissioners should be appointed by the two governments to exaniine and decide which was the true St. Croix . In this decision , the claim of the United States was sustained , // and the dispute was settled . The testimony of Mr. Adams and Mr. Jay on this subject undoubtedly had much weight . A monument was erected at the source of the St. Croix , to denote the boundary at that place . It still remained to find the northwest angle of Nova Scotia , which was to be sought somewhere in the line running due north from the monument , and at the point where this line should cross the highlands dividing streams which empty themselves into the St. Lawrence from those which run into the Atlantic Ocean . The line along those highlands to the head waters of the Connecticut River was also to be ascertained . And here it should be recollected , that the commissioners , who framed the treaty of 1783 , did not pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delineated , nor to define an angle which had been ascertained with mathematical exactness by actual measurement . It was known only , that Nova Scotia was bounded on the west and north by lines which must meet in an angle somewhere , and it was presumed that this angle was at the summit of certain highlands . The intention is supposed to have been , that this northeastern boundary should correspond with the old boundary between New England , Nova Scotia , and Canada ; yet this had never been surveyed , or even described , except in the vague and general language of charters , commissions to governors , and proclamations . Hence , whatever may have been the intention of the negotiators , we see the reason why they expressed themselves with so much looseness and uncertainty . They could nut describe with precision what was unknown . Yet the question rested entirely on a practical interpretation of their language , with such aids as could be derived from a more accurate knowledge of the topography of the country . If they had simply added to the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " south of the St. John , " the ob*scurity would have vanished at once , and there could have been but one opinion as to their meaning . Again , there was a doubt concerning the particular branch of the Connecticut River intended by the treaty , and the line on the forty-fifth degree of latitude , between that river and the St. Lawrence , which was said to have been inaccurately surveyed . Nioreover , the long line extending from this latter point to the Lake of the Woods and the head of the Mississippi , running through lakes and rivers , and winding // among islands , had never been determined . In this unsettled state was the important question of boundaries at the close of the last war . By the treaty of Ghent , the preliminary steps were taken for an amicable adjustment of the whole line . Four separate commissions were agreed upon , to each of which was to be assigned a part of the boundary . The first was to determine the line between the islands in the Passamaquoddy Bay ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defining the line from the source of the St. Croix to the point in the St. Laxvrence , which is cut by the forty-fifth degree of latitude ; the third was to begin the line at this point , and pursue it to the outlet of Lake Superior , and " decide to which of the two parties the several islands lying in the lakes , water communications , and rivers forming the said boundary , do respectively belong " ; and the fourth was to decide the same from the outlet of Lake Superior to the northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods . Each of the governments was to appoint one commissioner for each of the commissions , and , in case these should disagree , the subject of difference was to he referred to some friendly sovereign or state , whose decision was to be final and conclusive . Commissioners were accordingly appointed for all these objects . The first commission , for apportioning the islands in the Passamaquoddy Bay , was successful ; but not so the second . The primary object was , to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced their survey at the monument , and proceeded in a due north line about forty miles , till they came to an eminence called Mars Hill . Here the British commissioner stopped short , and declared he had reached the highlands , and found the long-desired angle . This hill is far south of the river St. John , and more than a hundred miles from the nearest source of any of the streams flowing into the St. Lawrence , where , according to the words of the treaty , the highland boundary was to he met by a line running north from the St. Croix . From this time the dispute assumed a definite shape , each party claiming a different range of highlands , as answering the terms of the treaty , one at the north and the other at the south of the St. John . From its mouth upward , the St. John takes a northwesterly direction , till after it crosses the line running north from the // St. Croix , and then it sweeps off to the southwest , and receives its head waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all large rivers have their fountains in highlands on each side , forming a basin through which the main stream passes . Thus it is with the St. John , and this basin , west of the north line so often mentioned , was the territory in dispute , of a triangular form , consisting of about twelve thousand square miles , or more than seven and a half millions of acres , and almost equally divided by the River St. John . Whether this territory belonged to Maine or Great Britain depended on the point at which should be fixed the northwest angle of Nova Scotia . It is not necessary now to examine the merits of the controversy . It is enough to say , that the further it has been pursued , the more perplexed it has become , and the less likelihood there has been of an agreement . Down to the last , both parties have maintained their claim with equal pertinacity and apparent conviction . Lord Ashburton avows his firm belief , that the British right to the whole territory is incontestable ; and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever more unanimously adopted , both by the Congress and people of the United States , than the equity of the American claim to its fullest extent . Since all the facts are open to both parties , it is certainly remarkable that they should lead to such opposites conclusions . As a clue to some of the difficulties of the case , we will say a few words on the attempts that have been made to find the northwest angle of Nova Scotia , on which pivot the whole controversy turns , since the highland boundary must begin at that angle . We have mentioned the discovery of the British commissioner at Mars Hill ; and his government afterwards maintained that there was the true angle of Nova Scotia . A construction so much at variance with what seemed to be the obvious sense of the treaty , however , was discountenanced by others , even in Great Britain . The report of Messrs . Mudge and Featherstonhaugh carries the angle considerably further north , about half way between 1'iars Hill and the St. John . It is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that it ought to be placed further west on a line running north from the source of a stream emptyin* itself into the Schoodic Lakes , which they pronounce to be the genuine St. Croix . Again , Mr. Charles // Buller , member of Parliament , wrote an able and ingenious paper , * chiefly to prove that the angle ought to be pushed up across the St. John to a point near the source of the ustagouche , which runs northeasterly and falls into the Bay of Chaleurs . In his opinion , likewise , the words , " along the highlands , " were not employed to denote a line running in a crooked direction along the sinuosities of any particular mountain range , hut a straight line passing over the mountainous region between the northwest angle of Nova Scotia and the head waters of the Connecticut River . Mr. Biidler accordingly confutes the argument in favor of the southern highlands , and the Mars Hill angle , which he says is " no angle at all of Nova Scotia , " hut a point in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our information be correct , and we have no doubt it is , that Mr. Buller 's paper was read and approved hy Lord Palrnerston before it was published , we have a striking proof of the little confidence reposed by the British government in the arguments which had been used to establish the angle at Mars Hill , and in favor of the southern highlands . Here , then , we have four angles , on the British side , and yet there can not possibly be more than one true angle , and that a single point with a fixed locality . To assume two , or three , or any other9 number of angles , remote from each other , and to argue that the one or the other may or must be the angle of the treaty , is , in fact , to abandon the question , and to rest upon nothing . If we turn to the American side , the conclusion will be nearly the same . The angle uniformly insisted on by the American negotiators is the point on the Canadian highlands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line running due north from the source of the St. Croix . Yet other opinions have been advanced . In the instructions of the old Congress to the commissioners for negotiating the treaty of peace , the northwest angle of Nova Scotia is mentioned as being near the source of the St. John . It is supposed that they may have alluded to the Madawaska branch of that river , and this idea is thrown out by the Commissioners of Maine , in their reply to one of Lord Ashburton 's communications to Mr. Webster ; but still this supposition would carry the angle at least fifty miles too far west . Mr. Hale , in a * See Westminster Review for June , 1840. vOL . LvI. - NO. 119. 58 // paper published in the . ilrnericar&amp; . Ilrnanctc for 1840 , written with ability and remarkable clearness , has taken the ground , that the true angle is a few miles north of the St. John , near the sources of the Ristagouche . He thinks our negotiators have erred in adhering so strenuously to the summit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Buller , although the inferences drawn by these two writers , in regard to the boundary , are essentially different . What shall we say to this singular discordance of opinion , not only between the parties , but between the supporters of each party , respecting this vital element of the controversy ? Can we say any thing else , than that there is an impenetrable obscurity in the thing itself , and that the words of the treaty do not admit of that clear and satisfactory interpretation which some have imagined ? If we look a little further , and glance at another cardinal point , the position of the highlands , our embarrassment will not be relieved . The treaty defines these highlands as dividing waters which " empty themselves into the St. Lawr*nce from those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean . " According to the American construction , the only chain of highlands answering to this description is the one north of the St. John , and between that river and the St. Lawrence . The British contend , on the contrary , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not into the Atlantic Ocean , as intended by the above words of the treaty ; and they cite other parts of the treaty to show , that what the commissioners meant in this place by the Atlantic Ocean was the part of the sea west of the St. Croix . Moreover , from the portion of the highlands , where the Americans fix their angle , the waters flow off in an easterly direction , and empty themselves through the ilistagouche into the Bay of Chaleurs , which , it is said , can not be designated by the general phrase , Atlantic Ocean so that the waters at that place are not divided as required by the words of the treaty . Mr. Webster has endeavoured to set aside this objection by a new and forcible argument . He says , that in the construction of treaties , and other instruments of this nature , where there is certainty on one side and doubt on the other , the certainty must rule the doubt . It is certain that the north line must proceed to highlands , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jt follows , that the streams running the other way must be regarded as flowing into the Atlantic , although in their course they may pass through hays and gulfs . Lord Ashburton replies to this argument , but he does not answer it . He contents himself with citing the opinion of the King of the Netherlands , who looked upon it as hazardous to class the Ristagouche with the streams falling into the Atlantic , and his Lordship adds his own opinion , that such an idea would he " most absurd . " This blunt phrase was not relished by the Maine Commissioners , and they have taken some pains to turn the tables upon his Lordship , by confronting his assertions with additional arguments . Mr. Hale removes this obstacle , by assuming the angle to be at the source of the Ristagouche , as we have seen , and then running a line along the highlands which separate the waters of that river from those of the St. John , till it reaches the Canadian highlands at a point considerably farther west than the angle claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that it supposes the Ristagouche to be among the rivers falling into the St. Lawrence , in the sense of the treaty , which is more hazardous , as it seems to us , than to class it with the streams that empty themselves into the Atlantic Ocean . These difficulties , according to the British view of the subject , render it impossible to explain the treaty by seeking for the boundary to the north of the valley of the St. John , and yet , since highlands are expressly mentioned , and more than once , they must be found somewhere . The southern range is selected as the only one that remains , and the hard task is undertaken of making it conform to the language of the treaty . Between the sources of the Connecticut and the St. John the case is clear enough . Here a mountain range divides the waters of the St. Lawrence from those running into the Atlantic . But , from the head of the St. John to Mars Hill , a distance of more than a hundred miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , on the other , they empty themselves into the St. John , and not into the St. Lawrence , as they ought to do , if we keep to the words of the treaty . We are to be reconciled to this apparent contradiction by the forced inference , that the framers of the treaty meant their description to apply to the principal range west of the basin of the St. John , and that this // southern chain is a continuation of the other , and necessarily included as a part of the whole . If we are still dissatisfied , we are brought at once to the last resort ; namely , that the treaty can not he executed hy any intelligible or practicable rules of interpretation . Such is a brief state of the controversy as to the two principal points , the northwest angle and the highlands , upon which all the other points depend . Without taking a step in the inquiry , whether the negotiators of the treaty of 1783 really understood the boundary they descrihed , or the meaning of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundary , or intended a new line , the question may emphatically he asked , whether , at the stage at which the discussion had arrived through this maze of conflicting opinions and contradictory arguments , it was possible for the parties ever to agree upon any construction of the treaty , with a rigid adherence to the claim of right , or for an arbitrator to come to any decision , on the grounds of the treaty , aided hy all the lights with which he could he furnished . The answer is most conclusively in the negative . A compromise , with the aim of conciliation , afforded the only hope of an amicable , or even a practicable , arrangement . Nor could there have been the least chance for such a compromise , without breaking , at the outset , the toils of the old controversy , throwing aside the treaty , and taking up the subject anew , with the single purpose of establishing a conventional line , suited to the convenience of the parties , if not meeting all their expectations . This was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiators at Washington , and which they were so fortunate as successfully to execute . The experiment of one arbitration had failed . The case was referred to the King of the Netherlands ; documents and maps were laid before him , and agents were sent from the two countries to afford the necessary explanations . it can not he doubted , that the arbitrator bestowed all the attention on the subject which its importance demanded , as affecting the peace , honor , and interests of the two nations , which had confided their cause to his charge . After a full inquiry , however , be confessed himself unable to decide the matter in dispute ; nevertheless , that he might present a ground of reconciliation , he proposed a new boundary line , which he thought would meet the equity of the case . By this line , // the disputed territory was so divided as to assign nearly two thirds of it to Maine , and the remainder to Great Britain . Mr. Preble , the American minister appointed to superintend the business of the arbitration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrator had transcended his powers , by which he was authorized and requested only to determine the true line of the treaty , and not to make a new one . The legislature of INlaine sustained this protest , and refused to accept the award . It was likexvise rejected by the Senate of the United States , although President Jackson was in favor of its being received ; and he was so much inclined to an adjustment on this basis , that he proposed a provisional arrangement , by which the United States should grant a million of acres of western lands to Nlaine , as an indemnity for the part of the disputed territory assigned to Great Britain . This proposal was rejected ; and here we must acquit the legislature of Maine of the suspicion of being influenced by pecuniary motives , since the lands thus offered , at the minimum price of sales , were worth a million and a quarter of dollars , an amount far beyond any value that could possibly he attached to the portion of territory they were solicited to relinquish . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netherlands , but , as the United States declined to yield their assent , the two countries were thrown back to the position in which they stood before the reference . The history of subsequent events needs not be narrated . Whilst the governments were deliberating , and repeating their arguments , the borderers resorted to arms , and a feverish excitement was beginning to pervade the public mind , portending future discords and troubles . Every day afforded additional proofs , that a speedy settlement of the dispute was of the utmost importance to the two countries . Some progress was made towards maturing a plan for a new arbitration . At this juncture , the British government , in an honorable and praiseworthy spirit of conciliation , appointed a special minister to proceed to the United States , with powers to adjust all the questions of boundary on such terms as should give mutual satisfaction . It is needless to say , that this advance was met by the government of the United States in the same spirit . The choice of the minister was judicious and fortunate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country , and were such as not only to inspire public confidence , but to raise a general and strong hope , that his mission of amity and peace would not prove abortive . And no American could for a moment distrust the ability , knowledge , and patriotism of Mr. Webster , or doubt what course he would pursue in whatever concerned the dignity and rights of his country . It was , therefore , a matter of universal congratulation , that the affair , so weighty in itself , and so momentous in its consequences , had fallen into the hands of these negotiators . We shall now attempt a brief sketch of their proceedings . In his first communication , Lord Ashburton proposed not to renew the " interminable discussion , " as he called it , on general grounds , but to come directly to the matter in hand ; to which Mr. Webster acceded . Yet his Lordship could not refrain from deviating so far from the course he had prescribed , as to touch upon this discussion in a manner , that called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine Commissioners to open upon his Lordship the whole battery of the old controversy . By a wise forbearance , however , there was a lucky escape from this snare . Some degree of sensitiveness is observable , also , on both sides , as to the light in which the concessions they were about to make should be regarded . They seem strenuous to have it appear , that they are not to be understood as conceding any thing , that their claims are indisputable , and that whatever each may grant to the other must be taken as a voluntary sacrifice to the desire of conciliation . We remember a similar show of sensitiveness in the negotiation of the treaty of 1783 . The British ministry were extremely reluctant to frame the treaty in such a form , that independence should seem to be conceded to the United States without an equivalent ; as if it were something in their possession , which they were about to bargain away . They would exchange it as the price of peace . The Americans claimed it as their right . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminaries of that negotiation . In the present instance , we perceive symptoms of a similar feeling . Perhaps it is natural ; and yet , it looks more like a shadoxv than a substance , especially when the object is conciliation on the basis of a compromise . No essential embarrassments , however , were interposed // by these considerations . Lord Ashburton first suggested a boundary line , which should run due north from the St. Croix to the St. John , and thence along that river to some one of its sources ; with the exception of the 1'Iadawaska settlements , situate on both sides of the river ; and here he required the line to be drawn so far south as to include all these settlements within the British possessions . He is sentimental on this point , and seems almost to make it a sine qua non . " There would he evident hardship , I might say cruelty , " he observes , " in separating this now happy and contented village . I can not in any case abandon the obvious interests of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a petition to the Queen , " imploring her Majesty 's protection , and deprecating the hard fate of being surrendered to the United States . His Lordship does not inform us , at whose instance the petition was procured . One would think these poor people were to be consigned over to Turkey or Morocco , or forced under the dominion of barbarians . The Commissioners of Maine , callous to this pathetic appeal , put the question at rest , by declaring , in positive terms , that they would not in any event agree to bring the line at this place south of the St. John . Mr. Webster was equally decided . Making all due allowance for his Lordship 's sympathies , he could not admit , " as far as political relations are concerned , " that there was any cruelty in the case . In fact , these sympathies were of recent origin . By the award of the King of the Netherlands , the line was to separate these settlements ; and yet the British government acceded to that award without making any reservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so unfortunate as to fall under the jurisdiction of the United States . As a part of his first proposition , also , the British negotiator said he was prepared to concede the right of navigating the St. John . After this primary stage of the negotiation , we learn little of the details . The business was transacted chiefly by conferences , the particulars of which are presumed not to have been recorded . The principles , reasons , and results , are sufficiently explained by the treaty itself , and by the published documents . The northeastern boundary , as finally agreed upon , proceeds in a due north line from the monument to the river St. John , thence up that river to the mouth of the St. Francis , and along the St. Francis to its outlet from the // Lake Pohenagamook . It then turns southwesterly , and runs mostly in a straight line , in a direction nearly parallel with the St. John , to the i'Latjarmette portage between the head waters of the Penobscot and Chaudi*re rivers , and from that place along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a territorial division , this line is more favorable to Great Britain , than that designated by the King of the Netherlands , since it leaves on the British side , at the foot of the highlands west of the St. Francis , somewhat over half a million of acres more than was assigned by the award . It is estimated , however , that the portion south of the present dividing line , and within the limits of INlaine , is , in value , at least four fifths of the whole . The lands north of the St. John are sterile , little fitted for cultivation , and almost destitute of lumber ; whereas the territory at the south , particularly the valley of the Aroostook , is rich and fertile , and covered with a heavy growth of good timber . This consideration , however , is of small moment , compared with the national interests involved in the question ; and , although Lord Ashburton puts it in as a makeweight , it evidently went but little way towards reconciling the Commissioners of Maine to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation of the St. John for all the products of the forest and of agriculture , with precisely the same privileges that are allowed to similar products in New Brunswick , may of itself be regarded as an equivalent for the barren lands ceded on the north of that river . And in this equivalent Massachusetts participates , for the lands owned by that State within the territory will be increased in value by having this outlet for their products . Such is the bearing of this part of the treaty on the States most intimately concerned . Let us follow it farther in its application to the United States . By the treaty of 1783 , the boundary line was to run to the " northwesternmost head " of the Connecticut River , down that river to the forty-fifth degree of latitude , and along that parallel of latitude to the River St. Lawrence . There was a dispute as to which branch of the Connecticut was intended , the British claiming the main branch , and the Americans one farther west , called " Hall 's Stream . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand acres . Again , // the parallel of forty-five degrees was the old boundary of Canada , which had been surveyed before the Revolution . By more recent surveys , it was ascertained that this line was erroneous , and that the true line coincided with it only at one point near the St. Lawrence , and then diverged southerly through its whole course to the Connecticut River , where the distance between them was three quarters of a mile , thus cutting off a triangular strip from New York and Vermont , including Rouse 's Point near the north end of Lake Champlain . This point had been selected by the American government as a military post of great importance , on account of its commanding the entrance into the lake from the River Richelien ; and , at the close of the last war , a fortification was erected there at a heavy expense to the nation . In the reference to the Kii*g of the Netherlands , three distinct points were submitted to his arbitration . First , the northwest angle of Nova Scotia , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Connecticut River ; thirdly , the line which should be adopted as the parallel of forty-five degrees . We have seen how he disposed of the first . The two others be decided in favor of Great Britain , cutting off one hundred thousand acres of land from New Hampshire , and , according to an estimate by Mr. Benton , about forty thousand from Vermont and New York ; or fifty-seven thousand as estimated by Mr. Choate ; reserving Rouse 's Point , however , and a small tract around it , to the United States . As the award was not accepted , the dispute still existed , and the British claim to the triangular strip , and to Rouse 's Point , with the fortification standing upon it , was demonstrable . To bring the boundary down from the mountain ridge into the sterile region between the St. Francis and the head waters of the St. John , with the view , no doubt , of pushing it as far as he could from Quehec , Lord Ashburton consented to cede the triangular strip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bead of the Connecticut . This was proposed on condition that Maine should acquiesce in the boundary throughout , as it has already been described . And here we have the equivalent for the three hundred thousand dollars paid hy the United States to Maine and 1'Tassachusetts , as an indemnity for the half million of acres given up at the foot of the highlands . // This acquisition , on the north of New York and Vermont , is of very great value to the nation . Incidentally those two States are gainers by it ; and the people , inhabiting the land in question , are retained within their country . But the possession of Rouse 's Point is of a vastly higher consideration . In the opinion of all military men , this post is more important than any other on the whole line of the frontier . The history of the wars in America , during the last century , teems with memorable events that occurred on the waters and the horders of Lake Champlain . It is true enough , that Great Britain will never invade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , with Rouse 's Point at her command , her armed vessels would at all times have access to Lake Champlain , and in a few hours an army might be transported into the very heart of the country , and within two days ' march of Albany . Hence , in the event of a war , it would be necessary to keep a large military force constantly in that neighbourhood for defence , at a charge , for a single campaign , much beyond the amount paid by the nation to our own citizens as an equivalent in adjusting the late disputes . The acquisition of this military post , therefore , viewed prospectively , can not fail to strike every thinking mind as most valuable and important . The negotiation did not stop here . The boundary , running through the rivers and lakes beyond the point where it meets the St. Lawrence , had been partly arranged by the commissioners acting under the treaty of Ghent , to the mutual satisfaction of the two governments . Upon a few important points they could not agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels , and a territory of four millions of acres northwest of Lake Superior , were still in dispute . The negotiators undertook a revision of the whole line , with the aim of permanently adjusting it throughout , and of putting it beyond the hazard of further controversy . In regard to this part of the negotiation , Mr. Rives , in his speech before the Senate , justly remarks , that " a question of disputed boundary between adjacent territories , now rapidly filling up with a hardy and enterprising population , is atten ( Ied with constant danger to the peace of the two nations . The acts of ill-advised individuals , of small detachments of troops , or of subordinate local authorities , may at any momeat bring on a conflict , in which the two countries would // be committed to the stern issues of war , against their own deliberate policy and will . " If we consider the long extent of this line , therefore , the proximity of the inhabitants in many places on the two sides of it , and their constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least important part of the treaty . A valuable island , called St. George 's , or Sugar Island , in the water comrnumcation connecting Lake Huron with Lake Superior , said to contain more than twenty-five thousand acres of fertile land , and also Isle Royal , near the northern extremity of Lake Superior , both of which were claimed by the British commissioner , have been confirmed to the United States ; as likewise the disputed tract of four millions of acres beyond the lake , a rocky and barren region , reputed to be of no great value for agriculture , but from which the President , in his message to the Senate , anticipates considerable benefit as a mining district . Again , by the treaty of 1783 , the line was to run through the middle of the rivers and lakes . This naturally left the only navigable channel in several places on one side , and no provision was made for the common use of these waters . Serious inconveniences and altercations might , therefore , happen , if either party should practically insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remove all occasions of discord , and encourage mutual harmony and good feeling among the borderers , these channels are now thrown open to the free navigation of the citizens and subjects of both countries . From the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains the boundary had already been decided . We thus have a complete boundary throughout our eastern and northern borders , well defined , after a long series of careful and accurate surveys , extending more than three thousand miles from the St. Croix to the Rocky Mountains , satisfactory to both parties , and established by the solemn pledges of a treaty . If the negotiators at Washington had accomplished no other achievement than this , it would be enough to secure to them the unqualified praise and lasting gratitude of their countrymen . We shall now touch upon a subject , which demands notice not so much on account of its intrinsic importance at piesent , as because it has been made a prolific theme of discussion since the treaty was ratified . We mean the unattrac // tive controversy about maps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Senate for the actiou of that body , the Secretary of State communicated to iL'Jr . Hives , Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Relations , the copy of a letter from Dr. Franklin to Count de Vergenues , with the copy of a map , the originals of both of which had been seen by Mr. Sparks in one of the public offices in Paris ; and also an extract from a letter which he had written on the subject to the Secretary of State . These papers were considered of sufficient consequence to be produced in the Senate during the debate on the treaty . The following is the extract from lJr . Sparks 's letter , ( dated February 15th , 1842 , ) as published in IIr . Hives 's speech . " While pursuing my researches among the voluminous papers relatipg to the American Revolution in the Archives des Affaires Etrang*res in Paris , I found in one of the hound volumes an original letter from Dr. Franklin to Count de Vergennes , of which the following is an exact transcript . Passy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor of returning herewith the map your Excellency sent me yesterday . I have marked with a strong red line , according to your desire , the limits of the United States , as settled in the preliminaries between the British and American plenipotentiaries . With great respect , I am , &amp;e . B. FRANKLIN . ' " This letter was written six days after the preliminaries were signed ; and , if we could procure the identical map mentioned by Franklin , it would seem to afford conclusive evidence as to the meaning affixed by the commissioners to the language of the treaty on the subject of the boundaries . You may well suppose that I lost no time in making inquiry for the map , not doubting that it would confirm all my previous opinions respecting the validity of our claim . In the geographical department of the Archives are sixty thousand maps and charts ; but so well arranged with catalogues and indexes , that any one of them may be easily found . After a little research in the American division , with the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , by D'Anville , dated 1746 , in size about eighteen inches square , on which was drawn a strong red line throughout the entire boundary of the United States , answering precisely to Franklin 's description . The line is bold and distinct in every part , made with red ink , and apparently drawn with a hairpencil , // or a pen with a blunt point . There is no other coloring on any part of the map . Imagine my surprise on discovering that this line runs wholly south of the St. John , and between the head waters of that river and those of the Penobscot and Kennebec . In short , it is exactly the line now contended for by Great Britain , except that it concedes more than is claimed . The north line , after departing from the source of the St. Croix , instead of proceeding to Mars Hill , stops far short of that point , and turns off to the west , so as to leave on the British side all the streams which flow into the St. John , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is evident , that the line , from the St. Croix to the Canadian high lands , is intended to exclude all the waters running into the St. John . **rPhere is no positive proof that this map is actually the one marked by Franklin ; yet , upon any other supposition , it would be difficult to explain the circumstances of its agreeing so perfectly with his description , and of its being preserved in the place where it would naturally be deposited by Count de Vergennes . I also found another map in the Archives , on which the same boundary was traced in a dotted red line with a pen , apparently copied from the other . " I enclose herewith a map of Maine , on which I have drawn a strong black line , corresponding with the red one above mentioned . " Mr. Rives then remarks , " I am far from intimating that the documents discovered by Mr. Sparks , curious and well worthy of consideration as they undoubtedly are , are of weight sufficient to shake the title of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace . But tl1ey could not fail , in the event of another reference , to give increased confidence and emphasis to the pretensions of Great Britain , and to exert a corresponding influence upon the mind of the arbiter . " While Mr. PAves was still speaking , another map was brought forward by Mr. Benton , the senator from Missouri , with the view , as Mr. Rives understood it , of confronting and invalidating the map alluded to in the above extract , but , as Mr. Benton afterwards said , for the purpose of showing that the red lines were no secret . Be this as it may , the map turned out to be of such a character as to excite some degree of surprise in the Senate . After describing it in general terms , IMr . Rives adds , " 1-lere , then , is a most remarkable and unforeseen confirmation of the map of Mr. Sparks , and by another map of a most // imposing character , and bearing every mark of biith authenticity . It was printed and published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the peace , ) by Lattr6 , graceur du Roi , ( engraver of maps , &amp;c. , to the King . ) It is formally entitled , on its face , a Map of the United States of America , , according to the Treaty of Peace of 1783. ' - ( Carte des Etats Unis de l'Arn&amp;ique , suivant le traits de paix de 1783 . ) It is dedicated and presented ' ( dedi*e et present*e ) to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin , Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America , near the court of France , ' and while Dr. Franklin yet remained in Paris ; for he did not return to the United States till the spring of the year 1785 . Is there not , then , the most plausible ground to argue , that this map , professing to be one constructed according to the Treaty of Peace of 1783 , ' and being dedicated and presented ' to Dr. Franklin , the leading negotiator who concluded that treaty , and who yet remained in Paris while the map was published , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions ; and that , corresponding as it does identically with the map found by Mr. Sparks in the Archives of the Foreign Affairs in Paris , they both partake of the same presumptions in favor of their authenticity ? " Tbe coincidence between these two maps is certainly remarkable ; but we would observe , tltat Mr. Sparks does not intimate that he saw any writing or other marks on the map mentioned by bim , except tbe red boundary line , from which it could be even inferred , that this was the identical map alluded to in Franklin 's letter . There is nothing like positive proof , therefore , in the case , though the presumptive evidence is strong . Mr. Buchanan , Mr. Benton , Mr. Woodbury , and other senators , who spoke against the treaty , made light of this map , as the tenor of their arguments required , calling it an old map , and a French map , adding , that on all the old French maps the southern boundary of Canada is pushed too far down . But we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connexton whatever with any old boundary of Canada ; that it is a line drawn by hand with remarkable distinctness and precision , not upon an engraved line , and not merely along the highlands south of the St. John , but throughout the entire circuit of the United States , in exact conforriiity with the treaty , even running out to sea , and pursuing its direction , at the adjudged distance of twenty leagues , parallel with the coast , from the mouth of the St. Mary to that of the St. Croix . There is another circum // stance , also , which shows the care with which this red line was draxvn . On iD'Anville 's map , the latitude of forty-five degrees runs much too far south , coming down in fact almost to Crown Point . Now the red line , after descending the Connecticut River for some distance , turns off to the west before it reaches the latitude of forty-five degrees on the map , and proceeds in a direct course to the St. Lawrence , so as to pass near the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a proof , that the person who drew the line knew the geography of that part of the country , saw the error of the map , and corrected it . As to Lattr6 's map , described by Mr. Rives , there is no certainty of its having been seen by Dr. Franklin before its publication . It is probable , and that is all . As far as this probability goes , it may strengthen the presumption , that the map in the Archives is the one sent by Franklin to Count de Vergennes . In each case , we have no more than presumptive testimony . The fact , that such maps exist , however , of so early a date , is a consideration of some moment . There are other maps of a similar character , which could not have originated in the same source . A revised edition of IDe Lisle 's Map of Canada , published in Paris in the year 1783 , purports to exhibit the northern boundary of the United States . The title of this map boasts of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials ( un grand nombre de relations imprinic*es on manuscrites ) . The boundary line , from the source of the St. Croix to the Canadian highlands , is drawn south of the St. John , and in such a manner as to exclude all the waters of that river from the territory of the United States . It is a dotted line , engraved , and distinctly marked by a red border on the British side , and a green one on the Anierican , running in contact with each other . After arriving at the highlands near the head waters of the St. John , this line takes a devious course , winding its way into Canada as far as the River St. Fran*ois , and thence in a southeasterly direction to Lake Champlain , which it crosses a full degree too far south . In all this part it is extremely inaccurate , and could not have depended on any information derived from Franklin , although he was then in Paris . By what authority the line was made to run south of the St. John can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mitchell 's map , which formerly belonged to Baron Steuben , but which , we believe , is now in the possession of the government . On this map , the boundary of the United States is delineated , throughout , by a broad and bold red mark , drawn by hand , and it runs south of the St. John ; made with less precision , indeed , than the line on the map in the Paris archives , but it is substantially the same . A gentleman now living saw this map fifty years ago in the library of Baron Steuben , with the red line then existing as it now appears . It could not have been copied from either of the French maps mentioned above , for , in such case , the part of the line in question would have been executed with more exactness . We have before us a curious German map of the United States , by Giissefeld , ( " Charte tiber die XIII . Vereinigte Staaten von Nord-America , " ) published at Nuremberg , in 784 , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlands south of the St. John . The author says , in a French note engraved on the margin , that he had constructed it from the best English maps ( d'apr*s les meilleures et speciales cartes . /inglaises ) . This was the year after the ratification of the treaty , and it is the more remarkable , as we believe no English map has been found , of an earlier date than 1785 , in which the boundary does not run on the northern highlands , as claimed by the United States . The line in question could hardly have been copied from Lattr*3 's map , because , although it is in all essential points the same , it is by no means identical with it . Faden 's map , of 1785 , is the earliest English authority of this kind , as far as our knowledge extends , which has been produced in vindication of the British claim . On this map , the boundary runs south of the St. John . A copy of it , brought over by Lord Ashburton , was exhibited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been captivated with its charms , nor convinced by its red or black lines . They call it a " small one and of small pretensions , " and allow themselves to utter a bard insinuation against the motives of its author , the King 's Geographer . But this is not much to the purpose , since the line is there notwithstanding , and is acknowledged to have been put there when the map was made . Mr. Featherstonhaugh , in his recent pamphlet on the // Treaty of Washington , lets us into the secret of another " ancient map discovered in one of the public offices in London , after the departure of Lord Ashburton , which had been apparently hid away for nearly sixty years , with a red line drawn upon it exactly conforming to the British claim. ** He says , " No doubt was entertained , that this was one of the maps used hy the negotiators of 1783 , and that the red line marked upon it designated the direction of the boundary they had established . But this map was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are left to infer , that this was the reason why it was not sent over to Lord Ashburton , to aid him in the negotiation . Such is the testimony of maps on one side . We now turn to the other . In the first place , there were at least four distinct maps of the United States , expressly designed to show the boundaries , published in London during the interval between the signing of the preliminaries and the ratification of the treaty by Great Britain . These were Sayer and Bennet 's , Bew 's , Willis 's , and Cary 's . All these maps exhibit the boundaries exactly as claimed by the United States . The first two were issued a few days before the debate in Parliament on the preliminary articles , and it can not he doubted that they were known to the members , and understood by them as presenting an accurate delineation of the boundaries . Not a word to the contrary appears in any one of the speeches , although the large extent of the boundaries was made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But a map worthy of more consideration , perhaps , than either of these , is that published in London in the year 1783 , by the same William Faden , who , two years afterwards , perpetrated the act of sending into the world the " small map " to which the Commissioners of Maine took such exceptions . His first map , of which we are now speaking , is stated on the face of it to be drawn " according to the treaty " ; the engraved and colored lines are designed for this special object . It was probably published before the signature of the definitive treaty , or at least soon afterwards , for that event took place in September of the same year . It is about two feet square , and the boundaries marked on it correspond with the greatest exactness to the American construction of the treaty . As a proof that the attention of the delineator was drawn particularly to the northeastern boundary , we have // only to cite the following printed note , attached , among others , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sagadahock is a new concession . " The tract intended by this new concession " is colored green , and stretches across the basin of the St. John to the ridge of the Canadian highlands . There are many other notes on the margin , explaining the boundary in different places , all tending to show that the work was executed with extreme care . And perhaps no man in England was more competent to such a task . He was eminent in his profession , and had engraved nearly all the maps and plans , published by authority , illustrative of the movements of the British army during the war of the Revolution . He could not , therefore , be ignorant of American geography . He even takes the trouble to exhibit an estimate , in figures , of the extent of territory conceded in various parts to the United States by the treaty , beyond what belonged to the Colonies under the old charters . Putting all these circumstances together , we are bound to regard this map as conclusive evidence of the state of opinion on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the most capable of forming a correct judgment . Besides the maps here enumerated , 1'Ir . Callatin speaks of seven others , made within two years after the signature of the preliminary articles , all of which agree with these five and , as we have before observed , no map published in England within the same period has been produced , which gives countenance to any other line of boundary . We deem these facts the more weighty , as Mr. Oswald , the British Commissioner for negotiating the treaty , was in London when the earliest maps were made ; and there is the strongest probability that he was consulted by the map-makers on a subject of this nature ; quite as strong as that Dr. Franklin was consulted for the same purpose in Paris ; or , at all events , that Mr. Oswald would take care , by some public manifestation , to correct errors of so grave an aspect derived from a false construction of the treaty . Nor would these errors , if they were such , have been overlooked by the ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concession of boundaries . We hear of no such correction from any quarter , nor of any assertion or insinuation , that the maps were erroneous . When we descend to later dates , we still find English // maps , of the highest authority , containing the same boundary , notwithstanding the example of Faden 's second effort . And these are even copied by some of the best French maps , in defiance of Lattr* and the amended edition of De Lisle . In the , fltlas Universel , by Robert , published at Paris in 1757 , there is a map of Canada , on which the northern and eastern boundary of New England is laid down as since claimed by the United States under the treaty of 1783 . Some time after the negotiation of that treaty , a new edition of the Atlas was published , with additions and alterations ; but the boundary line in question remains the same , although the editor , under the head of Lirnites des Etats Unis , quotes the second article of the Treaty , which relates to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first edition of the map necessary , in order to meet the terms of that instrument . On our table lie three maps of the United States by *rardieu , published at different times in Paris , one of them on a large scale , on each of which the boundary is drawn as claimed by the United States , with a slight deviation in one part . The north and south line , after crossing the St. John , and reaching the source of the Ristagouche , turns a little to the west , and seeks its way to the Canadian highlands , so as to avoid the head waters of that river . This is in exact accordance with Mr. Hale 's line , and with Mr. Buller 's northwest angle . We have also before us an elegantly executed German map of the United States , by Reichard , belonging to the Ebeling Collection in Harvard College , published at Nuremberg in 1809 , which gives the boundary exactly as claimed by the Americans . And , indeed , innumerable testimonies might be accumulated to show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well on the continent as in England . We shall here dismiss this subject of the conflict of maps . It has run to a greater length than we intended . We confess it is extraordinary , nor shall we venture upon the hopeless task of explaining or reconciling its difficulties , or of bringing light out of darkness . As far as it goes , however , the weight of the argument from this source preponderates heavily on the American side ; immeasurably so , if we estimate it by the number of maps ; but less so , it may be conceded , if the relative authority of the principal ones only be regarded . We must hold to the conviction , nevertheless , // that Mr. Oswald , or the British ministers , or both , were consulted in the execution of the first English maps . The presumption is so strong , that nothing short of absolute demonstration to the contrary can weaken this belief . We allow it is probable , and nothing more , that Franklin was consulted for a similar object in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supposition of the red line on D'Anville 's map having been drawn by Franklin , that he was mistaken . This is an easy way of solving the problem , if the fact could be proved . If this red line rested on Franklin 's authority alone , such an idea might possibly be more than a shadow . As we have only probahilities in the case , it is , in our opinion , much more probable that he did not draw the line , than that he should not understand the treaty , six days after it was signed , which he had been as many months in negotiating . But what shall we do with the four maps , emanating from different sources , of which it is not pretended that Franklin had any knowledge ? These are all separate authorities , and they accord with the supposed Franklinian red line . Besides , why should we conjecture Franklin to have been mistaken , any more than Mr. Oswald , or the British ministers , or the English map-makers ? Since we must admit an error on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we know nothing more about it , let us do justice to both parties , and at least allow them the grace of dividing the mistake between themselves , until we can place it on the right shoulders by some clear and indisputable evidence . It is a matter of serious regret , that the opinions of Mr. John Adams and Mr. Jay , in regard to this boundary dispute , were never publicly expressed . The former lived twelve years , and the latter fifteen , after the Treaty of Ghent , and yet nothing has been communicated to the world , from which their sentiments can be known or even inferred . This silence is the more remarkable , as they had given their testimony in the case of the St. Croix ; and , if similar testimony had been proffered in relation to the northeastern boundary , it could hardly have failed to produce a speedy settlement of the question . Until the opinions of these commissioners can be ascertained , from undoubted authority , it is neither just nor reasonable to throw the burden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conflicting maps , we shall remark only , that it affords another proof of the wisdom of the course adopted by the negotiators , in setting aside the // old controversy , and seeking a new arrangement upon the untried and pacific principles of a compromise . We have a word to say on the topic , to which public attention has been called since the ratification of the treaty . Some of the English and Canadian journals , in language which it would not adorn our pages to repeat , and which we are by no means in a humor to retort , have censured the A merican negotiator for withholding from Lord Ashburton a knowledge of Franklin 's letter and the map seen by Mr. Sparks in the Paris Archives . What foundation can there he , on the grounds of equity , reason , or courtesy , for this censure ? It was neither agreed nor understood by the negotiators , that each should show to the other all the materials in his possession . What could have been more unwise or indiscreet than such a proceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serbonian bog of the old controversy , from which they might never extricate themselves , and which they were taking all possible pains to shun . With this " gulf profound " before his eyes , Lord Ashburton very prudently kept back the " volume of additional matter " which he had brought with him , although he did venture to produce a map in favor of his own side . Even this experiment was somewhat perilous , for it roused the belligerent spirit , instead of cooling the ardent zeal , of the Maine Commissioners . Besides , this Paris map was unauthenticated ; and , for this reason , if for no other , it could nom have been formally introduced into the negotiation . The same reason operated against transmitting to Lord Ashburton the map discovered in the British offices after his departure . If this map could not be considered as valid testimony , why should another of precisely the same character ? It is possible , nay , highly probable , that there are papers and maps in the British offices favorable to the American claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to produce such materials , even if they were among the contents of his portfolio . Again , suppose the disclosure to have been made , and Lord Ashburton to have attached the importance to the Paris map and letter , which some persons have since imagined them to deserve . Could he have negotiated at all ? i'Just he not have said , that these were new facts , unknown to the ministers at the time his instructions were given , and that his duty required him not to proceed without communicating them for consideration ? And if the ministry had viewed // them as of sufficient weight to add an essential advantage to the British claim , would they or could they have authorized a treaty on the basis of their first instructions ? We ask these questions on the supposition , that the knowledge should have been deemed important . If it were not so deemed , it was of no moment whether it was communicated or not . All the world knows , that a treaty more favorable to England could not , in any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now stands , the Commissioners of Maine , with all the facts before them , were brought to acquiesce with a reluctance amounting almost to a refusal . Their last note to lJr . Webster , in which their final decision was to be embodied , is an argument against the treaty ; and the reader is taken by an agreeable surprise to find their assent in a short paragraph at the end , apparently at variance with their own convictions . It would seem , as if they had determined at first to reject the treaty , although they were informed that it was the best they could hope to procure , and had drawn up their paper accordingly ; but , changing their minds afterwards , and unwilling to lose so good an argument , they concluded to yield their assent , coupled as it was with their reasons to the contrary . However this may be , it is perfectly certain that any arrangement less favorable to ll'Laine would not have been listened to for a moment by the Commissioners or the people of that State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should have aided and strengthened the British claim , and raised higher the demands of the British government , besides the absurdity of such a step , the treaty must inevitably have failed . And what would have been said of such a result , brought about in such a manner ? Would not the whole world have cried out against it , as the most consummate folly that a wise or weak man , in his senses or out of them , could be guilty of ? It was not a private bargain which the American negotiator had to transact . A responsibility of a much more solemn nature rested upon him . He had the opinions , the will , and sensitive feelings of a great people to consult , their rights to maintain , and their interests to protect . Was it ever known , that two negotiators came together , and commenced their work by disclosing , each to the other , a new collection of facts or materials which should weaken his own cause ? If it can be conceived , that ambitious motives might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of success in their undertaking , would // they stand justified in the , eyes of the government and people of the respective countries , whose claims they were deputed to assert and support ? We repeat , it was not a bargain between individuals , in which each party could do as he pleased , and take into view personal considerations only ; it was a national trust of the highest character , which was to he fulfilled with strict fidelity to the interests of those who had placed it in the negotiators ' charge . In this sense , and in every sense , Mr. Wehster 's course was dictated hy scrupulous propriety , hy usage in similar cases , and by the soundest wisdom and discretion . He laid before the Maine Commissioners all the facts , from which they might understand the true position in which the controversy would be placed , if it were renewed and continued . This disclosure was due to them , as representatives of that portion of the country most deeply concerned in the negotiation . It was due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amicable compromise . Nor can there be any doubt , that the Commissioners of Maine were influenced to a considerable extent by the Paris letter and map ; for , whatever might he their real value , since they were open to the discovery of the British government , they might have been used with effect in another arbitration . Mr. Calhoun expressed his conviction , in the Senate , that in such an event they were " calculated to add no small weight to the British claim " ; and , if the treaty should fall to the ground , a second reference would be the only resort . To have shown these papers to Lord Ashburton could not possibly have done any good , and it might have done infinite mischief ; to show them to the Commissioners of Maine was giving them information which they had a right to possess , and by which they were enabled to act with intelligence for the honor and best interests of their immediate constituents and of their country . The advantage , whatever it might be , of this mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain as on that of the United States . Lord Ashburton himself , and the British ministry , if they attach any importance to this information , must be thankful that it was withheld from them , and that the hazard of again stirring up and embroiling all the old difficulties , with a worse prospect than ever for the future , was thus happily avoided . A treaty , meeting the approbation of a large majority of both nations , has been negotiated and confirmed ; tranquillity has been restored to // the public mind ; and a breach , which at one time threatened alarming consequences , has been healed and closed for ever . This has been done , in part at least , and perhaps in the turning point , by the admirable judgment of the American negotiator in the use of his materials , without injury to either party , and with incalculable benefits to both . Again , some of the British journalists , in a spirit of querulous discontent , take exceptions to a part of one of l'lr . Webster 's letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he expresses a confidence in the validity of the American claim , not consistent with his knowledge of the Paris map . If any one imagines there is the least weight in this charge , we would only recommend to him a perusal of the correspondence . In the able argument , to which we have before alluded , Mr. Webster confines himself to the single point of interpreting the language of the treaty of 1783 , and expressly abstains from " all historical facts , contemporaneous expositions , and external circumstances . " It is his sole aim to show , by a condensed and logical train of reasoning , founded on the words of the treaty itself , that the most obvious sense of these words clearly supports the American claim . Surely such an argument may be allowed to stand on its own merits , without subjecting its author to censure for not mingling with it the hopeless controversy about maps , or encumbering it with extraneous facts and conjectures , with neither of which was it in any manner connected . * We come now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more applauded for its object , than for the welldefined and strict rules of reciprocity upon which it is constructed . By the Treaty of Ghent it was declared , that the traffic in slaves is " irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice , " and the contracting parties agreed to use their best endeavours to accomplish its abolition . In conformity to this declaration and agreement , a law was passed by Congress denouncing this infamous traffic as piracy , and threatening the penalties of that crime to any citizen of the United States , who should be detected in prosecuting it . The example has been followed by Great * We have been favored with the perusal of a manuscript paper , written by Mr. Grattan , the British Consul in Boston , in which the argument on the British side of the boundary question is stated with more method , clearness , and o rce , than we have anywhere seen in print . // Britain and other countries . Treaties have likewise been entered into between Great Britain and some of the principal maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codperation in the suppression of the slave trade . By these treaties , the right is conceded to each party of boarding and searching merchant vessels sailing under the flag of the others in the African seas , with the view of ascertaining whether they are concerned in the slave trade , made illegal by the special laws of the respective parties . This is solely a right of compact , and not pretended to be derived from the laws of nations . For reasons , which we have no room here to explain , but which have been abundantly elucidated by our statesmen , the government of the United States declined joining in an arrangement which should subject merchant vessels , bearing the flag of the Union , to be searched and detained in their voyage on the high seas by the armed cruisers of other powers . These reasons were ably enforced more than twenty years ago by Mr. Adams , in his correspondence with Mr. Stratford Canning . As the laws of the United States , however , prohibited the slave trade under the severest penalties , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed on the coast of Africa for this object , as far as it could be done without weakening the naval armaments necessary for protecting our commerce in other parts of the world . In fact , such has been the employment of a portion of the navy for many year 's . An arrangement with any power , therefore , by which the object should be more speedily and effectually attained , under such regulations as would secure the independence of our flag , could not but be deemed exceedingly important . A stipulation to this effect , between Great Britain and the United States , on the principle of mutual co6perntion , constitutes the eighth article of the Treaty of Washington , in the following words . " The parties mutually stipulate , that each shall prepare , equip , and maintain in service , on the coast of Africa , a sufficient and adequate squadron , or naval force of vessels , of suitable numbers and descriptions , to carry in all not less than eighty guns , to enforce , separately and respectively , the laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the suppression of the slave trade ; the said squadrons to be independent of each other , but the two governments stipulating , nevertheless , to give // such orders to the officers commanding their respective forces , as shall enable them most effectually to act in concert and cooperation , upon mutual consultation , as exigencies may arise , for the attainment of the true object of this article ; copies of all such orders to be communicated by each government to the other respectively . " These words are so precise and explicit , that it is scarcely possible for two persons to form different ideas of their exact and literal meaning ; yet the President of the United States is supposed to have drawn an inference from them , which Sir Robert Peel , as the organ of the British government , has thought proper to disavow . The merits of the question , in all its bearings , we shall not attempt to discuss . A brief outline of its principal features will be enough for the general purpose of explanation . The British government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and executing their own laws against the slave trade , assumed the novel right , and adopted the practice , of boarding and searching vessels sailing under the American flag , which were suspected , by the commanders of British cruisers , of being concerned in this traffic . The consequence was , that several American vessels , engaged in lawful commerce , were interrupted and detained on their voyage , and some of them seized and turned over to the British tribunals for adjudication . A proceeding so unjustiliable naturally brought out complaints and remonstrances . These were laid before the British government by 1'Ir . Stevenson , the American minister in London . In the correspondence on this subject , Lord Palmerston , the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , advanced doctrines which at first sight presented a startling aspect . He seemed to claim the right for the officers of British armed cruisers , under the instructions of their government , to board and search American vessels on the high seas in time of peace , and to decide whether they were or were not engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications , he modified his expressions in such a way as to imply that the right he meant was that of visitation , or of inquiry , and not of search . Mr. Stevenson , however , could not perceive that his Lordship 's distinctions amounted to a difference . The substance and reality of the thing itself is not altered by giving it various names . He insists that " they are essentially // the same , " and that the distinction is wholly fictitious. ** Mr. Wheaton maintains the same ground in his learned treatise on the right of search , in which he investigates thoroughly and with much discrimination the laws and usages of nations upon these points . Mr. Duponceau defines the difference to be that between " fair lady " and " lady fair , " and practically this is not a forced definition . The solid part of the objection is not against the mere act of visiting and searching , but against its purpose and consequences . It may be granted , that going upon a vessel 's deck and reading her papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inspecting the cargo , are not acts in themselves of precisely the same nature ; but , if the object , intention , and consequences are the same in each case , we beg to know by what art of logic , or application of names , a real difference can be shown to exist . The visit is intended for something or nothing . If for nothing , it is an obtrusive and useless formality . If otherwise , it can not be of the least importance , in principle or effect , whether the visiter searches the ship and inspects the cargo , or only examines the papers . It is left entirely to his judgment , after either of these acts , to decide upon the character of the vessel ; and cases may occur where the papers are suspicious , in the opinion of the visiting officer , and an inspection of the vessel would prove that all was rig*zIt . If the visit is necessary at all , a search is much more so , as affording the means of a proper judgment . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a more safe course , and one more likely to prevent mistakes and the consequent mischiefs , to allow the officer the right of search , than to require him to make up his mind upon the bare inspection of papers , and from general appearances . If he is to be the sole judge in so responsible and delicate an affair , as that of seizing and detaining a vessel sailing on the broad ocean under the flag of an independent power , it is certainly desirable that every possible source of knowledge should be open to him . Whatever distinction may be discovered , therefore , by a refined diplomacy , between the meaning of the words visit and search , it is perfectly obvious that , in their practical application , they are the same thing ; or , if there is any difference , it is in favor of search , because it enables the officer to decide with more intelligence and better opportunities of ascertaining the truth . At any rate , // it is an unwarrantable stretch of sophistry to attempt to hide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive names . Lord Aberdeen inherited the controversy from his predecessor in office and he endeavoured to smooth over the harsh features of the claim of right which had been set up but still he adheres to the claim , and undertakes to justify it upon broad principles . He says , it has been the invariable practice of the British navy " to ascertain by visit the real nationality of merchant vessels met with on the high seas , if there be good reason to apprehend their illegal character . " If such has been the practice , it would appear to he a direct violation of the laws of nations , as expounded by one of the highest authorities in the British courts . Lord Stowell asserts , " that no authority can be found , which gives any right of visitation or interruption over the vessels and navigation of other states , on the high seas , except what the right of war gives to belligerents against neutrals . " And such has been the practical interpretation by the British government in cases where their own interests were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed in Hayti , by which vessels sailing under any flag , whether that of IThyti or of any other country , if found to be trading in slaves , were to be seized and taken into a port of the Republic for adjudication . The British government remonstrated against this law , on the ground , in the words of the official communication , " that , in time of peace , no ships belonging to one state have a right to search and detain ships sailing under the flag of , and belonging to , another state , without the permission of such state , which permission is generally signified by treaty . " Now this is the identical ground upon which the United States resist the British pretension . ATe have only to put Great Britain in the place of Hayti , and the cases become exactly the same . But what is the illegal character on the high seas , mentioned by Lord Aberdeen , as recognized by all nations ? Piracy only ; piracy by the laws of nations , and not by the municipal laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave trade to be piracy , this declaration gives no right to stop and search the vessels of other nations upon the mere suspicion that they are violating this law . The slave trade is not piracy by the law of nations , nor can it be so till the maritime powers // shall generally , and by mutual agreement , recognize it as such . Any government may unquestionably instruct its cruisers to detain and examine vessels within its own waters suspected of smuggling . But this is a local right , and not applicable to the high seas . iNor is it the right of search in the case either of piracy or smuggling , which is resisted or questioned by the United States . The British government claims the right of searching vessels sailing under the flag of other nations , not upon the suspicion of piracy or smuggling , but as being engaged in a traffic unauthorized by the municipal laws of Great Britain ; and not within her jurisdiction only , but on the high seas ; and the argument used for this extraordinary practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own laws , and not the laws of nations . Such a pretension may well excite alarm ; for where will it end ? If the plea of necessity will sanction this proceeding for the execution of one set of laws , why not of another , till the ocean becomes the domain of the strongest naval power , over which jurisdiction may be exercised in the same manner as within the acknowledged waters of that power ? Nor is this a theoretical discussion about the abstract principles of law ; it is a downright practical matter of fact . True enough , the mere act of visit is nothing in substance . It is an insult , and that is all . So a stranger may open your door and look into your house . No harm is done . It is a piece of rudeness , and nothing more . If he enters , and disturbs your family , and breaks your furniture , you may then prosecute him for a trespass , and claim damages , and call in the laws to your aid . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endure the vexations of a lawsuit . Is it not better that the conventional rules of society should be observed , and that strangers should not thrust themselves into your house without your consent ? But Lord Aberdeen tells us , " It is not as . flmerican that such vessels are ever visited . " And , again , in the letter to Mr. Fox , he repeats , that Great Britain does not pretend to interfere with vessels of the United States , " known or believed to be such . " Let the case stand thus , and what then ? The vessels are visited , nevertheless , while under the American flag , not as pirates or smugglers , but on suspicion of violating a British law , while traversing the broad ocean , where British laws can no more interfere with them than in // the harbour from which they sailed . Neither the breach of international law , nor the injury , is lessened in the least degree by supposing or believing them to have any other character than that indicated by the flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is visited , detained , and seized , what possible difference can it make to the owner , whether it is seized on suspicion of being one thing or another ? Just as well might the commander of an armed cruiser of any nation visit , detain , and seize every English merchantman he should find on the ocean , and then say that the vessel was not visited as English , but on suspicion of violating some law of the country to which the cruiser belongs . What consolation can it be to an American trader , engaged in fair commerce , after he has been seized , taken into a British port in Africa , his cargo perishing , his crew falling victims to the climate , his voyage broken up , to be told that he was not seized as an . ilmerican , but on suspicion of being concerned in a traffic not authorized by the laws of England ? The British minister adds another consolation . He shall have an indemnity . Where will he find it , and when will it come to him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and uncertainty of procuring such a relief ? Recent examples would afford but poor encouragement to his hopes on this score . Besides , if he were successful , would this soften the outrage , or atone for the abuse , or restore the dignity of a violated flag ? No nation , in time of peace , can submit to such an exercise of power by another , whether under the name of a pretended right , or any other name , without sacrificing its independence , and bowing to the will of a superior . Most assuredly . it can never be submitted to by the United States ; nor acquiesced in , unless by a mutual compact , implying a virtual renunciation , or at least a silent abandonment of the claim as a matter of right . Lord Aberdeen 's letter to liNir . Everett is regarded by the British government as the most plausible defence of this pretension , which has been put forth , if we may judge from Sir Robert Peel 's speech in Parliament on the " Address . " It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminish their weight . He only polishes a little the ston* , which his predecessor had left rough-hewn . And we may further remark , that it was either not very courteous , // or a strange oversight , or defect of memory , in Sir Robert Peel , to declare and repeat , as he did in Parliament , that this letter had " remained fourteen months unacknowledged and unanswered , " with a show of triumph in assuming that it was too much to be grappled with by the American minister in London , and the American Secretary of State . This same boast is likewise made to figure in the official letter to Mr. Fox . From the published correspondence , it appears , that the reception of the letter was acknowledged by Mr. Everett three days after it was written , and that he then gave notice of his intention soon to prepare a more formal answer , from which he was dissuaded by Lord Aberdeen himself , who said Lord Ashburton was furnished with full powers to treat on this question in Washington , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . The President , in his message to Congress at the beginning of the last session , after alluding to the eighth article of the Treaty , and to his sentiments expressed in a former message against the right of search , proceeds to say ; " From this it will be seen , that the ground assumed in the message has been fully maintained , at the same time that the stipulations of the rrreaty of Ghent are to be carried out in good faith by the two countries , and that all pretence is removed for interference with our commerce for any purpose whatever hy a foreign government . " From this passage it has been inferred in England , that the President supposed the pretension to the right of search had been given up by the British government . We doubt if this be a fair inference . It does unquestionably imply a conviction , that the so called right would not be exercised on American commerce while the Treaty existed and its stipulations were fulfilled ; and we presume this was the sense in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy to assign any motives , on the part of the United States , for entering into such a treaty , if the special duties and service of the American squadron on the coast of Africa were to be interfered with hy the British cruisers , any farther than such interference should be mutual , as authorized by the instructions of the two governments , according to the terms of the Treaty . Nothing is said about the abandonment of this darling right by the British government ; and while it stands a barren tree , producing no fruit , with however much aversion it // may be regarded in America , it will hardly be looked upon with an eye of jealousy or apprehension . We can not help thinking , therefore , that Sir Robert Peel 's harangue in Parliarnent on this subject was gratuitous , anJ that the formal letter from Lord Aberdeen to Mr. Fox , r cad with so much apparent solemnity to the Secretary of State , was ill-suited to the occasion . They have naturally excited the suspicion , that the practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such should be the result , we feel convinced it will breed troubles and mischief , and defeat the valuable ends which have been anticipated from this arrangement , founded , as believed in the United States , on the principles of a scrupulous reciprocity and the pledges of a mutual good faith . The plain construction of the Treaty is , that each nation , for the time stipulated , is to execute its own laws against the slave trade on the coast of Africa that is , as provided in the eleventh article of the Treaty , for five years from the date of exchanging the ratifications , and afterwards , until one or the other of the parties shall signify a wish for the agreement to cease . That this was the understanding of the American government , at the time of the negotiation , is declared by the I*resident in his message to Congress communicating the correspondence concerning the Treaty . " I regarded the eighth article , " he says , " as removing all possible pretext , on the ground of mere necessity , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any alleged abuse of our flag by slave traders of other nations . " And , again , " Denying , as we did , all color of right to exercise any such general police over the flag of independent nations , we did not demand of Great Britain any formal renunciation of her pretension still less had we the idea of yielding any thing ourselves in that respect . We chose to make a practical settlement of the question . " Such is the obvious purport of the rrreaty itself , " a practical settlement of the question , " while the Treaty continues at least , by a compact between the two nations to join with each other in executing the laws of each respectively for a common object . No pretension to a theoretical right , on either side , is meddled with ; and , we repeat , it is unfortunate , that the British government should at the present time force in this pretension anew , and in a tone and manner by no means calculated to promote the spirit of conciliation // and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty . It can scarcely be doubted , however , that some arrangement between the two governments , by which the cruisers of each nation , under proper limitations and restrictions , should be authorized , while the two squadrons are acting together , to ascertain the genuineness of the flag of the other borne by a suspected vessel on the coast of Africa , would facilitate the means adopted for the suppression of the slave trade , which both countries have so much at heart . Any reasonable temporary sacrifice for so desirable an end , consistent with national honor , dignity , and independence , should not be refused . But the recent pretexts and practices of Great Britain , connected with historical incidents of the gravest character , must render any such arrangement extremely difficult , perhaps impracticable . It could only be accomplished by a compact , framed on the basis of entire reciprocity , for a limited and definite time , and with every possible guard against abuse . We say a limited time , for if it were to last " for ever , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he calls the holy alliance* ' formed by the famous Quintuple Treaty , it may be safely aflirmed , that neither the government nor a single individual of the United States would tolerate such an idea for a moment . We hope , indeed , that the slave trade is not to continue for ever . If Great Britain finds the Americans indocile or intractable in this matter of maritime regulations , she must look for the cause to her past history and conduct . It is not alone the jealousy of the growing magnitude of her naval power , so often suggested by British writers , which has produced the sensitiveness that unquestionably exists in the breast of every citizen of the United States , in relation to this subject . Let her look back to her enormous encroachments upon our neutral commerce during her last European wars , her haughty bearing on the ocean , her blunted sense of justice , and her repeated violation of international laws , and she will see many sober realities , which have not been forgotten , and can not be forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon her foes , this may afford a feeble justification to herself , but it can not obliterate the impressions that were deeply stamped by deliberate and aggravated injuries . To // treat friends as enemies is not the way to secure their confidence , or subdue their spirit . We have no desire to revive these recollections ; we recur to them only as an index to the principal reasons for the cautious reserve of the government and people of the United States in lending an ear to any propositions touching the maritime power of Great Britain . To these causes add the preposterous claim to the allegiance of our adopted citizens , many of whom she has encouraged to leave their native land and seek a better heritage in a foreign country ; add , again , the consequent practice of impressment , that barbarous relic of a barharous age , scarcely less odious and detestable than the slave trade itself ; and we shall have reasons enough , without travelling further , for the jealousy of the naval power of England on this side of the Atlantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this practice , communicated to Lord Ashburton , embodies opinions universally entertained in America . For the peace and future good understanding between the two countries , these opinions ought not to be overlooked or slightly regarded by the British government and nation . Impressment of seamen , under the flag of the United States , has lighted the torch and kindled up the flames of one war ; it will be the immediate cause of another , whenever it shall be repeated . A powder-magazine would not explode more instantaneously at the touch of a living coal , than would the whole people of the United States fly to arms to avenge such an aggression . We hazard nothing in affirming , that this sentiment is universal ; it pervades every mind and every heart ; and it is too deeply seated to be loosened by theories and precedents drawn from usages in the times of feudal vassalage and regal oppressions . It is a practical , enduring , and inflexible conviction , which time may strengthen , but never change . A writer of certain papers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ashburton Capitulation , " reputed to have been a high functionary in the late administration , informs his countrymen in one of those papers , that " The Americans , when it suits their purpose , can invent the strangest doctrines of international law . " If the claim to protect their seamen under their country 's flag be one of these strange doctrines , it does undoubtedly suit their purpose , and , without taking any merit to themselves for the // invention , it is the last they xviii ever cease to support and defend . We forbear making any further remarks on these fruitful topics of the right of search and impressment , both because our space is limited , and because we propose to recur to them on some future occasion . The tenth article of the Treaty provides for the delivering up of criminals who escape from justice , upon the requisition of the authorities of the country from which they have fled . The crimes enumerated are murder , assault with the intent to commit murder , piracy , arson , robbery , forgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so favorable to the cause of justice can not but be essentially beneficial to both countries . It does not include political offenders or fugitive slaves . An article in Jay 's Treaty contained a similar provision in respect to two crimes only , those of murder and forgery , to continue in force for twelve years . The provision in the present Treaty is to cease whenever either of the parties shall signify a wish to that effect , and not before . In reviewing the advantages of the Treaty of Washington , immediate and prospective , it is scarcely possible to estimate them too highly , or to bestow extravagant praise on the skill and good management of the negotiators , by whom so fortunate a result has been effected . It is , in fact , a treaty of peace , as well as of compromise . Larger interests have been at stake between nations , more extended objects have been compassed by negotiation , but rarely has a harder knot of difficulties been encountered , or points more perplexing been submitted for adjustment . Under a constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State claims the right of sovereignty over its own soil , no question can be more embarrassing than that involved in a dispute about the boundaries between the individual States and the territory of a foreign power . The disturbing forces of two or more parties are here to be brought to a central action , and into concert with the general government , before that government , the organ of the Union , and the only one recognized by foreign states , can be put in a condition to negotiate . In the present instance , not only Maine and Massachusetts , but New Hampshire , Vermont , and New York , had a negative voice , and each might have interposed , // if its claims had not been satisfied either by concession or an equivalent . The task of Mr. Webster , therefore , was vastly more formidable than that of his associate , and , view it as we may , it was not one of easy accomplishment under any circumstances . The questions at issue had been a prolific source of irritation for years ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war ; and the settlement of them , not for the present only , but on a basis which prevents their ever being renewed , must surely be regarded by all considerate men as a great and lasting benefit to the nation . We have only to inquire , whether the gain is adeqoate to the loss . Has the national houor been preserved ? Has any thing been extorted from us ? Have improper sacrifices been made ? . As to the first , we think the most fastidious patriot can have no reason to complain ; and , on a point ike this , we would have every American fastidious . The advance was made by Great Britain , in the spirit of amity , not in a tone of demand ; she complimented us by sending a special minister to negotiate in our own capital ; and in the history of the negotiation we find nothing at variance with the spirit thus professed and shown . Our concessions were voluntary ; yielded not because they were claimed , but because we believed our interests to be promoted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe . In regard to the equivalents , they who are the most deeply concerned may be presumed to be the best qualified to form a correct judgment . The Commissioners of Maine accepted the Treaty , and their constituents have acquiesced with great unanimity . The option was allowed them of taking the award of the King of the Netherlands , submitting to a new arbitration , or abiding by the Treaty . In their Report to the Legislature of INJaine , they have given good reasons for preferring the last . The other States , whose border rights were blended in the controversy , are satisfied . What more can be asked or desired ? Without satisfying all these States , a compromise was out of the question , and no one can imagine that they would assent to an arrangemnent , which would require or imply a sacrifice of their rights , or unreasonable concessions . We think it due to Mr. Webster , that all , who would understand and properly estimate the difficulties of the // negotiation , should turn their attention particularly to the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous assent of Maine and Massachusetts . This was both a difficult and delicate point . The universal opinion in these States that their claim was just to its fullest extent , the deliberate and repeated acts of the legislatures , amounting almost to a declaration and pledge that this claim would be sustained at all hazards , and the popular feeling in accordance with these acts , presented obstacles not to be overcome without circumspection , address , and judgment . By the exercise of these qualities , with a prudent caution and penetrating foresight , the obstacles were removed , and the end was attained . It was an untried experiment , which would have failed in less skilful and less practised hands . A single false step , a single broken link in the chain of progress , a want of deference to the will or even the prejudices of a sovereign State , an ill-timed reserve , a tone of assurance , or an injudicious use of materials , might at any moment have broken off the negotiation and ruined the Treaty . The wisdom of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its success ; it has in the amplest manner fulfilled the high expectation , which his commanding talents , his character , and his long experience in public life , had taught tbe country to entertain . The free navigation of the St. John is a new privilege , ceded in perpetuity to the United States . It operates for the immediate benefit of Maine ; but it has heretofore been deemed of so much importance to the commercial interests of the Union , that the grant of it has more than once been solicited from Great Britain . The lumber and agricultural products , bordering on all the waters of the St. John , are allowed to be transported down that river , without any other duties , or restrictions , than such as are laid on similar products , the growth of New Brunswick . Lord Ashburton says , in one of his notes to Mr. Webster , that these products , when *once at the mouth of the St. John , will have the privilege of reaching the British as well as other markets ; and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Minister for the Colonies . It is favorable to this arrangement , that it is by no means adverse to the interests of New Brunswick , and will tend to cement and strengthen , rather than to weaken , the harmony between the people of that Province and of Maine . // From the constant presence of an American squadron on the coast of Africa , many advantages may be expected , in addition to that of its immediate and highest service for the suppression of the slave trade . According to a recent Report of the Secretary of the Navy , " the lawful commerce of our citizens with all parts of the coast is rapidly increasing , and already employs a very large capital . " We regret to learn from the same authority , that , during the past year , no squadron has been on the coast , and that , chiefly in consequence of this want of protection , " several of our vessels have been captured by the natives , and their crews barbarously murdered . " This consideration alone is enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty , besides the duty , which the nation owes to itself , of redeeming the solemn pledges it has made to the world , by the execution of its laws against a most infamous traffic , which has for centuries afflicted , degraded , and disgraced humanity . To Great Britain , for her noble and unwearied efforts in this sacred cause , and for her generous sacrifices in its behalf , every philanthropist will cheerfully render the homage of unqualified praise . She is suspected of having ulterior aims ; of being influenced as much , at least , by motives of aggrandizement , as by a love for an oppressed and benighted race of human beings . Herein we shall not assume the office of judge , content to weigh the motives by the deeds . Let her have credit for the good she has done , and is doing . If time removes a mask , and reveals the deformities of a deceptive and selfish design , of a grasping ambition and aggressive power , let judgment and retrihution follow . The aid and countenance which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the coast of Africa , by protecting and encouraging their trade , are not among the least benefits which may be anticipated from its service . These colonies present one of the most interesting features in the history of the passing age . Established on the broadest principles of humanity and benevolence , and intended to ascertain by a fair experiment the capacity of the colored race for civilization , enlightened government , and self-culture , they have hitherto more than answered the sanguine hopes of their founders and benefactors . An experiment so well begun , and for so high an object , and opening so bright a promnise , deserves not only good wishes , but a steady and active support . // If any other evidence of the value of the Treaty , than that to which we bave called the attention of our readers , were needed , it would be found in the triumph it has gained over public opinion . Rarely has a treaty in any country , involving such grave and complicated matters of dispute , been approved by so unanimous a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be highly advantageous to the nation , and call to mind the bitter hostility with which it was everywhere assailed , the ferment , the public meetings composed of all political parties , the denunciations and remonstrances , which almost shook the firmness of Washington himself ; and then compare these events with the tranquillity , and even the rejoicings , of the whole land , when the results of the late negotiation were sent abroad . This impulse of approbation has been confirmed by eight months of deliberate inquiry and calm thought . That there should be opposition in some quarters is not strange ; antagonist principles , and antagonist parties , exist in all free countries and a public measure of this magnitude will never fail to call them into action . But , after all , the effective opposition , as manifested in the national legislature , was inconsiderable . In the vote upon the bill making appropriations for the execution of the Treaty , there were only four negative voices in the Senate , and about forty in the other House ; a unanimity almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great national interest . The Senators who spoke against the Treaty , and whose speeches have been printed , seem to have taken the ground , that the United States were wholly right , and Great Britain wholly wrong , and that Mr. Webster had nothing to do but to insist peremptorily upon every demand he chose to make . An argument built upon this assumption would be equally strong against any treaty that could possibly have been effected . They moreover complain , that all the differences between the two countries were not reconciled and settled . What grain of sound policy , wisdom , or practical sense , can be detected in this objection ? Shall we never begin a good work , because we can not complete it , at once , to our entire satisfaction ? Is it not a great and substantial gain to remove some of the bars to peace , harmony , and reciprocal intercourse , although others may remain , and await the issue of more favorable circumstances ? Shall we do nothing , because // xve can not do every thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these arguments , also , the spirit of party is seen to be working so rifely at bottom , as to take away much of the force they might otherwise possess , and to show that honest convictions , when derived through this medium , may receive their shape and hue from prejudice and preconceived opinions . This is to be regretted , since , to whatever extent the ebullitions of party spirit may be endured in our domestic affairs , it should never be suffered to raise its hydra head in our relations with foreign countries . Wherever these relations are concerned , there should be but one party , and that party the whole nation , animated and moved by one heart and one soul . The Treaty has sustained itself against all these assaults . By the discussions to which they have given life , its real merits have been more conspicuously brought to light , and more deeply impressed on the public mind ; and experience will every day prove , that what is now regarded as an honorable and fortunate achievement , will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
