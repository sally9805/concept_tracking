txt THE verbal honors of literature in this country are lavished with a free hand . The mind of the nation is held responsible for all the mediocrity which rushes into print . Every thin poetaster , who wails or warbles in a sentimental magazine , is dignified with the title of an American author , and is duly paraded in biographical dictionaries and " specimens " of native poets . Literary reputations are manufactured for the smallest consideration , and in the easiest of all methods . A clique of sentimentalists , for example , find a young dyspeptic poet , and think they see in his murmurings a mirror which reflects the " mysteries " of our nature . Two or three excitable patriots are in ecstasies at discovering a national writer , when they bring forward some scribbler who repeats the truisms of our politics , or echoes the slang of our elections . These fooleries , it must be admitted , are not peculiar to this country . They are now practised in most , civilized communities . In England , a poem by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater circulation in a year or two , than the writings of Wordsworth had obtained in twenty . The art of puffing , an art which has succeeded in consummating the divorce between words and ideas , is the method employed on both sides of the Atlantic for effecting this exaltation of mediocrity . For our own part , we deny that the swarm of writers , to // whom we have adverted , are to be considered as the representatives of the national mind , or that their productions are to be deemed a permanent portion of our national literature . A great portion of the intellectual and moral energy of the nation is engaged in active life . Those who most clearly reflect the spirit of our institutions are those who are not writers by profession . If we were to make a list of American authors , a list which should comprehend only such as were animated by an American spirit , we should pass over the contributors to the magazines , and the select men who lead representative assemblies or contend for vast schemes of reform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some great practical work , who were applying large powers and attainments to the exigencies of the times , and who were stirred by noble impulses , and laboring to compass great ends . The thoughts and feelings , which spring warm from the hearts and minds of such men in such positions , would be likely to possess a grandeur and elevation before which the mere trifling of amateurs in letters would be humbled and abased . Believing thus , that our national literature is to be found in the records of our greatest minds , and is not confined to the poems , novels , and essays which may be produced by Americans , we have been surprised that the name of Daniel Webster is not placed high among American authors . Men in every way inferior to him in mental power have obtained a widd reputation for writing works , in every way inferior to those spoken by him . , should think that thought changes its character , when it is published from the mouth instead of the press . Still , it is true , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesman is rarely considered , even by his own partisans , in the light of an author . He is responsible for no " book . " The records of what he has said and done , though perhaps constantly studied by contemporaries , are not generally regarded as part and parcel of the national literature . The fame of the man of action overshadows that of the author . We are so accustomed to consider him as a speaker , that we are somewhat blind to the great literary merit of his speeches . The celebrated argument in reply to Hayne , for instance , was intended by the statesman as a defence of his // political position , as an exposition of ' constitutional law , and a vindication of what he deemed to be the true policy of the country . The acquisition of merely literary reputation had no part in the motives from which it sprung . Yet the speech , even to those who take little interest in subjects like the tariff , nullification , and the public lands , will ever be interesting , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mastery it exhibits of all the weapons of dialectics , the broad stamp of nationality it bears , and the wit , sarcasm , and splendid and impassioned eloquence , which pervade and vivify , without interrupting , the close and rapid march of the argument . Considered merely as literary productions , therefore , we think the three volumes of " Speeches and Forensic Arguments , " quoted at the head of this article , take the highest rank among the best productions of the American intellect . They are also thoroughly national in their spirit and tone , and are full of principles , arguments , and appeals , which come directly home to the hearts and understandings of the great body of the people . They contain the results of a long life of mental labor , employed in the service of the country . They give evidence of a complete familiarity with the spirit and workings of our institutions , and breathe the bracing air of a healthy and invigorating patriotism . They are replete with that true wisdom , which is slowly gathered from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns of daily life and duty . They display qualities of mind and style , which would give them a high place in any literature , even if the subjects discussed were less interesting and important ; and they show also a strength of personal character , superior to irresolution and fear , capable of bearing up against the most determined opposition , and uniting to the utmost boldness in thought the utmost intrepidity in action . In all the characteristics of great literary performances , they are fully equal to many works which have stood the test of ages , and baffled the skill of criticism . Still , though read and quoted by every body , though continually appealed to as authorities , though considered as the products of the most capacious understanding in the country , few seem inclined to consider the high rank they hold in our literature , or their claim to be placed among the greatest works which the human intellect has produced during the last fifty years . // If the mind of Mr. Webster were embodied in any other form than speeches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the branch of literature to which his works belong has been much degraded by the nonsense and bombast of declaimers and sophists . It is edifying to read some of the " thrilling " addresses , which have " enchained the attention " of thousands , were it only to observe what tasteless word-piling passes with many for eloquence . Thought and expression , in these examples , are supplanted by the lungs and the dictionary . A man who is to address a crowd or a jury deems it necessary that a portion of his speech should be imaginative and passionate ; and accordingly he painfully elaborates a mass of worn and wasted verbiage into a style senselessly extravagant or coldly turgid . The success with which he practises this deception emboldens him to continue his rhetorical foolery , and he soon obtains a reputation for affluence of fancy and warmth of feeling . A vast number of examples of detestable bad taste might be selected from the orations of eminent men , who have fallen into this style , and labored to make their eloquence " tell " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not more struck by the poverty of thought than thee poverty of feeling and invention . We find that the fine raiment of the orator is the mere cast-off clothes of the poet , - that be mistakes vulgarity for graceful ease , - that his images are bloated , coarse , and flaring , - and that he has all the meanness of mediocrity without its simplicity of language . Amidst all the tasteless splendor and labored frenzy of his diction , we can hardly discover one genuine burst of feeling . The speeches of Daniel Webster are in admirable contrast with the kind of oratory we have indicated . They have a value and interest apart from the time and occasion of their delivery , for they are storehouses of thought and knowledge . The speaker descends to no rhetorical tricks and shifts , he indulges in no parade of ornament . A selfsustained intellectual might is impressed on every page . He rarely confounds the processes of reason and imagination , even in those popular discourses intended to operate on large assemblies . He betrays no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brisk life and momentary sparkle of flashing declamation . Earnestness , solidity of judgment , // elevation of sentiment , broad and generous views of national policy , and a massive strength of expression , characterize all his works . We feel , in reading them , that he is a man of principles , not a man of expedients ; that he never adopts opinions without subjecting them to stern tests ; and that he recedes from them only at the bidding of reason and experience . He never seems to be playing a part , but always acting a life . The ponderous strength of his powers strikes us not more forcibly than the broad individuality of the man . Were we unacquainted with the history of his life , we could almost infer it from his works . Every thing in his productions indicates the character of a person who has struggled fiercely against obstacles , who has developed his faculties by strenuous labor , who has been a keen and active observer of man and nature , and who has been disciplined in the affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind , and a rugged energy in his feelings , which preserve him from all the affectations of literature and society . He is great hy original constitution . What nature originally gave to him , nature has to some extent developed , strengthened , and stamped with her own signature . We never consider him as a mere debater , a mere scholar , or a mere statesman ; but as a strong , sturdy , earnest man . The school and the college could not fashion him into any foreign shape , because they worked on materials too hard to yield easily to conventional moulds . The impression of power we obtain from Webster 's productions - a power not merely of the brain , but of the heart and physical temperament , a power resulting from the mental and bodily constitution of the whole man - is the source of his hold upon our respect and admiration . We feel , that , under any circumstances , in any condition of social life , and at almost any period of time , his great capacity would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like many eminent men , to be more peculiarly calculated for his own age than for any other , - to possess faculties and dispositions which might have rusted in obscurity , had circumstances been less propitious . We are sure , that , as an old baron of the feudal time , as an early settler of New England , as a pioneer in the western forests , he would have been a Warwick , a Standish , or a Boon . His childhood was pass // ed in a small country village , where the means of education were scanty , and at a period when the country was rent with civil dissensions . A large majority of those who are called educated men have been surrounded by all the implements and processes of instruction ; but Webster won his education by battling against difficulties . " A dwarf behind a steamengine can remove mountains ; but no dwarf can hew them down with a pickaxe , and he must be a Titan that hurls them abroad with his arms . " Every step in that long journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has obtained the highest rank in social and political life , has been one of strenuous effort . The space is crowded with incident , and tells of obstacles sturdily met and fairly overthrown . His life and his writings seem to bear testimony , that he can perform whatever he strenuously attempts . His words never seem disproportioned to his strength . Indeed , he rather gives the impression , that he has powers and impulses in reserve , to be employed when the occasion for their exercise may arise . In many of his speeches , not especially pervaded by passion , we perceive strength , indeed , but " strength half-leaning on his own right arm . " He has never yet been placed in circumstances where the full might of his nature , in all its depth of understanding , fiery vehemence of sensibility , and adamantine strength of will , have been brought to bear on any one object , and strained to their utmost . We have referred to Webster 's productions as being eminently national . Every one familiar with them will bear us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried glance at his life would prove , that , surrounded as he has been from his youth with American influences , it could hardly be otherwise . His earliest recollections must extend nearly to the feelings and incidents of the Revolution . His whole life since that period has been passed in the country of his birth , and his fame and honors are all closely connected with American feelings and institutions . His works all refer to the history , the policy , the laws , the government , the social life , and the destiny of his own land . They bear little resemblance in their tone and spir.it to productions of the same class on the other side of the Atlantic . They have come from the heart and understanding of one into whose very nature the life of his country has passed . Without taking into view the influences to which his youth and early manhood were sub // jected , so well calculated to inspire a love for the very soil of his nativity , and ' to mould his mind into accordance with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his position has been such as to lead him to survey objects from an American point of view . His patriotism has become part of his being . Deny him that , and you deny the authorship of his works . It has prompted many of the most majestic flights of his eloquence . It has given intensit , y to his purposes , and lent the richest glow to his genius . It has made his eloquence a language of the heart , felt and understood over every portion of the land it consecrates . On Plymouth Rock , on Bunker 's Hill , at Mount Vernon , by the tombs of Hamilton , and Adams , and Jefferson , and Jay , we are reminded of Daniel Webster . He has done what no national poet has yet succeeded in doing ,  --  associated his own great genius with all in our country 's history and scenery , which makes us rejoice that we are Americans . He has made the dead past a living present . Over all those events in our history which are heroical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination . He can not stand on one spot of ground , hallowed by liberty or religion , without being kindled by the genius of the place ; he can not mention a name , consecrated by self-devotion and patriotism , without doing it eloquent homage . Seeing clearly , and feeling deeply , he makes us see and feel with him . That scene of the landing of the Pilgrims , in which his imagination conjures up the forms and emotions of our New England ancestry , will ever live in the national memory . We see , with him , the " little bark , with the interesting group on its deck , make its slow progress to the shore . " We feel , with him , " the cold which benumbed , " and listen , with him , " to the winds which pierced them . " Carver , and Bradford , and Standish , and Brewster , and Allerton look out upon us from the pictured page , in all the dignity with which virtue and freedom invest their martyrs ; and we see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a mother 's arms , couchless but for a mother 's breast , till our own blood almost freezes . " The readiness with which the orator compels our sympathies to follow his own is again illustrated in the orations at Bunker Hill , and in the discourse in honor of Adams and Jefferson . In reading them , we feel proud of our country , // and of the great men and great principles it has cherished . The mind feels an unwonted elevation , and the heart is stirred with emotions of more than common depth , by their majesty and power . Some passages are so graphic and true , that they seem gifted with a voice , and to speak to us from the page they illumine . The intensity of feeling , with which they are pervaded , rises at times from confident hope to prophecy , and lifts the soul as with wings . In that splendid close to a remarkable passage in the oration on Adams and Jefferson , what American does not feel assured , with the orator , that their fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to their memory , nor engraved stone bear record to their deeds , yet will their remembrance be as lasting as the land they honored . Marble columns may , indeed , moulder into ( lust , time may erase all impress from the crumbling stone , but their fame remains ; for with AMERICAN LIBERTY it rose , and with AMERICAN LIBERTY ONLY can it perish . It was the last swelling peal of yonder choir , THEIR BODIES ARE BURIED IN PEACE , BUT THEIR NAME LIVETh EVERMORE . ' I catch the solemn song , I echo that lofty strain of funeral triumph , THEIR NAME LIVETH EVERMORE. * , * Throughout the speeches of Mr. Webster we perceive this national spirit . He has meditated so deeply on the history , the formation , and the tendencies of our institutions he is so well acquainted with the conduct and opinions of every statesman who has affected the policy of the government ; and has become so thoronghiy imbued with the national character , that his sympathies naturally flow in national channels , and have their end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His motto is , " Our country , our whole country , and nothing but our country . " It is the alpha and omega of his political alphabet . It is felt in his blood , and " felt along his heart . " It is twined with all his early recollections , with the acts of his life , with his hopes , his ambition , and his fame . Strike it from his works , and what re-mains ? We do not mean , that Webster 's patrioPsm , as displayed in his speeches , is a blind , unintelligent impulse , leading him into fanaticism , and inspiring a rash confidence in every thing American . He has none of that overweening conceit , that spirit of bravado , that ignorant contempt for other countries , // that undiscerning worship of his own , which have done so much to make patriotism a convertible term for cant or folly . His opinions belong not to the same class with those which are equivocally generated by the heat of fervid tempers out of the overtlowings of tumid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country is his theme . He is too profound a student of government and human nature to indulge in " Fourth of July orations . " In nothing is his love of country more manifest , than in the sense he has of its dangers . His voice is raised to warn as well as to animate . A warm enthusiasm for popular rights is often accompanied by recklessness in the use of means ; and mere mouthing , in such instances , is so apt to be confounded with eloquent patriotism , that a man who breasts the flood , instead of being whirled along with it , subjects himself to the charge of opposing the cause of humanity and freedom . His firmness at such periods is the test of his patriotism . Forms are liable to be overthrown and trampled under foot , in the march of a victorious party , flushed with warm anticipations and mad with zeal . In every free community , there are many , whose quick sensibilities would lead them at any moment to barter the slow gatherings of years of experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the statesmanship of Mr. Webster better displayed , than in the strength with which he combats fanciful theories of impracticable reforms , and the sturdiness with which he intrenches himself in principles which have stood the test of experience . His patriotism " looks before and after . " He would defend what liberty we possess from the impetuosity of those who are clamorous for more . All encroachments of power on right and precedent , for whatever purpose they may be designed , he resists with the full force of his nature . His notion of the duty of a representative of the people , and the cautious jealousy with which he would view the slightest attack upon established declarations and safeguards , are admirably illustrated in a speech on the President 's Protest . " We have been taught , " he says , " to regard a representative of the people as a sentinel on the watch-tower of liberty . Is he to be blind , though visible danger approaches ? Is he to be deaf , though sounds of peril fill the air ? Is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise the cry of alarm ? Is he not , // rather , to catch the lowest whisper which breathes intention or purpose of encroachment on the public liberties , and to give his voice breath and utterance at the first appearance of danger ? Is not his eye to traverse the whole horizon , with the keen and eager vision of an unhooded hawk , detecting , through all dis guises , every enemy advancing , in any form , towards the citadel he guards ? " Again he says " The spirit of liberty is , indeed , a bold and fearless spirit ; but it is also a sharp-sighted spirit ; it is a cautious , sagacious , discriminating , far-seeing intelligence ; it is jealous of encroachment , jealous of power , jealous of man . It demands checks ; it seeks for guards ; it insists on securities ; it intrenches itself behind strong defences , and fortifies , with all possible care , against the assaults of ambition and passion . " Sentiments similar to these are found in all portions of his political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timidity of conservatism , which fears every thing new , for the reason that it is new ; but they evince the profound knowledge and wisdom of one whose studies and experience have led him to look for theories of free government in other sources than the imagination and sensibility ; of one , who knows when it is proper to watch the approach of enemies , and when to march to the attack of abuses ; . and of one who is aware that patriotism and courage are as often displayed in resisting the impulses of the time , as in being borne forward on their fiery course . The mind of Mr. Webster is eminently comprehensive , and fitted for large speculations . Its range is so wide , that there is little danger of its being fixed permanently on one department of thought to the exclusion of others . It is not a mere reasoning machine . It is neither misled by its own subtilty , nor bewildered by the fallacies of the feelings . It is rather telescopic than microscopic , more conversant with great principles than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more by the general mental power they display , than by the preponderance of any particular faculty . Through them all we perceive the movement of an intellect strong enough to grapple with any subject , and capacious enough to comprehend it , both in itself and in its relations . Force and clearness of conception , exact analysis , skilful arrange-5it* // ment , a sharp logical ability , and a keen insight , " outrunning the deductions of logic , " indicate a mind well calculated for the investigation of truth and the detection of error ; a mind capable of testing the validity of principles by the usual processes of reasoning , and of penetrating through all the heavy panoply of argument in which falsehood is often concealed . His common sense , a quality which does not always accompany mental power , is as prominent as his dialectical skill . Folly , assumption , fallacy , however cunningly hid in metaphor or formula , can not stand for one moment the keen glance of his intellect . He seems to have a feeling and sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expose it by logical methods . He tears away the labored defences of a sophism , and exhibits it to the light in its native littleness and deformity ; or , perhaps , in the consciousness and plenitude of power , he will play with it awhile , and make it the butt of sarcastic trifling , and cluster around it all the phrases and images of contempt , and then spurn it from his path as a thing too mean even for scorn . His understanding embraces the whole extent of a subject , methodizes its complicated details , discerns its general laws and their remote applications , and exhibits the whole to view with a clearness of arrangement which renders it perceptible to the simplest apprehension . As a reasoner , he has hardly an equal among his countrymen , either in the sharp , swift argumentation of vehement debate , or in the calm survey and powerful combination of facts and principles . Some may excel him in the discussion of abstract questions , - questions which rather require fineness than depth or reach of thought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none , in that large inductive method , which comprehends all the facts that ' lead to general laws , and which modifies all general laws when used as principles of action . He has little of the fanaticism of reasoning , little of that spirit which pushes one idea to its remote results , without regard to its limitations . He is also powerful in reasoning a priori , if the term be admissible , of applying universal principles of reason or morals to particular cases , and forcing the mind into assent to their application ; which is , perhaps , a greater sign of genius than slowly travelling up the ladder of induction , and arriving at a general law by successive steps . // Many examples might be selected , in illustration of his felicitous use of great sentiments and universal ideas , in elucidating a question of national policy or constitutional law . We believe , that the power to grasp , and rightly to employ , these ideas and sentiments , constitutes the difference between a great reasoner and a mere subtile logician . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art than an effort of genius . The merit of picking flaws in an argument is about on a par with the wondrous ability displayed by young rhetoricians , fresh from Blair , in detecting faults in the sentences of Addison and Burke . It is merely a knack . Many a young lawyer at the bar has nearly as much of it as can be found in Chillingworth or Butler . It is little better than quibbling , and is within the reach of any who have sufficient ingenuity to make a pun . Constantly practised , it vitiates and narrows the mind , and renders it skeptical on trifles , only to make it dogmatic on things of importance . At all events , it can not be called force of thought , and is altogether unfitted for the discussion of great practical questions . The power of Mr. Webster 's mind is seen to greatest advantage , when employed on questions relating to universal truths in morals , in government , and in religion . He then displays a grandeur and elevation of thought , a confidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lawyer and politician , and a ponderous might of expression , which convey a stronger impression of the essential greatness of the man , than his most celebrated triumphs over personal adversaries , and his most overpowering declamation in debate . In these examples , there is a union of calmness and energy , a grave , severe , determined , almost oracular , enunciation of lofty truths , and a trust in the eventual triumph of the eternal principles of justice and equity , before which all the subtile speculation of the sophist , and all the philosophy of the worldling , appear tame and debasing . This grandeur of moral tone , accompanying the most daring exercise of the understanding , and giving to abstractions a power to thrill the blood and kindle the noblest affections , - this soaring of the soul above the common maxims which regulate existence , and bringing down wisdom from on high to shame authority into acquiescence , is the more remarkable as coming from a practical statesman , whose life for thirty years has been passed in the turmoil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should preserve a steady faith in ideas and principles , should rise continually above the question and policy of the hour , should accustom his intellect to the contemplation of eternal truths , must appear as an anomaly to a large majority of politicians . Perhaps , if they would reflect more deeply on the matter , they would discover , that , even in political life , more real confidence is reposed in a man of this stability and grasp of intellect , and force of moral principle , than in the cunning trimmer , who shifts his ground with every change of national feeling , who relies for favor on giving a brilliant echo to every shout of the multitude , and who keeps faith with nothing but his selfish interest or his ravenous vanity . In that noble burst of eloquence , in the speech on the Greek Revolution , in which he asserts the power of the moral sense of the world , in checking the dominion of brute force , and rendering insecure the spoils of successful oppression , we have a strong instance of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This public opinion of the civilized world , " he says , " may be silenced by military power , but it can not be conquered . It is elastic , irrepressible , and invulnerable to the weapons of ordinary power . It follows the conqueror back to the very scene of his ovations ; it calls upon him to take notice , that Europe , though silent , is yet indignant ; it shows him , that the sceptre of his victory is a barren sceptre , that it shall confer neither joy nor honor , but shall moulder to dry ashes in his grasp . In the midst of his exultation , it pierces his ear with the cry of injured justice , it denounces against him the indignation of an enlightened and civilized age ; it turns to bitterness the cup of his rejoicing , and wounds him with the sting which belongs to the consciousness of having outraged the opinion of mankind . " The most splendid image to be found in any of his works closes a passage in which he attempts to prove , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle . " It was against the recital of an act of Parliament , rather than against any suffering under its enactments , that they took up arms . They went to war against a preamble ! They fought seven years against a declaration . They poured out their treasures and their blood like water , in a contest in opposition to an assertion , which those less sagacious , and not so well schooled in // the principles of civil liberty , would have regarded as barren phraseology , or mere parade of words On this question of principle , while actual suffering was yet afar off , they raised their flag against a power , to which , for purposes of foreign conquest and subjugation , Rome , in the height of her glory , is not to be compared , - a power which has dotted over the surface of the whole globe with her possessions and military posts , whose morning drum-beat , following the sun , and keeping company with the hours , circles the earth daily with one continuous and unbroken strain of the martial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention of those who deem that Mr. Webster is too practical in his system of politics , to allow his mind to be swayed by any great general ideas and principles . It would not be difficult to select other passages displaying an equally firm faith in the supremacy of truth and right . The jealous eye with which he watches the smallest encroachments on established safeguards of liberty is another illustration of his habit of looking at the principles and tendencies of things , rather than at their specious shows . In truth , in all questions relating to life and duty , whether the mind declares what may be , or what must be , whether it declares probabilities or certainties , his understanding is never found deficient in insight or comprehension . To this power of intellect , thus capable of such various exercise , and restrained from sophistical aberrations by such strength of moral sentiment , it is owing , that Mr. Webster 's speeches have that character of solidity , which has been so often acknowledged and so loudly praised . There is substance and body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like so many subtile reasonings and so much declamatory rhetoric . They are , in some respects , authorities on the subjects of which they treat . In them , a person is enabled to obtain a view of the different political theories and practices which divide the nation into parties , without any of the extravagance and perversions of the mere advocate and partisan . Holding on to his own principles with an iron-like firmness , despising all shifts to accommodate them to popular prejudice , and expressing them with a force derived from his whole nature , he still never indulges in the ranting subterfuges of the one-sided politician , and is no spendthrift of invective in opposing the champions of different measures . If the stern , rapid argument of his speeches be compared , // or rather contrasted , with the fanatical fury which disgraces so many political discourses , delivered by men of both parties , the distinction we desire to make will be more clearly seen , than by any description it is in our power to give . We have incidentally seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though not dominant , is deep and strong . No American writer has more fire in his productions . His passions , when roused , seem to pervade his intellect , and give it additional clearness and power . The same impulses , which blind , confuse , or madden others , and lead them astray from their objects , only affect him by giving a quicker spring to his style , and more intensity and vehemence to his reasoning . His sensibility is not the master , but the ally , of his understanding . It never forces his mind into passionate fallacies , nor substitutes declamation for argument ; but it sharpens his insight , it condenses and vivifles his diction , and infuses into his " ponderous syllables * a fiery energy , by which they smite their objects with an overpowering effect . The fact , that there is such a mass of intellectual power behind his sensibility , to fix , condense , and direct its mighty impulses , confers upon it greater potency , than if it swept along with more uncontrolled fierceness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the understanding at the same moment . It forces the mind directly along the path of clear reasoning to the object in view . It is argument , but argument gifted with animal life and energy ; it is reason , but " reason penetrated , and made , as it were , red-hot with passion . " There are occasions , when Mr. Webster 's sensibility is less under his control , when it gives out scorn and denunci-ation , " As the rock Gives out the reddening , roaring fire " ; but generally , it is exercised in the service of reason . When attacked , he has his faculties most under the guidance of his judgment , and deals back blow for blow with tenfold force , from being able to concentrate his powers . There is a provoking condescension , even in his wrath , which must be more galling to an adversary , than the most ungovernable outbreak of rage and invective . Passion , to a debater , is the most useful of servants and the most tyrannical of masters . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild sophistries , or malignant hatred , it vitiates the intellect and enfeebles the judgment . Statesmen and orators , who have mingled much in the warfare of debate , have rarely preserved a due medium between fury and nonchalance . The strong understanding of Edmund Burke was not proof against the delusions of his feelings . It has been said of him , that he chose his position like a fanatic , and defended it like a philosopher . We sometimes find in his writings an almost gigantic power of reasoning , exercised to defend an unreasonable prejudice ; and an exhaustless fertility of fancy , employed to adorn a rotten institution . His intellect was so entangled in a web of associations and tastes , that it rarely had free play . In the fierce sway of his sensibility over his other powers , his dignity and self-possession were often lost ; and he directed some of the most potent efforts of his genius against those self-evident truths which no dialectical skill can overthrow . Lord Brougham 's large acquirements and high position do not preserve him from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches are the offspring of excitement and whim , valuable , chiefly , to show that the mere scolding of a great man is not without its eloquence . We have referred to the strength of personal character which the productions of Mr. Webster evince . This , we think , is to be attributed , in a great degree , to the depth and intensity of his feelings , and especially to his passions . Mental power , alone , could not have sustained him in the many emergencies of his political position . No one can read his works without being struck with the stout courage , both moral and physical , with which they are animated . He never seems touched with fear or irresolution . The hall of debate is not so dangerous , to be sure , as the field of battle but we can conceive of valor which would brave the cannon 's mouth , and yet shrink from the trials and responsibilities of political warfare . Not only is a man obliged to repel personal attack , but character , station , and influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . A mere passionate partisan , whose insignificance is his shield from the scocn of posterity , can ill appreciate the responsibility which presses on the heart of the great statesman . The latter is acting in the very eye of history ; indeed , he is living history . His vote and his opinions are to be remembered against him , // if they support a pernicious law , or spring from ignorance or excitement . His advocacy or denunciation of a measure is to affect for evil or good the condition of millions . His conscience , his patriotism , all the conservative principles of his nature , though they would impel him to act and speak for the right , are liable to perplex his determinations , if they are not based on clear conceptions of the subject . With posterity and its inevitable verdict before him , and a clamorous party , urging him to do every thing unreasonable , at his back , he is forced to come to a decision , and maintain it with his whole power . To do this requires courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's speeches , we find that they display no disposition to shrink from the consequences of his conduct , no evasion of responsibility , no expressions studiously framed to bear two interpretations , but a plain , sturdy , unflinching expression of judgment , fortified by clear arguments , and ever ready to be tried by the result . This intellectual hardihood , unaffected by skeptical distrust , and daring the verdict of the present and the future , must be deemed a great quality by all capable of appreciating it . If the measure supported be evil , he is to suffer from one of two imputations . If his conduct sprung from ignorance or rashness , it is folly ; if it sprung from selfishness , it is crime . In view of this fact , a little timidity is excusable in a statesman placed in a prominent station , whose opinions are axioms to great *parties , and who is surrounded by partisans and enemies , while all his acts and words are scrutinized with the sharp analysis of malice and hatred ; and it requires the rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character , to enable a man to act , in such a position , with wisdom , boldness , and decision . Much has been said and written in praise of Mr. Webster 's imagination , often , we think , from overlooking the claims of his understanding and sensibility . A careful examination of his works will lead us to speak more guardedly of the degree in which he possesses this faculty . We think , that loftiness of moral principle , reach of thought , and depth of passion are more apparent , than affluence of imagery . Imagination , however , is a word so loosely employed , that , in the common meaning of the term , it would be no compliment to apply it to any man of large intellect . The // same term which is applied to the most marked characteristic of Shakspeare 's " Tempest " is indiscriminately used in speaking of some florid oration , or some wild nonsense of passion . A poem is published , teeming with absurdities , and full of confused rant and bloated metaphors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A speaker indulges in the wildest vagaries of sentimentality , talks about the stars , the ocean , the progress of the species , and jumbles them all up in one series of worthless figures ; and sensible people call him a fool , but a fool by virtue of his strong imagination . Flowery and feeble declaimers - writers like the Rev. Mr. Hervey , orators like Counsellor Phillips - are accused of possessing imagination . Thus a term , which , more than any other in the vocabulary of criticism , requires to be employed cautiously and with qualifications , is made a convenient word to cover the feebleness of a critic 's insight and the clumsiness of his analysis . The imagination , " the vision and the faculty divine , " is by no means predominant in Mr. Webster 's mind . With him , it is not a spontaneous , shaping power , but acts chiefly at the direction of reason and feeling , and is most fruitful when his intellect is most active in its operations . Many of its analogies may be referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally broad , distinct , and vivid , speaking directly to the eye , and informed with the feeling of the moment ; but it has little of that subtile influence which touches minute shades of feeling , suggests remote analogies , sheds ineffable beauty over the common realities of life , detects the latent spiritual meaning beneath rough forms , and combines things seemingly different into one consistent whole . Its power bears little comparison with the power of the understanding which directs it , - an understanding which often dives deeper and soars higher than his imagination , with the disadvantage of acting under more laborious processes . In some of his most splendid efforts , his imagination works rather by allusion than creation ; by vivifying and applying old images and forms of expression , than by originating new . Throughout the speech in reply to ilayne , there is a constant reference to figures and phrases which are in the memories of all who have studied the Bible , Shakspeare , and Milton . Though suggested and applied to his own purposes by the imagination , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive their great effect from the spirit and feeling with which they are pervaded . Indeed , if Mr. Webster 's invention were equal to his understanding , he would be a poet , before whose genius the brightest names in our literature would " pale their ineffectual fires . " The mere fact , that his imagination is subsidiary to his reasoning powers , and that its products are not esteemed of equal value , proves that it is relatively inferior . The imagination of Mr. Webster , if not that of a poet , is eminently the imagination which befits an orator and debater . A statesman , who is to present his views on a question of national policy in lucid order , and to illustrate them by familiar pictures , would fail in attaining his object , if he substituted fancies for reasons , or linked his reasoning with too subtile images . Mr. Webster 's imagination never leads him astray from his logic , but only illumines the path . It is no delicate Ariel , sporting with abstract thought , and clothing it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chain of argument it brightens . Even in his noblest bursts of eloquence , we are struck rather by the elevation of the feeling , than the vigor of the imagination . For instance , in the Bunker Hill oration , he closes an animated passage with the well known sentence , - " Let it rise till it meet the sun in his coming ; let the earliest light of morning gild it , and parting day linger and play upon its summit . " If we take from this passage all the phrases which are not strictly original , and separate the sentiment from the invention , we shall find that it is not eminently creative . Wordsworth in one word conveys a similar but more subtile imagination , in the lines commencing , " There is an eminence , of these our hills , The last that parleys with the setting sun . " When we consider , that the first comes from a mind in that excited state which prompts great images , and that the other is conceived in the calm of thought , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the eye of the understanding , and a mind habitually looking at things with the eye of imagination . Again , it would be difficult to believe , that the sound of exquisite music would suggest to a mind like Mr. Webster* s an image of such grace , fineness , and beauty , as the following from Shelley : // " My soul is an enchanted boat , Which , like a sleeping swan , doth float Upon the silver waves of thy sweet singing ; And thine doth like an angel sit Beside the helm , conducting it , While all the winds with melody are ringing . " Here , the most inexpressible of all sweet emotions is shaped into a palpable form . Shelley , we know , is an extreme case , but therefore the best to illustrate the distinction we wish to make . Mr. Webster is celebrated for his use of images drawn from familiar objects . Here , likewise , we discern the difference between the poet 's imagination and the imagination of the orator and reasoner . The products of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the other can be easily distinguished from the idea they illustrate . From Shelley , a multitude of examples might be taken , in which the most familiar things are linked with the most profound and most recondite analogies . We will quote one from his prose works , as a specimen . " The mind in inspiration is a fading coal , which some inconstant influence , like an invisible wind , wakes into momentary brightness . " in this , the imagination not only suggests the analogy , but selects , with unerring tact , the words which best convey it to other imaginations ; and yet , to Shelley , the whole process of its conception and expression was as natural an exercise of his peculiar mind , as to Mr. Webster would be the deduction of a conclusion from a premise . Indeed , we think that those who assert for our great statesman the inventive power of a poet misconceive both poetry and him . The most rapid glance at his productions shows , that he lacks the " inwardness , " the brooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows of things to the desires of the mind . " With all his tremendous power of thinking , he has little thoughtfulness ,  --  - little of the habit of quiet meditation . He could do things worthy of being recorded in a great poem ; but he could not write a great poem . We do not know , but that this predominance of the reasoning over the imaginative power , in Mr. Webster 's mind , is owing to the severe training to which his faculties have been subjected in the exercise of his profession . It is said , that the compositions of his youth were more replete with images than deductions . But however this may be , it is certain , that // 64 July , his manhood has witnessed the triumph of his understanding over the impulses of his passions and the analogies of his fancy . If one of his speeches be compared with one of Burke 's or Curran 's , it will be seen , that in affluence of imagination he does not hold the first rank among orators . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over with images . So capricious and wayward was his imagination , that it scattered its rich treasures on themes the least congenial to the faculty , and the least apt to be benefited by its exercise . It began to work , the moment he began to write or speak . Analogies of the understanding and analogies of fancy are blended somewhat confusedly in many of his discourses , where the subject demanded a rigid adherence to reason . Allusions , metaphors , comparisons , cluster thickly round almost every argument . The clear , keen , penetrating logic , casting aside every thing which does not immediately aid the progress of the discussion , and piercing through all obstacles straight to the object , is often wanting . The very quality of mind , which lends such vividness and beauty to his diction , and which will ever make his works of inestimable value to men of taste , interfered with the free exercise of his great understanding , and with the intensity and condensation of his thoughts . Curran , whose reasoning capacity , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one can read his speeches without seeing their admirable adaptation to the object of inflaming the passions and stimulating the imagination . The energy of his mind strikes us not so much as its exceeding fruitfulness . Byron said , that he had heard him speak more poetry than he had ever seen written . Images , sometimes coarse and flaring , often in a high degree vivid and magnificent , and always vigorous and apposite , are poured out lavishly over every page of his imperfectly reported speeches . But the faults of such a style are as apparent as its beauties . It may serve before a jury or a " caucus " ; but it is out of place in the senate . A practical statesman , whose mind was under the dominion of such an enchanter , would be liable to lose the confidence of his constituents , - would be apt to lose the confidence of his own understanding . There is an eloquence , grave , majestic , pervaded by deep feeling , expressing the loftiest principles of moral and political duty , replete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vivid pictures , which is not in. consistent with the strictest exercise of the understanding , in all those departments of thought over which the understanding holds rightful dominion ; and of this kind is the eloquence of Mr. Webster . Every great writer has a style of his own , constructed according to the character of his mind and disposition . The style of Mr. Webster has great merit , not only for its vigor , clearness and compression , but for the broad impress which it bears of the writer 's nature . It owes nothing to the usual tricks of rhetoric , but seems the unforced utterance of his intellect , and is eminently Websterian . There is a granitelike strength in its construction . It varies , from the simple force and directness of logical statement , to a fierce , trampling energy of manner , with each variation of his mind from calmness to excitement . He appears moderately gifted with fluency . Were it not for the precision and grasp of his mind , he would probably be a hesitating extemporaneous speaker . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large command of expression . He has none of the faults which spring from verbal fluency , and is never misled by his vocabulary . Words , in his mind , are not masters , but instruments . They seem selected , or rather clutched , by the faculty or feeling they serve . They never overload his meaning . Perhaps extreme readiness in the use of language is prejudicial to depth and intensity of thinking . The ease with which a half-formed idea , swimming on the mind 's surface , is clothed in equivocal words , and illustrated with vague images , is the " fatal facility " which produces mediocrity of thought . In Mr. Webster 's style , we always perceive , that a presiding power of intellect regulates his use of terms . The amplitude of his comprehension is the source of his ' felicity of expression . He bends language into the shape of his thought ; he never accommodates his thoughts to his language . The grave , high , earnest nature of the man looks out upon us from his well knit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reading the works of one whose greatness of mind and strength of passion no conventionalism could distort , and no exterior process of culture could polish into feebleness and affectation ; of one who has lived a life , as well as passed through a college , - who has looked at nature and man as they are in themselves , not as they appear 6* // in books . We can trace back expressions to influences coming from the woods and field ,  --  from the fireside of the farmer , - from the intercourse of social life . The secret of his style is not to be found in Kames or Blair , but in his own mental and moral constitution . There is a tough , sinewy strength in his diction , which gives it almost muscular power in forcing its way to the heart and understanding . Occasionally , his words are of that kind which are called " half-battles , stronger than most men 's deeds . " In the course of an abstract discussion , or a clear statement of facts , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our feet . When vehemently roused , either from the excitement of opposition , or in unfolding a great principle which fills and expands his soul , or in paying homage to some noble exemplar of virtue and genius , his style has a Miltonic grandeur and roll , which can hardly be surpassed for majestic eloquence . In that exulting rush of the mind , when every faculty is permeated by feeling , and works with all the force of passion , his style has a corresponding swiftness and energy , and seems endowed with power to sweep all obstacles from its path . In those inimitable touches of wit and sarcasm , also , where so much depends on the selection and collocation of apt and expressive language , and where the object is to pelt and tease rather than to crush , his diction glides easily into colloquial forms , and sparkles with animation and point . In the speech in reply to Hayne , the variety of his style is admirably exemplified . The pungency and force of many strokes of sarcasm in this celebrated production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compression of the wit , and the skill with which all are made subsidiary to the general purpose of the orator , afford fine examples of what may be termed the science of debate . There is a good-humored mockery , covering , however , much grave satire , in his reference to the bugbear of Federalism , " We all know a process , " he says , " by which the whole Essex Junto could , in one hour , be all washed white from their ancient federalism , and come out , every one of them , an original democrat , dyed in the wool ! Some of them have actually undergone the operation , and they say it is quite easy . The only inconvenience it occasions , as they tell us , is a slight tendency of the blood to the head , a soft suffusion , which , however , is very transient , since nothing is said by those they join calculated // to deepen the red in the cheek , but a prudent silence is observed in regard to all the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enumerating the various countings which the " public moneys " would undergo , if collected and disbursed according to the specie plan , he introduces a ludicrous image , which , when taken in connection with the strain of argument that precedes it , is almost unrivalled as a felicitous stroke of ridicule . Sir , " he says , " what a money-counting , tinkling , jingling , generation we shall be ! All the money-changers in Solomon 's Temple will be as nothing to us . Our sound will go forth into all lands . We shall all be like the king in the ditty of the nur-sery : ? There sat the king a.counting of his money . ' " The sarcasm of Mr. Webster , when it is exercised on things which awake his resentment , is often exceedingly sharp and severe ; and his very words seem to cut , and sting , and hiss , in their utterance . This power he rarely uses , except when some malignant personal attack calls it forth ; and then he is merciless . He not only wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his victim . His expression of scorn and contempt , likewise , is measureless and crushing . When taunted with a participation in things , the very suspicion of which is offensive to his pride or his dignity , he does not condescend to defend himself , or to be enraged ; but his scorn darts instantly to the motives of the attack , and to the baseness of the imputation . He ever gives the impression , that the originator of the libel was aware of its incongruity with the character of Daniel Webster , and therefore was compelled to support it by the hardiest falsehood . The reference to the " murdered coalition** is a case in point . " Doubtless , " he says , " it served its day , and , in a greater or less degree , the end designed by it . Having done that , it has sunk into the general mass of stale and loathed calumnies . It is the very cast-off slough of a polluted and shameless press . Incapable of further mischief , it lies in the sewer , lifeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the power of the honorable member to give it dignity and decency , by attempting to elevate it , and to introduce it into the Senate . He can not change it from what it is , an object of general disgust and scorn . On the contrary , // the contact , if he choose to touch it , is more likely to drag him down , down , to the place where it lies itself " In these observations on some of the characteristics of Mr. Webster , we have not attempted a complete analysis of his mind , or followed him in any of those political and constitutional discussions in which it has been so ably exercised . We have rather taken a general view of his works , with reference to the large mental power and strong points of character they evince , and the elevated station they occupy as literary productions . We have claimed for them some of the highest honors of the intellect . We have considered them as being eminently American in their subjects and principles , and as constituting an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how little justice can be done a great man , in thus taking , as it were , his nature to pieces , and examining each portion separately . In the case of an author like Mr. Webster , whose different powers interpenetrate each other , and produce by joint action a harmonious result , it requires a more potent alchemy than we have applied , thoroughly to resolve his different productions into the elements from whose combination they have sprung . We have likewise run the risk of being charged with exaggeraiion , in our estimate of his capacity . The perfect clearness of his arrangement , and the straight-forward , thorough-going force of his mind , by which he simplifies subjects the most intricate to common understandings , and exhibits them in what Bacon calls " dry light , " are not likely to be appreciated by those who judge obscurity to be a necessary ingredient of the profound . There appears nothing wonderful in the result , for it seems simple and easy of comprehension ; but the wonder is in the process by which the result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half clear and half confused , a little mingling of assertion with deduction , a suppression of some facts , a lofty enunciation of a few abstract propositions , and a less comprehensive mode of argumentation ; would give him , in the minds of many , a greater reputation as a deep reasoner , than he could obtain from his rigid severity of method , his penetrating sharpness of analysis , and his massive good sense . There is more likelihood , that such an author would be underrated , than that the triumphs of his understanding would elicit exaggerated panegyric. // In the United States , there is much fanaticism in the opinions - we will not insult reason by calling them judgments - expressed of public men . There are two species of cant prevailing , - the cant of absurd panegyric , and the cant of absurd invective ; and it has become almost a custom for men indiscriminately to denounce certain statesmen , against whom they have no feeling of hatred , and indiscriminately to eulogize others , for whom they have no feeling of admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities which should call them forth . In the jargon of this political rhetoric , there is no sliding scale of morality or immorality , genius or stupidity ; but the boundaries are fixed , with geometrical precision , at those points where one party comes , face to face , with another . On one side is knavery and folly , on the other side is honesty and wisdom . Of course , such a code of criticism admits of no minute distinctions or shades in the delineation of character . A few epithets , of the bitterest gall or the sweetest honey , suffice for the purpose . We are not so simple as to believe , that this mode of deciding upon the character and ability of public men goes any deeper than words . It is merely a vice of the pen and the tongue , and has no foundation in the heart of the community . We have no apology , therefore , to make for reviewing the works of one who is connected with a great political party , and whose speeches , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many of our eminent men are engaged in public life , it would be folly in neutral literary journals to avoid noticing their productions , for fear of wounding the sensitiveness of one class , and disregarding the wishes of another . In respect to literature and intellectual power , there should be no partisan feeling . We have not considered Daniel Webster as a politician , but as an American . We do not possess great men in such abundance , as to be able to spare one from the list . It is clearly our pride and interest to indulge in an honest exultation at any signs of intellectual supremacy in one of our own countrymen . His talents and acquirements are so many arguments for republicanism . They are an answer to the libel , that , under our constitution , and in the midst of our society , large powers of mind and marked individuality of character can not be developed and nourished . We have in Mr. Webster the example of a // man , whose youth saw the foundation of our government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest offices ; who was horn on our soil , educated amid our people , exposed to all the malign and beneficent influences of our society ; and who has acquired high station by no sinuous path , by no sacrifice of manliness , principle , or individuality , but by a straight-forward force of character and vigor of intellect . A fame such as he has obtained is worthy of the noblest ambition ; it reflects honor on the whole nation ; it is stained by no meanness , or fear , or subserviency ; it is the result of a long life of intellectual labor , employed in elucidating the spirit of our laws and government , in defending the principles of our institutions , in disseminating enlarged views of patriotism and duty , and in ennobling , by the most elevated sentiments of freedom and religion , the heroical events of our national history . And we feel assured , when the animosities of party have been stilled at the tomb , and the great men of this generation have passed from the present feverish sphere of excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with feelings of unalloyed pride and admiration , that the scholar , the lawyer , the statesman , the orator , the . /Imerican , will ponder over the writings of Daniel Webster.
