txt IN a former number , about a year ago , in a notice of an admirable essay under the title of " Self-Culture , " a brief tribute was offered itt the pages of this work to the noble spirit of democratic philanthropy with which the writings of Dr. Channing have been of late years especially imbued  --  and to the value of the contributions which have proceeded from his great and good mind towards that holy cause of the developement of the Democratic Principle , in this country and to the ends of the earth , which we most devoutly believe to be identified with all the highest and best interests of Humanity . It is a duty that we owe to that cause , not to let pass the occasion of the publication of the two Lectures referred to at the foot of this page , without a special commendation of them to our readers , with a view to the widest possible diffusion of them throughout the classes of society to which they particularly address themselves ; at the same time that we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own interest and value to our present Number , by the quotation of liberal extracts from them . The " Elevation of the Laboring Portion of the Co*nmunity " - this is indeed the great social problem which it is the end and aim of our whole . Democratic Civilization to work out . In comparison with this every other question which the widest range and the loftiest flight of human inquiry can present-exclusive of those relating more directly to the soul 's own future immortal destinies-sinks into an insignificance that seems utterly unworthy of engaging the attention of a thinking man . A fearful and a sorrowful thing is it to contemplate fhe actual condition of that great mass of society indicated by the expression , its " laboring * Lectures on the Elevation of the Laboring Portion of the CoThmunity . By William B. Channing . Boston : Published by William D. Ticknor , 1840. 1i2 // portion , " as it exists even in the most favored country-especially when we regard it in contrast with that ideal of which we have both the conception and the dim prophetic hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wretched and degraded mass-wretched from unceasing toil and care for the mere sustenance of animal existence , and degraded by the necessary consequent ignorance , and want of spiritual developement  --  a man , bringing with him from the generous hand of creative nature , each in his degree , all the elements and germs of those glorious capabilities of greatness and goodness which , under more fortunate circumstances , we have so often seen ; in single instances , to raise men to a rank of moral elevation only a little lower than angels ? And if all may not attain the highest degrees of excellence , is it not at least very certain that a wiser culture , and a better combination of those social influences which surround men as with an atmospheric pressure , could readily , within a brief number of generations , elevate the whole mass to a point of amelioration of their moral as well as physical condition , from which they are now seemingly at a hopeless distance ? The most bigoted asserter of the radical and pervading depravity of human nature will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least within him . The admission is contained in the proposition that all are capable by their own effort in self-improvement , aided by the higher influence by which such effort will always be seconded , of working out their own future Eternal Salvation . And in all the hideous amount of wickedness and wretchedness by which the atmosphere we breathe is polluted and darkened , when has ever been seen such an instance of total , unredeemed depravity , that we are not ready to say that that man , steeped as he may have become in every imaginable foulness of crime , might not have been made-by the presence of happier influences presiding over the developement and formation of his character , guiding him from his cradle upwards into the pleasant paths of goodness , and training him to a right use of that fearful , while divine , faculty and responsibility , the freedom of the human will  --  a valuable and honorable member of society ? Who , then , will deny the possibility at least of the object which philanthropic democracyproposes to itself , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of mankind , in spite of all the wretched experience of past thousands of years , if only the means can be devised of giving increased efficiency to all the good influences now in action in the institutions of society , and of extirpating , to the greatest extent practicable , all those unfavorable influences of external circumstances to which nine-tenths of the physical and moral degradation which now afflicts society appears directly traceable ? And , if possible , how glorious the object-how worthy of the most zealous devotion of the loftiest powers of the human intellect ! This is the point of view in which the science of Politics acquires its dignity // and its interest  --  a dignity and interest incomparably beyond the claims of any other subject of inquiry* or action . It is because we believe the Democratic Principle capable of eventually working out the nearest possible approach to that ideal model of human society in which there shall be the maximum amount of good and happiness and the minimum amount of evil and misery , that we are devoted to the object of cultivating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the malign influences which we see unceasingly at work among the institutions of society to impede and to pervert it . And much " as there is with which we have little sympathy , both in the political morals , and in the practice , of both the great parties which now convulse the country in their struggle for the ascendency , it is because we know the Democratic Party to have at least the best title on the whole to the name to whichtheir opponents have recently attempted to advance a claim-to be the party of the democratic movement  --  and to be at the present period actually pursuing a line of practical policy which we regard as a step of inappreciable importance in the progress of that movementthat it , its leading men , and its leading measures , command our earnest and anxious support . But to return to the Lectures themselves which have suggested the above remarks , of which we desire not so much to present a criticism or analysis , as a few extracts , in which we only regret that our limits will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we are told in the preface , " for two meetings of Mechanics , one of them consisting of Apprentices , the other of adults ; " and they are published at the request of " the Mechanics Apprentices ' Library Association " - an excellent institution in the city of Boston , of which the character and objects are sufficiently indicated in its name . The following introductory remarks touch upon that great and sublime truth , of the new era which it is the mission of Democracy to establish in the world of which we have spoken above : " It is with no common pleasure , that I take part in the present course of Lectures . Such a course is a sign of the times , and very interesting to all who are interested in the progress of their fellow-creatures . We hear much of the improvements of our age . The wonders achieved by machinery are the common talk of every circle ; but I confess , that , to me , this gathering of mechanics ' apprentices , whose chief bond of union is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improve themselves by the best instruction which the state of society places within their reach , is more encouraging than all the miracles of the machinist . In this meeting I see , what I desire most to see , that the mass of the people are beginning to comprehend themselves and their true happiness , that they are catching glimpses of the great work and vocation of human beings , and are rising to their true place in the social state . The present meeting indicates a far more radical , more important change in the world , than the steam-engine , or the navigation of the Atlantic in a fortnight . That members of the laboring class , at the close of a day 's work , should assemble in such a hall as this , to hear lectures on science , history , ethics , and the most stirring topics of the day , from men whose education is thought to fit them for the highest offices , is a proof of a social revolution to which no bounds can be set , and from which too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repeal of the sentence of degradation passed by ages on the mass of mankind . I see in it the dawn of a // new era , in which it will be understood , that the first object nf society is to give incitements and means of progress to all its members . I see in it the sign of the approaching triumph of men 's spiritual over their outward and material interests . In the hunger and thirst for knowledge and for refined pleasures , which this course of lectures indicates in those who labor , I see that the spirit of man is not always to be weighed down by toils for animal life and by the appetite for animal indulgencies . I do attach great importance to this meeting , not for its own sake or its immediate benefits , but a ' a token and pledge of a new impulse given to society through all its conditions . On this account I take more pleasure in speaking here , than I should feel in being summoned to pronounce a show-oration before all the kings and nobles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done with shows . The age is too stirring-we are pressed on by too solemn interests , to be justified in making speeches for self-display or mere amusement . He who can not say something in sympathy with , or in aid of ; the great movements of humanity , might as well hold his peace . " Passing , then , to his subject of ifte elevation of the laboring portion of society , Dr. Channing devotes the first Lecture to the consideration of the question , in what this elevation consists . The second answers objections to its practicableness , and speaks of some of the circumstances which now favor it , and give us hope that it will be more and more accomplished . Beginning with stating in what it does not consist , he thus places in a strong light the dignity and value of labor : " By the elevation of the laborer , I do not understand that he is to be raised above the need of labor . I do not expect a series of improvements by which he is to be released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no desire to dismiss him from his workshop and farm , to take the spade and axe from his hand , and to make his life a long holyday . I have faith in labor , and I see the goodness of God in placing us in a world where labor alone can keep us alive . I would not change , if I could , our subjection to physical laws , our exposure to hunger and cold , and the necessity of constant conflicts with the material world . I would not , if I could , so temper the elements , that they should infuse into us only grateful sensations , that they should make vegetation so exuberant as to anticipate every want , and the minerals so ductile as to offer no resistance to our strength or skill . Such a world would make a contemptible race . Man owes his growth , his energy , chiefly to that striving of the will , that conflict with difficulty , which we call Effort . Easy , pleasant work does not make robust minds , does not give men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endurance , to perseverance , to steady force of will , that force without which all other acquisitions avail nothing . Manual labor is a school , in which men are placed to get energy of purpose and character , a vastly more important endowment than all the learning of all other schools . They are placed , indeed , under hard masters , physical sufferings and wants , the power of fearful elements , and the vicissitudes of all human things ; but these stern teachers do a work which no compassionate , indulgent friend could do for us ; and true wisdQm will bless Providence for their sharp ministry . I have great faith in hard work . The material world does much for the mind by its beauty and order ; but it does more for our minds by the pains it inflicts , by its obstinate resistance which nothing but patient toil can overcome , by its vast forces which nothing but unremitting skill and effort can turn to our use , by its perils which demand continual vigilance , and by its tendencies to decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human mind than what we call assistances . Work we all must , if we mean to bring out and perfect our nature . Even if we do not work with the hands , we must undergo equivalent t0il in some other direction . No business or study which does not present obstacles , tasking to the full the intellect and the will , is worthy of a man . In science , he // who does not grapple with hard questions , who does not concentrate his whole intellect in vigorous attention , who does not aim to penetrate what at first repels him , will never attain to mental force . The uses of toil reach beyond the present world . The capacity of steady , earnest labor is , I apprehend , one of our great preparations for another state of being . When I see the vast amount of toil required of men , I feel , that it must have important connexions with their future existence ; and that he , who has met this discipline manfully , has laid one essential foundation of improvement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will here see that to me labor has great dignity . It is not merely the grand instrument by which the earth is overspread with fruitfulness and beauty , and the ocean subdued , and matter wrought into innumerable forms for comfort and ornament . It has a far higher function , which is to give force to the will , efficiency , courage , the capacity of endurance and of persevering devotion to far-reaching plans . Alas , for the man who has not learned to work ! He is a poor creature . He does not know himself . He depends on others , with no capacity of making returns for the support they give ; and let him not fancy that he has a monopoly of enjoyment . Ease , rest , owes its deliciousness to toil ; and no toil is so burdensome as the rest of him who has nothing to task and quicken his powers . " Still less does it consist in a participation in the luxurious habits and conventional manners of those circles of society which are sent to claim the peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the next place , thatthis elevation is not to be gained by efforts to force themselves into what are called the upper ranks of society . I wish them to rise , but I have no desire to transform them into gentlemen or ladies , according to the common acceptation of these terms . I desire for them not an outward and showy , but an inward and real change ; not to give them new , titles and an artificial rank , but substantial improvements and real claims to respect . I have no wish to dress them from a Parisian tailor 's shop , or to teach them manners from a dancing school . I have no desire to see them , at the end of the day , doff their working dress , that they may play a part in richly attired , circles . I have no desire , that they should he admitted to luxurious feasts , or should get a taste for gorgeous upholstery . There is nothing cruel in the necessity , which sentences the multitude of men to eat , dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence is executed so mildly asin this country . In this country , where the demand for labor is seldom interrupted , and the openings for enterprise are numerous beyond precedent , the laboring class , with few exceptions , may well be satisfied with their accomodations . Very many of them need nothing but . a higher taste for beauty , order , and neatness , to give an air of refinement and grace as well as comfort to their establishments . In this country the mass of laborers have their share of outward good . Their food , abundant and healthful , seasoned with the appetite which labor gives , is , on the whole , sweeter as well as healthier than the elaborate luxuries of the prosperous ; and their sleep is sounder and more refreshing than falls to the lot of the less employed . Were it a possible thing , I should be sorry to see them turned into men and women of fashion . Fashion is a poor vocation . Its creed , that idleness is a privilege , and work a disgrace , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or earnestness of feeling , or strength of purpose , living an unreal life , sacrificing substance to show , substituting the factitious for the natural , mistaking a crowd for society , finding its chief pleasure in ridicule , and exhausting its ingenuity in expedients for killing time , fashion is among the last influences under which a human being , who respects himself or who comprehends the great end of life , would desire to be placed . I use strong language , because I would combat the disposition , too common in the laboring mass , to regard what is called the upper class with envy or admiration . This disposition manifests itself among them in various forms . Thus , when one of their number prospers , he is apt to forget his old ac. // quaintance. and to work his way , if possible , into a more fashionajle caste . As far , indeed , as he extends his acquaintance among the intelligent , refined , generous and truly honorable , he makes a substantial improvement of his condition ; but if , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of favor intcr a circle , which has few claims , beyond those of greater luxury and show , and which bestows on him a patronizing , condescending notice , in exchange for his old , honorable influence among his original associates , he does anything but rise . Such is not the elevation I desire for the laborer . I do not desire him to struggle into another rank . Let him not be a servile copyist of other classes , but aim at something higher than has yet been realized in any body of men . Let him not associate the idea of dignity or honor with certain modes of living , or certain outward connexions . I would have every man stand on his own ground , and take his place among men according to personal endowments and worth , and not according to outward appendages ; and I would have every member of the community furnished with such means of improvement , that , if faithful to himself , he may need no outward appendage to attract the respect of all around bim . " Neither is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political action , with an attempt to monopolize , as a distinct class , the control of the powers of government ; and on this point Dr. Channing makes the following remarks , of which we regret to have to acknowledge the general truth-though we doubt not that the number of those among us , who do at the present period cultivate the science of politics in the lofty spirit , and with the noble aim , alluded to by him , is much larger than he probably supposes . We can only speak , of our own knowledge and observation , of the one side of the political contest now raging throughout the country , and can conscientiously declare that the animating spirit which now constitutes the health and strength of the Democratic party in the great movement of reform in which it is engaged- ( of the " politicians by profession " on either side we say nothing ) - is one of the purest philanthropy , enlightened by the clearest convictions of reason . Nor do we doubt that many of our opponents can with equal sincerity , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon the same questions , make the same declaration , though we think the general character of their present party movement and cause as sordid in its motive , and as unprincipled and factious in its ends , as we are firmly assured that its success would prove it pernicious in its tendency to the best interests of the country , and of the universal cause of democracy " I am sorry to say it , but the truth should be spoken , that , at the present moment , political action in this country does little to lift up any who are concerned in it . It stands in opposition to a high morality . Politics , indeed , regarded as the study and pursuit of the true , enduring good of a community , as the application of great unchangeable principles to public affairs , is a noble sphere of thought and action ; but politics , in its common sense , or considered as the invention of temporary shifts , as the playing of a subtle game , as the tactics of party for gaining power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men above another , is a paltry and debasing concern . The laboring class are sometimes stimulated to seek power as a class , and this it is thought will raise them . But no class as such should bear rule among us . All conditions of society should be represented in the government , and alike protected by it ; nor can anything be expected but disgrace to the individual and the country , from the success of any class in grasping at a monopoly of political power . // I would by no means discourage the attention of the people to politics . They ought to study in earnest the interests of the country , the principles of our institutions , the tendencies of public measures . But the unhappiness is , they do not study ; and , until they do , they can not rise by political action . A great amount of time , which , if well used , would form an enlightened population , is now wasted on newspapers and conversations which inflame the passions , which unscrupulously distort the truth , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which agitate the country for no higher end than a triumph over opponents ; and thus multitudes are degraded into men-worshippers or men-haters , into the dupes of the ambitious , or the slaves of a faction . To rise , the people must substitute reflection for passion . There is no other way . By these remarks , I do not mean to charge on the laboring class all the passionateness of the country . All classes partake of the madness , and all are debased by it . The fiery spirits are not confined to one portion of the community . The men whose ravings resound through the hall of Congress , and are then circulated through the country as eloquence , are not taken from among those who toil . Party prejudices break out as fiercely on the exchange , and even in the saloon , as in the workshop . The disease has spread everywhere . Yet it does not dishearten me , for I see that it admits of mitigation , if not of cure . I trust , that these lectures and other sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abate the fever of political excitement , by giving better occupation to the mind . Much , too , may be hoped from the growing self-respect of the people , which will make them shrink indignantly from the disgrace of being used as blinded partisans and unreflecting tools . Much also is to be hoped from the discovery , which must sooner or later be made , that the importance of government is enormously overrated , that it does not deserve all this stir , that there are vastly more effectual means of human happiness . Political institutions are to be less and less deified , and to shrink into a narrower space ; and just in proportion as a wiser estimate of government prevails , the present phrenzy of political excitement will be discovered and put to shame . " Having thus stated in what the contemplated elevation of the laboring mass does not consist-neither in exemption from manual toil , nor in the luxuries of fashionable rank , nor in mere political power , as a distinctive class-Dr . Channiug then proceeds to explain the Elevation of Soul to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first in Force of Thought exerted for the acquisition of Truth , secondly , in Force of Pure and Generous Feeling , thirdly , in Force of Moral Purpose . " " I say , every man is to be a student , a thinker . This does not mean , that he is to shut himself within four walls and bend body and mind over books . Men thought before books were written , and some of the greatest thinkers never entered what we call a study . Nature , Scripture , society , and life , present perpetual subjects for thought ; and the man who collects , concentrates , employs his faculties on any of these subjects far the purpose of getting the truth , is so far a student , a thinker , a philosopher , and is rising to the dignity of a man . It is time that we should cease to limit to professed scholars the titles of thinkers , philosophers . Whoever seeks truth with an earnest mind , no matter when or how , belongs to the school of intellectual men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said to think ; that is , a succession of ideas , notions , passes through their minds from morning to night ; but in as far as this discussion is passive , undirected , or governed only by accident and outward impulse , it has little more claim to dignity than the experience of the brute , who receives , with like passiveness , sensations from abroad , through his working hours . Such thought , if thought it may be called , having no aim , is as useless , as the vision // of an eye , which rests on nothing , which flies without pause over earth and sky , and of consequence receives no distinct image . Thought , in its true sense , is an energy of intellect . In thought , the mind not only receives impressions or suggestions from without or within , but re-acts upon them , collects its attention , concentrates its forces upon them , breaks them up and analyzes them like a living7aboratory , and then combines them anew , traces their connexions , and thus impresses itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe in which we live was plainly meant by God to stir up such thoughts as has now been described . It is full of difficulty and mystery , and can only be penetrated and unravelled by the concentration of the intellect . Every object , even the simplest in nature and society , every event of life , is made up of various elements subtly bound together ; so that to understand anything , we must reduce from its complexity to its parts and principles , and examine their relations to one another . Nor is this all . Everything , which enters the mind , not only contains a depth of mystery in itself , but is connected by a thousand ties with all other things . The universe is not a disorderly , disconnected heap , but a beautiful whole , stamped with unity , so as to be an image of the One Infinite Spirit . Nothing stands alone All things are knit together , each existing for all and all for each . The humblest ob1ect has infinite connexions . The vegetable , which you saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first plant which God made to grow on the earth , and was the product of the rains and sunshine of six thousand years . Such a universe demands thought to be understood ; and we are placed in it to think , to put forth the power within , to look beneath the surface of things , to look beyond particular facts and events to their causes and effects , to their reasons and ends , their mutual influences , their diversities and resemblances , their proportions and harmonies , an the general laws which bind them together .. This is what I mean by thinking ; and by such thought the mind rises to a dignity , which humbly represents the greatness of the Divine intellect ; that is , it rises more and more to consistency of views , to broad general principles , to universal truths , to glimpses of the order and harmony and infinity of the Divine system , and thus to a deep , enlightened veneration of the Infinite Father . Do not be startled , as if I were holding out an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all thinking , which aims honestly and earnestly to see things as they are , to see them in their connexions , and to bring the loose , conflicting ideas of the mind into consistency and harmony , all such thinking , no matter in what sphere , is an approach to the dignity of which I speak . You are all capable of the thinking which I recommend . You have all practised it in a degree . The child , who casts an inquiring eye on a new toy , and breaks it to pieces that he may discover the mysterious cause of its movements , has begun the work of which I speak , has begun to be a philosopher , has begun to penetrate the unknown , to seek consistency and harmony of thought ; and let him go on as he has begun , and make it one great business of life to inquire into the elements , connexions , and reasons of whatever he witnesses in his own breast , or in society , or in outward nature , and , be his condition what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and force ' of thought , to a breadth and unity of views , which will be to him an inward revelation and promise of the intellectual greatness for which he was created . " But it is only in the spirit of the Love of Truth that force of thought should be exerted , or can be cultivated to any valuable end . It may be prostituted to mean and selfish motives , and in the cause of Falsehood and Wrong . " But energy of thought , so employed , is suicidal . The intellect , in becoming a pander to vice , a tool of the passions , an advocate of lies , becomes not only degraded , but diseased . It loses the capacity of distinguishing truth from falsehood , good from evil , right from wrong ; it becomes as worthless as an eye which can not die tinguish // between colors or forms . Wo to that mind which wants the love of truth ! For want of this , genius has become a scourge to the world , its breath a poisonous exhalation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Truth is the light of the Infinite Mind , and the image of God in his creatures . Nothing endures hut truth . The dreams , fictions , theories which men would substitute for it , soon die . Without its guidance effort is vain , and hope baseless . Accordingly , the love of truth , a deep thirst for it , a deliberate purpose to seek it and hold it fast , may be considered as the very foundation of human culture and dignity . Precious as thought is , the love of truth is still more precious ; for without it , thought wanders and wastes itself , and precipitates men into guilt and misery . There is no greater defect in education and the pulpit , than that they inculcate so little an impartial , earnest , reverential love of truth , a readiness to toil , to live and die for it . Let the laboring man be imbued in a measure with this spirit ; let him learn to regard himself as endowed with the power of thought , for the very end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as more precious than his daily bread ; and the spring of true and perpetual elevation is touched within him . He has begun to be a man ; he becomes one of the elect of his race . Nor do I despair of this elevation of the laborer . Unhappily little , almost nothing has been done as yet , to inspire either rich or poor with the love of truth for its own sake , or for the life , and inspiration , and dignity it gives to the soul . The prosperous have as little of it as the laboring mass . I think , indeed , that the spirit of luxurious , fashionable life is more hostile to it than the hardships of the poor . Under a wise culture this spirit may be awakened in all classes , and wherever awakened , it will form philosophers , successful and noble thinkers . These remarks seem to me particularly important , as showing how intimate a union subsists between the moral and intellectual nature , and how both must work together from the beginning . All human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disinterested spirit , on a willingness to make sacrifices to the truth . Without this moral power , mere force of thought avails nothing towards our elevation . " After a brief but comprehensive allusion to the vast range of objects of thought presented to the mind of the humble son of toil in that physical world which is the sphere of his daily labor , he next speaks of the spiritual world of which the former is but the shadow , though every human being possesses in his own nature the key to all the various sciences into which we are wont to classify it , formidable as seems the list which embraces theology , metaphysics , moral philosophy , political science , history , literature . Without a specific knowledge of what has been thought and written in regard to the spiritual naturewithout becoming an 3*ncyclopedia-all men are capable of comprehending and feeling the Great Ideas in which all discoveries terminate , which sum up all sciences , and which the philosopher extracts from infinite details . For example , says the author : " I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the writings of the Fathers , in the history of sects , &amp;c. , &amp;c. ; nor is this needful . All theology , scattered as it is through countless volumes , is summed up in the idea of God ; and let this idea shine bright and clear in the laborer 's soul , and he has the essence of theological libraries , and a far higher light than has visited thousands of renowned divines . A great mind is formed by a few great ideas , not by an infinity of loose details . I have known very learned men , who seemed to me very poor in intellect , because they had no grand thoughts . What avails it , that a man has studied never so minutely the histories of Greece and Rome , if the Great Ideas of vOL . VII . NO. xxx. - JIJNE , 1840 . K it // Freedom , and Beauty , and Valor , and Spiritual Energy have not been kindled by these records into living fires in his soul . The illumination of an age does not consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad and noble principles , of which that knowledge is the foundation and inspirer . The truth is , that the most laborious and successful student is confined in his researches to a very few of God 's works ; but this limited knowledge of things may still suggest universal laws , broad principles , grand ideas , and these elevate the mind . There are certain thoughts , principles , ideas , which , by their nature ' , rule over all knowledge , which are intrinsically glorious , quickening , all-comprehending , eternal , and with these I desire to enrich the mind of the laborer and of every human being . " After assigning the first place to the great idea of God , the Parent Mind , the Primitive and Infinite Intelligence-of which he truly says that , " this one idea , expanded in the breast of the laborer , is a germ of elevation , more fruitful than all science , no matter how extensive or profound , which treats only of outward finite things " - he continues in the following grand strain of lofty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , I proceed to another grand one , that of Man , of human nature ; and this should he the object of serious , intense thought . Few men know as yet what a man is . They know his clothes , his complexion , his property , his rank , his follies and his outward life . But the thought of his inward being , his proper humanity , has hardly dawned on multitudes ; and yet who can live a man 's life , that does not know what is the distinctive worth of a human being 3 It is interesting to observe , how faithful men generally are to their idea of a man ; how they act up to it . Spread the notion , that courage is true manhood , and how many will die rather than fall short of that standard ; and hence , the true idea of a man , brought out in the laborer 's mind , elevates him above every other class who may want it . Am I asked for my conception of the dignity of a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , in that spiritual principle , called sometimes the Reason , sometimes the Conscience , which rising above what is local and temporary , discerns immutable truth , and everlasting right ; which , in the midst of imperfect things , conceives of Perfection ; which is universal and impartial , standing in direct opposition to the partial , selfish principles of human nature ; which says to me with authority , that my neighbor is as precious as myself , and his rights as sacred as my own ; which commands me to receive all truth , however it may war with my pride , and to do all justice , howqver it may conflict with my interest ; and which calls me to rejoice with love in all that is beautiful , good , holy , happy in whatever being these attributes may be found . This principle is a ray of Divinity in man . We do not know what man is , till something of the celestial grandeur of this principle in the soul be discerned . There is another grand view of man , included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . He is a Free being ; created to act from a spring in his own breast , to form himself and to decide his own destiny ; connected intimately with nature , but not enslaved to it ; connected still more strongly with God , yet not enslaved even to the Divinity , but having power to render or withhold the service due to his Creator ; encompassed by a thousand warring forces , by physical elements which inflict pleasure and pain , by dangers seen and unseen , by the influences of a tempting , sinful world , yet endued by God with power to contend with all , to perfect himself by conflict with the very forces which threaten to overwhelm him . Such is the idea of a man . Happy he in whom it is unfolded by earnest thought . " Had I time I should be glad to speak of other great ideas belonging to the science of mind , and which sum up and give us , in one bright expression , the speculations of ages . The idea of Human Life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * as the absolute and ultimate good ; the idea of Liberty , . which is the // highest thought of political science , and which , by its intimate presence to the minds of the people , is the chief spring of our country 's life and greatness-all these might be enlarged on ; and I might show how these may be awakened in the laborer , and may give him an elevation which many who are above labor want . But , leaving all these , I will only refer to another , one of the most important results of the science of mind , and which the laborer , in common with every man , may and should receive , and should strengthen by patient thought . It is the Idea of his importance as an Individual . He is to understand that he has a value , not as belonging to a community , and contributing to a general good which is distinct from himself , but on his own account . He is not a mere part of a machine . In a machine the parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , for which alone they subsist . Not so a man . He is not simply a means , but an end , and exists for his own sake , for the unfolding of his nature , for his own virtue and happiness . True , he is to work for others , but not servilely , not with a broken spirit , not so as to degrade himself ; he is to work for others from a wise self-regard , from principles of justice and benevolence , and in the exercise of a free will and intelligence , by which his own character is perfected . His individual dignity , not derived from birth , from success , from wealth , from outward show , but consisting in the indestructible principles of his soul , this ought to enter into his habitual consciousness . I do . not speak rhetorically or use the cant of rhapsodists , but I utter my calm , deliberate conviction , when I say , that the laborer ought to regard himself with a self-respect unknown to the proudest monarch who rests on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean by the Great Ideas which exalt the mind . Their worth and power can not be exaggerated . They are the mightiest influences on earth . One great thought breathed into a man may regenerate him . The idea of Freedom in ancient and modern republics , the idea of Inspiration in various religious sects , the idea of Immortality , howizave these triumphed over worldly interests ! How many heroes and martyrs have they formed ! Great ideas are mightier than the passions . To awaken them is the highest office of education . As yet it has been little thought of . The education of the mass of the people has consisted in *iving them mechanical habits , in breaking them to current usages and modes of . hinking , in teaching religion and morality as traditions . It is time that a rational culture should take place of the mechanical ; that men should learn to act more from ideas and principles , and less from blind impulse and undiscerning imitation . " The preceding quotations are from the first of the two Lectures we have referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted to indulge in them renders it necessary to leave for a second notice , in our next Number , the other Lecture , in which Dr. Channing considers several of the objections commonly advanced against the practicableness of the general elevation spoken of for the laboring mass of society , and of some of the circumstances that now tend to favor it . As they are the last , so do we consider these discourses as the best , of the writings of their illustrious author ; and replete as they are with pregnant democratic truth , and animated with the purest and wisest philanthropy , we regard them as far better entitled than the stateliest quarto that the press could produce on any other subject , to fill a large portion of the pages of this work  --  to which we only regret the impossibility of transferring them in their entire length and completexiess.
