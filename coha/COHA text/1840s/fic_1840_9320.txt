Main text Fragment George H. Calvert . Old Officer . Old Officer . My general , I know this people well ; And all the virtues which Old England claims , As the foundations of her happiness And greatness  --  such as reverence of law And custom , prudence , female chastity , And with them , independence , fortitude , Courage , and sturdiness of purpose  --  have Been here transplanted from their native soil , And flourish undegenerate . From these  --  Sources exhaustible but with the life That feeds them  --  their severe intents take birth , And draw the lusty sustenance to mould The limbs and body of their own fulfilment , So that performance lag not after purpose . They are our countrymen . They are , as well In manly resolution as in blood , The children of our fathers . Washington Doth know no other language than the one We speak : and never did an English tongue Give voice unto a larger , wiser mind . You 'll task your judgment vainly to point out , Through all this desp'rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in execution . He In spirit is unconquerable , as In genius perfect . Side by side I fought With him in that disastrous enterprise Where rash young Braddock fell ; and there I mark 'd The vet'ran 's skill contend for mastery With youthful courage in his wondrous deeds . Well might the bloody Indian warrior pause , Amid his massacre confounded , and His baffled rifle 's aim , till then unerring , Turn from " that tall young man , " and deem in awe That the Great Spirit hover 'd over him ; For he , of all our mounted officers , Alone came out unscathed from that dread carnage , To guard our shatter 'd army 's swift retreat . For years did his majestic form hold place Upon my mind , stamp 'd in that perilous hour , In th'image of a strong-arm 'd friend , until I met him next as a resistless foe . ' T was at the fight near Princeton . In quick march , Victorious o'er his van , onward we press 'd ; When , moving with firm pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter 'd us . One moment paused th'opposing hosts , and then The rattling volley hid the death it bore : Another , and the sudden cloud , uproll 'd , Display 'd , midway between the adverse lines , His drawn sword gleaming high , the chief , as though That crash of deadly music , and the burst Of sulphurous vapour , had from out the earth Summon 'd the god of war . Doubly exposed , He stood unharm 'd . Like eagles tempest-borne Rush 'd to his side his men ; and had our souls And arms with twofold strength been braced , we yet Had not withstood that onset . Thus does he Keep ever with occasion even step ; Now warily before our eager speed Retreating , tempting us with battle 's promise Only to toil us with a vain pursuit ; Now wheeling rapidly about our flanks , Startling our ears with sudden peal of war , And fronting in the thickest of the fight The common soldier 's death , stirring the blood Of faintest hearts to deeds of bravery By his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
