txt THE style of this book we do not like . It is , indeed , frequently eloquent , and has a majestic march ; but these merits are not suflicient to atone for the lack of simplicity . There is a uniform strain for elevation which wearies us . We find ourselves wishing that the author would come down from his stilts , and walk with us easily and naturally . It would be injustice to say of the style that it is grandiloquent ; yet , at times , it almost deserves the name . The form of expression is often too lofty and stately for the thought . There seems to he an habitual endeavor , not merely to express , but to exaggerate the ideas by words . rllhe main doctrine of the hook , viz. , that the whole complex person of Jesus Christ suffered in the work of atonement-in the humiliation , poverty , privation and anguish of the whole redemptive work , or , as our author expresses it , suffered in his divine as well as in his human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine , which the Scriptures , in their fair and obvious meaning , abundantly teach . We think this to be the doctrine which the great body of Christians who have no theory to support , have received from the Scriptures , so that the opposite doctrine commonly and plainly promulged would surprise them more than this surprises theologians . We believe this to be the teaching of theologians themselves , when they lose sight of philosophical theories , and are intent with single eye on presenting the work of atonement in its true greatness and dignity . We believe moreover , that it is a doctrine of great practical importance . And therefore we feel arid express gratitude to the venerable and eminent layman , who , in expectation of much opposition and i-eproach , has sustained it by a candid , earnest , able , and , in most respects , thorough discussion . Our object now is , not to give a particular review of this book , though * The Sufferings of Christ . By a Layman . Second edition , revised and enlarged - New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that we , in this article , denotes only the writer and those who agree with him . While the question presented is considered by the gentlemen who are jointly responsible with the editor for the New Englander , an open one , which may he properly and profitably discussed , they do not agree in wishing this article to be considered as an expression of their views . // we shall occasionally refer to it , but , having commended it to public attention and respect , to discuss , in our own way , the doctrine it advocates. * This doctrine certainly is no heresy . All must acknowledge that , if true , it gives a far higher idea than its opposite , of the atonement , and of the evangelical truths connected therewith , such as the evil and guilt of sin , the value of the divine law , the necessity of propitiation , and the divine justice and goodness . Any one , therefore , who , with the reverent spirit , and the candor and courtesy manifested by our author , endeavors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motives , especially a strong love of the doctrines of the cross ; and he deserves kindness rather than the severity with which , in some quarters , he has been treated . In our discussion of the subject , we shall confine our remarks mainly to these three positions , which , if substantiated , will be quite conclusive. 1 . That the fair and obvious meaning ( the meaning which the popular mind naturally attaches to the language ) of those passages , which declare the privations and sufferings of Jesus Christ , is , that the whole complex person designated by that name suffered ; and that this meaning is to be received as the true meaning , unless there is some sufficient reason for setting it aside and adopting some other possible meaning . * We learn with pleasure that , although it is but a short time since the hook under review was published , yet the first edition has already been sold , and a second is passing off with such rapidity , that a third will undoubtedly be called for during the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the doctrine of the work has been advocated by several of our religious Q*uarierlies , * articularly the Christian Review , the iblical Repository , and the Oberlin Review . 2 . That there are no sufficient reasons for selling aside this meaning . And 3 . That there are decisive reasons for adopting this meaning , exclusive of the fact that it is the plain and obvious one . It is the interpretation demanded by the exigency of the case , by the purpose for which the sufferings of Christ were appointed . I. Under our first position , we will consider two classes of passagesthose which affirm suffering of Jesus Christ , the name given to the complex person ; and those which affirm suffering of that person under the name of God or its equivalents . The following are some of the passages in which privation , sacrifice , suffering , is ascribed to Christ . We take them as we find them compactly arranged in the work before us . " Before I ( Christ ) suffer . " - Luke xxii , 15 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 26 . " Thus it behooved Christ to suffer . " - Luke xxiv , 46 . God before showed " that Christ should suffer . " - Acts iii , 18 . " Opening and alledging that Christ must needs have suffered . " - Acts xvii , 3 . " That Christ should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead . " - Acts xxvi , 23 . " If so be that we suffer with him " ( Christ ) . - Romans viii , 17 . " For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us. " -1 Corinthians v , 7 . " For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us. " -2 Corinthians i , 5 . " For he bath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin. ** -2 Corinthians v , 21 . " And the life which I now live in the flesh , I live by the faith of the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me. " - Galatians ii , 20 . " Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being made a curse for us. " - Galatians iii , 13 . " As Christ also bath loved us , and bath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God . " - Ephesians v , 2. // " Even as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself for it . " - Ephesians v , 25 . " That I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings . " - Philippians iii , 10 . " To make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings . " - Hebrews ii , 10 . " For in that he himself ( Christ ) hath suffered , being tempted . " - Hebrews ii , 18 . " Though he were a Son , yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered . " - Hebrews v , 8 . " For then must he ( Christ ) often have suffered since the foundation of the world . " - Hebrewsix , 26 . " Wherefore Jesus also , that he might sanctify the people with his own blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 12 . " When it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ . " -1 Peter i , 11 . " Christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example . " -1 Peter ii , 21 . " When he ( Christ ) suffered , he threatened not . " -1 Peter ii , 23 . " Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree . " -1 Peter ii , 24 . " For Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust . " -1 Peter iii , 18 . " Forasmuch , then , as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh . " -1 Peter iv , 1 . " As ye are partakers of Christ 's sufferings . " - 1 Peter iv , 13 . " WI10 am also an elder , and a witness of the sufferings of Christ . " -1 Peter v , 1 . Now , plainly , we ought to judge , that what is here predicated of the person called Jesus Christ , is predicated of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the passages themselves , or in the nature of the predicate , which forbids us to apply it to his whole person , and confines it to a part of his complex nature . This is too plain for argument . Jesus Christ appeared before men one person . He spoke , he acted , he spoke of himself , as a unity . He was , indeed , a complex person , of two united natures , yet one per VOL . V. 54 son . The second person of the Trinity , a divine spirit , dwelt , by wonderful condescension , with a human spirit , in a human body , and to all appearance , was as closely connected with that body , as was the human spirit . There is no intimation in the Scriptures that this apparent truth was not real truth . The body was the body of the divine spirit , as truly as of the human spirit . And the complex person , thus marvelously constituted , appeared , and was , one person . Now , when anything is affirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name given to that person , we ought to judge that it is affirmed of the whole person , unless there is some decisive reason in the language of the affirmation , or in the nature of the affirmation , that limits it to one of the united natures . Such decisive reason there is , in many instances , given now in the one , and now in the other , and sometimes in both of these modes . When the affirmation is made of Christ that he " is over all , God blessed forever , " ( Rom. 9 : 5 , ) both the language and the nature of the affirmation limit it to the divinity of Christ . The name God , and the predicate of supreme power , both decisively evince that the divine part , and that only , of the complex person called Christ , is the subject of this declaration . When it is said of Christ , ( 1 John 5 : 20 , ) " This is the true God , " the language teaches us that the divine nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ , such as omniscience , eternal preexistence , omnipresence , the creation of the worlds , and universal dominion , the nature of the predicate limits us to the divine part of his nature as its subject . So when it is affirmed of Christ , ( Luke 2 : 52 , ) that he " increased in wisdom , and stature , and in favor with God and man , " the nature of the affirmation confines it to the human part of his complex person . Thus we often have ' decisive // reason either in the language , or the nature , of predicates made of Christ , or in both , to limit them to one or the other of his united natures ; and we say with propriety and force to the Unitarian , or to the Monophysite of whatever kind , our doctrine that Christ was a complex person , a divine spirit and a human spirit dwelling in a human body , is the one which the Bible teaches : for it is the only one which harmonizes the declarations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradictory and absurd . But if no such reason is , in any way , given for limitation , then we are to interpret passages which speak of Christ , as speaking of his whole person . The scriptures , then , already quoted , and others like them , affirming that the Christ suffered , prove that he suffered in his whole person , in both natures , unless there can be alledged a decisive reason for limiting their affirmation of suffering to his human nature . Any interpreter , who , without such reason , says of such passages , this refers to the human nature of Christ , and that refers to his divine nature , interprets arbitrarily , and contrary to rational laws . On this point our author speaks with truth and force , when he says , p. 97- " The prevalent theory might as well seek to exclude the participation of the divinity from any other department of the mediatorial office , as from its suffering department . The Bible declares that Christ went about preaching the " gospel of the kingdom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles . The Bible declares that Christ suffered for the redemption of the world . Each declaration designates the Actor by the name of Christ , or one of its synonymes . Each declaration is couched in the same unequivocal terms , without exception , restriction , or qualification . Each declaration pervades the united natures of the Messiah . The prevalent theory has singled out the pains of the suffering department as the sole subject of its exclusion of divine participation . Why this distinction ? There is the same scriptural evidence of the participation of the God in the mediatorial sufferings , as there is of the participation of the God in the preaching of the gospel or the working of the miracles . If the mediatorial Preacher of the gospel was the God-man in his united natures ; if the mediatorial Worker of the miracles was the God-man in his united natures , so must the mediatonal Sufferer have been the God-man in his united natures . Any distinction is arbitrary . It has no scriptural authority . " Let those therefore who would thus restrict these scri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The burden of proof is *n them . Whether the reasons that have been adduced are valid , we will consider when we come to our second position . Previously , as in order bound , we must consider the second class of passages before mentioned-those which affirm suffering of Christ , in phraseology which indicates the divine nature of the sufferer . " Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to alt the flock over which the Holy Ghost bath made you overseers , to feed the church of God , * which he hath purchased with his own blood . " - Acts 20 : 28 . " And killed the Prince of life . " - Acts 3:15 . " The y .... crucified the Lord of glory . " -1 Cor. 2 : 8 . We will not say concerning these , that there could be no reason strong enough to oblige us to limit their affirmation of suffering to the human nature of Christ . If we had positive knowledge that it is impossible for the divine nature to suffer , we should feet compelled to interpret with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression infelicitous , and liable to the objection of infidels , that the Bible , interpreted as other books , teaches known impossibilities . Certainly , * We are aware that some readings of the Greek text give xu*'ou , ( Lord , ) instead of 3iou , ( God . ) This is the reading of Griesbach , who also rejects the common reading translated , " God manifest in the flesh . " But Siou is the received text , is maintained by most respectable critics , and is , we believe , the true text . // the presumption against such limitation is very strong , much stronger than in the class of cases already considered . Here are the plain assertions that the Prince of life , not the mere man Jesus , or the human part of the Christ , but the Prince ( **ijyog , the Author , as WahI renders it ) of life , was killed , i. e. suffered the pain of death ; that the Lord of glory , ( an expression equivalent to the " King of glory " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory ? Jehovah , strong and mighty , Jehovah mighty in battle . Jehovah of hosts , he is the King of glory , " ) - that the Lord of glory was crucified , i. e. suffered the pains of crucifixion ; and that God purchased the church by his own blood , i. e. by the suffering of a bloody death . Surely it must be a strong reason indeed , which can compel us to set aside these plain and forcible declarations from the divine nature of Christ , which alone constituted him God , the Prince of life , and the Lord of glory , and confine them to his human nature , which contributed not at all to justify the application to him of those titles . The criticism that attempts it , without the strictest necessity , seems to us audacious . Where is that strict necessity ? In what does it consist ? That there is none , we shall soon endeavor to prove . To say , as has been said , that the blood , with which the incarnate God purchased the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he had no other blood , is to give no proof that it was in his human nature only that he shed his blood , nor any disproof at all that the divine nature suffered , in the shedding of the blood of that body which was the common tabernacle of the divine and human spirits . Just as reasonably we might say , that the blood of the man Christ Jesus was blood which flowed from his bodyfor he had no other blood-and think that thus we had proved that the suffering was confined to the body , because , forsooth , the human spirit has no blood to be shed , as it has not , any more than the divine spirit . The wounds were indeed inflicted upon the body ; but the sense of suffering was in the spiritual nature which that body enshrined . And to say that this suffering was confined to one of the spiritual natures enshrined therein , the human , and did not exist at all in the other , which , apparently , was connected by equal ties of sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nay , it is an assertion against proof , contrary to the obvious meaning of the passage , which declares that the blood , by which the church was purchased , was the blood of God . Nor is the contradiction which these passages give to the theory that the divinity of Christ did not suffer , in the least removed by saying , as has been said , that Christ being both God and man in one per . son , his person may be truly designated by either appellation . For , though it is true that his person , his whole person , may be designated by either appellation , it is not true that one part of his person as distinguished from the other may be properly designated by either appellation . It can not be so designated without self-contradiction . This theory , so far as suffering is concerned , separates the divine part of the person from the human , asserts that the human only suffered , and yet says that the part which suffered may be designated by the term God ; 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be called God ! This will not answer at all . Suppose that in the passage which asserts that Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature , we should substitute for the name Jesus the name God , so so that the assertion would be , that God increased in wisdom and in stature , how could such a passage be vindicated from the charge of // teaching a self-contradiction and absurdity ? It does seem to us , that the criticism , which will , to support a theory , substitute a human for a divine title , virtually put the word man in the place of the word God , change the declaration that God purchased the church with his own blood , into the declaration that the man in the complex person of Christ Jesus purchased the church with his blood , is lawless enough to suit the boldest latitudinarian , in the work of bending to his uses the most stubborn passages of Holy Writ . Suz'ely , unless we are positively forbidden , by some sufficient prohibition , from giving the meaning which seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " killed the prince of life , " " crucified the Lord of glory , " " the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood , " we must believe that the divine , as well as human , part of Christ suffered in the expiatory sacrifice . There are other passages of which we will quote a few , that are perhaps equally decisive , though they do not apply divine titles to the sufferer . Phil . ii , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , " Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus , who being in the form of God thought it not robbery ( a*ra*iot ' - a thing to be eagerly seized and held ) to he equal with God , hut made himself of no reputation ( emptied himself ) and took upon him the form of a servant , and was made in the likeness of men : and being found in fashion as a man , he humbled himself and became obedient unto death , even the death of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for our sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich . " Rom. viii , 32 , " He that spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , " &amp;c . John iii , 16 , 17 , " For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son , that whoso ever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life . " The language applied to him who is the subject of these passages , is as decisive of his preexistent and divine character as the title of Deity could be . Who was he , who became obedient unto death , the painful death of the cross ? It was He who was in the form of God , and who was equal with God . lie , thinking this equality not to be eagerly retained in view of , a perishing world , which , by the sacrifice , might be redeemed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a servant and the fashion of a man - He gave himself to the death of the cross . He , who became poor , that we through his poverty might be rich , is lie who was rich , rich in the possession of the throne and wealth of the universe , and in the service and praises of the principalities of heaven . He whom God spared not , but gave as a sacrifice for the world 's redemption , was his only begotten Son , sent , given up from a preexistent state of equality and companionship with himself . Surely , it must be a very strong reason which will suffice , if indeed any reason can suffice , to set aside the meaning on the face of such language as this , viz. , that the Son of God , the second person of the Trrinity , gave himself , and was given , to a life and death of humiliation , poverty and suffering , and make it mean that , not He , but the human nature only with which he was connected endured this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious language of those revelations respecting the condescension and compassion and love and costly sacrifice of God and his Son , which have ever filled his people with mingled amazement and delight . II . Having thus considered the obvious meaning of those portions of Holy Writ , which declare the sufferings of Christ , we come now to our // second position , that there is no sufficient reason for setting aside this obvious meaning , and for limiting these affirmations of suffering to the human nature of Christ . And here we may as well attend , in the outset , to an alledged fact , which is supposed to constitute a strong presumption that there are such reasons , the fact that the Christian church have very generally given this limited interpretation to these portions of Scripture . Were this alledged fact real , it would furnish a strong , though not invincible , presumption that there are such reasons . A general opinion of men , especially a general opinion of good men , of Christian people , is entitled to great respect . Its universal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And therefore an individual , who has formed an opposite opinion , should , both in modesty and reason , before he gives it utterarce or publication , subject it to suspicion , and to thorough and repeated examination . But , as has been already intimated , we do not believe this alledged fact to be real . We deny that it is , or has been , the general opinion of the church , that Christ 's sufferings were confined to his human nature . On this point the author of the book before us has , in our view , made a mistaken concession , which throws suspicion on his doctrine , and arrays against it a strong presumption . In stately phrase , he speaks of the opposite doctrine , as that " spiritual structure which has extended over continents its vast dimensions , and grown gray under the frosts of almost fifteen hundred years ! Ever since its erection , it has been the abode of the chief portion of the piety of Christendom . In its many chambers , devotion has for ages uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accents . From its lofty turrets for near fifteen centuries , have triumphantly ascended joyous groups of the spirits of just men made perfect ? ' Every where , throughout his book , he calls this " the prevalent theory . " Neither candor , nor truth , require him thus to admit , what skill in argument requires him , if he truly can , to deny . We the more wonder at this , because in his book , particularly in the Appendix , he has collected materials , on which he could have firmly founded such a denial . Of these we shall make free use in our argument . They are such as our own conclusion respecting the belief of the church has long rested upon with satisfaction . The three following positions can , we think , be easily substantiatedthat the great body of the church , those who have read the Scriptures without any theory in mind respecting the passibility of the divine nature , have understood them to teach , and have believed , that Christ suffered in his divine as well as human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferings extended to his divine nature ; and that those theologians , who , constrained by their theory that God is impassible , have affirmed that Christ 's sufferings were confined to his human nature , have , when they have had the scriptural representations more than their theory in mind , and have been endeavoring to give those representations their legitimate effect , affirmed the opposite doctrine . The first of these positions we re * , ard the most important . For on a matter of such common interest as the sufferings of the Redeemer , constituting as it does , the burden of the New Testament , we had rather trust the great body of the church than its philosophers and scientific interpreters . Our own observation of the impression which people generally receive from the Scriptures ( and our observation has been directed to this point for some years ) has al . // most uniformly taught us that that impression is very decided that Christ suffered in his divine nature ; that he came from heaven on purpose to suffer ; that it is this suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gratitude as a marvelous exhibition of divine love and condescension ; and that it is this chiefly , which constitutes the infinite costliness of the sacrifice for sin . Any one who has listened to the prayers of the sanctuary , or of any place " where prayer is wont to be made , " will not remember one among the many suppliants , who , when , with devout heart , he has endeavored to express , in the language of adoration and thanksgiving , his sense of God 's unspeakable gift of his Son to humiliation and privation and the atoning death of the cross , has chilled and impoverished the whole by any intimation or implication that the divinity of Christ was exempt from suffering . On the contrary , he will remember that the burden of the adoration and thanksgiving which the powers of language strove , earnestly but inadequately , to express , was the idea of suffering and dying Deity . Not more decisive , but more available for our purpose of indicating the general sentiment , because recorded and capable of quotation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the church , in all its branches , from age to age , has wafted heavenward its tuneful and sincere praise . Copious extracts , bearing on the subject in dispute , our author has introduced into his Appendix , from the devotional manuals of various Christian churches . We have ioom for a few specimens only . " Well may the earth , astonished , shako , And nature sympathize , The sun as darkest night be black , Their Maker , Jesus , dies . Well might the sun in darkness hide , And stint his glories in , When God , the mighty Maker , died For man the creature 's sin . Oh , how I hate those lusts of mine , That crucified my God . Oh ! the sweet wonders of that cross , Where God , the Savior , lov 'd and died ! There my God bore all my guilt . Agonizing in the garden , Lo ! your Maker prostrate lies . God , who did your souls retrieve , Died himself that ye might live . Jehovah , in thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me hath died , My Lord , my love , is crucified . Wash 'd in the sanctifying blood Of an expiring Deity . I thirst for a life-giving God , A God that on Calvary died . He that distributes crowns and thrones hangs on a tree , and bleeds , and groans : The Prince of life resigns his breath ; The King of glory bows in death . " Now what better testimony can we have of the general sentiment of the Christian church , than this familiar and beloved language of psalmody from the lips and hearts of its members in all its wide-extended departments ? In the language of the work before us , " the melodies of the general church read and sung for ages , and pervading all its denominations , are the irrepressible outpourings of pious feeling ; they are the comments of unschooled devotion upon the plain language of Holy Writ The godly heart is often a better scriptural commentator than the learned head . " However this may be , these sacred songs express the real sentiments of those who utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is poetry- It has been said concerning these hymns adduced for this purpose , that we are not to subject the language of poetry and eloquence to the same rules of criticism as those which are applied to didactic discourse . True . And it is just as true , that poetry is a mode , a very efficient mode of expressing truth . It is often used for " didactic " purposes , especially for teaching those truths which are fitted to // kindle the feelings . That it has , in this way , more influence on a peo. pie than their laws , is proverbial . Are the Psalms never quoted as proof and expression of religious truth ? And are not Watts 's metrical versions of those Psalms the best exposition of them ever written ? We say of the metaphors of the Bible that they mean something , and teach something , Universalists notwithstanding . So we say of the poetry of the church . And when it declares that " God , " " Jehovah , " " the mighty Maker , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it means what it says , and not something different toto ccelo . It does not mean merely that the suffering , agonizing , and dying , were endured by a man in juxtaposition with a divine nature which is entirely unaffected thereby . It can not be made thus to mean , except by an interpretation so latitudinarian as to nullify the text . Our second position in proof that the general sentiment accords with the doctrine that the divine nature suffered in the sufferings of Christ , viz , that able theologians , interpreters of the Bible , have taught the same , is sufficiently substantiated by the following extracts from Chalmers and Harris and Vinet , which we take , as we find them in the book before us . Had we room for quotation , we could greatly add to their number . " We apprehend that the theism of nature and of science has taken unwarrantable freedoms with the theism of the Bible ; attaching a mere figurative sense to all that is spoken there of the various affections of the Deity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to our world , of the warmth and power to move and to engage , that prop . erly belong to them . It represents God as altogether impassive ; as made up of little more than of understanding and of power ; as having no part in that system of emotions which occupies so wide a space in the constitution of man , made after his own image and according to his own likeness . " * * * * " The Father sent his Son , for our sake , to the humiliation and the agony of a painful sacrifice . There is evident stress laid in the Bible on Jesus Christ being his only Son , and his only beloved Son . This is conceived to enhance the surrender ; to aggravate , as it were , the cost of having given up unto the death so near and so dear a relative . In that memorable verse where it is represented that God so loved the world as to send his only begotten Son into it , I bid you mark well the emphasis that lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect of painful surrender , between his giving up another , more distantly , as it were , connected with him , and his giving up one who stood to him in such close and affecting relationship . The kin that he hath to Christ is the measure of the love that he manifested to the world , in giving up Christ as the propitiation fur the world 's sins . What is this to say but that , in this great and solemn mystery , the Parent was put to the trial of his firmness ? that , in tue act of doing so , there was a soreness , and a suffering , and a struggle in the bosom of the Divinity ? that a something was felt like that which an earthly father feels when he devotes the best and the dearest of his family to some high object of patriotism ? God , in sparing him not , but in giving him up unto the death for us all , sustained a conflict between pity for his child and love for that world for whom he bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vials of his wrath on the head of his only beloved Son , in awaking the sword of offended justice against his fellow ; in laying upon him the whole burden of that propitiation , by which the law could be magnified and its transgresso rs could be saved I in holding forth on the cross of Christ this blended demonstration of his love and his holiness , and thus enduring the spectacle of his tears and of his agonies and cries till the full atonement was rendered ; and not till it was finished did the meek and gentle sufferer give up the ghost . At that time , when angels , looking down from the high battlements of heaven , would have flown to rescue the Son of God from the hands of persecutors , think you that God himself was the only unconcerned and unfeeling spectator ? or that , in consenting to these cruel sufferings of his Son for the world , he did not make his love to that world its strongest and most substantial testimony .

While walking the earth in the form of a servant , he could still affirm , My Father is in me and I in him ' - ' I and my Father are one . ' " " The love of God , then , invites onr adoration , not only as it at first sent his only begotten Son ; during every moment of the Savior 's sojourn on earth that love was repeating its gift , was making an infinite sacrifice for sinners ; while every pang he endured in the prosecution of his work was the infliction of a wound in the very heart of paternal love .

That long contest* if I may dare to say it , that agony of God for generations , that painful birth by which humanity was brought forth to the life of heaven , has been revealed to him in the ancient dispensation ; he has been shown the very steps of God impressed upon the dust of ages , and mingled with the foot-prints of the human race ; but at the trace which God has left on the rock of Calvary , the rock of his heart is broken , the veil of his understanding torn away. * We will only add on this point , ( the addition may be deemed of little worth-so let it be , ) that we have frequently , during a few years past , inquired of many ministers and students in theology for the cbnvict ions with which the language of the Bible on this subject has impressed them , and have ascertained that they were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even those who have held the philosophy that God can not suffer , and , constrained by that philosophy , have taught , formally , that the divine nature of Christ took no part in his sufferings , when , in their earnestness to set forth the atoning sufferings in their real greatness and worth , they have lost sight of their philosophy , and have spoken out , unschooled and unrestrained , the impressions naturally received from the plain language of the Bible , they have , in full and express terms , asserted the doctrine we advocate . This is our last position on this topic of the general sentiment of the church . The proof of it may be found in practical sermons on the sufferings of Christ , the great salvation , the worth of the soul as evinced by the cost of its redemption , and man 's obligations of gratitude for redeeming love , preached by any of those qwq who hold the dogma of divine impassibility . We venture to say , that they are adapted to produce the full impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , both in his divine and human natures . The proof may be found also , abundantly , in their puhlished discourses . We will quote a few from those adduced by our author , premising , that any familiar reader of sermons may multiply them indefinitely . " In all his sufferings he retained the relation and reality of the Son of God ; the unity of his nature remained firm in all his passions , and therefore the efficacy of the Deity mingled itself with every groan in his agony , every pang and cry upon the cross , as well as with the blood which was shed ; and as his blood was the blood of God ,  --  Acts , xx , 28 ,  --  so his groans were the groans of God , his pangs were the pangs of God .

' " - Robert Hall . The common interpretation of the Bible , therefore , by Christian people , affords a strong presumption , notfor but against the existence of sufficient reasons for limiting to the human nature of Christ the scriptural declarations of his suffering . We come now to the question what are the reasons , for setting aside the natural and obvious meaning of these Scriptures . They must be found , if found at all , either in the language or in the nalure of the affirmations that Christ suffered . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of these affirmationsthat they affirm suffering , which can not truly be affirmed of the divine nature ; for God is impassible . The reasons may be all reduced to this one . Suffering is inconsistent with the nature and attributes of DeityGod is impassible . Are these reasons to be found in the language of these scriptural declarations ? This question , after what has been already said , may be easily answered . Some of the passages , which declare the sufferings of Christ , speak of his suffering in the flesh , in his body , by the shedding of his blood , and by his death , e. g- " being put to death in the // flesh , " ( 1 Pet . 3 : 18. ) - " Forasmuch as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , " &amp;c. , ( 1 Pet . 4 : 1. ) - " Redeemed with the precious blood of Christ , " ( 1 Pet . 1 : 19 . ) From such language it is inferred , ( 1 ) that these particular passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature ; and ( 2 ) that these govern the interpretation of all other passages which affirm suffering of Christ . Now , all such inferences rest on the assumption , that , by the wounding of Christ 's flesh and by the bruising of his body , by the shedding of its blood and by its death , only one of the two spirit . ual natures enshrined in that body and flesh suffered ,  --  the human ; which is the merest assumption , without any proof whatever , and contrary to the apparent reality . As has beea before intimated , that body was as truly the shrine of the divine , as of the human spirit of Christ ; was , apparently , as much the servant and instrument of the one as of the other , and connected by tender ties of sympathy as truly with the one as with the other . True , He suffered in the flesh , in the body , by the shedding of blood and by death . But who was He ? Why , according to the whole current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the King of glory ; not only the son of Mary , the mere man , but He , whom God gave , spared , for the manger and the cross ; He , who was in the form of God ; He who was rich , yet became poor ; He who is the author and finisher of faith ; He who bare our sins . Could the mere human part bear , atone for , the sins of the world ? But here we anticipate . Were it not for the dogma of divine impassibility , no one , as we believe , would think of giving this limited interpretation to this language . We come , then , at length , to the one great reason for this limitation of the meaning of Holy Writ-that such are the nature and attributes of Deity , that it can not suffer . God is impassible . Now we ask for proof of this position . Where is the authority for it ? We do not call for authority , in the form of decrees of councils , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creed-makers . We ask for authority in the form of evidence . Who knows , and how does he know , that God can not suffer ? Who has attained such " high , " such " wonderful " " knowledge . " Who has so " found out the Almighty unto perfection , " that he can affirm , that He can have no sympathy with grief and pain ; that if He chooses , in condescension and for purposes of mercy , to suffer , He can not ? We can not be constrained to set aside what seems to us the plain and precious teaching of the Bible , for any unproved and ex-catliedra dogma . We ask for its proof . We have never seen such proof . We have long looked for it in vain . We believe it to be a mere hypothesis that has no foundation either in the Scriptures or sound philosophy . What authority for it is there in the Scriptures ? Do they not disprove it abundantly ? Is there any support there for that " metaphysical notion " which ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as altogether impassive ; as made up of little more than of understanding and of power ; as having no part in that system of emotions which occupies so wide a space in the constitution of man , made after his own image and according to his own likeness ? " The answer , and a very convincing one , is found in such passages as these- " And God saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth , and it grieved him at his heart . " " Like as a father pitieth his children , so the Lord pitieth them that fear him . " " Hear , 0 heavens ; and give ear , 0 earth : I have nourished and brought up children , and they have rebelled against // me ! The ox knoweth his owner , and the ass his master 's crib : but Israel doth not know ; my people doth not consider I " " How shall I give thee up , Ephraim ? How shall 1 deliver thee , Israel ? How shall I make thee as Admah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart is turned within me ; my repentings are kindled together . " Now this philosophical ( yet most unphilosophical ) " statute of limitations , " God is impassible , by taking the fair meaning out of this language , disproves itself . Reason , as well as docility and reverent piety , bid us believe , that this language is not a mere rhetorical flourish ; that God means what he says ; that he is grieved , when his authority is spurned , the beneficent law of his kingdom broken , his goodness disregarded , his mercy rejected , his children injured and self-ruined . He feels , he suffers , grief . If the language does not mean this , it means nothing . Moreover , does not the Bible represent the work of atonement as a most costly work , a great and painful sacrifice for God ? Does not the worth of the atonement consist in this very fact ? What is it which makes that work such a marvellous manifestation of divine love ? Is it not this , that it cost God so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to poverty , humiliation and death ; and God the Son , in enduring that poverty , humiliation and death ? And how did or could it cost God , Father or Son , anything , except in the form of self-denial , privation , suffering ? When we are pointed , in the language of wonder , to the love of God , in not sparing his Son but giving him up freely for us all ; when we are told that he so loved , so loved the world , that he gave his only-begotten Son , can it be meant , can the language be so tortured as to mean , that there was no sacrifice , trial , pain , for the Father , in thus giving up the Son , or for the Son , in enduring that to which he was given up ? We say , with Chalmers , " mark well the emphasis that lies in the so . There was a difference in respect of painful surrender , between his giving up another , more distantly , as it were , connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in such close and affecting relationship . The kin that he hath to Christ is the measure of the love that he manifested to the world in giving up Christ as a propitiation for the world 's sins . What is this to say , but that in this great and solemn m the Parent was put to the tria Fofh* firmness ? - that in the act of doing so , there was a soreness , and a suffering , and a struggle , in the bosom of the Divinity ? - that a something was felt , like that which an earthly father feels , when he devotes the best and dearest of his family to some high object of patriotism ? " Take away this meaning , and the language has no force . Take away this meaning , and we should feel that the cost , the benevolence , the glory of the atonement was gone . It has been objected to the doctrine that the divine nature of Christ suffered in making atonement , that , if true , it proves suffering on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be it so . We give praise that it is so . We glory in it . God forbid that we should glory in anything else than in that cross , on which , to redeem a lost world , God the Son suft'ered-that cross to which God the Father gave his Son by a painful sacrifice . Such is the light which the Scriptures throw on the question whether God is impassible . But it is said that the Bible affirms that God is immutable , and therefore suffering can not be truly predicated of him , since that would prove him mutable . To this we reply , the Bible , as we have seen , makes the plain assertion that God the Father and the Son both suffered in the work of atonement : and the inconsist*ncy , if there be any , between this asser // tion and that of his immutability , is as much an argument against divine immutability as against divine passibility . But there is no such inconsistency . God is immutable . But , in what sense ? Is he immutably impassive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape ? It is not pretended . True , God is immutable . But is he immutably an omnipotent graven image ? Is he immutable , in any sense inconsistent with his feeling or suffering as *co*dition and necessities of his aWoral creatures require ? He is immutable , as we believe , in essence and in moral character . Does immutability of essence incapacitate him for suffering ? No one can assert it . Is immutability of moral character ( immutability in wisdom and justice and goodness ) inconsistent with capacity of grief , or of voluntary suffering ? Not in the least . On the contrary , this very immutability implies , that he grieves , or voluntarily suffers , whenever the condition or real good of his creatures , calls for grief or redemptive suffering ; just as immutability in goodness or holiness implies change in his feelings or emotions towards men , according to changes in their conduct and character-change , e. g. from displeasure to complacency as they change from sin to holiness ; just as he felt differently , towards Adam in his holy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penitent and obedient Paul . The idea that , if God suffered at the period of making atonement , he must , to be immutable , have suffered eternally , is about as rational and scriptural as the idea that , if he is angry with a particular sinner , at a particu. lar time , he must have been eternally angry ; or if he was pleased with Satan , in heaven , before he sinned , that he is pleased with him still , as he blasphemes in hell , and ever will be ; just as rational and scriptural , in short , as any form of the dogma of the " eternal now , " or no succession , in the divine mind . The objection , that divine grief , or redemptive suffering , is inconsistent with the divine blessedness , as declared in the Bible , is more plausible , but not more valid . True , the Bible declares , in general terms , God 's blessedness . These declarations , indeed , are not as numerous as the reader of our received translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instances where the word blessed is applied to God in the English version , e. g- Rom. 1 : 25 , " the Creator , who is blessed forever ; " Rom. 9 : 5 , " who is over all , God , blessed forever , " the Greek word is ru* io*ro* , which is doxological , not declarative of blessedness , and should be rendered worthy to be praised . There are , however , passages wherein the word properly rendered blessed , or happy , ( not perfectly blessed , or infinitely blessed , ) is applied to God ; as , iTim. 1 : 11 , " theglorious gospel of the blessed ( *iaxu* *uov ) God . " I Tim . 6 : 15 , " Jesus Christ who is the blessed and only Potentate , " &amp;c . So , in the same general form , it asserts the blessedness of the angels and glorified saints : but is that inconsistent with the truth that they sympathize with the griefs of a suffering Lazarus , and that they have new and increased joys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bears on the point under discussion , is , does the Bible represent the blessedness of God , in such form and manner as to be inconsistent with the idea that he has appropriate grief in view of the sin and misery of a fallen world , and consents , when the moral exigencies of his sinful creatures , and of his government , call for it , to redemptive suffering ? We believe it does not . The passages relied on , of which those that we have quoted are as defirtite as any , do not , and evidently were riot designed , // to make such a specific affirmation . Moreover , the divine blessedness , according to our doctrine , is greater and higher than on the theory of the objector . Which is the higher and better blessedness , that of a God whose warm heart sorrows over the wickedness and misery of sinning creatures , and tenderly sympathizes with the griefs of suffering saints , and who so loves the world even in its sin as to give himself to suffering , for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places before him ; or that of a God sitting on his lofty throne in unaffected , unsocial , cold , petrified impassibility ? An author of the day , justly popular , in one of his most skillfully wrought fancy sketches , describes an annual Christmas banquet , provided by stewards according to the last will and testament of an eccentric and misanthropic old gentleman , for ten of the most miserable persons that could be found , not for the purpose of relieving , but of giving opportunity to manifest and act out their wretchedness , on a day set apart for gratitude and joy . On the table was a wreathed crown of cypress , which was to be given to " the wofullest , " when he had proved his claim to it . The result was , that it was given to one , whose right to it and even to a seat at the table , was , for several years , on account of his prosperous circumstances and appearance , questioned by the other wretched guests , but was at length fully acknowledged : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Possessed of every thing , in wealth , fortune and social condition , to make him happy , his unsympathizing , unsocial , cold , in a word , impassive heart , entitled him , according to the judgment of the trustees and the consent of all , to the crown of wretchedness . The story evinces the author 's deep insight into the nature of the happiness of a spiritual being . Who , ac cording to actual observation , is the happiest , a father whose heart shares in the griefs of his children , and encounters self-denial and ssffering for their relief and welfare ; or a father whose heart is impassive , incapable of sharing in their griefs , and endures no voluntary self-denial or suffering for their sake ? It is not our doctrine , but that of the divine impassibility , which degrades the divine blessedness , and is inconsistent with the scriptural representations thereof . That doctrine makes God less blessed than ours . The Scriptures , then , furnish no proof of the dogma that God can not suffer , nor any objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advocates of this dogma on their own ground-that of philosophy . And here it is , or ought to be , a well settled rule , that philosophy can teach us nothing respecting the divine mind , except by reasoning from a knowledge of the human mind-on the principle that all minds are alike in kind , since God has made man after his own natural image and likeness . In reasoning from the light of nature , or from the statements of the Bible , we can , evidently , learn nothing of the operations and nature of the divine mind , except on the ground that they are , in kind , like the operations and nature of the human mind . This fundamental principle is thus laid down by President Edwards . in the fifth chapter of his " Dissertation concerning the nature of true virtue : " " We have no other way to conceive of any thing which other persons act or suffer , but by recalling and exciting the ideas of what weourselves are conscious we have found in our own minds ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the place of another ; or , as it were , substituting ourselves in their place . Thus we have no conception , what understanding , perception , love , pleasure , pain , or de* // sire are in others ; but by putting ourselves as it were in their stead , or transferring the ideas we obtain of such things in our own minds by consciousness into their place ; making such an alteratidn , as to degree and circumstances , as what we observe of them requires . It is thus in all moral things that we conceive of in others ; and indeed in every thing we conceive of , belonging to others , more than shape , size , corn . plexion , situation , and motion of their bodies . And this is the only way that we come to be capable of having ideas of any perception or act even of the Godhead . We never could have any notion what under . standing or volition , love or hatred are , either in created spirits or in God , if we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are in our own minds . Knowing what they are by consciousness , we can deny limits , and remove changeableness and other imperfections , and ascribe them to God . " We need not stop to verify this principle , but only to apply it . The world and the things that are therein indicate an almighty , wise and good mind , orspirit . The Bible declares that " God is a spirit . " But it nowhere defines spirit , except negatively in the words of the risen Christ to his disciples , " A spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have . " It assumes that we know what spirit is , from the operation of our own minds . And we must know it in this way , or not at all . It can be revealed to one ignorant of it by no form of language for nothing is more certain than that mere words can never convey to the mind the elementary knowledge of things , e. g. of color to a blind man , or of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To know , then , what God is as a spirit or mind , we must , as Edwards says , " take the ideas which we have by consciousness of our own minds , and then deny limits , remove changeableness and other imperfections , and ascribe them to God . " The authority for denying limits and imperfection , we find in the declarations of God 's word , and in the indications given by his works , that his attributes are perfect . Now a spirit is in its very nature passive-capable of emotions of joy and sorrow , of experiencing pleasure or pain . This , according to all our knowledge of spirit , is an essential characteristic of it  --  a matter , not of degree but of kind . Neither perfection , nor infinity of spirit removes it . Spirit is a thing in its very nature passive-capable of emotions of joy or sorrow . Indeed capacity for the one is capacity for the other . Denying limits , changeableness and other imperfections , according to Edwards 's rule , does not remove capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immutability which the Scriptures , as well as reason , ascribe to God , is perfectly consistent with and implies passibility , we have already seen . Surely , to deny the capacity or power of the infinite Spirit for any action or emotion , is to affirm instead of denying limits . ( His unchanging goodness or holiness , indeed , renders it infallibly certain , that that power will be exercised only according to righteousness . ) And to affirm that God can not feel such emotions as are appropriate in view of the sin and misery of his creatures and the sufferings of his people , and can not endure redemptive suffering when the salvation of a world calls for it , and his own inclination and choice respond to the call , is to affix , instead of removing , imperfection . It is a declaration that the divine nature is imperfect-not fully fitted to the relations , either of a father , or of a moral governor . The doctrine that God can not feel sorrow , or endure suffering when he chooses , is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite can not be consistently // denied , without denying the principle , which is the foundation of all our reasoning , of all our interpretation of nature or the Bible , in a word , of all our knowledge , respecting God . Thus we have seen that there is nothing in the language or nature of the scriptural declarations under consideration , which requires us to limit , or justifies us in limiting them to the human nature of Christ . The one great reason for such limitation to which all others are reduced , has no foundation either in the Bible , or in philosophy , truly so called . 111 . Here we might rest the argument . But we should not thus present its full strength . Not only is there no reason for , there is a decisive reason against , the limitation in question . The interpretation which we have shown to be the obvious one , is demanded by the exigency of the case -- by the purpose for which the sufferings of Christ were appointed . This is the Third position which we proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our view very important , can be presented in a brief space ; for the materials of the argument are conceded , more than this , are firmly held and strenuously contended for , by Christians of every orthodox denomination . That an atonement or propitiation for sin is necessary , in order that God in pardoning the sinner may be just , the upholder of his beneficent law and government ; that any atonement , to be sufficient for this purpose , must be equivalent to the penalty of the divine law , ( equivalent , as some teach , in amount of suffering to that from which the pardoned are saved , or , as others teach , and as has been taught in New England for more than fifty years , equivalent to the penalty , by fully answering the purpose of the penalty in the expression of God 's regard for his law , of his hatred of sin and love of holiness ) ; and that this equivalent can be rendered by nothing that any created being can do-that help must come from God -- that God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly held , and are accounted important and fundamental , by those who are called evangelical Christians . When , therefore , we read in the Bible , that , to make propitiation for sin , God gave his Son to suffering and death ; that He who was in the form of God and equal with God , He who was rich , the Prince of life and the Lord of glory , became poor , and took upon him the likeness of man and the form of a servant , endured humiliation , poverty and abuse , and became obedient unto the death of the cross , we are prepared to receive it all in its plain and obvious meaning : for this is just what sinful man needs ; this is indeed help from God ; this is a sufficient propitiation . And , instead of there being any presumption against giving to this language its obvious meaning , that the divinity in the person of Christ suffered , there is a strong presumption in favor of it , very strong , strong as our conviction that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a world . This is the very divine interposition that the exigency requires . We know , indeed , that no man , no mere son of Mary could by his sufferings make a sufficient expiation . But when we remember that Christ is not merely the son of Mary , but the " Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , the Almighty , " He who " stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth , " who is " Governor among the nations , having on his vesture and on his thigh a name written King of kings and Lord of lords ; " when we consider the intimate and endearing relation between Him and the first person of the Trinity  --  a relation feebly expressed by the name of only begotten Son  --  and then read of His humiliation and His agony in Gethsemane and on Calvary , we feel that here is ample propitiation , // a real magnifying of the law , a full and glorious vindication of Jehovah 's justice . God himself , manifest in the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemption . That atonement , according to any orthodox ideas , could not be made by the suffering of any human or created being , is very plain : for how could the suffering of one human being , either in amount , or as an expression of God 's feelings towards his law , sin and holiness , be equivalent to the eternal punishment of the wicked , to the smoke of their torment ascending forever ? The suffering of one created being for a few *days or years , would be , in comparison , as a drop to an ocean . And yet , the theory that the divine nature of Christ did not partake in his sufferings , makes the atonement just this-no more ! We are quite familiar with the answer , which is made to reasoning of this kind-with the argument , that the union of the divine nature with the human , gave a boundless dignity and worth to the sufferings of that human nature , though having no part in them . But we are constrained to say , that it never commended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction . We can not see how the divine nature had , we think we see that it had not , any share in the atonement , if it had no share in the sacrffice which constituted it ; nOr how it could give dignity and worth to sufferings , by which it was entirely unaffected . We have heard illustration after illustration upon this point : but to our mind it is like sailing in the face of the wind . The merit of the suffering was as great as the merit of the nature that suffered . It can be no greater . The theory we are opposing , represents the divine nature to have been as unaffected by the sufferings of the human nature , as if they had never been united . So far as suffering , the coast ituent matter of the atonement , is concerned , it makes an impassable gulf between the human and divine natures . The human endured it all . And yet , no amount of human suffering short of the everlasting misery of all sinners , of all pardoned sinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meager atonement does this theory present , compared with that , which , according to our view , is contained in the Bible-an atonement constituted by the voluntary suffering of the Son of God in his divine as well as human nature , as Vinet says , " a God suffering , a God dying " - suffering , death , to which the Father , with yearning paternal heart , " spared , " " gave up " his Son . This is what the sin-burdened soul needs . In the language of the hymn , " ( It ) thirsts for a life-giving God , A God that on Calvary died . " The mode of presenting the atonement , on the theory of the impassibility of the divine nature , has always seemed to us ( though we know it has not been so intended ) unfair and deceptive . The penalty of the law is truly represented to be eternal death . Atonement must be , for the purpose of government , something equivalent to that penalty . Such an atonement can be made by no creature 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet , when the atonement is presented , it is the mere suffering of a man , and God 's part of it is only nominal and fictitious ! It is a pertinent and solemn question , to what extent this method of presenting the doctrine of atonement has caused or confirmed the Unitarian heresy . The manner in which it affected the mind of Dr. Channing , is expressed thus , in his own language , which has always deeply impressed us . " I have a second objection to this doctrine of infinite atonement . When examined minutely , and freed from ambiguous language , it vanishes // into air . It is wholly delusion . The Trinitarian tells me , that , according to his system , we have an infinite substitute ; that the infinite God was pleased to bear our pun . ishment , and consequently , that pardon is made sure . But I ask him , Do I understand you ? Do you mean , that the great God , who never changes , whose happiness is the same yesterday , to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious man , when pressed by this question , answers , No . What then does the doctrine of infinite atonement mean ? Why , this ; that God took into union with himself our nature , that is , a human body and soul ; and these bore the suffering for our sins ; and , through his union with these , God may be said to have borne it himself . Thus this vaunted system goes out-in words . The infinite victim proves to be a frail man , and God 's share in the sacrifice is a mere fiction ? " Now , give the premise , God is impassible-the divine nature of Christ did not share in his sufferings , and the conclusion , as we have ever seen , and especially have ever felt , is sure , unavoidable . The representation is a solemn and high.sounding deception . Deny this premise , . as both the Scriptures and philosophy require ; admit , what the Bible , according to just rules of interpretation , requires us to admit and to hold , that Christ suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objection " vanishes into air. ** The atonement is represented to be , what , to be a sufficient atonement , it must be , the work of no mere creature , but of God . Here we leave the subject . We have endeavored to discuss it with fearlessness , but with reverence , candor and a solemn sense of responsibility , conscious that our feet were on holy ground . We know that we have been actuated by a love for the fundamental doctrine of the Gospel  --  a sufficient atonement for sin .  --  and by an earnest desire to hold it up to view in its true great ness and worth.
