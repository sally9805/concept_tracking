txt //and the high deeds of Ruy Diaz the Cid , are still sung amongst the fastnesses of the Sierra Morena. " 0 I believe that no stronger argument can be brought forward in proof of the natural vigour and resources of Spain , and the sterling character of her population , than the fact that , at the present day , she is still a powerful and unexhausted country , and her children still , to a certain extent , a high-minded and great people . Yes , notwithstanding the misrule of the brutal and sensual Austrian , the doting Bourbon , and , above all , the spiritual tyranny of the court of Rome , Spain can still maintain her own , fight her own combat , and Spaniards are not yet fanatic slaves and crouching beggars . This is saying much , very much : she has undergone far more than Naples had ever to bear , and yet the fate of Naples has not been hers . There is still valour in Astruria ; generosity in Aragon ; probity in Old Castile ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place a silver fork and a snowy napkin beside the plate of their guest . Yes , in spite of Austrian , Bourbon , and Rome , there is still a wide gulf between Spain and Naples . Strange as it may sound , Spain is not a fanatic country . I know something about her , and declare that she is not , nor has ever been ; Spain never changes . It is true that , for nearly two centuries , she was the she-butcher , La Verduga , of malignant Rome ; the chosen instrument for carrying into effect the atrocious projects of that power ; yet fanaticism was not the spring which impelled her to the work of butchery ; another feeling , in her the predominant one , was worked upon  --  her fatal pride . It was by humouring her pride that she was induced to waste her precious blood and treasure in the Low Country wars , to launch the Armada , and to many other equally insane actions . Love of Rome had ever slight influence over her policy ; but flattered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eager to prove herself not unworthy of the same , she shut her eyes and rushed upon her own destruction with the cry of " Charge , Spain . " But the arms of Spain became powerless abroad , and she retired within herself . She ceased to be the tool of the vengeance and cruelty of Rome . She was not cast aside , however . No ! though she could no longer wield the sword with success against the Lutherans , she might still be turned to some account . She had still gold and silver , and she was still the land of the vine and olive . Ceasing to be the butcher , she became the banker of Rome ; and the poor Spaniards , who always esteem it a privilege to pay another person 's reckoning , were for a long time happy in being permitted to minister to the grasping cupidity of Rome , who during the last century , probably extracted from Spain more treasure than from all the rest of Christendom . But wars came into the land . Napoleon and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of which will probably be felt for ages . Spain could no longer pay pence to Peter so freely as of yore , and from that period she became contemptible in the eyes of Rome , who has no respect for a nation , save so far as it can minister to her cruelty or avarice . The Spaniard was still willing to pay , as far as his means would allow , but he was soon given to understand that he was a degraded being ,  - -  a barbarian ; nay , a beggar . Now , you may draw the last cuarto from a Spaniard , provided you will concede to him the title of cavalier , and rich man , for the old leaven still works as powerfully as in the time of the first Philip ; but you must never hint that he is poor , or that his blood is inferior to your own . And the old peasant , on being informed in what slight estimation he was held , replied , " If I am a beast , a barbarian , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there is no remedy , I shall spend these four bushels of barley , which I had reserved to alleviate the misery of the holy father , in procuring bull spectacles , and other convenient diversions , for the queen my wife , and the young princes my children . Beggar ! carajo ! The water of my village is better than the wine of Rome . " I see that in a late pastoral letter directed to the Spaniards , the father of Rome complains bitterly of the treatment which he has received in Spain at the hands of naughty men . " My cathedrals are let down , " he says , " my priests are insulted , and the revenues of my bishops are curtailed . " He consoles himself , however , with the idea that this is the effect of the malice of a few , and that the generality of the nation love him , especially the peasantry , the innocent peasantry , who shed tears when they think of the sufferings of their pope and their religion . Undeceive yourself , Batuschca , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as she could increase her own glory by doing so ; but she took no pleasure in losing battle after battle on your account . She had no objection to pay money into your coffers in the shape of alms , expecting , however , that the same would be received with the gratitude and humility which becomes those who accept charity . Finding , however , that you were neither humble nor grateful ; suspecting , moreover , that you held Austria in higher esteem than herself , even as a banker , she shrugged up her shoulders , and uttered a sentence somewhat similar to that which I have already put into the mouth of one of her children , " These four bushels of barley , " etc . It is truly surprising what little interest the great body of the Spanish nation took in the late struggle , and yet it has been called , by some who ought to know better , a war of religion and principle . It was generally supposed that Biscay was the stronghold of Carlism , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehended was in danger . The truth is , that the Basques cared nothing for Carlos or Rome , and merely took up arms to defend certain rights and privileges of their own . For the dwarfish brother of Ferdinand they always exhibited supreme contempt , which his character , a compound of imbecility , cowardice , and cruelty , well merited . If they made use of his name , it was merely as a cri de guerre . Much the same may be said with respect to his Spanish partisans , at least those who appeared in the field for him . These , however , were of a widely different character from the Basques , who were brave soldiers and honest men . The Spanish armies of Don Carlos were composed entirely of thieves and assassins , chiefly Valencians and Manchegans , who , marshalled under two cut-throats , Cabrera and Palillos , took advantage of the distracted state of the country to plunder and massacre the honest part of the community . With respect to the Queen Regent Christina , of whom the less said the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decease of her husband , and with them the command of the soldiery . The respectable part of the Spanish nation , and more especially the honourable and toilworn peasantry , loathed and execrated both factions . Oft when I was sharing at nightfall the frugal fare of the villager of Old or New Castile , on hearing the distant shot of the Christino soldier or Carlist bandit , he would invoke curses on the heads of the two pretenders , not forgetting the holy father and the goddess of Rome , Maria Santissima . Then , with the tiger energy of the Spaniard when roused , he would start up and exclaim : " Vamos , Don Jorge , to the plain , to the plain ! I wish to enlist with you , and to learn the law of the English . To the plain , therefore , to the plain to-morrow , to circulate the gospel of Ingalaterra . " Amongst the peasantry of Spain I found my sturdiest supporters : and yet the holy father supposes that the Spanish labourers are friends and lovers of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present work : it is devoted to an account of what befell me in Spain whilst engaged in distributing the Scripture . With respect to my poor labours , I wish here to observe , that I accomplished but very little , and that I lay claim to no brilliant successes and triumphs ; indeed I was sent into Spain more to explore the country , and to ascertain how far the minds of the people were prepared to receive the truths of Christianity , than for any other object ; I obtained , however , through the assistance of kind friends , permission from the Spanish government to print an edition of the sacred volume at Madrid , which I subsequently circulated in that capital and in the provinces . During my sojourn in Spain , there were others who wrought good service in the Gospel cause , and of whose efforts it were unjust to be silent in a work of this description . Base is the heart which would refuse merit its meed , and , however insignificant may be the value of any eulogium which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrain from mentioning with respect and esteem a few names connected with Gospel enterprise . A zealous Irish gentleman , of the name of Graydon , exerted himself with indefatigable diligence in diffusing the light of Scripture in the province of Catalonia , and along the southern shores of Spain ; whilst two missionaries from Gibraltar , Messrs . Rule and Lyon , during one entire year , preached Evangelic truth in a Church at Cadiz . So much success attended the efforts of these two last brave disciples of the immortal Wesley , that there is every reason for supposing that , had they not been silenced and eventually banished from the country by the pseudo-liberal faction of the Moderados , not only Cadiz , but the greater part of Andalusia , would by this time have confessed the pure doctrines of the Gospel , and have discarded for ever the last relics of popish superstition . More immediately connected with the Bible Society and myself , I am most happy to take this opportunity of speaking of Luis de Usoz y Rio , the scion of an ancient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish New Testament at Madrid . Throughout my residence in Spain , I experienced every mark of friendship from this gentleman , who , during the periods of my absence in the provinces , and my numerous and long journeys , cheerfully supplied my place at Madrid , and exerted himself to the utmost in forwarding the views of the Bible Society , influenced by no other motive than a hope that its efforts would eventually contribute to the peace , happiness , and civilisation of his native land . In conclusion , I beg leave to state that I am fully aware of the various faults and inaccuracies of the present work . It is founded on certain journals which I kept during my stay in Spain , and numerous letters written to my friends in England , which they had subsequently the kindness to restore : the greater part , however , consisting of descriptions of scenery , sketches of character , etc. , has been supplied from memory . In various instances I have omitted the names of places , which I have either forgotten , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it at present exists , was written in a solitary hamlet in a remote part of England , where I had neither books to consult , nor friends of whose opinion or advice I could occasionally avail myself , and under all the disadvantages which arise from enfeebled health ; I have , however , on a recent occasion , experienced too much of the lenity and generosity of the public , both of Britain and America , to shrink from again exposing myself to its gaze , and trust that , if in the present volumes it finds but little to admire , it will give me credit for good spirit , and for setting down nought in malice .

On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself off the coast of Galicia , whose lofty mountains , gilded by the rising sun , presented a magnificent appearance . I was bound for Lisbon ; we passed Cape Finisterre , and standing farther out to sea , speedily lost sight of land . On the morning of the eleventh the sea was very rough , and a remarkable circumstance occurred . I was on the forecastle , discoursing with two of the sailors : one of them , who had but just left his hammock , said , " I have had a strange dream , which I do not much like , for , " continued he , pointing up to the mast , " I dreamt that I fell into the sea from the cross-trees . " He was heard to say this by several of the crew besides myself . A moment after , the captain of the vessel perceiving that the squall was increasing , ordered the topsails to be taken in , whereupon this man with several others instantly ran aloft ; the yard was in the act of being hauled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with violence , and a man was struck down from the cross-trees into the sea , which was working like yeast below . In a short time he emerged ; I saw his head on the crest of a billow , and instantly recognised in the unfortunate man the sailor who a few moments before had related his dream . I shall never forget the look of agony he cast whilst the steamer hurried past him . The alarm was given , and everything was in confusion ; it was two minutes at least before the vessel was stopped , by which time the man was a considerable way astern ; I still , however , kept my eye upon him , and could see that he was struggling gallantly with the waves . A boat was at length lowered , but the rudder was unfortunately not at hand , and only two oars could be procured , with which the men could make but little progress in so rough a sea . They did their best , however , and had arrived within ten yards of the man , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , and the men on their return said that they saw him below the water , at glimpses , sinking deeper and deeper , his arms stretched out and his body apparently stiff , but that they found it impossible to save him ; presently after , the sea , as if satisfied with the prey which it had acquired , became comparatively calm . The poor fellow who perished in this singular manner was a fine young man of twenty-seven , the only son of a widowed mother ; he was the best sailor on board , and was beloved by all who were acquainted with him . This event occurred on the eleventh of November , 1835 ; the vessel was the London Merchant steamship . Truly wonderful are the ways of Providence ! That same night we entered the Tagus , and dropped anchor before the old tower of Belem ; early the next morning we weighed , and , proceeding onward about a league , we again anchored at a short distance from the Caesodre , or principal quay of Lisbon . Here we lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rainha Nao , a man-of-war , which in old times so captivated the eye of Nelson , that he would fain have procured it for his native country . She was , long subsequently , the admiral 's ship of the Miguelite squadron , and had been captured by the gallant Napier about three years previous to the time of which I am speaking . The Rainha Nao is said to have caused him more trouble than all the other vessels of the enemy ; and some assert that , had the others defended themselves with half the fury which the old vixen queen displayed , the result of the battle which decided the fate of Portugal would have been widely different . I found disembarkation at Lisbon to be a matter of considerable vexation ; the custom-house officers were exceedingly uncivil , and examined every article of my little baggage with most provocating minuteness . My first impression on landing in the Peninsula was by no means a favourable one ; and I had scarcely pressed the soil one hour before I heartily wished myself back in Russia , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where I had left cherished friends and warm affections . After having submitted to much ill-usage and robbery at the custom-house , I proceeded in quest of a lodging , and at last found one , but dirty and expensive . The next day I hired a servant , a Portuguese , it being my invariable custom on arriving in a country to avail myself of the services of a native ; chiefly with the view of perfecting myself in the language ; and being already acquainted with most of the principal languages and dialects of the east and the west , I am soon able to make myself quite intelligible to the inhabitants . In about a fortnight I found myself conversing in Portuguese with considerable fluency . Those who wish to make themselves understood by a foreigner in his own language , should speak with much noise and vociferation , opening their mouths wide . Is it surprising that the English are , in general , the worst linguists in the world , seeing that they pursue a system diametrically opposite ? For example , when they attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they scarcely open their lips , and putting their hands in their pockets , fumble lazily , instead of applying them to the indispensable office of gesticulation . Well may the poor Spaniards exclaim , THESE ENGLISH TALK SO CRABBEDLY , THAT SATAN HIMSELF WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THEM . Lisbon is a huge ruinous city , still exhibiting in almost every direction the vestiges of that terrific visitation of God , the earthquake which shattered it some eighty years ago . It stands on seven hills , the loftiest of which is occupied by the castle of Saint George , which is the boldest and most prominent object to the eye , whilst surveying the city from the Tagus . The most frequented and busy parts of the city are those comprised within the valley to the north of this elevation . Here you find the Plaza of the Inquisition , the principal square in Lisbon , from which run parallel towards the river three or four streets , amongst which are those of the gold and silver , so designated from being inhabited by smiths cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole very magnificent ; the houses are huge and as high as castles ; immense pillars defend the causeway at intervals , producing , however , rather a cumbrous effect . These streets are quite level , and are well paved , in which respect they differ from all the others in Lisbon . The most singular street , however , of all is that of the Alemcrin , or Rosemary , which debouches on the Caesodre . It is very precipitous , and is occupied on either side by the palaces of the principal Portuguese nobility , massive and frowning , but grand and picturesque , edifices , with here and there a hanging garden , overlooking the streets at a great height . With all its ruin and desolation , Lisbon is unquestionably the most remarkable city in the Peninsula , and , perhaps , in the south of Europe . It is not my intention to enter into minute details concerning it ; I shall content myself with remarking , that it is quite as much deserving the attention of the artist as even Rome itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no gigantic cathedral , like St. Peter 's , to attract the eye and fill it with wonder , yet I boldly say that there is no monument of man 's labour and skill , pertaining either to ancient or modern Rome , for whatever purpose designed , which can rival the water-works of Lisbon ; I mean the stupendous aqueduct whose principal arches cross the valley to the north-east of Lisbon , and which discharges its little runnel of cool and delicious water into the rocky cistern within that beautiful edifice called the Mother of the Waters , from whence all Lisbon is supplied with the crystal lymph , though the source is seven leagues distant . Let travellers devote one entire morning to inspecting the Arcos and the Mai das Agoas , after which they may repair to the English church and cemetery , Pere-la-chaise in miniature , where , if they be of England , they may well be excused if they kiss the cold tomb , as I did , of the author of Amelia , the most singular genius which their island ever produced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public and to read in secret . In the same cemetery rest the mortal remains of Doddridge , another English author of a different stamp , but justly admired and esteemed . I had not intended , on disembarking , to remain long in Lisbon , nor indeed in Portugal ; my destination was Spain , whither I shortly proposed to direct my steps , it being the intention of the Bible Society to attempt to commence operations in that country , the object of which should be the distribution of the Word of God , for Spain had hitherto been a region barred against the admission of the Bible ; not so Portugal , where , since the revolution , the Bible had been permitted both to be introduced and circulated . Little , however , had been accomplished ; therefore , finding myself in the country , I determined , if possible , to effect something in the way of distribution , but first of all to make myself acquainted as to how far the people were disposed to receive the Bible , and whether the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much account . I had plenty of Bibles and Testaments at my disposal , but could the people read them , or would they ? A friend of the Society to whom I was recommended was absent from Lisbon at the period of my arrival ; this I regretted , as he could have afforded me several useful hints . In order , however , that no time might be lost , I determined not to wait for his arrival , but at once proceed to gather the best information I could upon those points to which I have already alluded . I determined to commence my researches at some slight distance from Lisbon , being well aware of the erroneous ideas that I must form of the Portuguese in general , should I judge of their character and opinions from what I saw and heard in a city so much subjected to foreign intercourse . My first excursion was to Cintra . If there be any place in the world entitled to the appellation of an enchanted region , it is surely Cintra ; Tivoli is a beautiful and picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have seen the Portuguese Paradise . When speaking of Cintra , it must not for a moment be supposed that nothing more is meant than the little town or city ; by Cintra must be understood the entire region , town , palace , quintas , forests , crags , Moorish ruin , which suddenly burst on the view on rounding the side of a bleak , savage , and sterile-looking mountain . Nothing is more sullen and uninviting than the south-western aspect of the stony wall which , on the side of Lisbon , seems to shield Cintra from the eye of the world , but the other side is a mingled scene of fairy beauty , artificial elegance , savage grandeur , domes , turrets , enormous trees , flowers and waterfalls , such as is met with nowhere else beneath the sun . Oh ! there are strange and wonderful objects at Cintra , and strange and wonderful recollections attached to them . The ruin on that lofty peak , and which covers part of the side of that precipitous steep , was once the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they had disappeared , at a particular moon of every year , were wont to repair wild santons of Maugrabie , to pray at the tomb of a famous Sidi , who slumbers amongst the rocks . That grey palace witnessed the assemblage of the last cortes held by the boy king Sebastian , ere he departed on his romantic expedition against the Moors , who so well avenged their insulted faith and country at Alcazarquibir , and in that low shady quinta , embowered amongst those tall alcornoques , once dwelt John de Castro , the strange old viceroy of Goa , who pawned the hairs of his dead son 's beard to raise money to repair the ruined wall of a fortress threatened by the heathen of Ind ; those crumbling stones which stand before the portal , deeply graven , not with " runes , " but things equally dark , Sanscrit rhymes from the Vedas , were brought by him from Goa , the most brilliant scene of his glory , before Portugal had become a base kingdom ; and down that dingle , on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Millionaire , who there nursed the wayward fancies of a mind as wild , rich , and variegated as the scenes around . Yes , wonderful are the objects which meet the eye at Cintra , and wonderful are the recollections attached to them . The town of Cintra contains about eight hundred inhabitants . The morning subsequent to my arrival , as I was about to ascend the mountain for the purpose of examining the Moorish ruins , I observed a person advancing towards me whom I judged by his dress to be an ecclesiastic ; he was in fact one of the three priests of the place . I instantly accosted him , and had no reason to regret doing so ; I found him affable and communicative . After praising the beauty of the surrounding scenery , I made some inquiry as to the state of education amongst the people under his care . He answered , that he was sorry to say that they were in a state of great ignorance , very few of the common people being able either to read or write ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the place , where four or five children were taught the alphabet , but that even this was at present closed ; he informed me , however , that there was a school at Colhares , about a league distant . Amongst other things , he said that nothing more surprised him than to see Englishmen , the most learned and intelligent people in the world , visiting a place like Cintra , where there was no literature , science , nor anything of utility ( coisa que presta ) . I suspect that there was some covert satire in the last speech of the worthy priest ; I was , however , Jesuit enough to appear to receive it as a high compliment , and , taking off my hat , departed with an infinity of bows . That same day I visited Colhares , a romantic village on the side of the mountain of Cintra , to the north-west . Seeing some peasants collected round a smithy , I inquired about the school , whereupon one of the men instantly conducted me thither . I went upstairs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a dozen pupils standing in a row ; I saw but one stool in the room , and to that , after having embraced me , he conducted me with great civility . After some discourse , he showed me the books which he used for the instruction of the children ; they were spelling books , much of the same kind as those used in the village schools in England . Upon my asking him whether it was his practice to place the Scriptures in the hands of the children , he informed me that long before they had acquired sufficient intelligence to understand them they were removed by their parents , in order that they might assist in the labours of the field , and that the parents in general were by no means solicitous that their children should learn anything , as they considered the time occupied in learning as so much squandered away . He said , that though the schools were nominally supported by the government , it was rarely that the schoolmasters could obtain their salaries , on which account many had of late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copy of the New Testament in his possession , which I desired to see , but on examining it I discovered that it was only the epistles by Pereira , with copious notes . I asked him whether he considered that there was harm in reading the Scriptures without notes : he replied that there was certainly no harm in it , but that simple people , without the help of notes , could derive but little benefit from Scripture , as the greatest part would be unintelligible to them ; whereupon I shook hands with him , and on departing said that there was no part of Scripture so difficult to understand as those very notes which were intended to elucidate it , and that it would never have been written if not calculated of itself to illume the minds of all classes of mankind . In a day or two I made an excursion to Mafra , distant about three leagues from Cintra ; the principal part of the way lay over steep hills , somewhat dangerous for horses ; however , I reached the place in safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immense building , intended to serve as a convent and palace , and which is built somewhat after the fashion of the Escurial . In this edifice exists the finest library in Portugal , containing books on all sciences and in all languages , and well suited to the size and grandeur of the edifice which contains it . There were no monks , however , to take care of it , as in former times ; they had been driven forth , some to beg their bread , some to serve under the banners of Don Carlos , in Spain , and many , as I was informed , to prowl about as banditti . I found the place abandoned to two or three menials , and exhibiting an aspect of solitude and desolation truly appalling . Whilst I was viewing the cloisters , a fine intelligent-looking lad came up and asked ( I suppose in the hope of obtaining a trifle ) whether I would permit him to show me the village church , which he informed me was well worth seeing ; I said no , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school I should feel much obliged to him . He looked at me with astonishment , and assured me that there was nothing to be seen at the school , which did not contain more than half a dozen boys , and that he himself was one of the number . On my telling him , however , that he should show me no other place , he at length unwillingly attended me . On the way I learned from him that the schoolmaster was one of the friars who had lately been expelled from the convent , that he was a very learned man , and spoke French and Greek . We passed a stone cross , and the boy bent his head and crossed himself with much devotion . I mention this circumstance , as it was the first instance of the kind which I had observed amongst the Portuguese since my arrival . When near the house where the schoolmaster resided , he pointed it out to me , and then hid himself behind a wall , where he awaited my return . On stepping over the threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty and seventy years of age , dressed in a blue jerkin and grey trousers , without shirt or waistcoat ; he looked at me sternly , and enquired in the French language what was my pleasure . I apologised for intruding upon him , and stated that , being informed he occupied the situation of schoolmaster , I had come to pay my respects to him and to beg permission to ask a few questions respecting the seminary . He answered that whoever told me he was a schoolmaster lied , for that he was a friar of the convent and nothing else . " It is not then true , " said I , " that all the convents have been broken up and the monks dismissed ? " " Yes , yes , " said he with a sigh , " it is true ; it is but too true . " He then was silent for a minute , and his better nature overcoming his angry feelings , he produced a snuff-box and offered it to me . The snuff-box is the olive-branch of the Portuguese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them must never refuse to dip his finger and thumb into it when offered . I took therefore a huge pinch , though I detest the dust , and we were soon on the best possible terms . He was eager to obtain news , especially from Lisbon and Spain . I told him that the officers of the troops at Lisbon had , the day before I left that place , gone in a body to the queen and insisted upon her either receiving their swords or dismissing her ministers ; whereupon he rubbed his hands and said that he was sure matters would not remain tranquil at Lisbon . On my saying , however , that I thought the affairs of Don Carlos were on the decline ( this was shortly after the death of Zumalacarregui ) , he frowned , and cried that it could not possibly be , for that God was too just to suffer it . I felt for the poor man who had been driven out of his home in the noble convent close by , and from a state of affluence and comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his present dwelling scarcely seemed to contain an article of furniture . I tried twice or thrice to induce him to converse about the school , but he either avoided the subject or said shortly that he knew nothing about it . On my leaving him , the boy came from his hiding-place and rejoined me ; he said that he had hidden himself through fear of his master 's knowing that he had brought me to him , for that he was unwilling that any stranger should know that he was a schoolmaster . I asked the boy whether he or his parents were acquainted with the Scripture and ever read it ; he did not , however , seem to understand me . I must here observe that the boy was fifteen years of age , that he was in many respects very intelligent , and had some knowledge of the Latin language ; nevertheless he knew not the Scripture even by name , and I have no doubt , from what I subsequently observed , that at least two-thirds of his countrymen are on that important point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inns , at the hearths of the rustics , in the fields where they labour , at the stone fountains by the wayside where they water their cattle , I have questioned the lower class of the children of Portugal about the Scripture , the Bible , the Old and New Testament , and in no one instance have they known what I was alluding to , or could return me a rational answer , though on all other matters their replies were sensible enough ; indeed , nothing surprised me more than the free and unembarrassed manner in which the Portuguese peasantry sustain a conversation , and the purity of the language in which they express their thoughts , and yet few of them can read or write ; whereas the peasantry of England , whose education is in general much superior , are in their conversation coarse and dull almost to brutality , and absurdly ungrammatical in their language , though the English tongue is upon the whole more simple in its structure than the Portuguese . On my return to Lisbon I found our friend - , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly rainy , which prevented me from making any excursions into the country : during this time I saw our friend frequently , and had long conversations with him concerning the best means of distributing the gospel . He thought we could do no better for the present than put part of our stock into the hands of the booksellers of Lisbon , and at the same time employ colporteurs to hawk the books about the streets , receiving a certain profit off every copy they sold . This plan was agreed upon and forthwith put in practice , and with some success . I had thought of sending colporteurs into the neighbouring villages , but to this our friend objected . He thought the attempt dangerous , as it was very possible that the rural priesthood , who still possessed much influence in their own districts , and who were for the most part decided enemies to the spread of the gospel , might cause the men employed to be assassinated or ill-treated . I determined , however , ere leaving Portugal , to establish depots of Bibles in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the Alemtejo , which I had heard was a very benighted region . The Alemtejo means the province beyond the Tagus . This province is not beautiful and picturesque , like most other parts of Portugal : there are few hills and mountains , the greater part consists of heaths broken by knolls , and gloomy dingles , and forests of stunted pine ; these places are infested with banditti . The principal city is Evora , one of the most ancient in Portugal , and formerly the seat of a branch of the Inquisition , yet more cruel and baneful than the terrible one of Lisbon . Evora lies about sixty miles from Lisbon , and to Evora I determined on going with twenty Testaments and two Bibles . How I fared there will presently be seen . CHAPTER II Boatmen of the Tagus  --  Dangers of the Stream  --  Aldea Gallega  --  The Hostelry  --  Robbers  --  Sabocha  --  Adventure of a Muleteer  --  Estalagem de Ladroes  --  Don Geronimo  --  Vendas Novas  --  Royal Residence  --  Swine of the Alemtejo  --  Monto Moro  --  Swayne Vonved  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadducees . On the afternoon of the sixth of December I set out for Evora , accompanied by my servant . I had been informed that the tide would serve for the regular passage-boats , or felouks , as they are called , at about four o'clock , but on reaching the side of the Tagus opposite to Aldea Gallega , between which place and Lisbon the boats ply , I found that the tide would not permit them to start before eight o'clock . Had I waited for them I should have probably landed at Aldea Gallega about midnight , and I felt little inclination to make my entree in the Alemtejo at that hour ; therefore , as I saw small boats which can push off at any time lying near in abundance , I determined upon hiring one of them for the passage , though the expense would be thus considerably increased . I soon agreed with a wild-looking lad , who told me that he was in part owner of one of the boats , to take me over . I was not aware of the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is opposite Aldea Gallega , at any time , but especially at close of day in the winter season , or I should certainly not have ventured . The lad and his comrade , a miserable looking object , whose only clothing , notwithstanding the season , was a tattered jerkin and trousers , rowed until we had advanced about half a mile from the land ; they then set up a large sail , and the lad , who seemed to direct everything and to be the principal , took the helm and steered . The evening was now setting in ; the sun was not far from its bourne in the horizon , the air was very cold , the wind was rising , and the waves of the noble Tagus began to be crested with foam . I told the boy that it was scarcely possible for the boat to carry so much sail without upsetting , upon which he laughed , and began to gabble in a most incoherent manner . He had the most harsh and rapid articulation that has ever come under my observation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyena blended with the bark of the terrier , though it was by no means an index of his disposition , which I soon found to be light , merry , and anything but malevolent , for when I , in order to show him that I cared little about him , began to hum " Eu que sou Contrabandista , " he laughed heartily and said , clapping me on the shoulder , that he would not drown us if he could help it . The other poor fellow seemed by no means averse to go to the bottom ; he sat at the fore part of the boat looking the image of famine , and only smiled when the waters broke over the weather side and soaked his scanty habiliments . In a little time I had made up my mind that our last hour was come ; the wind was getting higher , the short dangerous waves were more foamy , the boat was frequently on its beam , and the water came over the lee side in torrents ; but still the wild lad at the helm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Miguelite air , " Quando el Rey chegou " the singing of which in Lisbon is imprisonment . The stream was against us , but the wind was in our favour , and we sprang along at a wonderful rate , and I saw that our only chance of escape was in speedily passing the farther bank of the Tagus where the bight or bay at the extremity of which stands Aldea Gallega commences , for we should not then have to battle with the waves of the stream , which the adverse wind lashed into fury . It was the will of the Almighty to permit us speedily to gain this shelter , but not before the boat was nearly filled with water , and we were all wet to the skin . At about seven o'clock in the evening we reached Aldea Gallega , shivering with cold and in a most deplorable plight . Aldea Gallega , or the Galician Village ( for the two words are Spanish , and have that signification ) , it a place containing , I should think , about four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rockets soon began to fly about in all directions , illuming the air far and wide . As we passed along the dirty unpaved street which leads to the Largo , or square in which the inn is situated , a horrible uproar of drums and voices assailed our ears . On inquiring the cause of all this bustle , I was informed that it was the eve of the Conception of the Virgin . As it was not the custom of the people at the inn to furnish provisions for the guests , I wandered about in search of food ; and at last seeing some soldiers eating and drinking in a species of wine-house , I went in and asked the people to let me have some supper , and in a short time they furnished me with a tolerable meal , for which , however , they charged three crowns . Having engaged with a person for mules to carry us to Evora , which were to be ready at five next morning , I soon retired to bed , my servant sleeping in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacant . I closed not my eyes during the whole night . Beneath us was a stable , in which some almocreves , or carriers , slept with their mules ; at our back , in the yard , was a pigsty . How could I sleep ? The hogs grunted , the mules screamed , and the almocreves snored most horribly . I heard the village clock strike the hours until midnight , and from midnight till four in the morning , when I sprang up and began to dress , and despatched my servant to hasten the man with the mules , for I was heartily tired of the place and wanted to leave it . An old man , bony and hale , accompanied by a barefooted lad , brought the beasts , which were tolerably good . He was the proprietor of them , and intended , with the lad , who was his nephew , to accompany us to Evora . When we started , the moon was shining brightly , and the morning was piercingly cold . We soon entered on a sandy hollow way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large edifice , standing on a high bleak sand-hill on our left . We were speedily overtaken by five or six men on horseback , riding at a rapid pace , each with a long gun slung at his saddle , the muzzle depending about two feet below the horse 's belly . I inquired of the old man what was the reason of this warlike array . He answered , that the roads were very bad ( meaning that they abounded with robbers ) , and that they went armed in this manner for their defence ; they soon turned off to the right towards Palmella . We reached a sandy plain studded with stunted pine ; the road was little more than a footpath , and as we proceeded , the trees thickened and became a wood , which extended for two leagues , with clear spaces at intervals , in which herds of cattle and sheep were feeding ; the bells attached to their necks were ringing lowly and monotonously . The sun was just beginning to show itself ; but the morning was misty and dreary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country exhibited , had an unfavourable effect on my spirits . I got down and walked , entering into conversation with the old man . He seemed to have but one theme , " the robbers , " and the atrocities they were in the habit of practising in the very spots we were passing . The tales he told were truly horrible , and to avoid them I mounted again , and rode on considerably in front . In about an hour and a half we emerged from the forest , and entered upon a savage , wild , broken ground , covered with mato , or brushwood . The mules stopped to drink at a shallow pool , and on looking to the right I saw a ruined wall . This , the guide informed me , was the remains of Vendas Velhas , or the Old Inn , formerly the haunt of the celebrated robber Sabocha . This Sabocha , it seems , had , some sixteen years ago , a band of about forty ruffians at his command , who infested these wilds , and supported themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocious trade unsuspected , and many an unfortunate traveller was murdered in the dead of night at the solitary inn by the wood-side , which he kept ; indeed , a more fit situation for plunder and murder I never saw . The gang were in the habit of watering their horses at the pool , and perhaps of washing therein their hands stained with the blood of their victims ; the lieutenant of the troop was the brother of Sabocha , a fellow of great strength and ferocity , particularly famous for the skill he possessed in darting a long knife , with which he was in the habit of transfixing his opponents . Sabocha 's connection with the gang at length became known , and he fled , with the greater part of his associates , across the Tagus to the northern provinces . Himself and his brothers eventually lost their lives on the road to Coimbra , in an engagement with the military . His house was razed by order of the government . The ruins are still frequently visited by banditti , who eat and drink amidst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place commands a view of the road . The old man assured me , that about two months previous , on returning to Aldea Gallega with his mules from accompanying some travellers , he had been knocked down , stripped naked , and all his money taken from him , by a fellow whom he believed came from this murderers ' nest . He said that he was an exceedingly powerful young man , with immense moustaches and whiskers , and was armed with an espingarda , or musket . About ten days subsequently he saw the robber at Vendas Novas , where we should pass the night . The fellow on recognising him took him aside , and , with horrid imprecations , threatened that he should never be permitted to return home if he attempted to discover him ; he therefore held his peace , as there was little to be gained and everything to be risked in apprehending him , as he would have been speedily set at liberty for want of evidence to criminate him , and then he would not have failed to have had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrades . I dismounted and went up to the place , and saw the vestiges of a fire and a broken bottle . The sons of plunder had been there very lately . I left a New Testament and some tracts amongst the ruins , and hastened away . The sun had dispelled the mists and was beaming very hot ; we rode on for about an hour , when I heard the neighing of a horse in our rear , and our guide said there was a party of horsemen behind ; our mules were good , and they did not overtake us for at least twenty minutes . The headmost rider was a gentleman in a fashionable travelling dress ; a little way behind were an officer , two soldiers , and a boy in livery . I heard the principal horseman , on overtaking my servant , inquiring who I was , and whether French or English . He was told I was an English gentleman , travelling . He then asked whether I understood Portuguese ; the man said I understood it , but he believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurred on his horse and accosted me , not in Portuguese , nor in French or Italian , but in the purest English that I ever heard spoken by a foreigner ; it had , indeed , nothing of foreign accent or pronunciation in it ; and had I not known , by the countenance of the speaker , that he was no Englishman , ( for there is a peculiarity in the countenance , as everybody knows , which , though it can not be described , is sure to betray the Englishman ) , I should have concluded that I was in company with a countryman . We continued discoursing until we arrived at Pegoens . Pegoens consists of about two or three houses and an inn ; there is likewise a species of barrack , where half a dozen soldiers are stationed . In the whole of Portugal there is no place of worse reputation , and the inn is nick-named Estalagem de Ladroes , or the hostelry of thieves ; for it is there that the banditti of the wilderness , which extends around it on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spending the money , the fruits of their criminal daring ; there they dance and sing , eat fricasseed rabbits and olives , and drink the muddy but strong wine of the Alemtejo . An enormous fire , fed by the trunk of a cork tree , was blazing in a niche on the left hand on entering the spacious kitchen . Close by it , seething , were several large jars , which emitted no disagreeable odour , and reminded me that I had not broken my fast , although it was now nearly one o'clock , and I had ridden five leagues . Several wild-looking men , who if they were not banditti might easily be mistaken for such , were seated on logs about the fire . I asked them some unimportant questions , to which they replied with readiness and civility , and one of them , who said he could read , accepted a tract which I offered him . My new friend , who had been bespeaking dinner , or rather breakfast , now , with great civility , invited me to partake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer who accompanied him , and who was his brother , and also spoke English , though not so well as himself . I found I had become acquainted with Don Geronimo Joze D'Azveto , secretary to the government at Evora ; his brother belonged to a regiment of hussars , whose headquarters were at Evora , but which had outlying parties along the road ,  --  for example , the place where we were stopping . Rabbits at Pegoens seem to be a standard article of food , being produced in abundance on the moors around . We had one fried , the gravy of which was delicious , and afterwards a roasted one , which was brought up on a dish entire ; the hostess , having first washed her hands , proceeded to tear the animal to pieces , which having accomplished , she poured over the fragments a sweet sauce . I ate heartily of both dishes , particularly of the last ; owing , perhaps , to the novel and curious manner in which it was served up . Excellent figs , from the Algarves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little side room with a mud floor , which sent such a piercing chill into my system , as prevented me from deriving that pleasure from my fare and my agreeable companions that I should have otherwise experienced . Don Geronimo had been educated in England , in which country he passed his boyhood , which in a certain degree accounted for his proficiency in the English language , the idiom and pronunciation of which can only be acquired by residing in the country at that period of one 's life . He had also fled thither shortly after the usurpation of the throne of Portugal by Don Miguel , and from thence had departed to the Brazils , where he had devoted himself to the service of Don Pedro , and had followed him in the expedition which terminated in the downfall of the usurper and the establishment of the constitutional government in Portugal . Our conversation rolled chiefly on literary and political subjects , and my acquaintance with the writings of the most celebrated authors of Portugal was hailed with surprise and delight ; for nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking an interest in the literature of his nation , of which , in many respects , he is justly proud . At about two o'clock we were once more in the saddle , and pursued our way in company through a country exactly resembling that which we had previously been traversing , rugged and broken , with here and there a clump of pines . The afternoon was exceedingly fine , and the bright rays of the sun relieved the desolation of the scene . Having advanced about two leagues , we caught sight of a large edifice towering majestically in the distance , which I learnt was a royal palace standing at the farther extremity of Vendas Novas , the village in which we were to pass the night ; it was considerably more than a league from us , yet , seen through the clear transparent atmosphere of Portugal it appeared much nearer . Before reaching it we passed by a stone cross , on the pedestal of which was an inscription commemorating a horrible murder of a native of Lisbon , which had occurred on that spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the greater part of the inscription was illegible , at least it was to me , who could not bestow much time on its deciphering . Having arrived at Vendas Novas , and bespoken supper , my new friend and myself strolled forth to view the palace ; it was built by the late king of Portugal , and presents little that is remarkable in its exterior ; it is a long edifice with wings , and is only two stories high , though it can be seen afar off , from being situated on elevated ground ; it has fifteen windows in the upper , and twelve in the lower story , with a paltry-looking door , something like that of a barn , to which you ascend by one single step ; the interior corresponds with the exterior , offering nothing which can gratify curiosity , if we except the kitchens , which are indeed magnificent , and so large that food enough might be cooked in them , at one time , to serve as a repast for all the inhabitants of the Alemtejo . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remote from all those noises so rife in a Portuguese inn , and the next morning at six we again set out on our journey , which we hoped to terminate before sunset , as Evora is but ten leagues from Vendas Novas . The preceding morning had been cold , but the present one was far colder , so much so , that just before sunrise I could no longer support it on horseback , and therefore dismounting , ran and walked until we reached a few houses at the termination of these desolate moors . It was in one of these houses that the commissioners of Don Pedro and Miguel met , and it was there agreed that the latter should resign the crown in favour of Donna Maria , for Evora was the last stronghold of the usurper , and the moors of the Alemtejo the last area of the combats which so long agitated unhappy Portugal . I therefore gazed on the miserable huts with considerable interest , and did not fail to scatter in the neighbourhood several of the precious little tracts with which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag was provided . The country began to improve ; the savage heaths were left behind , and we saw hills and dales , cork trees , and azinheiras , on the last of which trees grows that kind of sweet acorn called bolotas , which is pleasant as a chestnut , and which supplies in winter the principal food on which the numerous swine of the Alemtejo subsist . Gallant swine they are , with short legs and portly bodies of a black or dark red colour ; and for the excellence of their flesh I can vouch , having frequently luxuriated upon it in the course of my wanderings in this province ; the lombo , or loin , when broiled on the live embers , is delicious , especially when eaten with olives . We were now in sight of Monte Moro , which , as the name denotes , was once a fortress of the Moors ; it is a high steep hill , on the summit and sides of which are ruined walls and towers ; at its western side is a deep ravine or valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stone bridge ; farther down there is a ford , over which we passed and ascended to the town , which , commencing near the northern base , passes over the lower ridge towards the north-east . The town is exceedingly picturesque , and many of the houses are very ancient , and built in the Moorish fashion . I wished much to examine the relics of Moorish sway on the upper part of the mountain , but time pressed , and the short period of our stay at this place did not permit me to gratify my inclination . Monte Moro is the head of a range of hills which cross this part of the Alemtejo , and from hence they fork east and south-east , towards the former of which directions lies the direct road to Elvas , Badajos , and Madrid ; and towards the latter that to Evora . A beautiful mountain , covered to the top with cork trees , is the third of the chain which skirts the way in the direction of Elvas . It is called Monte Almo ; a brook brawls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was shining gloriously on the green herbage on which flocks of goats were feeding , with their bells ringing merrily , so that the tout ensemble resembled a fairy scene ; and that nothing might be wanted to complete the picture , I here met a man , a goatherd , beneath an azinheira , whose appearance recalled to my mind the Brute Carle , mentioned in the Danish ballad of Swayne Vonved : - " A wild swine on his shoulders he kept , And upon his bosom a black bear slept ; And about his fingers with hair o'erhung , The squirrel sported and weasel clung . " Upon the shoulder of the goatherd was a beast , which he told me was a lontra , or otter , which he had lately caught in the neighbouring brook ; it had a string round its neck which was attached to his arm . At his left side was a bag , from the top of which peered the heads of two or three singular-looking animals , and at his right was squatted the sullen cub of a wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance was to the last degree savage and wild . After a little conversation such as those who meet on the road frequently hold , I asked him if he could read , but he made me no answer . I then inquired if he knew anything of God or Jesus Christ ; he looked me fixedly in the face for a moment , and then turned his countenance towards the sun , which was beginning to sink in the west , nodded to it , and then again looked fixedly upon me . I believe that I understood the mute reply ; which probably was , that it was God who made that glorious light which illumes and gladdens all creation ; and gratified with that belief , I left him and hastened after my companions , who were by this time a considerable way in advance . I have always found in the disposition of the children of the fields a more determined tendency to religion and piety than amongst the inhabitants of towns and cities , and the reason is obvious , they are less acquainted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; their occupations , too , which are simple , and requiring less of ingenuity and skill than those which engage the attention of the other portion of their fellow-creatures , are less favourable to the engendering of self-conceit and sufficiency so utterly at variance with that lowliness of spirit which constitutes the best foundation of piety . The sneerers and scoffers at religion do not spring from amongst the simple children of nature , but are the excrescences of overwrought refinement , and though their baneful influence has indeed penetrated to the country and corrupted man there , the source and fountainhead was amongst crowded houses , where nature is scarcely known . I am not one of those who look for perfection amongst the rural population of any country ; perfection is not to be found amongst the children of the fall , wherever their abodes may happen to be ; but , until the heart discredits the existence of a God , there is still hope for the soul of the possessor , however stained with crime he may be , for even Simon the magician was converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , infidelity confirmed by carnal wisdom , an exuberance of the grace of God is required to melt it , which is seldom manifested ; for we read in the blessed book that the Pharisee and the wizard became receptacles of grace , but where is there mention made of the conversion of the sneering Sadducee , and is the modern infidel aught but a Sadducee of later date ? It was dark night before we reached Evora , and having taken leave of my friends , who kindly requested me to consider their house my home , I and my servant went to the Largo de San Francisco , in which the muleteer informed me was the best hostelry of the town . We rode into the kitchen , at the extreme end of which was the stable , as is customary in Portugal . The house was kept by an aged gypsy-like female and her daughter , a fine blooming girl about eighteen years of age . The house was large ; in the upper storey was a very long room , like a granary , which extended nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was partitioned off and formed a chamber tolerably comfortable but very cold , and the floor was of tiles , as was also that of the large room in which the muleteers were accustomed to sleep on the furniture of the mules . After supper I went to bed , and having offered up my devotions to Him who had protected me through a dangerous journey , I slept soundly till the morning . CHAPTER III Shopkeeper at Evora  --  Spanish Contrabandistas  --  Lion and Unicorn  --  The Fountain  --  Trust in the Almighty  --  Distribution of Tracts  --  Library at Evora  --  Manuscript  --  The Bible as a Guide  --  The Infamous Mary  --  The Man of Palmella  --  The Charm  --  The Monkish System  --  Sunday  --  Volney  --  An Auto-Da-Fe  --  Men from Spain  --  Reading of a Tract  --  New Arrival  --  The Herb Rosemary . Evora is a small city , walled , but not regularly fortified , and could not sustain a siege of a day . It has five gates ; before that to the south-west is the principal promenade of its inhabitants : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; the houses are in general very ancient , and many of them unoccupied . It contains about five thousand inhabitants , though twice that number would be by no means disproportionate to its size . The two principal edifices are the See , or cathedral , and the convent of San Francisco , in the square before the latter of which was situated the posada where I had taken up my abode . A large barrack for cavalry stands on the right-hand side , on entering the south-west gate . To the south-east , at the distance of six leagues , is to be seen a blue chain of hills , the highest of which is called Serra Dorso ; it is picturesquely beautiful , and contains within its recesses wolves and wild boars in numbers . About a league and a half on the other side of this hill is Estremos . I passed the day succeeding my arrival principally in examining the town and its environs , and , as I strolled about , entering into conversation with various people that I met ; several of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they were all Constitutionalists , or pretended to be so , but had very little to say except a few commonplace remarks on the way of living of the friars , their hypocrisy and laziness . I endeavoured to obtain some information respecting the state of instruction in the place , and from their answers was led to believe that it must be at the lowest ebb , for it seemed that there was neither book-shop nor school . When I spoke of religion , they exhibited the utmost apathy for the subject , and making their bows left me as soon as possible . Having a letter of introduction to a person who kept a shop in the market-place , I went thither and delivered it to him as he stood behind his counter . In the course of conversation , I found that he had been much persecuted whilst the old system was in its vigour , and that he entertained a hearty aversion for it . I told him that the ignorance of the people in religious matters had served to nurse that system , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their minds : I added that I had brought a small stock of Bibles and Testaments to Evora , which I wished to leave for sale in the hands of some respectable merchant , and that it he were anxious to help to lay the axe to the root of superstition and tyranny , he could not do so more effectually than by undertaking the charge of these books . He declared his willingness to do so , and I went away determined to entrust to him half of my stock . I returned to the hostelry , and sat down on a log of wood on the hearth within the immense chimney in the common apartment ; two surly looking men were on their knees on the stones ; before them was a large heap of pieces of old iron , brass , and copper ; they were assorting it , and stowing it away in various bags . They were Spanish contrabandistas of the lowest class , and earned a miserable livelihood by smuggling such rubbish from Portugal into Spain . Not a word proceeded from their lips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they returned no other answer than a kind of growl . They looked as dirty and rusty as the iron in which they trafficked ; their four miserable donkeys were in the stable in the rear . The woman of the house and her daughter were exceedingly civil to me , and coming near crouched down , asking various questions about England . A man dressed somewhat like an English sailor , who sat on the other side of the hearth confronting me , said , " I hate the English , for they are not baptized , and have not the law , " meaning the law of God . I laughed , and told him that according to the law of England , no one who was unbaptized could be buried in consecrated ground ; whereupon he said , " Then you are stricter than we . " He then said , " What is meant by the lion and the unicorn which I saw the other day on the coat of arms over the door of the English consul at St. Ubes ? " I said they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , " but what do they represent ? " I said I did not know . " Then , " said he , " you do not know the secrets of your own house . " I said , " Suppose I were to tell you that they represent the Lion of Bethlehem , and the horned monster of the flaming pit in combat , as to which should obtain the mastery in England , what would you say ? " He replied , " I should say that you gave a fair answer . " This man and myself became great friends ; he came from Palmella , not far from St. Ubes ; he had several mules and horses with him , and dealt in corn and barley . I again walked out and roamed in the environs of the town . About half a mile from the southern wall is a stone fountain , where the muleteers and other people who visit the town are accustomed to water their horses . I sat down by it , and there I remained about two hours , entering into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will here observe , that during the time of my sojourn at Evora , I repeated my visit every day , and remained there the same time ; and by following this plan , I believe that I spoke to at least two hundred of the children of Portugal upon matters relating to their eternal welfare . I found that very few of those whom I addressed had received any species of literary education , none of them had seen the Bible , and not more than half a dozen had the slightest inkling of what the holy book consisted . I found that most of them were bigoted Papists and Miguelites at heart . I therefore , when they told me they were Christians , denied the possibility of their being so , as they were ignorant of Christ and His commandments , and placed their hope of salvation on outward forms and superstitious observances , which were the invention of Satan , who wished to keep them in darkness that at last they might stumble into the pit which he had dug for them . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arch deceiver , and the head minister of Satan here on earth , and that the monks and friars , whose absence they so deplored , and to whom they had been accustomed to confess themselves , were his subordinate agents . When called upon for proofs , I invariably cited the ignorance of my auditors respecting the Scriptures , and said that if their spiritual guides had been really ministers of Christ , they would not have permitted their flocks to remain unacquainted with His Word . Since this occurred , I have been frequently surprised that I experienced no insult and ill-treatment from the people , whose superstitions I was thus attacking ; but I really experienced none , and am inclined to believe that the utter fearlessness which I displayed , trusting in the Protection of the Almighty , may have been the cause . When threatened by danger , the best policy is to fix your eye steadily upon it , and it will in general vanish like the morning mist before the sun ; whereas , if you quail before it , it is sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of my mouth sank deep into the hearts of some of my auditors , as I observed many of them depart musing and pensive . I occasionally distributed tracts amongst them ; for although they themselves were unable to turn them to much account , I thought that by their means they might become of service at some future time , and fall into the hands of others , to whom they might be of eternal interest . Many a book which is abandoned to the waters is wafted to some remote shore , and there proves a blessing and a comfort to millions , who are ignorant from whence it came . The next day , which was Friday , I called at the house of my friend Don Geronimo Azveto . I did not find him there , but was directed to the see , or episcopal palace , in an apartment of which I found him , writing , with another gentleman , to whom he introduced me ; it was the governor of Evora , who welcomed me with every mark of kindness and affability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine an ancient edifice , which was reported to have served , in bygone times , as a temple to Diana . Part of it was evidently of Roman architecture , for there was no mistaking the beautiful light pillars which supported a dome , under which the sacrifices to the most captivating and poetical divinity of the heathen theocracy had probably been made ; but the original space between the pillars had been filled up with rubbish of a modern date , and the rest of the building was apparently of the architecture of the latter end of the Middle Ages . It was situated at one end of the building which had once been the seat of the Inquisition , and had served , before the erection of the present see , as the residence of the bishop . Within the see , where the governor now resides , is a superb library , occupying an immense vaulted room , like the aisle of a cathedral , and in a side apartment is a collection of paintings by Portuguese artists , chiefly portraits , amongst which is that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him justice , for it represents him in the shape of an awkward lad of about eighteen , with a bloated booby face with staring eyes , and a ruff round a short apoplectic neck . I was shown several beautifully illuminated missals and other manuscripts ; but the one which most arrested my attention , I scarcely need say why , was that which bore the following title : - " Forma sive ordinatio Capelli illustrissimi et xianissimi principis Henvici Sexti Regis Anglie et Francie am dm Hibernie descripta serenissio principi Alfonso Regi Portugalie illustri per humilem servitorem sm Willm . Sav . Decanu capelle supradicte . " It seemed a voice from the olden times of my dear native land ! This library and picture gallery had been formed by one of the latter bishops , a person of much learning and piety . In the evening I dined with Don Geronimo and his brother ; the latter soon left us to attend to his military duties . My friend and myself had now much conversation of considerable interest ; he lamented the deplorable state of ignorance in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend the governor and himself were endeavouring to establish a school in the vicinity , and that they had made application to the government for the use of an empty convent , called the Espinheiro , or thorn tree , at about a league 's distance , and that they had little doubt of their request being complied with . I had before told him who I was , and after expressing joy at the plan which he had in contemplation , I now urged him in the most pressing manner to use all his influence to make the knowledge of the Scripture the basis of the education which the children were to receive , and added , that half the Bibles and Testaments which I had brought with me to Evora were heartily at his service ; he instantly gave me his hand , said he accepted my offer with the greatest pleasure , and would do all in his power to forward my views , which were in many respects his own . I now told him that I did not come to Portugal with the view of propagating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of introducing the Bible , which is the well-head of all that is useful and conducive to the happiness of society ,  --  that I cared not what people called themselves , provided they followed the Bible as a guide ; for that where the Scriptures were read , neither priestcraft nor tyranny could long exist , and instanced the case of my own country , the cause of whose freedom and prosperity was the Bible , and that only , as the last persecutor of this book , the bloody and infamous Mary , was the last tyrant who had sat on the throne of England . We did not part till the night was considerably advanced , and the next morning I sent him the books , in the firm and confident hope that a bright and glorious morning was about to rise over the night which had so long cast its dreary shadows over the regions of the Alemtejo . The day after this interesting event , which was Saturday , I had more conversation with the man from Palmella . I asked him if in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered no , for that he generally travelled in company with others . " However , " said he , " were I alone I should have little fear , for I am well protected . " I said that I supposed he carried arms with him . " No other arms than this , " said he , pulling out one of those long desperate looking knives , of English manufacture , with which every Portuguese peasant is usually furnished . This knife serves for many purposes , and I should consider it a far more efficient weapon than a dagger . " But , " said he , " I do not place much confidence in the knife . " I then inquired in what rested his hope of protection . " In this , " said he : and unbuttoning his waistcoat , he showed me a small bag , attached to his neck by a silken string . " In this bag is an oracam , or prayer , written by a person of power , and as long as I carry it about with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading feature of my character , and I instantly said , with eagerness , that I should feel great pleasure in being permitted to read the prayer . " Well , " he replied , " you are my friend , and I would do for you what I would for few others , I will show it you . " He then asked for my penknife , and having unripped the bag , took out a large piece of paper closely folded up . I hurried to my apartment and commenced the examination of it . It was scrawled over in a very illegible hand , and was moreover much stained with perspiration , so that I had considerable difficulty in making myself master of its contents , but I at last accomplished the following literal translation of the charm , which was written in bad Portuguese , but which struck me at the time as being one of the most remarkable compositions that had ever come to my knowledge . THE CHARM " Just Judge and divine Son of the Virgin Maria , who wast born in Bethlehem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Jewry , I beseech thee , O Lord , by thy sixth day , that the body of me be not caught , nor put to death by the hands of justice at all ; peace be with you , the peace of Christ , may I receive peace , may you receive peace , said God to his disciples . If the accursed justice should distrust me , or have its eyes on me , in order to take me or to rob me , may its eyes not see me , may its mouth not speak to me , may it have ears which may not hear me , may it have hands which may not seize me , may it have feet which may not overtake me ; for may I be armed with the arms of St. George , covered with the cloak of Abraham , and shipped in the ark of Noah , so that it can neither see me , nor hear me , nor draw the blood from my body . I also adjure thee , O Lord , by those three blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three blessed clergymen , by those three consecrated hosts , that thou give me that sweet company which thou gavest to the Virgin Maria , from the gates of Bethlehem to the portals of Jerusalem , that I may go and come with pleasure and joy with Jesus Christ , the Son of the Virgin Maria , the prolific yet nevertheless the eternal virgin . " The woman of the house and her daughter had similar bags attached to their necks , containing charms , which , they said , prevented the witches having power to harm them . The belief in witchcraft is very prevalent amongst the peasantry of the Alemtejo , and I believe of other provinces of Portugal . This is one of the relies of the monkish system , the aim of which , in all countries where it has existed , seems to have been to beset the minds of the people , that they might be more easily misled . All these charms were fabrications of the monks , who had sold them to their infatuated confessants . The monks of the Greek and Syrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be poison , but which they would rather vend than the wholesome balm of the gospel , because it brings them a large price , and fosters the delusion which enables them to live a life of luxury . The Sunday morning was fine , and the plain before the church of the convent of San Francisco was crowded with people hastening to or returning from the mass . After having performed my morning devotion , and breakfasted , I went down to the kitchen ; the girl Geronima was seated by the fire . I inquired if she had heard mass ? She replied in the negative , and that she did not intend to hear it . Upon my inquiring her motive for absenting herself , she replied , that since the friars had been expelled from their churches and convents she had ceased to attend mass , or to confess herself ; for that the government priests had no spiritual power , and consequently she never troubled them . She said the friars were holy men and charitable ; for that every morning those of the convent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the meals of the preceding day , but that now these people were allowed to starve . I replied , that the friars , who lived on the fat of the land , could well afford to bestow a few bones upon their poor , and that their doing so was merely a part of their policy , by which they hoped to secure to themselves friends in time of need . The girl then observed , that as it was Sunday , I should perhaps like to see some books , and without waiting for a reply she produced them . They consisted principally of popular stories , with lives and miracles of saints , but amongst them was a translation of Volney 's Ruins of Empires . I expressed a wish to know how she became possessed of this book . She said that a young man , a great Constitutionalist , had given it to her some months previous , and had pressed her much to read it , for that it was one of the best books in the world . I replied , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enemy of Jesus Christ and the souls of mankind ; that it was written with the sole aim of bringing all religion into contempt , and that it inculcated the doctrine that there was no future state , nor reward for the righteous nor punishment for the wicked . She made no reply , but going into another room , returned with her apron full of dry sticks and brushwood , all which she piled upon the fire , and produced a bright blaze . She then took the book from my hand and placed it upon the flaming pile ; then sitting down , took her rosary out of her pocket and told her beads till the volume was consumed . This was an auto da fe in the best sense of the word . On the Monday and Tuesday I paid my usual visits to the fountain , and likewise rode about the neighbourhood on a mule , for the purpose of circulating tracts . I dropped a great many in the favourite walks of the people of Evora , as I felt rather dubious of their accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas , should they be observed lying on the ground , I thought that curiosity might cause them to be picked up and examined . I likewise , on the Tuesday evening , paid a farewell visit to my friend Azveto , as it was my intention to leave Evora on the Thursday following and return to Lisbon ; in which view I had engaged a calash of a man who informed me that he had served as a soldier in the grande armee of Napoleon , and been present in the Russian campaign . He looked the very image of a drunkard . His face was covered with carbuncles , and his breath impregnated with the fumes of strong waters . He wished much to converse with me in French , in the speaking of which language it seemed he prided himself , but I refused , and told him to speak the language of the country , or I would hold no discourse with him . Wednesday was stormy , with occasional rain . On coming down , I found that my friend from Palmella had departed : but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine fellows , and unlike the two I had seen the preceding week , who were of much lower degree , were chatty and communicative ; they spoke their native language , and no other , and seemed to hold the Portuguese in great contempt . The magnificent tones of the Spanish sounded to great advantage amidst the shrill squeaking dialect of Portugal . I was soon in deep conversation with them , and was much pleased to find that all of them could read . I presented the eldest , a man of about fifty years of age , with a tract in Spanish . He examined it for some time with great attention ; he then rose from his seat , and going into the middle of the apartment , began reading it aloud , slowly and emphatically ; his companions gathered around him , and every now and then expressed their approbation of what they heard . The reader occasionally called upon me to explain passages which , as they referred to particular texts of Scripture , he did not exactly understand , for not one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He continued reading for upwards of an hour , until he had finished the tract ; and , at its conclusion , the whole party were clamorous for similar ones , with which I was happy to be able to supply them . Most of these men spoke of priestcraft and the monkish system with the utmost abhorrence , and said that they should prefer death to submitting again to the yoke which had formerly galled their necks . I questioned them very particularly respecting the opinion of their neighbours and acquaintances on this point , and they assured me that in their part of the Spanish frontier all were of the same mind , and that they cared as little for the Pope and his monks as they did for Don Carlos ; for the latter was a dwarf ( chicotito ) and a tyrant , and the others were plunderers and robbers . I told them they must beware of confounding religion with priestcraft , and that in their abhorrence of the latter they must not forget that there is a God and a Christ to whom they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incumbent upon them to study on every occasion ; whereupon they all expressed a devout belief in Christ and the Virgin . These men , though in many respects more enlightened than the surrounding peasantry , were in others as much in the dark ; they believed in witchcraft and in the efficacy of particular charms . The night was very stormy , and at about nine we heard a galloping towards the door , and then a loud knocking ; it was opened , and in rushed a wild-looking man mounted on a donkey ; he wore a ragged jacket of sheepskin , called in Spanish zamarra , with breeches of the same as far down as his knees ; his legs were bare . Around his sombrero , or shadowy hat , was tied a large quantity of the herb which in English is called rosemary , in Spanish romero , and in the rustic language of Portugal , alecrim ; which last is a word of Scandinavian origin ( ellegren ) , signifying the elfin plant , and was probably carried into the south by the Vandals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witches had been pursuing him and hovering over his head for the last two leagues . He came from the Spanish frontier with meal and other articles ; he said that his wife was following him and would soon arrive , and in about a quarter of an hour she made her appearance , dripping with rain , and also mounted on a donkey . I asked my friends the contrabandistas why he wore the rosemary in his hat ; whereupon they told me that it was good against witches and the mischances on the road . I had no time to argue against this superstition , for , as the chaise was to be ready at five the next morning , I wished to make the most of the short time which I could devote to sleep . CHAPTER IV Vexatious Delays  --  Drunken Driver  --  The Murdered Mule  --  The Lamentation  --  Adventure on the Heath  --  Fear of Darkness  --  Portuguese Fidalgo  --  The Escort  --  Return to Lisbon . I rose at four , and after having taken some refreshment , I descended and found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fire , which was still burning ; they soon awoke and began preparing their breakfast , which consisted of salt sardinhas , broiled upon the embers . In the meantime the woman sang snatches of the beautiful hymn , very common in Spain , which commences thus : - " Once of old upon a mountain , shepherds overcome with sleep , Near to Bethlem 's holy tower , kept at dead of night their sheep ; Round about the trunk they nodded of a huge ignited oak , Whence the crackling flame ascending bright and clear the darkness broke . " On hearing that I was about to depart , she said , " You shall have some of my husband 's rosemary , which will keep you from danger , and prevent any misfortune occurring . " I was foolish enough to permit her to put some of it in my hat ; and the man having by this time arrived with his mules , I bade farewell to my friendly hostesses , and entered the chaise with my servant . I remarked at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever seen ; the largest could be little short of sixteen hands high ; and the fellow told me in his bad French that he loved them better than his wife and children . We turned round the corner of the convent and proceeded down the street which leads to the south-western gate . The driver now stopped before the door of a large house , and having alighted , said that it was yet very early , and that he was afraid to venture forth , as it was very probable we should be robbed , and himself murdered , as the robbers who resided in the town would be apprehensive of his discovering them , but that the family who lived in this house were going to Lisbon , and would depart in about a quarter of an hour , when we might avail ourselves of an escort of soldiers which they would take with them , and in their company we should run no danger . I told him I had no fear , and commanded him to drive on ; but he said he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , when two carriages came to the door of the house , but it seems the family were not yet ready , whereupon the coachman likewise got down and went away . At the expiration of about half an hour the family came out , and when their luggage had been arranged they called for the coachman , but he was nowhere to be found . Search was made for him , but ineffectually , and an hour more was spent before another driver could be procured ; but the escort had not yet made its appearance , and it was not before a servant had been twice despatched to the barracks that it arrived . At last everything was ready , and they drove off . All this time I had seen nothing of our own coachman , and I fully expected that he had abandoned us altogether . In a few minutes I saw him staggering up the street in a state of intoxication , attempting to sing the Marseillois hymn . I said nothing to him , but sat observing him . He stood for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French . At last he said , " I am not so drunk but I can ride , " and proceeded to lead his mules towards the gate . When out of the town he made several ineffectual attempts to mount the smallest mule which bore the saddle ; he at length succeeded , and instantly commenced spurring at a furious rate down the road . We arrived at a place where a narrow rocky path branched off , by taking which we should avoid a considerable circuit round the city wall , which otherwise it would be necessary to make before we could reach the road to Lisbon , which lay at the north-east ; he now said , " I shall take this path , for by so doing we shall overtake the family in a minute " ; so into the path we went ; it was scarcely wide enough to admit the carriage , and exceedingly steep and broken ; we proceeded ; ascending and descending , the wheels cracked , and the motion was so violent that we were in danger of being cast out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the carriage it must be broken in pieces , as our weight must insure its destruction . I called to him in Portuguese to stop , but he flogged and spurred the beasts the more . My man now entreated me for God 's sake to speak to him in French , for , if anything would pacify him , that would . I did so , and entreated him to let us dismount and walk , till we had cleared this dangerous way . The result justified Antonio 's anticipation . He instantly stopped and said , " Sir , you are master , you have only to command and I shall obey . " We dismounted and walked on till we reached the great road , when we once more seated ourselves . The family were about a quarter of a mile in advance , and we were no sooner reseated , than he lashed the mules into full gallop for the purpose of overtaking it ; his cloak had fallen from his shoulder , and , in endeavouring to readjust it , he dropped the string from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became entangled in the legs of the poor animal , which fell heavily on its neck , it struggled for a moment , and then lay stretched across the way , the shafts over its body . I was pitched forward into the dirt , and the drunken driver fell upon the murdered mule . I was in a great rage , and cried , " You drunken renegade , who are ashamed to speak the language of your own country , you have broken the staff of your existence , and may now starve . " " Paciencia , " said he , and began kicking the head of the mule , in order to make it rise ; but I pushed him down , and taking his knife , which had fallen from his pocket , cut the bands by which it was attached to the carriage , but life had fled , and the film of death had begun to cover its eyes . The fellow , in the recklessness of intoxication , seemed at first disposed to make light of his loss , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she should die , what more can be said ? Paciencia . " Meanwhile , I despatched Antonio to the town for the purpose of hiring mules , and , having taken my baggage from the chaise , waited on the roadside until he should arrive . The fumes of the liquor began now to depart from the fellow 's brain ; he clasped his hands and exclaimed , " Blessed Virgin , what is to become of me ? How am I to support myself ? Where am I to get another mule ! For my mule , my best mule is dead , she fell upon the road , and died of a sudden ! I have been in France , and in other countries , and have seen beasts of all kinds , but such a mule as that I have never seen ; but she is dead  --  my mule is dead  --  she fell upon the road and died of a sudden ! " He continued in this strain for a considerable time , and the burden of his lamentation was always , " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and died of a sudden . " At length he took the collar from the creature 's neck , and put it upon the other , which with some difficulty he placed in the shafts . A beautiful boy of about thirteen now came from the direction of the town , running along the road with the velocity of a hare : he stopped before the dead mule and burst into tears : it was the man 's son , who had heard of the accident from Antonio . This was too much for the poor fellow : he ran up to the boy , and said , " Do n't cry , our bread is gone , but it is God 's will ; the mule is dead ! " He then flung himself on the ground , uttering fearful cries . " I could have borne my loss , " said he , " but when I saw my child cry , I became a fool . " I gave him two or three crowns , and added some words of comfort ; assuring him I had no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take compassion on him and repair his loss . At length he became more composed , and placing my baggage in the chaise , we returned to the town , where I found two excellent riding mules awaiting my arrival at the inn . I did not see the Spanish woman , or I should have told her of the little efficacy of rosemary in this instance . I have known several drunkards amongst the Portuguese , but , without one exception , they have been individuals who , having travelled abroad , like this fellow , have returned with a contempt for their own country , and polluted with the worst vices of the lands which they have visited . I would strongly advise any of my countrymen who may chance to read these lines , that , if their fate lead them into Spain or Portugal , they avoid hiring as domestics , or being connected with , individuals of the lower classes who speak any other language than their own , as the probability is that they are heartless thieves and drunkards . These gentry are invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it is my opinion , grounded upon experience , that an individual who is capable of such baseness would not hesitate at the perpetration of any villainy , for next to the love of God , the love of country is the best preventive of crime . He who is proud of his country , will be particularly cautious not to do anything which is calculated to disgrace it . We now journeyed towards Lisbon , and reached Monte Moro about two o'clock . After taking such refreshment as the place afforded , we pursued our way till we were within a quarter of a league of the huts which stand on the edge of the savage wilderness we had before crossed . Here we were overtaken by a horseman ; he was a powerful , middle-sized man , and was mounted on a noble Spanish horse . He had a broad , slouching sombrero on his head , and wore a jerkin of blue cloth , with large bosses of silver for buttons , and clasps of the same metal ; he had breeches of yellow leather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable gun . He inquired if I intended to pass the night at Vendas Novas , and on my replying in the affirmative , he said that he would avail himself of our company . He now looked towards the sun , whose disk was rapidly sinking beneath the horizon , and entreated us to spur on and make the most of its light , for that the moor was a horrible place in the dusk . He placed himself at our head , and we trotted briskly on , the boy or muleteer who attended us running behind without exhibiting the slightest symptom of fatigue . We entered upon the moor , and had advanced about a mile when dark night fell around us ; we were in a wild path , with high brushwood on either side , when the rider said that he could not confront the darkness , and begged me to ride on before , and he would follow after : I could hear him trembling . I asked the reason of his terror , and he replied that at one time darkness was the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years he dreaded it , especially in wild places . I complied with his request , but I was ignorant of the way , and as I could scarcely see my hand , was continually going wrong . This made the man impatient , and he again placed himself at our head . We proceeded so for a considerable way , when he again stopped , and said that the power of the darkness was too much for him . His horse seemed to be infected with the same panic , for it shook in every limb . I now told him to call on the name of the Lord Jesus , who was able to turn the darkness into light , but he gave a terrible shout , and , brandishing his gun aloft , discharged it in the air . His horse sprang forward at full speed , and my mule , which was one of the swiftest of its kind , took fright and followed at the heels of the charger . Antonio and the boy were left behind . On we flew like a whirlwind , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire they struck from the stones . I knew not whither we were going , but the dumb creatures were acquainted with the way , and soon brought us to Vendas Novas , where we were rejoined by our companions . I thought this man was a coward , but I did him injustice , for during the day he was as brave as a lion , and feared no one . About five years since , he had overcome two robbers who had attacked him on the moors , and , after tying their hands behind them , had delivered them up to justice ; but at night the rustling of a leaf filled him with terror . I have known similar instances of the kind in persons of otherwise extraordinary resolution . For myself , I confess I am not a person of extraordinary resolution , but the dangers of the night daunt me no more than those of midday . The man in question was a farmer from Evora , and a person of considerable wealth . I found the inn at Vendas Novas thronged with people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was occupied by the family of a certain Fidalgo , from Estremoz ; he was on the way to Lisbon , conveying a large sum of money , as was said  - -  probably the rents of his estates . He had with him a body guard of four-and-twenty of his dependants , each armed with a rifle ; they consisted of his swineherds , shepherds , cowherds , and hunters , and were commanded by two youths , his son and nephew , the latter of whom was in regimentals ; nevertheless , notwithstanding the number of his troop , it appeared that the Fidalgo laboured under considerable apprehension of being despoiled upon the waste which lay between Vendas Novas and Pegoens , as he had just requested a guard of four soldiers from the officer who commanded a detachment stationed here : there were many females in his company , who , I was told , were his illegitimate daughters  --  for he bore an infamous moral character , and was represented to me as a staunch friend of Don Miguel . It was not long before he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat by the kitchen fire : he was a tall man of about sixty , but stooped much . His countenance was by no means pleasing : he had a long hooked nose , small twinkling cunning eyes , and , what I liked worst of all , a continual sneering smile , which I firmly believe to be the index of a treacherous and malignant heart . He addressed me in Spanish , which , as he resided not far from the frontier , he spoke with fluency , but contrary to my usual practice , I was reserved and silent . On the following morning I rose at seven , and found that the party from Estremoz had started several hours previously . I breakfasted with my acquaintance of the preceding night , and we set out to accomplish what remained of our journey . The sun had now arisen ; and all his fears had left him  --  he breathed defiance against all the robbers of the Alemtejo . When we had advanced about a league , the boy who attended us said he saw heads of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and causing his horse to make two or three lofty bounds , held it in one hand , the muzzle pointed in the direction indicated , but the heads did not again make their appearance , and it was probably but a false alarm . We resumed our way , and the conversation turned , as might be expected , upon robbers . My companion , who seemed to be acquainted with every inch of ground over which we passed , had a legend to tell of every dingle and every pine-clump . We reached a slight eminence , on the top of which grew three stately pines : about half a league farther on was another similar one : these two eminences commanded a view of the road from Pegoens and Vendas Novas , so that all people going and coming could be descried , whilst yet at a distance . My friend told me that these heights were favourite stations of robbers . Some two years since , a band of six mounted banditti remained there three days , and plundered whomsoever approached from either quarter : their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of the trees , and two scouts , one for each eminence , continually sat in the topmost branches and gave notice of the approach of travellers : when at a proper distance the robbers below sprang upon their horses , and putting them to full gallop , made at their prey , shouting Rendete , Picaro ! Rendete , Picaro ! ( Surrender , scoundrel , surrender ! ) We , however , passed unmolested , and , about a quarter of a mile before we reached Pegoens , overtook the family of the Fidalgo . Had they been conveying the wealth of Ind through the deserts of Arabia , they could not have travelled with more precaution . The nephew , with drawn sabre , rode in front ; pistols at his holsters , and the usual Spanish gun slung at his saddle . Behind him tramped six men in a rank , with muskets shouldered , and each of them wore at his girdle a hatchet , which was probably intended to cleave the thieves to the brisket should they venture to come to close quarters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which latter rode the Fidalgo and his daughters ; the others were covered carts , and seemed to be filled with household furniture ; each of these vehicles had an armed rustic on either side ; and the son , a lad about sixteen , brought up the rear with a squad equal to that of his cousin in the van . The soldiers , who by good fortune were light horse , and admirably mounted , were galloping about in all directions , for the purpose of driving the enemy from cover , should they happen to be lurking in the neighbourhood . I could not help thinking as I passed by , that this martial array was very injudicious , for though it was calculated to awe plunderers , it was likewise calculated to allure them , as it seemed to hint that immense wealth was passing through their territories . I do not know how the soldiers and rustics would have behaved in case of an attack ; but am inclined to believe that if three such men as Richard Turpin had suddenly galloped forth from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance opposed to them would have prevented them from bearing away the contents of the strong box jingling in their saddlebags . From this moment nothing worthy of relating occurred till our arrival at Aldea Gallega , where we passed the night , and next morning at three o'clock embarked in the passage-boat for Lisbon , where we arrived at eight  --  and thus terminates my first wandering in the Alemtejo . CHAPTER V The College  --  The Rector  --  Shibboleth  --  National Prejudices  --  Youthful Sports  --  Jews of Lisbon  --  Bad Faith  --  Crime and Superstition  --  Strange Proposal . One afternoon Antonio said to me , " It has struck me , Senhor , that your worship would like to see the college of the English  --  . " " By all means , " I replied , " pray conduct me thither . " So he led me through various streets until we stopped before the gate of a large building in one of the most elevated situations in Lisbon ; upon our ringing , a kind of porter presently made his appearance , and demanded our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment ; but presently , bidding us enter , conducted us to a large gloomy-looking stone hall , where , begging us to be seated , he left us . We were soon joined by a venerable personage , seemingly about seventy , in a kind of flowing robe or surplice , with a collegiate cap upon his head . Notwithstanding his age there was a ruddy tinge upon his features , which were perfectly English . Coming slowly up he addressed me in the English tongue , requesting to know how he could serve me . I informed him that I was an English traveller , and should be happy to be permitted to inspect the college , provided it were customary to show it to strangers . He informed me that there could be no objection to accede to my request , but that I came at rather an unfortunate moment , it being the hour of refection . I apologised , and was preparing to retire , but he begged me to remain , as , in a few minutes , the refection would be over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasure of waiting on me . We sat down on the stone bench , when he commenced surveying me attentively for some time , and then cast his eyes on Antonio . " Whom have we here ? " said he to the latter ; " surely your features are not unknown to me . " " Probably not , your reverence , " replied Antonio , getting up and bowing most profoundly . " I lived in the family of the Countess - , at Cintra , when your venerability was her spiritual guide . " " True , true , " said the old gentleman , sighing , " I remember you now . Ah , Antonio , things are strangely changed since then . A new government  --  a new system  --  a new religion , I may say . " Then looking again at me , he demanded whither I was journeying ? " I am going to Spain , " said I , " and have stopped at Lisbon by the way . " " Spain , Spain ! " said the old man ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain ; there is much bloodshedding in Spain at present , and violent wars and tumults . " " I consider the cause of Don Carlos as already crushed , " I replied ; " he has lost the only general capable of leading his armies to Madrid . Zumalacarregui , his Cid , has fallen . " " Do not flatter yourself ; I beg your pardon , but do not think , young man , that the Lord will permit the powers of darkness to triumph so easily ; the cause of Don Carlos is not lost ; its success did not depend on the life of a frail worm like him whom you have mentioned . " We continued in discourse some little time , when he arose , saying that by this time he believed the refection was concluded . He had scarcely left me five minutes when three individuals entered the stone hall , and advanced slowly towards me ;  --  the principals of the college , said I to myself ! and so indeed they were . The first of these gentlemen , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a thin spare person , somewhat above the middle height ; his complexion was very pale , his features emaciated but fine , his eyes dark and sparkling ; he might be about fifty  --  the other two were men in the prime of life . One was of rather low stature ; his features were dark , and wore that pinched and mortified expression so frequently to be observed in the countenance of the English - : the other was a bluff , ruddy , and rather good-looking young man ; all three were dressed alike in the usual college cap and silk gown . Coming up , the eldest of the three took me by the hand and thus addressed me in clear silvery tones : - " Welcome , Sir , to our poor house ; we are always happy to see in it a countryman from our beloved native land ; it will afford us extreme satisfaction to show you over it ; it is true that satisfaction is considerably diminished by the reflection that it possesses nothing worthy of the attention of a traveller ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy , and that as we walk about we will explain to you . Permit us , first of all , to introduce ourselves to you ; I am rector of this poor English house of refuge ; this gentleman is our professor of humanity , and this ( pointing to the ruddy personage ) is our professor of polite learning , Hebrew , and Syriac . " Myself .  --  I humbly salute you all ; excuse me if I inquire who was the venerable gentleman who put himself to the inconvenience of staying with me whilst I was awaiting your leisure . Rector .  --  O ! a most admirable personage , our almoner , our chaplain ; he came into this country before any of us were born , and here he has continued ever since . Now let us ascend that we may show you our poor house : but how is this , my dear Sir , how is it that I see you standing uncovered in our cold damp hall ? Myself .  --  I can easily explain that to you ; it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am just arrived from Russia , where I have spent some years . A Russian invariably takes off his hat whenever he enters beneath a roof , whether it pertain to hut , shop , or palace . To omit doing so would be considered as a mark of brutality and barbarism , and for the following reason : in every apartment of a Russian house there is a small picture of the Virgin stuck up in a corner , just below the ceiling  --  the hat is taken off out of respect to her . Quick glances of intelligence were exchanged by the three gentlemen . I had stumbled upon their shibboleth , and proclaimed myself an Ephraimite , and not of Gilead . I have no doubt that up to that moment they had considered me as one of themselves  --  a member , and perhaps a priest , of their own ancient , grand , and imposing religion , for such it is , I must confess  --  an error into which it was natural that they should fall . What motives could a Protestant have for intruding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspecting the economy of their establishment ? So far , however , from relaxing in their attention after this discovery , their politeness visibly increased , though , perhaps , a scrutinizing observer might have detected a shade of less cordiality in their manner . Rector .  --  Beneath the ceiling in every apartment ? I think I understood you so . How delightful  --  how truly interesting ; a picture of the BLESSED Virgin beneath the ceiling in every apartment of a Russian house ! Truly , this intelligence is as unexpected as it is delightful . I shall from this moment entertain a much higher opinion of the Russians than hitherto  --  most truly an example worthy of imitation . I wish sincerely that it was our own practice to place an IMAGE of the BLESSED Virgin beneath the ceiling in every corner of our houses . What say you , our professor of humanity ? What say you to the information so obligingly communicated to us by this excellent gentleman ? Humanity Professor .  --  It is , indeed , most delightful , most cheering , I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprepared for it . The adoration of the Blessed Virgin is becoming every day more extended in countries where it has hitherto been unknown or forgotten . Dr. W- , when he passed through Lisbon , gave me some most interesting details with respect to the labours of the propaganda in India . Even England , our own beloved country . . . . My obliging friends showed me all over their " poor house , " it certainly did not appear a very rich one ; it was spacious , and rather dilapidated . The library was small , and possessed nothing remarkable ; the view , however , from the roof , over the greater part of Lisbon and the Tagus , was very grand and noble ; but I did not visit this place in the hope of seeing busts , or books , or fine prospects ,  --  I visited this strange old house to converse with its inmates , for my favourite , I might say , my only study , is man . I found these gentlemen much what I had anticipated , for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English  --  establishment in a foreign land . They were full of amiability and courtesy to their heretic countryman , and though the advancement of their religion was with them an object of paramount importance , I soon found that , with ludicrous inconsistency , they cherished , to a wonderful degree , national prejudices almost extinct in the mother land , even to the disparagement of those of their own darling faith . I spoke of the English - , of their high respectability , and of the loyalty which they had uniformly displayed to their sovereign , though of a different religion , and by whom they had been not unfrequently subjected to much oppression and injustice . Rector .  --  My dear Sir , I am rejoiced to hear you ; I see that you are well acquainted with the great body of those of our faith in England . They are as you have well described them , a most respectable and loyal body ; from loyalty , indeed , they never swerved , and though they have been accused of plots and conspiracies , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were merely calumnies invented by their religious enemies . During the civil wars the English  --  cheerfully shed their blood and squandered their fortunes in the cause of the unfortunate martyr , notwithstanding that he never favoured them , and invariably looked upon them with suspicion . At present the English  --  are the most devoted subjects to our gracious sovereign . I should be happy if I could say as much for our Irish brethren ; but their conduct has been  --  oh ! detestable . Yet what can you expect ? The true  --  blush for them . A certain person is a disgrace to the church of which he pretends to be a servant . Where does he find in our canons sanction for his proceedings , his undutiful expressions towards one who is his sovereign by divine right , and who can do no wrong ? And above all , where does he find authority for inflaming the passions of a vile mob against a nation intended by nature and by position to command them ? Myself .  --  I believe there is an Irish college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ; but it does not flourish , there are few or no pupils . Oh ! I looked through a window , at a great height , and saw about twenty or thirty fine lads sporting in a court below . " This is as it should be , " said I ; " those boys will not make worse priests from a little early devotion to trap-ball and cudgel playing . I dislike a staid , serious , puritanic education , as I firmly believe that it encourages vice and hypocrisy . " We then went into the Rector 's room , where , above a crucifix , was hanging a small portrait . Myself .  --  That was a great and portentous man , honest withal . I believe the body of which he was the founder , and which has been so much decried , has effected infinitely more good than it has caused harm . Rector .  --  What do I hear ? You an Englishman , and a Protestant , and yet an admirer of Ignatius Loyola ? Myself .  --  I will say nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you have observed , I am a Protestant : but I am ready to assert that there are no people in the world better qualified , upon the whole , to be intrusted with the education of youth . Their moral system and discipline are truly admirable . Their pupils , in after life , are seldom vicious and licentious characters , and are in general men of learning , science , and possessed of every elegant accomplishment . I execrate the conduct of the liberals of Madrid in murdering last year the helpless fathers , by whose care and instruction two of the finest minds of Spain have been evolved  --  the two ornaments of the liberal cause and modern literature of Spain , for such are Toreno and Martinez de la Rosa . . . . Gathered in small clusters about the pillars at the lower extremities of the gold and silver streets in Lisbon , may be observed , about noon in every day , certain strange looking men , whose appearance is neither Portuguese nor European . Their dress generally consists of a red cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , a blue tunic girded at the waist with a red sash , and wide linen pantaloons or trousers . He who passes by these groups generally hears them conversing in broken Spanish or Portuguese , and occasionally in a harsh guttural language , which the oriental traveller knows to be the Arabic , or a dialect thereof . These people are the Jews of Lisbon . Into the midst of one of these groups I one day introduced myself , and pronounced a beraka , or blessing . I have lived in different parts of the world , much amongst the Hebrew race , and am well acquainted with their ways and phraseology . I was rather anxious to become acquainted with the state of the Portuguese Jews , and I had now an opportunity . " The man is a powerful rabbi , " said a voice in Arabic ; " it behoves us to treat him kindly . " They welcomed me . I favoured their mistake , and in a few days I knew all that related to them and their traffic in Lisbon . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred in number . With a few exceptions , they consist of escapados from the Barbary shore , from Tetuan , from Tangier , but principally from Mogadore ; fellows who have fled to a foreign land from the punishment due to their misdeeds . Their manner of life in Lisbon is worthy of such a goodly assemblage of amis reunis . The generality of them pretend to work in gold and silver , and keep small peddling shops ; they , however , principally depend for their livelihood on an extensive traffic in stolen goods which they carry on . It is said that there is honour amongst thieves , but this is certainly not the case with the Jews of Lisbon , for they are so greedy and avaricious , that they are constantly quarrelling about their ill-gotten gain , the result being that they frequently ruin each other . Their mutual jealousy is truly extraordinary . If one , by cheating and roguery , gains a cruzado in the presence of another , the latter instantly says I cry halves , and if the first refuse he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cheat each other has , with all its infamy , occasionally something extremely droll and ludicrous . I was one day in the shop of a Swiri , or Jew of Mogadore , when a Jew from Gibraltar entered , with a Portuguese female , who held in her hand a mantle , richly embroidered with gold . Gibraltar Jew ( speaking in broken Arabic ) .  --  Good-day , O Swiri ; God has favoured me this day ; here is a bargain by which we shall both gain . I have bought this mantle of the woman almost for nothing , for it is stolen ; but I am poor , as you know , I have not a cruzado ; pay her therefore the price , that we may then forthwith sell the mantle and divide the gain . Swiri.  --  Willingly , brother of Gibraltar ; I will pay the woman for the mantle ; it does not appear a bad one . Thereupon he flung two cruzados to the woman , who forthwith left the shop . Gibraltar Jew .  --  Thanks , brother Swirl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us go and sell the mantle , the gold alone is well worth a moidore ; but I am poor and have nothing to eat , give me , therefore , the half of that sum and keep the mantle ; I shall be content . Swiri.  --  May Allah blot out your name , you thief . What mean you by asking me for money ? I bought the mantle of the woman and paid for it . I know nothing of you . Go out of my doors , dog of a Nazarene , if not I will pay you with a kick . The dispute was referred to one of the sabios , or priests ; but the sabio , who was also from Mogadore , at once took the part of the Swiri , and decided that the other should have nothing . Whereupon the Gibraltar Jew cursed the sabio , his father , mother , and all his family . The sabio replied , " I put you in ndui , " a kind of purgatory or hell . " I put you in seven nduis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , superstitious fear speedily prevailed ; he faltered , became pale , and dropping his voice , retreated , trembling in every limb . The Jews have two synagogues in Lisbon , both are small ; one is , however , tolerably well furnished , it has its reading desk , and in the middle there is a rather handsome chandelier ; the other is little better than a sty , filthy to a degree , without ornament of any kind . The congregation of this last are thieves to a man ; no Jew of the slightest respectability ever enters it . How well do superstition and crime go hand in hand . These wretched beings break the eternal commandments of their Maker without scruple ; but they will not partake of the beast of the uncloven foot , and the fish which has no scales . They pay no regard to the denunciations of holy prophets against the children of sin , but they quake at the sound of a dark cabalistic word , pronounced by one perhaps their equal , or superior , in villainy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workers of iniquity . I was one day sauntering on the Caesodre , when a Jew , with whom I had previously exchanged a word or two , came up and addressed me . Jew .  --  The blessing of God upon you , brother ; I know you to be a wise and powerful man , and I have conceived much regard for you ; it is on that account that I wish to put you in the way of gaining much money . Come with me , and I will conduct you to a place where there are forty chests of tea . It is a sereka ( a robbery ) , and the thieves are willing to dispose of it for a trifle , for there is search being made , and they are in much fear . I can raise one half of what they demand , do you supply the other , we will then divide it , each shall go his own way and dispose of his portion . Myself .  --  Wherefore , O son of Arbat , do you propose this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad . Have you not your own people about you whom you know , and in whom you can confide ? Jew .  --  It is because I know our people here that I do not confide in them ; we are in the galoot of sin . Were I to confide in my brethren there would be a dispute , and perhaps they would rob me , and few of them have any money . Were I to apply to the sabio he might consent , but when I ask for my portion he would put me in ndui ! You I do not fear ; you are good and would do me no harm , unless I attempted to deceive you , and that I dare not do , for I know you are powerful . Come with me , master , for I wish to gain something , that I may return to Arbat , where I have children . . . Such are Jews in Lisbon . CHAPTER VI Cold of Portugal  --  Extortion prevented  --  Sensation of Loneliness  --  The Dog  --  The Convent  --  Enchanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About a fortnight after my return from Evora , having made the necessary preparations , I set out on my journey for Badajoz , from which town I intended to take the diligence to Madrid . Badajoz lies about a hundred miles distant from Lisbon , and is the principal frontier town of Spain in the direction of the Alemtejo . To reach this place , it was necessary to retravel the road as far as Monte More , which I had already passed in my excursion to Evora ; I had therefore very little pleasure to anticipate from novelty of scenery . Moreover , in this journey I should be a solitary traveller , with no other companion than the muleteer , as it was my intention to take my servant no farther than Aldea Gallega , for which place I started at four in the afternoon . Warned by former experience , I did not now embark in a small boat , but in one of the regular passage felouks , in which we reached Aldea Gallega , after a voyage of six hours ; for the boat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the crew were obliged to ply their huge oars the whole way . In a word , this passage was the reverse of the first ,  - -  safe in every respect ,  --  but so sluggish and tiresome , that I a hundred times wished myself again under the guidance of the wild lad , galloping before the hurricane over the foaming billows . From eight till ten the cold was truly terrible , and though I was closely wrapped in an excellent fur " shoob , " with which I had braved the frosts of Russian winters , I shivered in every limb , and was far more rejoiced when I again set my foot on the Alemtejo , than when I landed for the first time , after having escaped the horrors of the tempest . I took up my quarters for the night at a house to which my friend who feared the darkness had introduced me on my return from Evora , and where , though I paid mercilessly dear for everything , the accommodation was superior to that of the common inn in the square . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey myself and baggage to Elvas , from whence there are but three short leagues to the Spanish town of Badajoz . The people of the house informed me that they had an excellent pair at my disposal , but when I inquired the price , they were not ashamed to demand four moidores . I offered them three , which was too much , but which , however , they did not accept , for knowing me to be an Englishman , they thought they had an excellent opportunity to practise imposition , not imagining that a person so rich as an Englishman MUST be , would go out in a cold night for the sake of obtaining a reasonable bargain . They were , however , much mistaken , as I told them that rather than encourage them in their knavery , I should be content to return to Lisbon ; whereupon they dropped their demand to three and a half , but I made them no answer , and going out with Antonio , proceeded to the house of the old man who had accompanied us to Evora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed ; at length he arose and admitted us , but on hearing our object , he said that his mules were again gone to Evora , under the charge of the boy , for the purpose of transporting some articles of merchandise . He , however , recommended us to a person in the neighbourhood who kept mules for hire , and there Antonio engaged two fine beasts for two moidores and a half . I say he engaged them , for I stood aloof and spoke not , and the proprietor , who exhibited them , and who stood half-dressed , with a lamp in his hand and shivering with cold , was not aware that they were intended for a foreigner till the agreement was made , and he had received a part of the sum in earnest . I returned to the inn well pleased , and having taken some refreshment went to rest , paying little attention to the people , who glanced daggers at me from their small Jewish eyes . At five the next morning the mules were at the door ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; he was short but exceedingly strong built , and possessed the largest head which I ever beheld upon mortal shoulders ; neck he had none , at least I could discern nothing which could be entitled to that name . His features were hideously ugly , and upon addressing him I discovered that he was an idiot . Such was my intended companion in a journey of nearly a hundred miles , which would occupy four days , and which lay over the most savage and ill noted track in the whole kingdom . I took leave of my servant almost with tears , for he had always served me with the greatest fidelity , and had exhibited an assiduity and a wish to please which afforded me the utmost satisfaction . We started , my uncouth guide sitting tailor-fashion on the sumpter mule upon the baggage . The moon had just gone down , and the morning was pitchy dark , and , as usual , piercingly cold . He soon entered the dismal wood , which I had already traversed , and through which we wended our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound was to be heard save the trampling of the animals , not a breath of air moved the leafless branches , no animal stirred in the thickets , no bird , not even the owl , flew over our heads , all seemed desolate and dead , and during my many and far wanderings , I never experienced a greater sensation of loneliness , and a greater desire for conversation and an exchange of ideas than then . To speak to the idiot was useless , for though competent to show the road , with which he was well acquainted , he had no other answer than an uncouth laugh to any question put to him . Thus situated , like many other persons when human comfort is not at hand , I turned my heart to God , and began to commune with Him , the result of which was that my mind soon became quieted and comforted . We passed on our way uninterrupted ; no thieves showed themselves , nor indeed did we see a single individual until we arrived at Pegoens , and from thence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was welcomed with great kindness by the people of the hostelry of the latter place , who were well acquainted with me on account of my having twice passed the night under their roof . The name of the keeper of this is , or was , Joze Dias Azido , and unlike the generality of those of the same profession as himself in Portugal , he is an honest man , and a stranger and foreigner who takes up his quarters at his inn , may rest assured that he will not be most unmercifully pillaged and cheated when the hour of reckoning shall arrive , as he will not be charged a single re more than a native Portuguese on a similar occasion . I paid at this place exactly one half of the sum which was demanded from me at Arroyolos , where I passed the ensuing night , and where the accommodation was in every respect inferior . At twelve next day we arrived at Monte More , and , as I was not pressed for time , I determined upon viewing the ruins which cover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the town . Having ordered some refreshment at the inn where we dismounted , I ascended till I arrived at a large wall or rampart , which , at a certain altitude embraces the whole hill . I crossed a rude bridge of stones , which bestrides a small hollow or trench ; and passing by a large tower , entered through a portal into the enclosed part of the hill . On the left hand stood a church , in good preservation , and still devoted to the purposes of religion , but which I could not enter , as the door was locked , and I saw no one at hand to open it . I soon found that my curiosity had led me to a most extraordinary place , which quite beggars the scanty powers of description with which I am gifted . I stumbled on amongst ruined walls , and at one time found I was treading over vaults , as I suddenly started back from a yawning orifice into which my next step , as I strolled musing along , would have precipitated me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till I heard a tremendous bark , and presently an immense dog , such as those which guard the flocks in the neighbourhood against the wolves , came bounding to attack me " with eyes that glowed and fangs that grinned . " Had I retreated , or had recourse to any other mode of defence than that which I invariably practise under such circumstances , he would probably have worried me ; but I stooped till my chin nearly touched my knee , and looked him full in the eyes , and as John Leyden says , in the noblest ballad which the Land of Heather has produced : - " The hound he yowled and back he fled , As struck with fairy charm . " It is a fact known to many people , and I believe it has been frequently stated , that no large and fierce dog or animal of any kind , with the exception of the bull , which shuts its eyes and rushes blindly forward , will venture to attack an individual who confronts it with a firm and motionless countenance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to repel a bloodhound or bear of Finland in this manner than a dunghill cur or a terrier , against which a stick or a stone is a much more certain defence . This will astonish no one who considers that the calm reproving glance of reason , which allays the excesses of the mighty and courageous in our own species , has seldom any other effect than to add to the insolence of the feeble and foolish , who become placid as doves upon the infliction of chastisements , which if attempted to be applied to the former would only serve to render them more terrible , and like gunpowder cast on a flame , cause them in mad desperation to scatter destruction around them . The barking of the dog brought out from a kind of alley an elderly man , whom I supposed to be his master , and of whom I made some inquiries respecting the place . The man was civil , and informed me that he served as a soldier in the British army , under the " great lord , " during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nuns a little farther on , which he would show me , and thereupon led the way to the south-east part of the wall , where stood a large dilapidated edifice . We entered a dark stone apartment , at one corner of which was a kind of window occupied by a turning table , at which articles were received into the convent or delivered out . He rang the bell , and , without saying a word , retired , leaving me rather perplexed ; but presently I heard , though the speaker was invisible , a soft feminine voice demanding who I was , and what I wanted . I replied that I was an Englishman travelling into Spain , and that passing through Monte Moro I had ascended the hill for the purpose of seeing the ruins . The voice then said , " I suppose you are a military man going to fight against the king , like the rest of your countrymen . " " No , " said I , " I am not a military man , but a Christian , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel of Christ into a country where it is not known ; " whereupon there was a stifled titter , I then inquired if there were any copies of the Holy Scriptures in the convent , but the friendly voice could give me no information on that point , and I scarcely believe that its possessor understood the purport of my question . It informed me , that the office of lady abbess of the house was an annual one , and that every year there was a fresh superior ; on my inquiring whether the nuns did not frequently find the time exceedingly heavy on their hands , it stated that , when they had nothing better to do , they employed themselves in making cheesecakes , which were disposed of in the neighbourhood . I thanked the voice for its communications , and walked away . Whilst proceeding under the wall of the house towards the south-west , I heard a fresh and louder tittering above my head , and looking up , saw three or four windows crowded with dusky faces , and black waving hair ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the stranger . After kissing my hand repeatedly , I moved on , and soon arrived at the south-west end of this mountain of curiosities . There I found the remains of a large building , which seemed to have been originally erected in the shape of a cross . A tower at its eastern entrance was still entire ; the western side was quite in ruins , and stood on the verge of the hill overlooking the valley , at the bottom of which ran the stream I have spoken of on a former occasion . The day was intensely hot , notwithstanding the coldness of the preceding nights ; and the brilliant sun of Portugal now illumined a landscape of entrancing beauty . Groves of cork trees covered the farther side of the valley and the distant acclivities , exhibiting here and there charming vistas , where various flocks of cattle were feeding ; the soft murmur of the stream , which was at intervals chafed and broken by huge stones , ascended to my ears and filled my mind with delicious feelings . I sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shedding tears of rapture ; for , of all the pleasures which a bountiful God permitteth his children to enjoy , none are so dear to some hearts as the music of forests , and streams , and the view of the beauties of his glorious creation . An hour elapsed , and I still maintained my seat on the wall ; the past scenes of my life flitting before my eyes in airy and fantastic array , through which every now and then peeped trees and hills and other patches of the real landscape which I was confronting ; the sun burnt my visage , but I heeded it not ; and I believe that I should have remained till night , buried in these reveries , which , I confess , only served to enervate the mind , and steal many a minute which might be most profitably employed , had not the report of the gun of a fowler in the valley , which awakened the echoes of the woods , hills , and ruins , caused me to start on my feet , and remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the hostelry where I intended to pass the night . I bent my steps to the inn , passing along a kind of rampart : shortly before I reached the portal , which I have already mentioned , I observed a kind of vault on my right hand , scooped out of the side of the hill ; its roof was supported by three pillars , though part of it had given way towards the farther end , so that the light was admitted through a chasm in the top . It might have been intended for a chapel , a dungeon , or a cemetery , but I should rather think for the latter ; one thing I am certain of , that it was not the work of Moorish hands , and indeed throughout my wanderings in this place I saw nothing which reminded me of that most singular people . The hill on which the ruins stand was doubtless originally a strong fortress of the Moors , who , upon their first irruption into the peninsula , seized and fortified most of the lofty and naturally strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early period , so that the broken walls and edifices , which at present cover the hill , are probably remains of the labours of the Christians after the place had been rescued from the hands of the terrible enemies of their faith . Monte Moro will perhaps recall Cintra to the mind of the traveller , as it exhibits a distant resemblance to that place ; nevertheless , there is something in Cintra wild and savage , to which Monte Moro has no pretension ; its scathed and gigantic crags are piled upon each other in a manner which seems to menace headlong destruction to whatever is in the neighbourhood ; and the ruins which still cling to those crags seem more like eagles ' nests than the remains of the habitations even of Moors ; whereas those of Monte Moro stand comparatively at their ease on the broad back of a hill , which , though stately and commanding , has no crags nor precipices , and which can be ascended on every side without much difficulty : yet I was much gratified by my visit , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dilapidated convent , the ruined walls amongst which I strayed , and the rampart where , sunk in dreamy rapture , I sat during a bright sunny hour at Monte Moro . I returned to the inn , where I refreshed myself with tea and very sweet and delicious cheesecakes , the handiwork of the nuns in the convent above . Observing gloom and unhappiness on the countenances of the people of the house , I inquired the reason of the hostess , who sat almost motionless , on the hearth by the fire ; whereupon she informed me that her husband was deadly sick with a disorder which , from her description , I supposed to be a species of cholera ; she added , that the surgeon who attended him entertained no hopes of his recovery . I replied that it was quite in the power of God to restore her husband in a few hours from the verge of the grave to health and vigour , and that it was her duty to pray to that Omnipotent Being with all fervency . I added , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , I was ready to pray for her , provided she would join in the spirit of the supplication . I then offered up a short prayer in Portuguese , in which I entreated the Lord to remove , if he thought proper , the burden of affliction under which the family was labouring . The woman listened attentively , with her hands devoutly clasped , until the prayer was finished , and then gazed at me seemingly with astonishment , but uttered no word by which I could gather that she was pleased or displeased with what I had said . I now bade the family farewell , and having mounted my mule , set forward to Arroyolos . CHAPTER VII The Druids ' Stone  --  The Young Spaniard  --  Ruffianly Soldiers  --  Evils of War  --  Estremoz  --  The Brawl  --  Ruined Watch Tower  --  Glimpse of Spain  --  Old Times and New . After proceeding about a league and a half , a blast came booming from the north , rolling before it immense clouds of dust ; happily it did not blow in our faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great was its violence . We had left the road in order to take advantage of one of those short cuts , which , though possible for a horse or a mule , are far too rough to permit any species of carriage to travel along them . We were in the midst of sands , brushwood , and huge pieces of rock , which thickly studded the ground . These are the stones which form the sierras of Spain and Portugal ; those singular mountains which rise in naked horridness , like the ribs of some mighty carcass from which the flesh has been torn . Many of these stones , or rocks , grew out of the earth , and many lay on its surface unattached , perhaps wrested from their bed by the waters of the deluge . Whilst toiling along these wild wastes , I observed , a little way to my left , a pile of stones of rather a singular appearance , and rode up to it . It was a druidical altar , and the most perfect and beautiful one of the kind which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of stones immensely large and heavy at the bottom , which towards the top became thinner and thinner , having been fashioned by the hand of art to something of the shape of scollop shells . These were surmounted by a very large flat stone , which slanted down towards the south , where was a door . Three or four individuals might have taken shelter within the interior , in which was growing a small thorn tree . I gazed with reverence and awe upon the pile where the first colonies of Europe offered their worship to the unknown God . The temples of the mighty and skilful Roman , comparatively of modern date , have crumbled to dust in its neighbourhood . The churches of the Arian Goth , his successor in power , have sunk beneath the earth , and are not to be found ; and the mosques of the Moor , the conqueror of the Goth , where and what are they ? Upon the rock , masses of hoary and vanishing ruin . Not so the Druids ' stone ; there it stands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new as the day , perhaps thirty centuries back , when it was first raised , by means which are a mystery . Earthquakes have heaved it , but its copestone has not fallen ; rain floods have deluged it , but failed to sweep it from its station ; the burning sun has flashed upon it , but neither split nor crumbled it ; and time , stern old time , has rubbed it with his iron tooth , and with what effect let those who view it declare . There it stands , and he who wishes to study the literature , the learning , and the history of the ancient Celt and Cymbrian , may gaze on its broad covering , and glean from that blank stone the whole known amount . The Roman has left behind him his deathless writings , his history , and his songs ; the Goth his liturgy , his traditions , and the germs of noble institutions ; the Moor his chivalry , his discoveries in medicine , and the foundations of modern commerce ; and where is the memorial of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We arrived at Arroyolos about seven at night . I took possession of a large two-bedded room , and , as I was preparing to sit down to supper , the hostess came to inquire whether I had any objection to receive a young Spaniard for the night . She said he had just arrived with a train of muleteers , and that she had no other room in which she could lodge him . I replied that I was willing , and in about half an hour he made his appearance , having first supped with his companions . He was a very gentlemanly , good-looking lad of seventeen . He addressed me in his native language , and , finding that I understood him , he commenced talking with astonishing volubility . In the space of five minutes he informed me that , having a desire to see the world , he had run away from his friends , who were people of opulence at Madrid , and that he did not intend to return until he had travelled through various countries . I told him that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very wicked and foolish action ; wicked , because he must have overwhelmed those with grief whom he was bound to honour and love , and foolish , inasmuch as he was going to expose himself to inconceivable miseries and hardships , which would shortly cause him to rue the step he had taken ; that he would be only welcome in foreign countries so long as he had money to spend , and when he had none , he would be repulsed as a vagabond , and would perhaps be allowed to perish of hunger . He replied that he had a considerable sum of money with him , no less than a hundred dollars , which would last him a long time , and that when it was spent he should perhaps be able to obtain more . " Your hundred dollars , " said I , " will scarcely last you three months in the country in which you are , even if it be not stolen from you ; and you may as well hope to gather money on the tops of the mountains as expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet sufficiently drank of the cup of experience to attend much to what I said , and I soon after changed the subject . About five next morning he came to my bedside to take leave , as his muleteers were preparing to depart . I gave him the usual Spanish valediction ( Vaya usted con Dios ) , and saw no more of him . At nine , after having paid a most exorbitant sum for slight accommodation , I started from Arroyolos , which is a town or large village situated on very elevated ground , and discernible afar off . It can boast of the remains of a large ancient and seemingly Moorish castle , which stands on a hill on the left as you take the road to Estremoz . About a mile from Arroyolos I overtook a train of carts escorted by a number of Portuguese soldiers , conveying stores and ammunition into Spain . Six or seven of these soldiers marched a considerable way in front ; they were villainous looking ruffians upon whose livid and ghastly countenances were written murder , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed by , one of them , with a harsh , croaking voice , commenced cursing all foreigners . " There , " said he , " is this Frenchman riding on horseback " ( I was on a mule ) , " with a man " ( the idiot ) " to take care of him , and all because he is rich ; whilst I , who am a poor soldier , am obliged to tramp on foot . I could find it in my heart to shoot him dead , for in what respect is he better than I ? But he is a foreigner , and the devil helps foreigners and hates the Portuguese . " He continued shouting his remarks until I got about forty yards in advance , when I commenced laughing ; but it would have been more prudent in me to have held my peace , for the next moment , with bang  --  bang , two bullets , well aimed , came whizzing past my ears . A small river lay just before me , though the bridge was a considerable way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closely followed by my terrified guide , and commenced galloping along a sandy plain on the other side , and so escaped with my life . These fellows , with the look of banditti , were in no respect better ; and the traveller who should meet them in a solitary place would have little reason to bless his good fortune . One of the carriers ( all of whom were Spaniards from the neighbourhood of Badajoz , and had been despatched into Portugal for the purpose of conveying the stores ) , whom I afterwards met in the aforesaid town , informed me that the whole party were equally bad , and that he and his companions had been plundered by them of various articles , and threatened with death if they attempted to complain . How frightful to figure to oneself an army of such beings in a foreign land , sent thither either to invade or defend ; and yet Spain , at the time I am writing this , is looking forward to armed assistance from Portugal . May the Lord in his mercy grant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different stamp : and yet , from the lax state of discipline which exists in the Portuguese army , in comparison with that of England and France , I am afraid that the inoffensive population of the disturbed provinces will say that wolves have been summoned to chase away foxes from the sheepfold . O ! may I live to see the day when soldiery will no longer be tolerated in any civilized , or at least Christian , country ! I pursued my route to Estremoz , passing by Monte Moro Novo , which is a tall dusky hill , surmounted by an ancient edifice , probably Moorish . The country was dreary and deserted , but offering here and there a valley studded with cork trees and azinheiras . After midday the wind , which during the night and morning had much abated , again blew with such violence as nearly to deprive me of my senses , though it was still in our rear . I was heartily glad when , on ascending a rising ground , at about four o'clock , I saw Estremoz on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here the view became wildly interesting ; the sun was sinking in the midst of red and stormy clouds , and its rays were reflected on the dun walls of the lofty town to which we were wending . Nor far distant to the south-west rose Serra Dorso , which I had seen from Evora , and which is the most beautiful mountain in the Alemtejo . My idiot guide turned his uncouth visage towards it , and becoming suddenly inspired , opened his mouth for the first time during the day , I might almost say since we had left Aldea Gallega , and began to tell me what rare hunting was to be obtained in that mountain . He likewise described with great minuteness a wonderful dog , which was kept in the neighbourhood for the purpose of catching the wolves and wild boars , and for which the proprietor had refused twenty moidores . At length we reached Estremoz , and took up our quarters at the principal inn , which looks upon a large plain or market-place occupying the centre of the town , and which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least might perform their evolutions there with case . The cold was far too terrible to permit me to remain in the chamber to which I had been conducted ; I therefore went down to a kind of kitchen on one side of the arched passage , which led under the house to the yard and stables . A tremendous withering blast poured through this passage , like the water through the flush of a mill . A large cork tree was blazing in the kitchen beneath a spacious chimney ; and around it were gathered a noisy crew of peasants and farmers from the neighbourhood , and three or four Spanish smugglers from the frontier . I with difficulty obtained a place amongst them , as a Portuguese or a Spaniard will seldom make way for a stranger , till called upon or pushed aside , but prefers gazing upon him with an expression which seems to say , I know what you want , but I prefer remaining where I am . I now first began to observe an alteration in the language spoken ; it had become less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , the speakers used the Spanish title of courtesy usted , or your worthiness , instead of the Portuguese high flowing vossem se , or your lordship . This is the result of constant communication with the natives of Spain , who never condescend to speak Portuguese , even when in Portugal , but persist in the use of their own beautiful language , which , perhaps , at some future period , the Portuguese will generally adopt . This would greatly facilitate the union of the two countries , hitherto kept asunder by the natural waywardness of mankind . I had not been seated long before the blazing pile , when a fellow , mounted on a fine spirited horse , dashed from the stables through the passage into the kitchen , where he commenced displaying his horsemanship , by causing the animal to wheel about with the velocity of a millstone , to the great danger of everybody in the apartment . He then galloped out upon the plain , and after half an hour 's absence returned , and having placed his horse once more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom he commenced talking in a gibberish of which I understood very little , but which he intended for French . He was half intoxicated , and soon became three parts so , by swallowing glass after glass of aguardiente . Finding that I made him no answer , he directed his discourse to one of the contrabandistas , to whom he talked in bad Spanish . The latter either did not or would not understand him ; but at last , losing patience , called him a drunkard , and told him to hold his tongue . The fellow , enraged at this contempt , flung the glass out of which he was drinking at the Spaniard 's head , who sprang up like a tiger , and unsheathing instantly a snick and snee knife , made an upward cut at the fellow 's cheek , and would have infallibly laid it open , had I not pulled his arm down just in time to prevent worse effects than a scratch above the lower jawbone , which , however , drew blood . The smuggler 's companions interfered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small apartment in the rear of the house , where they slept , and kept the furniture of their mules . The drunkard then commenced singing , or rather yelling , the Marseillois hymn ; and after having annoyed every one for nearly an hour , was persuaded to mount his horse and depart , accompanied by one of his neighbours . He was a pig merchant of the vicinity , but had formerly been a trooper in the army of Napoleon , where , I suppose , like the drunken coachman of Evora , he had picked up his French and his habits of intoxication . From Estremoz to Elvas the distance is six leagues . I started at nine next morning ; the first part of the way lay through an enclosed country , but we soon emerged upon wild bleak downs , over which the wind , which still pursued us , howled most mournfully . We met no one on the route ; and the scene was desolate in the extreme ; the heaven was of a dark grey , through which no glimpse of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great distance , on an elevated ground , rose a tower  --  the only object which broke the monotony of the waste . In about two hours from the time when we first discovered it , we reached a fountain , at the foot of the hill on which it stood ; the water , which gushed into a long stone trough , was beautifully clear and transparent , and we stopped here to water the animals . Having dismounted , I left the guide , and proceeded to ascend the hill on which the tower stood . Though the ascent was very gentle I did not accomplish it without difficulty ; the ground was covered with sharp stones , which , in two or three instances , cut through my boots and wounded my feet ; and the distance was much greater than I had expected . I at last arrived at the ruin , for such it was . I found it had been one of those watch towers or small fortresses called in Portuguese atalaias ; it was square , and surrounded by a wall , broken down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lower part being of solid stone work ; but on one side were crevices at intervals between the stones , for the purpose of placing the feet , and up this rude staircase I climbed to a small apartment , about five feet square , from which the top had fallen . It commanded an extensive view from all sides , and had evidently been built for the accommodation of those whose business it was to keep watch on the frontier , and at the appearance of an enemy to alarm the country by signals  --  probably by a fire . Resolute men might have defended themselves in this little fastness against many assailants , who must have been completely exposed to their arrows or musketry in the ascent . Being about to leave the place , I heard a strange cry behind a part of the wall which I had not visited , and hastening thither , I found a miserable object in rags , seated upon a stone . It was a maniac  - -  a man about thirty years of age , and I believe deaf and dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorting his wild features into various dreadful appearances . There wanted nothing but this object to render the scene complete ; banditti amongst such melancholy desolation would have been by no means so much in keeping . But the maniac , on his stone , in the rear of the wind-beaten ruin , overlooking the blasted heath , above which scowled the leaden heaven , presented such a picture of gloom and misery as I believe neither painter nor poet ever conceived in the saddest of their musings . This is not the first instance in which it has been my lot to verify the wisdom of the saying , that truth is sometimes wilder than fiction . I remounted my mule , and proceeded till , on the top of another hill , my guide suddenly exclaimed , " there is Elvas . " I looked in the direction in which he pointed , and beheld a town perched on the top of a lofty hill . On the other side of a deep valley towards the left rose another hill , much higher , on the top of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strongest place in Portugal . Through the opening between the fort and the town , but in the background and far in Spain , I discerned the misty sides and cloudy head of a stately mountain , which I afterwards learned was Albuquerque , one of the loftiest of Estremadura . We now got into a cultivated country , and following the road , which wound amongst hedgerows , we arrived at a place where the ground began gradually to shelve down . Here , on the right , was the commencement of an aqueduct by means of which the town on the opposite hill was supplied ; it was at this point scarcely two feet in altitude , but , as we descended , it became higher and higher , and its proportions more colossal . Near the bottom of the valley it took a turn to the left , bestriding the road with one of its arches . I looked up , after passing under it ; the water must have been flowing near a hundred feet above my head , and I was filled with wonder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , however , one feature which was no slight drawback to its pretensions to grandeur and magnificence ; the water was supported not by gigantic single arches , like those of the aqueduct of Lisbon , which stalk over the valley like legs of Titans , but by three layers of arches , which , like three distinct aqueducts , rise above each other . The expense and labour necessary for the erection of such a structure must have been enormous ; and , when we reflect with what comparative ease modern art would confer the same advantage , we can not help congratulating ourselves that we live in times when it is not necessary to exhaust the wealth of a province to supply a town on a hill with one of the first necessaries of existence . CHAPTER VIII Elvas  --  Extraordinary Longevity  --  The English Nation  --  Portuguese Ingratitude  --  Illiberality  --  Fortifications  --  Spanish Beggar  --  Badajoz -- The Custom House . Arrived at the gate of Elvas , an officer came out of a kind of guard house , and , having asked me some questions , despatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my passport might be viseed , as upon the frontier they are much more particular with respect to passports than in other parts . This matter having been settled , I entered an hostelry near the same gate , which had been recommended to me by my host at Vendas Novas , and which was kept by a person of the name of Joze Rosado . It was the best in the town , though , for convenience and accommodation , inferior to a hedge alehouse in England . The cold still pursued me , and I was glad to take refuge in an inner kitchen , which , when the door was not open , was only lighted by a fire burning somewhat dimly on the hearth . An elderly female sat beside it in her chair , telling her beads : there was something singular and extraordinary in her look , as well as I could discern by the imperfect light of the apartment . I put a few unimportant questions to her , to which she replied , but seemed to be afflicted to a slight degree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that I believed she was older than myself , but that I was confident she had less snow on her head . " How old may you be , cavalier ? " said she , giving me that title which in Spain is generally used when an extraordinary degree of respect is wished to be exhibited . I answered that I was near thirty . " Then , " said she , " you were right in supposing that I am older than yourself ; I am older than your mother , or your mother 's mother : it is more than a hundred years since I was a girl , and sported with the daughters of the town on the hillside . " " In that case , " said I , " you doubtless remember the earthquake . " " Yes , " she replied , " if there is any occurrence in my life that I remember , it is that : I was in the church of Elvas at the moment , hearing the mass of the king , and the priest fell on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall never forget how the earth shook ; it made us all sick ; and the houses and walls reeled like drunkards . Since that happened I have seen fourscore years pass by me , yet I was older then than you are now . " I looked with wonder at this surprising female , and could scarcely believe her words . I was , however , assured that she was in fact upwards of a hundred and ten years of age , and was considered the oldest person in Portugal . She still retained the use of her faculties in as full a degree as the generality of people who have scarcely attained the half of her age . She was related to the people of the house . As the night advanced , several persons entered for the purpose of enjoying the comfort of the fire and for the sake of conversation , for the house was a kind of news room , where the principal speaker was the host , a man of some shrewdness and experience , who had served as a soldier in the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate . After a few observations , this gentleman , who was a good-looking young man of five-and-twenty , began to burst forth in violent declamation against the English nation and government , who , he said , had at all times proved themselves selfish and deceitful , but that their present conduct in respect to Spain was particularly infamous , for though it was in their power to put an end to the war at once , by sending a large army thither , they preferred sending a handful of troops , in order that the war might be prolonged , for no other reason than that it was of advantage to them . Having paid him an ironical compliment for his politeness and urbanity , I asked whether he reckoned amongst the selfish actions of the English government and nation , their having expended hundreds of millions of pounds sterling , and an ocean of precious blood , in fighting the battles of Spain and Portugal against Napoleon . " Surely , " said I , " the fort of Elvas above our heads , and still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting English selfishness , and must , every time you view them , confirm you in the opinion which you have just expressed . And then , with respect to the present combat in Spain , the gratitude which that country evinced to England after the French , by means of English armies , had been expelled ,  - -  gratitude evinced by discouraging the trade of England on all occasions , and by offering up masses in thanksgiving when the English heretics quitted the Spanish shores ,  --  ought now to induce England to exhaust and ruin herself , for the sake of hunting Don Carlos out of his mountains . In deference to your superior judgment , " continued I to the officer , " I will endeavour to believe that it would be for the advantage of England were the war prolonged for an indefinite period ; nevertheless , you would do me a particular favour by explaining by what process in chemistry blood shed in Spain will find its way into the English treasury in the shape of gold . " As he was not ready with his answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table beside me , and said , " What do you call these fruits ? " " Pomegranates and bolotas , " he replied . " Right , " said I , " a home-bred Englishman could not have given me that answer ; yet he is as much acquainted with pomegranates and bolotas as your lordship is with the line of conduct which it is incumbent upon England to pursue in her foreign and domestic policy . " This answer of mine , I confess , was not that of a Christian , and proved to me how much of the leaven of the ancient man still pervaded me ; yet I must be permitted to add , that I believe no other provocation would have elicited from me a reply so full of angry feeling : but I could not command myself when I heard my own glorious land traduced in this unmerited manner . By whom ? A Portuguese ! A native of a country which has been twice liberated from horrid and detestable thraldom by the hands of Englishmen . But for Wellington and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but for Napier and his mariners , Miguel would now be lording it in Lisbon . To return , however , to the officer ; every one laughed at him , and he presently went away . The next day I became acquainted with a respectable tradesman of the name of Almeida , a man of talent , though rather rough in his manners . He expressed great abhorrence of the papal system , which had so long spread a darkness like that of death over his unfortunate country , and I had no sooner informed him that I had brought with me a certain quantity of Testaments , which it was my intention to leave for sale at Elvas , than he expressed a great desire to undertake the charge , and said that he would do the utmost in his power to procure a sale for them amongst his numerous customers . Upon showing him a copy , I remarked , your name is upon the title page ; the Portuguese version of the Holy Scriptures , circulated by the Bible Society , having been executed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the year 1712 ; whereupon he smiled , and observed that he esteemed it an honour to be connected in name at least with such a man . He scoffed at the idea of receiving any remuneration , and assured me that the feeling of being permitted to co-operate in so holy and useful a cause as the circulation of the Scriptures was quite a sufficient reward . After having accomplished this matter , I proceeded to survey the environs of the place , and strolled up the hill to the fort on the north side of the town . The lower part of the hill is planted with azinheiras , which give it a picturesque appearance , and at the bottom is a small brook , which I crossed by means of stepping stones . Arrived at the gate of the fort , I was stopped by the sentry , who , however , civilly told me , that if I sent in my name to the commanding officer he would make no objection to my visiting the interior . I accordingly sent in my card by a soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stone , waited his return . He presently appeared , and inquired whether I was an Englishman ; to which , having replied in the affirmative , he said , " In that case , sir , you can not enter ; indeed , it is not the custom to permit any foreigners to visit the fort . " I answered that it was perfectly indifferent to me whether I visited it or not ; and , having taken a survey of Badajoz from the eastern side of the hill , descended by the way I came . This is one of the beneficial results of protecting a nation and squandering blood and treasure in its defence . The English , who have never been at war with Portugal , who have fought for its independence on land and sea , and always with success , who have forced themselves by a treaty of commerce to drink its coarse and filthy wines , which no other nation cares to taste , are the most unpopular people who visit Portugal . The French have ravaged the country with fire and sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the French buy not its fruits and loathe its wines , yet there is no bad spirit in Portugal towards the French . The reason of this is no mystery ; it is the nature not of the Portuguese only , but of corrupt and unregenerate man , to dislike his benefactors , who , by conferring benefits upon him , mortify in the most generous manner his miserable vanity . There is no country in which the English are so popular as in France ; but , though the French have been frequently roughly handled by the English , and have seen their capital occupied by an English army , they have never been subjected to the supposed ignominy of receiving assistance from them . The fortifications of Elvas are models of their kind , and , at the first view , it would seem that the town , if well garrisoned , might bid defiance to any hostile power ; but it has its weak point : the western side is commanded by a hill , at the distance of half a mile , from which an experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the last town in this part of Portugal , the distance to the Spanish frontier being barely two leagues . It was evidently built as a rival to Badajoz , upon which it looks down from its height across a sandy plain and over the sullen waters of the Guadiana ; but , though a strong town , it can scarcely be called a defence to the frontier , which is open on all sides , so that there would not be the slightest necessity for an invading army to approach within a dozen leagues of its walls , should it be disposed to avoid them . Its fortifications are so extensive that ten thousand men at least would be required to man them , who , in the event of an invasion , might be far better employed in meeting the enemy in the open field . The French , during their occupation of Portugal , kept a small force in this place , who , at the approach of the British , retreated to the fort , where they shortly after capitulated . Having nothing farther to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier into Spain . My idiot guide was on his way back to Aldea Gallega ; and , on the fifth of January , I mounted a sorry mule without bridle or stirrups , which I guided by a species of halter , and followed by a lad who was to attend me on another , I spurred down the hill of Elvas to the plain , eager to arrive in old chivalrous romantic Spain . But I soon found that I had no need to quicken the beast which bore me , for though covered with sores , wall-eyed , and with a kind of halt in its gait , it cantered along like the wind . In little more than half an hour we arrived at a brook , whose waters ran vigorously between steep banks . A man who was standing on the side directed me to the ford in the squeaking dialect of Portugal ; but whilst I was yet splashing through the water , a voice from the other bank hailed me , in the magnificent language of Spain , in this guise : " O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amor de Dios , una limosnita para que io me compre un traguillo de vino tinto " ( Charity , Sir Cavalier , for the love of God , bestow an alms upon me , that I may purchase a mouthful of red wine ) . In a moment I was on Spanish ground , as the brook , which is called Acaia , is the boundary here of the two kingdoms , and having flung the beggar a small piece of silver , I cried in ecstasy " Santiago y cierra Espana ! " and scoured on my way with more speed than before , paying , as Gil Blas says , little heed to the torrent of blessings which the mendicant poured forth in my rear : yet never was charity more unwisely bestowed , for I was subsequently informed that the fellow was a confirmed drunkard , who took his station every morning at the ford , where he remained the whole day for the purpose of extorting money from the passengers , which he regularly spent every night in the wine-shops of Badajoz . To those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who refused , curses ; being equally skilled and fluent in the use of either . Badajoz was now in view , at the distance of little more than half a league . We soon took a turn to the left , towards a bridge of many arches across the Guadiana , which , though so famed in song and ballad , is a very unpicturesque stream , shallow and sluggish , though tolerably wide ; its banks were white with linen which the washer-women had spread out to dry in the sun , which was shining brightly ; I heard their singing at a great distance , and the theme seemed to be the praises of the river where they were toiling , for as I approached , I could distinguish Guadiana , Guadiana , which reverberated far and wide , pronounced by the clear and strong voices of many a dark-checked maid and matron . I thought there was some analogy between their employment and my own : I was about to tan my northern complexion by exposing myself to the hot sun of Spain , in the humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stains of Popery from the minds of its children , with whom I had little acquaintance , whilst they were bronzing themselves on the banks of the river in order to make white the garments of strangers : the words of an eastern poet returned forcibly to my mind . " I 'll weary myself each night and each day , To aid my unfortunate brothers ; As the laundress tans her own face in the ray , To cleanse the garments of others . " Having crossed the bridge , we arrived at the northern gate , when out rushed from a species of sentry box a fellow wearing on his head a high-peaked Andalusian hat , with his figure wrapped up in one of those immense cloaks so well known to those who have travelled in Spain , and which none but a Spaniard can wear in a becoming manner : without saying a word , he laid hold of the halter of the mule , and began to lead it through the gate up a dirty street , crowded with long-cloaked people like himself . I asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer , the boy , however , who waited upon me said that it was one of the gate-keepers , and that he was conducting us to the Custom House or Alfandega , where the baggage would be examined . Having arrived there , the fellow , who still maintained a dogged silence , began to pull the trunks off the sumpter mule , and commenced uncording them . I was about to give him a severe reproof for his brutality , but before I could open my mouth a stout elderly personage appeared at the door , who I soon found was the principal officer . He looked at me for a moment and then asked me , in the English language , if I was an Englishman . On my replying in the affirmative , he demanded of the fellow how he dared to have the insolence to touch the baggage , without orders , and sternly bade him cord up the trunks again and place them on the mule , which he performed without uttering a word . The gentleman then asked what the trunks contained : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the insolence of the subordinate , and informed him that I was at liberty to proceed where I thought proper . I thanked him for his exceeding politeness , and , under guidance of the boy , made the best of my way to the Inn of the Three Nations , to which I had been recommended at Elvas . CHAPTER IX Badajoz  --  Antonio the Gypsy  --  Antonio 's Proposal  --  The Proposal Accepted  --  Gypsy Breakfast  --  Departure from Badajoz  --  The Gypsy Donkey  --  Merida  --  The Ruined Wall  --  The Crone  --  The Land of the Moor  - -  The Black Men  --  Life in the Desert  --  The Supper . I was now at Badajoz in Spain , a country which for the next four years was destined to be the scene of my labour : but I will not anticipate . The neighbourhood of Badajoz did not prepossess me much in favour of the country which I had just entered ; it consists chiefly of brown moors , which bear little but a species of brushwood , called in Spanish carrasco ; blue mountains are however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene from the monotony which would otherwise pervade it . It was at this town of Badajoz , the capital of Estremadura , that I first fell in with those singular people , the Zincali , Gitanos , or Spanish gypsies . It was here I met with the wild Paco , the man with the withered arm , who wielded the cachas ( shears ) with his left hand ; his shrewd wife , Antonia , skilled in hokkano baro , or the great trick ; the fierce gypsy , Antonio Lopez , their father-in-law ; and many other almost equally singular individuals of the Errate , or gypsy blood . It was here that I first preached the gospel to the gypsy people , and commenced that translation of the New Testament in the Spanish gypsy tongue , a portion of which I subsequently printed at Madrid . After a stay of three weeks at Badajoz , I prepared to depart for Madrid : late one afternoon , as I was arranging my scanty baggage , the gypsy Antonio entered my apartment , dressed in his zamarra and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother ; they tell me that on the callicaste ( day after to-morrow ) you intend to set out for Madrilati . Myself .  --  Such is my intention ; I can stay here no longer . Antonio .  --  The way is far to Madrilati : there are , moreover , wars in the land and many chories ( thieves ) walk about ; are you not afraid to journey ? Myself .  --  I have no fears ; every man must accomplish his destiny : what befalls my body or soul was written in a gabicote ( book ) a thousand years before the foundation of the world . Antonio .  --  I have no fears myself , brother ; the dark night is the same to me as the fair day , and the wild carrascal as the market-place or the chardy ( fair ) ; I have got the bar lachi in my bosom , the precious stone to which sticks the needle . Myself .  --  You mean the loadstone , I suppose . Do you believe that a lifeless stone can preserve you from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother , I am fifty years old , and you see me standing before you in life and strength ; how could that be unless the bar lachi had power ? I have been soldier and contrabandista , and I have likewise slain and robbed the Busne . The bullets of the Gabine ( French ) and of the jara canallis ( revenue officers ) have hissed about my ears without injuring me , for I carried the bar lachi . I have twenty times done that which by Busnee law should have brought me to the filimicha ( gallows ) , yet my neck has never yet been squeezed by the cold garrote . Brother , I trust in the bar lachi , like the Calore of old : were I in the midst of the gulph of Bombardo ( Lyons ) , without a plank to float upon , I should feel no fear ; for if I carried the precious stone , it would bring me safe to shore : the bar lachi has power , brother . Myself .  --  I shall not dispute the matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Badajoz : I must speedily bid you farewell , and we shall see each other no more . Antonio .  --  Brother , do you know what brings me hither ? Myself .  --  I can not tell , unless it be to wish me a happy journey : I am not gypsy enough to interpret the thoughts of other people . Antonio .  --  All last night I lay awake , thinking of the affairs of Egypt ; and when I arose in the morning I took the bar lachi from my bosom , and scraping it with a knife , swallowed some of the dust in aguardiente , as I am in the habit of doing when I have made up my mind ; and I said to myself , I am wanted on the frontiers of Castumba ( Castile ) on a certain matter . The strange Caloro is about to proceed to Madrilati ; the journey is long , and he may fall into evil hands , peradventure into those of his own blood ; for let me tell you , brother , the Cales are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops to plunder the Busne , for there is now but little law in the land , and now or never is the time for the Calore to become once more what they were in former times ; so I said , the strange Caloro may fall into the hands of his own blood and be ill-treated by them , which were shame : I will therefore go with him through the Chim del Manro ( Estremadura ) as far as the frontiers of Castumba , and upon the frontiers of Castumba I will leave the London Caloro to find his own way to Madrilati , for there is less danger in Castumba than in the Chim del Manro , and I will then betake me to the affairs of Egypt which call me from hence . Myself .  --  This is a very hopeful plan of yours , my friend ; and in what manner do you propose that we shall travel ? Antonio .  --  I will tell you , brother ; I have a gras in the stall , even the one which I purchased at Olivencas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good and fleet , and cost me , who am a gypsy , fifty chule ( dollars ) ; upon that gras you shall ride . As for myself , I will journey upon the macho . Myself .  --  Before I answer you , I shall wish you to inform me what business it is which renders your presence necessary in Castumba ; your son-in-law , Paco , told me that it was no longer the custom of the gypsies to wander . Antonio .  --  It is an affair of Egypt , brother , and I shall not acquaint you with it ; peradventure it relates to a horse or an ass , or peradventure it relates to a mule or a macho ; it does not relate to yourself , therefore I advise you not to inquire about it  --  Dosta ( enough ) . With respect to my offer , you are free to decline it ; there is a drungruje ( royal road ) between here and Madrilati , and you can travel it in the birdoche ( stage-coach ) or with the dromale ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , that there are chories upon the drun , and some of them are of the Errate . Certainly few people in my situation would have accepted the offer of this singular gypsy . It was not , however , without its allurements for me ; I was fond of adventure , and what more ready means of gratifying my love of it than by putting myself under the hands of such a guide . There are many who would have been afraid of treachery , but I had no fears on this point , as I did not believe that the fellow harboured the slightest ill intention towards me ; I saw that he was fully convinced that I was one of the Errate , and his affection for his own race , and his hatred for the Busne , were his strongest characteristics . I wished , moreover , to lay hold of every opportunity of making myself acquainted with the ways of the Spanish gypsies , and an excellent one here presented itself on my first entrance into Spain . In a word , I determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I exclaimed ; " as for my baggage , I will despatch it to Madrid by the birdoche . " " Do so , brother , " he replied , " and the gras will go lighter . Baggage , indeed !  --  what need of baggage have you ? How the Busne on the road would laugh if they saw two Cales with baggage behind them . " During my stay at Badajoz , I had but little intercourse with the Spaniards , my time being chiefly devoted to the gypsies , with whom , from long intercourse with various sections of their race in different parts of the world , I felt myself much more at home than with the silent , reserved men of Spain , with whom a foreigner might mingle for half a century without having half a dozen words addressed to him , unless he himself made the first advances to intimacy , which , after all , might be rejected with a shrug and a no intendo ; for , among the many deeply rooted prejudices of these people , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea to which they will still cling though they hear him conversing with perfect ease ; for in that case the utmost that they will concede to his attainments is , Habla quatro palabras y nada mas ( he can speak four words , and no more ) . Early one morning , before sunrise , I found myself at the house of Antonio ; it was a small mean building , situated in a dirty street . The morning was quite dark ; the street , however , was partially illumined by a heap of lighted straw , round which two or three men were busily engaged , apparently holding an object over the flames . Presently the gypsy 's door opened , and Antonio made his appearance ; and , casting his eye in the direction of the light , exclaimed , " The swine have killed their brother ; would that every Busno was served as yonder hog is . Come in , brother , and we will eat the heart of that hog . " I scarcely understood his words , but , following him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brasero , or small pan full of lighted charcoal ; beside it was a rude table , spread with a coarse linen cloth , upon which was bread and a large pipkin full of a mess which emitted no disagreeable savour . " The heart of the balichow is in that puchera , " said Antonio ; " eat , brother . " We both sat down and ate , Antonio voraciously . When we had concluded he arose : - " Have you got your li ? " he demanded . " Here it is , " said I , showing him my passport . " Good , " said he , " you may want it ; I want none , my passport is the bar lachi . Now for a glass of repani , and then for the road . " We left the room , the door of which he locked , hiding the key beneath a loose brick in a corner of the passage . " Go into the street , brother , whilst I fetch the caballerias from the stable . " I obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air was piercingly cold ; the grey light , however , of dawn enabled me to distinguish objects with tolerable accuracy ; I soon heard the clattering of the animals ' feet , and Antonio presently stepped forth leading the horse by the bridle ; the macho followed behind . I looked at the horse and shrugged my shoulders : as far as I could scan it , it appeared the most uncouth animal I had ever beheld . It was of a spectral white , short in the body , but with remarkably long legs . I observed that it was particularly high in the cruz or withers . " You are looking at the grasti , " said Antonio ; " it is eighteen years old , but it is the very best in the Chim del Manro ; I have long had my eye upon it ; I bought it for my own use for the affairs of Egypt . Mount , brother , mount and let us leave the foros  --  the gate is about being opened . " He locked the door , and deposited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of an hour we had left the town behind us . " This does not appear to be a very good horse , " said I to Antonio , as we proceeded over the plain . " It is with difficulty that I can make him move . " " He is the swiftest horse in the Chim del Manro , brother , " said Antonio ; " at the gallop and at the speedy trot there is no one to match him ; but he is eighteen years old , and his joints are stiff , especially of a morning ; but let him once become heated and the genio del viejo ( spirit of the old man ) comes upon him and there is no holding him in with bit or bridle . I bought that horse for the affairs of Egypt , brother . " About noon we arrived at a small village in the neighbourhood of a high lumpy hill . " There is no Calo house in this place , " said Antonio ; " we will therefore go to the posada of the Busne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We entered the kitchen and sat down at the boards , calling for wine and bread . There were two ill-looking fellows in the kitchen , smoking cigars ; I said something to Antonio in the Calo language . " What is that I hear ? " said one of the fellows , who was distinguished by an immense pair of moustaches . " What is that I hear ? is it in Calo that you are speaking before me , and I a Chalan and national ? Accursed gypsy , how dare you enter this posada and speak before me in that speech ? Is it not forbidden by the law of the land in which we are , even as it is forbidden for a gypsy to enter the mercado ? I tell you what , friend , if I hear another word of Calo come from your mouth , I will cudgel your bones and send you flying over the house-tops with a kick of my foot . " " You would do right , " said his companion ; " the insolence of these gypsies is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Badajoz I go to the mercado , and there in a corner stand the accursed gypsies jabbering to each other in a speech which I understand not . ' Gypsy gentleman , ' say I to one of them , ' what will you have for that donkey ? ' ' I will have ten dollars for it , Caballero nacional , ' says the gypsy ; ' it is the best donkey in all Spain . ' ' I should like to see its paces , ' say I. ' That you shall , most valorous ! ' says the gypsy , and jumping upon its back , he puts it to its paces , first of all whispering something into its ears in Calo , and truly the paces of the donkey are most wonderful , such as I have never seen before . ' I think it will just suit me , ' and after looking at it awhile , I take out the money and pay for it . ' I shall go to my house , ' says the gypsy ; and off he runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I , and I mount the donkey . ' Vamonos , ' say I , but the donkey wo n't move . I give him a switch , but I do n't get on the better for that . ' How is this ? ' say I , and I fall to spurring him . What happens then , brother ? The wizard no sooner feels the prick than he bucks down , and flings me over his head into the mire . I get up and look about me ; there stands the donkey staring at me , and there stand the whole gypsy canaille squinting at me with their filmy eyes . ' Where is the scamp who has sold me this piece of furniture ? ' I shout . ' He is gone to Granada , Valorous , ' says one . ' He is gone to see his kindred among the Moors , ' says another . ' I just saw him running over the field , in the direction of - , with the devil close behind him , ' says a third . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of the donkey ; no one , however , will buy him ; he is a Calo donkey , and every person avoids him . At last the gypsies offer thirty rials for him ; and after much chaffering I am glad to get rid of him at two dollars . It is all a trick , however ; he returns to his master , and the brotherhood share the spoil amongst them . All which villainy would be prevented , in my opinion , were the Calo language not spoken ; for what but the word of Calo could have induced the donkey to behave in such an unaccountable manner ? " Both seemed perfectly satisfied with the justness of this conclusion , and continued smoking till their cigars were burnt to stumps , when they arose , twitched their whiskers , looked at us with fierce disdain , and dashing the tobacco-ends to the ground , strode out of the apartment . " Those people seem no friends to the gypsies , " said I to Antonio , when the two bullies had departed , " nor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize their nostrils , " said Antonio ; " they have been jonjabadoed by our people . However , brother , you did wrong to speak to me in Calo , in a posada like this ; it is a forbidden language ; for , as I have often told you , the king has destroyed the law of the Cales . Let us away , brother , or those juntunes ( sneaking scoundrels ) may set the justicia upon us . " Towards evening we drew near to a large town or village . " That is Merida , " said Antonio , " formerly , as the Busne say , a mighty city of the Corahai . We shall stay here to-night , and perhaps for a day or two , for I have some business of Egypt to transact in this place . Now , brother , step aside with the horse , and wait for me beneath yonder wall . I must go before and see in what condition matters stand . " I dismounted from the horse , and sat down on a stone beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun went down , and the air was exceedingly keen ; I drew close around me an old tattered gypsy cloak with which my companion had provided me , and being somewhat fatigued , fell into a doze which lasted for nearly an hour . " Is your worship the London Caloro ? " said a strange voice close beside me . I started and beheld the face of a woman peering under my hat . Notwithstanding the dusk , I could see that the features were hideously ugly and almost black ; they belonged , in fact , to a gypsy crone , at least seventy years of age , leaning upon a staff . " Is your worship the London Caloro ? " repeated she . " I am he whom you seek , " said I ; " where is Antonio ? " " Curelando , curelando , baribustres curelos terela , " 1 said the crone : " come with me , Caloro of my garlochin , come with me to my little ker , he will be there anon . " I followed the crone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruinous and seemingly half deserted ; we went up the street , from which she turned into a narrow and dark lane , and presently opened the gate of a large dilapidated house ; " Come in , " said she . " And the gras ? " I demanded . " Bring the gras in too , my chabo , bring the gras in too ; there is room for the gras in my little stable . " We entered a large court , across which we proceeded till we came to a wide doorway . " Go in , my child of Egypt , " said the hag ; " go in , that is my little stable . " " The place is as dark as pitch , " said I , " and may be a well for what I know ; bring a light or I will not enter . " " Give me the solabarri ( bridle ) , " said the hag , " and I will lead your horse in , my chabo of Egypt , yes , and tether him to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway , and I heard her busy in the darkness ; presently the horse shook himself : " Grasti terelamos , " said the hag , who now made her appearance with the bridle in her hand ; " the horse has shaken himself , he is not harmed by his day 's journey ; now let us go in , my Caloro , into my little room . " We entered the house and found ourselves in a vast room , which would have been quite dark but for a faint glow which appeared at the farther end ; it proceeded from a brasero , beside which were squatted two dusky figures . " These are Callees , " said the hag ; " one is my daughter and the other is her chabi ; sit down , my London Caloro , and let us hear you speak . " I looked about for a chair , but could see none ; at a short distance , however , I perceived the end of a broken pillar lying on the floor ; this I rolled to the brasero and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mother of the gypsies , " said I to the hag , willing to gratify the desire she had expressed of hearing me speak ; " a fine house is this of yours , rather cold and damp , though ; it appears large enough to be a barrack for hundunares . " " Plenty of houses in this foros , plenty of houses in Merida , my London Caloro , some of them just as they were left by the Corahanoes ; ah , a fine people are the Corahanoes ; I often wish myself in their chim once more . " " How is this , mother , " said I , " have you been in the land of the Moors ? " " Twice have I been in their country , my Caloro ,  --  twice have I been in the land of the Corahai ; the first time is more than fifty years ago , I was then with the Sese ( Spaniards ) , for my husband was a soldier of the Crallis of Spain , and Oran at that time belonged to Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moors , " said I , " but only with the Spaniards who occupied part of their country . " " I have been with the real Moors , my London Caloro . Who knows more of the real Moors than myself ? About forty years ago I was with my ro in Ceuta , for he was still a soldier of the king , and he said to me one day , ' I am tired of this place where there is no bread and less water , I will escape and turn Corahano ; this night I will kill my sergeant and flee to the camp of the Moor . ' ' Do so , ' said I , ' my chabo , and as soon as may be I will follow you and become a Corahani . ' That same night he killed his sergeant , who five years before had called him Calo and cursed him , then running to the wall he dropped from it , and amidst many shots he escaped to the land of the Corahai , as for myself , I remained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repani to the soldiers . Two years passed by and I neither saw nor heard from my ro ; one day there came a strange man to my cachimani ( wine-shop ) , he was dressed like a Corahano , and yet he did not look like one , he looked like more a callardo ( black ) , and yet he was not a callardo either , though he was almost black , and as I looked upon him I thought he looked something like the Errate , and he said to me , ' Zincali ; chachipe ! ' and then he whispered to me in queer language , which I could scarcely understand , ' Your ro is waiting , come with me , my little sister , and I will take you unto him . ' ' Where is he ? ' said I , and he pointed to the west , to the land of the Corahai , and said , ' He is yonder away ; come with me , little sister , the ro is waiting . ' For a moment I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wished to be amongst the Corahai ; so I took the little parne ( money ) I had , and locking up the cachimani went with the strange man ; the sentinel challenged us at the gate , but I gave him repani ( brandy ) and he let us pass ; in a moment we were in the land of the Corahai . About a league from the town beneath a hill we found four people , men and women , all very black like the strange man , and we joined ourselves with them and they all saluted me and called me little sister . That was all I understood of their discourse , which was very crabbed ; and they took away my dress and gave me other clothes , and I looked like a Corahani , and away we marched for many days amidst deserts and small villages , and more than once it seemed to me that I was amongst the Errate , for their ways were the same : the men would hokkawar ( cheat ) with mules and asses , and the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large town , and the black man said , ' Go in there , little sister , and there you will find your ro ; ' and I went to the gate , and an armed Corahano stood within the gate , and I looked in his face , and lo ! it was my ro . " O what a strange town it was that I found myself in , full of people who had once been Candore ( Christians ) but had renegaded and become Corahai . There were Sese and Lalore ( Portuguese ) , and men of other nations , and amongst them were some of the Errate from my own country ; all were now soldiers of the Crallis of the Corahai and followed him to his wars ; and in that town I remained with my ro a long time , occasionally going out with him to the wars , and I often asked him about the black men who had brought me thither , and he told me that he had had dealings with them , and that he believed them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , my ro was killed in the wars , before a town to which the king of the Corahai laid siege , and I became a piuli ( widow ) , and I returned to the village of the renegades , as it was called , and supported myself as well as I could ; and one day as I was sitting weeping , the black man , whom I had never seen since the day he brought me to my ro , again stood before me , and he said , ' Come with me , little sister , come with me , the ro is at hand ' ; and I went with him , and beyond the gate in the desert was the same party of black men and women which I had seen before . ' Where is my ro ? ' said I. ' Here he is , little sister , ' said the black man , ' here he is ; from this day I am the ro and you the romi ; come , let us go , for there is business to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was my ro , and we lived amongst the deserts , and hokkawar 'd and choried and told baji ; and I said to myself , this is good , sure I am amongst the Errate in a better chim than my own ; and I often said that they were of the Errate , and then they would laugh and say that it might be so , and that they were not Corahai , but they could give no account of themselves . " Well , things went on in this way for years , and I had three chai by the black man , two of them died , but the youngest , who is the Calli who sits by the brasero , was spared ; so we roamed about and choried and told baji ; and it came to pass that once in the winter time our company attempted to pass a wide and deep river , of which there are many in the Chim del Corahai , and the boat overset with the rapidity of the current and all our people were drowned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my bosom . I had now no friends amongst the Corahai , and I wandered about the despoblados howling and lamenting till I became half lili ( mad ) , and in this manner I found my way to the coast , where I made friends with the captain of a ship and returned to this land of Spain . And now I am here , I often wish myself back again amongst the Corahai . " Here she commenced laughing loud and long , and when she had ceased , her daughter and grandchild took up the laugh , which they continued so long that I concluded they were all lunatics . Hour succeeded hour , and still we sat crouching over the brasero , from which , by this time , all warmth had departed ; the glow had long since disappeared , and only a few dying sparks were to be distinguished . The room or hall was now involved in utter darkness ; the women were motionless and still ; I shivered and began to feel uneasy . " Will Antonio be here to-night ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my London Caloro , " said the Gypsy mother , in an unearthly tone ; " Pepindorio 2 has been here some time . " I was about to rise from my seat and attempt to escape from the house , when I felt a hand laid upon my shoulder , and in a moment I heard the voice of Antonio . " Be not afraid , ' t is I , brother ; we will have a light anon , and then supper . " The supper was rude enough , consisting of bread , cheese , and olives . Antonio , however , produced a leathern bottle of excellent wine ; we despatched these viands by the light of an earthen lamp which was placed upon the floor . " Now , " said Antonio to the youngest female , " bring me the pajandi , and I will sing a gachapla . " The girl brought the guitar , which , with some difficulty , the Gypsy tuned , and then strumming it vigorously , he sang : " I stole a plump and bonny fowl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with scowl and growl , And me would captive bind . " My hat and mantle off I threw , And scour 'd across the lea , Then cried the beng 3 with loud halloo , Where does the Gypsy flee ? " He continued playing and singing for a considerable time , the two younger females dancing in the meanwhile with unwearied diligence , whilst the aged mother occasionally snapped her fingers or beat time on the ground with her stick . At last Antonio suddenly laid down the instrument : - " I see the London Caloro is weary ; enough , enough , to-morrow more thereof  --  we will now to the charipe ( bed ) . " " With all my heart , " said I ; " where are we to sleep ? " " In the stable , " said he , " in the manger ; however cold the stable may be we shall be warm enough in the bufa . " CHAPTER X The Gypsy 's Granddaughter  --  Proposed Marriage  --  The Algnazil  --  The Assault  --  Speedy Trot  --  Arrival at Trujillo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Mount and Away !  --  Jaraicejo  --  The National  --  The Cavalier Balmerson  --  Among the Thicket  --  Serious Discourse  --  What is Truth ?  --  Unexpected Intelligence . We remained three days at the Gypsies ' house , Antonio departing early every morning , on his mule , and returning late at night . The house was large and ruinous , the only habitable part of it , with the exception of the stable , being the hall , where we had supped , and there the Gypsy females slept at night , on some mats and mattresses in a corner . " A strange house is this , " said I to Antonio , one morning as he was on the point of saddling his mule and departing , as I supposed , on the affairs of Egypt ; " a strange house and strange people ; that Gypsy grandmother has all the appearance of a sowanee ( sorceress ) . " " All the appearance of one ! " said Antonio ; " and is she not really one ? She knows more crabbed things and crabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has been amongst the wild Moors , and can make more drows , poisons , and philtres than any one alive . She once made a kind of paste , and persuaded me to taste , and shortly after I had done so my soul departed from my body , and wandered through horrid forests and mountains , amidst monsters and duendes , during one entire night . She learned many things amidst the Corahai which I should be glad to know . " " Have you been long acquainted with her ? " said I ; " you appear to be quite at home in this house . " " Acquainted with her ! " said Antonio . " Did not my own brother marry the black Calli , her daughter , who bore him the chabi , sixteen years ago , just before he was hanged by the Busne ? " In the afternoon I was seated with the Gypsy mother in the hall , the two Callees were absent telling fortunes about the town and neighbourhood , which was their principal occupation . " Are you married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . " Are you a ro ? " Myself .  --  Wherefore do you ask , O Dai de los Cales ? Gypsy Mother .  --  It is high time that the lacha of the chabi were taken from her , and that she had a ro . You can do no better than take her for romi , my London Caloro . Myself .  --  I am a stranger in this land , O mother of the Gypsies , and scarcely know how to provide for myself , much less for a romi . Gypsy Mother .  --  She wants no one to provide for her , my London Caloro , she can at any time provide for herself and her ro . She can hokkawar , tell baji , and there are few to equal her at stealing a pastesas . Were she once at Madrilati , where they tell me you are going , she would make much treasure ; therefore take her thither , for in this foros she is nahi ( lost ) , as it were , for there is nothing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another matter ; she would go dressed in lachipi and sonacai ( silk and gold ) , whilst you would ride about on your black-tailed gra ; and when you had got much treasure , you might return hither and live like a Crallis , and all the Errate of the Chim del Manro should bow down their heads to you . What , say you , my London Caloro , what say you to my plan ? Myself .  --  Your plan is a plausible one , mother , or at least some people would think so ; but I am , as you are aware , of another chim , and have no inclination to pass my life in this country . Gypsy Mother .  --  Then return to your own country , my Caloro , the chabi can cross the pani . Would she not do business in London with the rest of the Calore ? Or why not go to the land of the Corahai ? In which case I would accompany you ; I and my daughter , the mother of the chabi . Myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Corahai ? It is a poor and wild country , I believe . Gypsy Mother .  --  The London Caloro asks me what we could do in the land of the Corahai ! Aromali ! I almost think that I am speaking to a lilipendi ( simpleton ) . Are there not horses to chore ? Yes , I trow there are , and better ones than in this land , and asses and mules . In the land of the Corahai you must hokkawar and chore even as you must here , or in your own country , or else you are no Caloro . Can you not join yourselves with the black people who live in the despoblados ? Yes , surely ; and glad they would be to have among them the Errate from Spain and London . I am seventy years of age , but I wish not to die in this chim , but yonder , far away , where both my roms are sleeping . Take the chabi , therefore , and go to Madrilati to win the parne , and when you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banquet to all the Busne in Merida , and in their food I will mix drow , and they shall eat and burst like poisoned sheep . . . . And when they have eaten we will leave them , and away to the land of the Moor , my London Caloro . During the whole time that I remained at Merida I stirred not once from the house ; following the advice of Antonio , who informed me that it would not be convenient . My time lay rather heavily on my hands , my only source of amusement consisting in the conversation of the women , and in that of Antonio when he made his appearance at night . In these tertulias the grandmother was the principal spokeswoman , and astonished my ears with wonderful tales of the Land of the Moors , prison escapes , thievish feats , and one or two poisoning adventures , in which she had been engaged , as she informed me , in her early youth . There was occasionally something very wild in her gestures and demeanour ; more than once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop short , stare in vacancy , and thrust out her palms as if endeavouring to push away some invisible substance ; she goggled frightfully with her eyes , and once sank back in convulsions , of which her children took no farther notice than observing that she was only lili , and would soon come to herself . Late in the afternoon of the third day , as the three women and myself sat conversing as usual over the brasero , a shabby looking fellow in an old rusty cloak walked into the room : he came straight up to the place where we were sitting , produced a paper cigar , which he lighted at a coal , and taking a whiff or two , looked at me : " Carracho , " said he , " who is this companion ? " I saw at once that the fellow was no Gypsy : the women said nothing , but I could hear the grandmother growling to herself , something after the manner of an old grimalkin when disturbed . " Carracho , " reiterated the fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le penela chi min chaboro , " said the black Callee to me , in an undertone ; " sin un balicho de los chineles 4 ; " then looking up to the interrogator she said aloud , " he is one of our people from Portugal , come on the smuggling lay , and to see his poor sisters here . " " Then let him give me some tobacco , " said the fellow , " I suppose he has brought some with him . " " He has no tobacco , " said the black Callee , " he has nothing but old iron . This cigar is the only tobacco there is in the house ; take it , smoke it , and go away ! " Thereupon she produced a cigar from out her shoe , which she presented to the alguazil . " This will not do , " said the fellow , taking the cigar , " I must have something better ; it is now three months since I received anything from you ; the last present was a handkerchief , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking , or I will carry you all to the Carcel . " " The Busno will take us to prison , " said the black Callee , " ha ! ha ! ha ! " " The Chinel will take us to prison , " giggled the young girl " he ! he ! he ! " " The Bengui will carry us all to the estaripel , " grunted the Gypsy grandmother , " ho ! ho ! ho ! " The three females arose and walked slowly round the fellow , fixing their eyes steadfastly on his face ; he appeared frightened , and evidently wished to get away . Suddenly the two youngest seized his hands , and whilst he struggled to release himself , the old woman exclaimed : " You want tobacco , hijo  --  you come to the Gypsy house to frighten the Callees and the strange Caloro out of their plako  - -  truly , hijo , we have none for you , and right sorry I am ; we have , however , plenty of the dust a su servicio . " Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of some kind of dust or snuff into the fellow 's eyes ; he stamped and roared , but was for some time held fast by the two Callees ; he extricated himself , however , and attempted to unsheath a knife which he bore at his girdle ; but the two younger females flung themselves upon him like furies , while the old woman increased his disorder by thrusting her stick into his face ; he was soon glad to give up the contest , and retreated , leaving behind him his hat and cloak , which the chabi gathered up and flung after him into the street . " This is a bad business , " said I , " the fellow will of course bring the rest of the justicia upon us , and we shall all be cast into the estaripel . " " Ca ! " said the black Callee , biting her thumb nail , " he has more reason to fear us than we him , we could bring him to the filimicha ; we have , moreover , friends in this town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumbled the grandmother , " the daughters of the baji have friends , my London Caloro , friends among the Busnees , baributre , baribu ( plenty , plenty ) . " Nothing farther of any account occurred in the Gypsy house ; the next day , Antonio and myself were again in the saddle , we travelled at least thirteen leagues before we reached the Venta , where we passed the night ; we rose early in the morning , my guide informing me that we had a long day 's journey to make . " Where are we bound to ? " I demanded . " To Trujillo , " he replied . When the sun arose , which it did gloomily and amidst threatening rain-clouds , we found ourselves in the neighbourhood of a range of mountains which lay on our left , and which , Antonio informed me , were called the Sierra of San Selvan ; our route , however , lay over wide plains , scantily clothed with brushwood , with here and there a melancholy village , with its old and dilapidated church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain was falling , which turned the dust of the roads into mud and mire , considerably impeding our progress . Towards evening we reached a moor , a wild place enough , strewn with enormous stones and rocks . Before us , at some distance , rose a strange conical hill , rough and shaggy , which appeared to be neither more nor less than an immense assemblage of the same kind of rocks which lay upon the moor . The rain had now ceased , but a strong wind rose and howled at our backs . Throughout the journey , I had experienced considerable difficulty in keeping up with the mule of Antonio ; the walk of the horse was slow , and I could discover no vestige of the spirit which the Gypsy had assured me lurked within him . We were now upon a tolerably clear spot of the moor : " I am about to see , " I said , " whether this horse has any of the quality which you have described . " " Do so , " said Antonio , and spurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I jerked the horse with the bit , endeavouring to arouse his dormant spirit , whereupon he stopped , reared , and refused to proceed . " Hold the bridle loose and touch him with your whip , " shouted Antonio from before . I obeyed , and forthwith the animal set off at a trot , which gradually increased in swiftness till it became a downright furious speedy trot ; his limbs were now thoroughly lithy , and he brandished his fore legs in a manner perfectly wondrous ; the mule of Antonio , which was a spirited animal of excellent paces , would fain have competed with him , but was passed in a twinkling . This tremendous trot endured for about a mile , when the animal , becoming yet more heated , broke suddenly into a gallop . Hurrah ! no hare ever ran so wildly or blindly ; it was , literally , ventre a terre ; and I had considerable difficulty in keeping him clear of rocks , against which he would have rushed in his savage fury , and dashed himself and rider to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill , where I waited till the Gypsy rejoined me : we left the hill , which seemed quite inaccessible , on our right , passing through a small and wretched village . The sun went down , and dark night presently came upon us ; we proceeded on , however , for nearly three hours , until we heard the barking of dogs , and perceived a light or two in the distance . " That is Trujillo , " said Antonio , who had not spoken for a long time . " I am glad of it , " I replied ; " I am thoroughly tired ; I shall sleep soundly in Trujillo . " " That is as it may be , " said the Gypsy , and spurred his mule to a brisker pace . We soon entered the town , which appeared dark and gloomy enough ; I followed close behind the Gypsy , who led the way I knew not whither , through dismal streets and dark places , where cats were squalling . " Here is the house , " said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knocked , no answer was returned ;  --  he knocked again , but still there was no reply ; he shook the door and essayed to open it , but it appeared firmly locked and bolted . " Caramba ! " said he , " they are out  --  I feared it might be so . Now what are we to do ? " " There can be no difficulty , " said I , " with respect to what we have to do ; if your friends are gone out , it is easy enough to go to a posada . " " You know not what you say , " replied the Gypsy , " I dare not go to the mesuna , nor enter any house in Trujillo save this , and this is shut ; well , there is no remedy , we must move on , and , between ourselves , the sooner we leave this place the better ; my own planoro ( brother ) was garroted at Trujillo . " He lighted a cigar , by means of a steel and yesca , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lanes equally dismal as those which we had already traversed till we again found ourselves out of the , town . I confess I did not much like this decision of the Gypsy ; I felt very slight inclination to leave the town behind and to venture into unknown places in the dark night : amidst rain and mist , for the wind had now dropped , and the rain began again to fall briskly . I was , moreover , much fatigued , and wished for nothing better than to deposit myself in some comfortable manger , where I might sink to sleep , lulled by the pleasant sound of horses and mules despatching their provender . I had , however , put myself under the direction of the Gypsy , and I was too old a traveller to quarrel with my guide under the present circumstances . I therefore followed close at his crupper ; our only light being the glow emitted from the Gypsy 's cigar ; at last he flung it from his mouth into a puddle , and we were then in darkness . We proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silent ; I myself was equally so ; the rain descended more and more . I sometimes thought I heard doleful noises , something like the hooting of owls . " This is a strange night to be wandering abroad in , " I at length said to Antonio . " It is , brother , " said he , " but I would sooner be abroad in such a night , and in such places , than in the estaripel of Trujillo . " We wandered at least a league farther , and appeared now to be near a wood , for I could occasionally distinguish the trunks of immense trees . Suddenly Antonio stopped his mule ; " Look , brother , " said he , " to the left , and tell me if you do not see a light ; your eyes are sharper than mine . " I did as he commanded me . At first I could see nothing , but moving a little farther on I plainly saw a large light at some distance , seemingly amongst the trees . " Yonder can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " it is more like the blaze of a fire . " " Very likely , " said Antonio . " There are no queres ( houses ) in this place ; it is doubtless a fire made by durotunes ( shepherds ) ; let us go and join them , for , as you say , it is doleful work wandering about at night amidst rain and mire . " We dismounted and entered what I now saw was a forest , leading the animals cautiously amongst the trees and brushwood . In about five minutes we reached a small open space , at the farther side of which , at the foot of a large cork tree , a fire was burning , and by it stood or sat two or three figures ; they had heard our approach , and one of them now exclaimed Quien Vive ? " I know that voice , " said Antonio , and leaving the horse with me , rapidly advanced towards the fire : presently I heard an Ola ! and a laugh , and soon the voice of Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found two dark lads , and a still darker woman of about forty ; the latter seated on what appeared to be horse or mule furniture . I likewise saw a horse and two donkeys tethered to the neighbouring trees . It was in fact a Gypsy bivouac . . . . " Come forward , brother , and show yourself , " said Antonio to me ; " you are amongst friends ; these are of the Errate , the very people whom I expected to find at Trujillo , and in whose house we should have slept . " " And what , " said I , " could have induced them to leave their house in Trujillo and come into this dark forest in the midst of wind and rain , to pass the night ? " " They come on business of Egypt , brother , doubtless , " replied Antonio ; " and that business is none of ours , Calla boca ! It is lucky we have found them here , else we should have had no supper , and our horses no corn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the woman , pointing with her hand in a particular direction ; " he is prisoner yonder for choring a mailla ( stealing a donkey ) ; we are come to see what we can do in his behalf ; and where can we lodge better than in this forest , where there is nothing to pay ? It is not the first time , I trow , that Calore have slept at the root of a tree . " One of the striplings now gave us barley for our animals in a large bag , into which we successively introduced their heads , allowing the famished creatures to regale themselves till we conceived that they had satisfied their hunger . There was a puchero simmering at the fire , half full of bacon , garbanzos , and other provisions ; this was emptied into a large wooden platter , and out of this Antonio and myself supped ; the other Gypsies refused to join us , giving us to understand that they had eaten before our arrival ; they all , however , did justice to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Merida , he had the precaution to fill . I was by this time completely overcome with fatigue and sleep . Antonio flung me an immense horse-cloth , of which he bore more than one beneath the huge cushion on which he rode ; in this I wrapped myself , and placing my head upon a bundle , and my feet as near as possible to the fire , I lay down . Antonio and the other Gypsies remained seated by the fire conversing . I listened for a moment to what they said , but I did not perfectly understand it , and what I did understand by no means interested me : the rain still drizzled , but I heeded it not , and was soon asleep . The sun was just appearing as I awoke . I made several efforts before I could rise from the ground ; my limbs were quite stiff , and my hair was covered with rime ; for the rain had ceased and a rather severe frost set in . I looked around me , but could see neither Antonio nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so had the horse which I had hitherto rode ; the mule , however , of Antonio still remained fastened to the tree ! this latter circumstance quieted some apprehensions which were beginning to arise in my mind . " They are gone on some business of Egypt , " I said to myself , " and will return anon . " I gathered together the embers of the fire , and heaping upon them sticks and branches , soon succeeded in calling forth a blaze , beside which I placed the puchero , with what remained of the provision of last night . I waited for a considerable time in expectation of the return of my companions , but as they did not appear , I sat down and breakfasted . Before I had well finished I heard the noise of a horse approaching rapidly , and presently Antonio made his appearance amongst the trees , with some agitation in his countenance . He sprang from the horse , and instantly proceeded to untie the mule . " Mount , brother , mount ! " said he , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her chabes to the village where the ro is in trouble ; the chinobaro , however , seized them at once with their cattle , and would have laid hands also on me , but I set spurs to the grasti , gave him the bridle , and was soon far away . Mount , brother , mount , or we shall have the whole rustic canaille upon us in a twinkling . " I did as he commanded : we were presently in the road which we had left the night before . Along this we hurried at a great rate , the horse displaying his best speedy trot ; whilst the mule , with its ears pricked up , galloped gallantly at his side . " What place is that on the hill yonder ? " said I to Antonio , at the expiration of an hour , as we prepared to descend a deep valley . " That is Jaraicejo , " said Antonio ; " a bad place it is and a bad place it has ever been for the Calo people . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I hope we shall not have to pass through it . " " We must pass through it , " said Antonio , " for more reasons than one : first , forasmuch is the road lies through Jaraicejo ; and second , forasmuch as it will be necessary to purchase provisions there , both for ourselves and horses . On the other side of Jaraicejo there is a wild desert , a despoblado , where we shall find nothing . " We crossed the valley , and ascended the hill , and as we drew near to the town the Gypsy said , " Brother , we had best pass through that town singly . I will go in advance ; follow slowly , and when there purchase bread and barley ; you have nothing to fear . I will await you on the despoblado . " Without waiting for my answer he hastened forward , and was speedily out of sight . I followed slowly behind , and entered the gate of the town ; an old dilapidated place , consisting of little more than one street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with a dirty foraging cap on his head , and holding a gun in his hand , came running up to me : " Who are you ? " said he , in rather rough accents , " from whence do you come ? " " From Badajoz and Trujillo , " I replied ; " why do you ask ? " " I am one of the national guard , " said the man , " and am placed here to inspect strangers ; I am told that a Gypsy fellow just now rode through the town ; it is well for him that I had stepped into my house . Do you come in his company ? " " Do I look a person , " said I , " likely to keep company with Gypsies ? " The national measured me from top to toe , and then looked me full in the face with an expression which seemed to say , " likely enough . " In fact , my appearance was by no means calculated to prepossess people in my favour . Upon my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its condition , appeared to have been trodden under foot ; a rusty cloak , which had perhaps served half a dozen generations , enwrapped my body . My nether garments were by no means of the finest description ; and as far as could be seen were covered with mud , with which my face was likewise plentifully bespattered , and upon my chin was a beard of a week 's growth . " Have you a passport ? " at length demanded the national . I remembered having read that the best way to win a Spaniard 's heart is to treat him with ceremonious civility . I therefore dismounted , and taking off my hat , made a low bow to the constitutional soldier , saying , " Senor nacional , you must know that I am an English gentleman , travelling in this country for my pleasure ; I bear a passport , which , on inspecting , you will find to be perfectly regular ; it was given me by the great Lord Palmerston , minister of England , whom you of course have heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handwriting ; look at it and rejoice ; perhaps you will never have another opportunity . As I put unbounded confidence in the honour of every gentleman , I leave the passport in your hands whilst I repair to the posada to refresh myself . When you have inspected it , you will perhaps oblige me so far as to bring it to me . Cavalier , I kiss your hands . " I then made him another low bow , which he returned with one still lower , and leaving him now staring at the passport and now looking at myself , I went into a posada , to which I was directed by a beggar whom I met . I fed the horse , and procured some bread and barley , as the Gypsy had directed me ; I likewise purchased three fine partridges of a fowler , who was drinking wine in the posada . He was satisfied with the price I gave him , and offered to treat me with a copita , to which I made no objection . As we sat discoursing at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sat down by us . National .  --  Caballero ! I return you your passport , it is quite in form ; I rejoice much to have made your acquaintance ; I have no doubt that you can give me some information respecting the present war . Myself .  --  I shall be very happy to afford so polite and honourable a gentleman any information in my power . National .  --  What is England doing ,  --  is she about to afford any assistance to this country ? If she pleased she could put down the war in three months . Myself .  --  Be under no apprehension , Senor nacional ; the war will be put down , do n't doubt . You have heard of the English legion , which my Lord Palmerston has sent over ? Leave the matter in their hands , and you will soon see the result . National .  --  It appears to me that this Caballero Balmerson must be a very honest man . Myself .  --  There can be no doubt of it . National .  --  I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  There can be no doubt of it . In some things neither Napoleon nor the sawyer 5 would stand a chance with him for a moment . Es mucho hombre . National .  --  I am glad to hear it . Does he intend to head the legion himself ? Myself .  --  I believe not ; but he has sent over , to head the fighting men , a friend of his , who is thought to be nearly as much versed in military matters as himself . National .  --  I am rejoiced to hear it . I see that the war will soon be over . Caballero , I thank you for your politeness , and for the information which you have afforded me . I hope you will have a pleasant journey . I confess that I am surprised to see a gentleman of your country travelling alone , and in this manner , through such regions as these . The roads are at present very bad ; there have of late been many accidents , and more than two deaths in this neighbourhood . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your guard , Caballero . I am sorry that Gypsy was permitted to pass ; should you meet him and not like his looks , shoot him at once , stab him , or ride him down . He is a well known thief , contrabandista , and murderer , and has committed more assassinations than he has fingers on his hands . Caballero , if you please , we will allow you a guard to the other side of the pass . You do not wish it ? Then , farewell . Stay , before I go I should wish to see once more the signature of the Caballero Balmerson . I showed him the signature , which he looked upon with profound reverence , uncovering his head for a moment ; we then embraced and parted . I mounted the horse and rode from the town , at first proceeding very slowly ; I had no sooner , however , reached the moor , than I put the animal to his speedy trot , and proceeded at a tremendous rate for some time , expecting every moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , nor did I meet with a single human being . The road along which I sped was narrow and sandy , winding amidst thickets of broom and brushwood , with which the despoblado was overgrown , and which in some places were as high as a man 's head . Across the moor , in the direction in which I was proceeding , rose a lofty eminence , naked and bare . The moor extended for at least three leagues ; I had nearly crossed it , and reached the foot of the ascent . I was becoming very uneasy , conceiving that I might have passed the Gypsy amongst the thickets , when I suddenly heard his well known Ola ! and his black savage head and staring eyes suddenly appeared from amidst a clump of broom . " You have tarried long , brother , " said he ; " I almost thought you had played me false . " He bade me dismount , and then proceeded to lead the horse behind the thicket , where I found the route picqueted to the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to relate to him my adventure with the national . " I would I had him here , " said the Gypsy , on hearing the epithets which the former had lavished upon him . " I would I had him here , then should my chulee and his carlo become better acquainted . " " And what are you doing here yourself , " I demanded , " in this wild place , amidst these thickets ? " " I am expecting a messenger down yon pass , " said the Gypsy ; " and till that messenger arrive I can neither go forward nor return . It is on business of Egypt , brother , that I am here . " As he invariably used this last expression when he wished to evade my inquiries , I held my peace , and said no more ; the animals were fed , and we proceeded to make a frugal repast on bread and wine . " Why do you not cook the game which I brought ? " I demanded ; " in this place there is plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover us , brother , " said Antonio , " I am desirous of lying escondido in this place until the arrival of the messenger . " It was now considerably past noon ; the gypsy lay behind the thicket , raising himself up occasionally and looking anxiously towards the hill which lay over against us ; at last , with an exclamation of disappointment and impatience , he flung himself on the ground , where he lay a considerable time , apparently ruminating ; at last he lifted up his head and looked me in the face . Antonio .  --  Brother , I can not imagine what business brought you to this country . Myself .  --  Perhaps the same which brings you to this moor  --  business of Egypt . Antonio .  --  Not so , brother ; you speak the language of Egypt , it is true , but your ways and words are neither those of the Cales nor of the Busne . Myself .  --  Did you not hear me speak in the foros about God and Tebleque ? It was to declare his glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land of Spain . Antonio .  --  And who sent you on this errand ? Myself .  --  You would scarcely understand me were I to inform you . Know , however , that there are many in foreign lands who lament the darkness which envelops Spain , and the scenes of cruelty , robbery , and murder which deform it . Antonio .  --  Are they Calore or Busne ? Myself .  --  What matters it ? Both Calore and Busne are sons of the same God . Antonio .  --  You lie , brother , they are not of one father nor of one Errate . You speak of robbery , cruelty , and murder . There are too many Busne , brother ; if there were no Busne there would be neither robbery nor murder . The Calore neither rob nor murder each other , the Busno do ; nor are they cruel to their animals , their law forbids them . When I was a child I was beating a burra , but my father stopped my hand , and chided me . " Hurt not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the soul of your own sister ! " Myself .  --  And do you believe in this wild doctrine , O Antonio ? Antonio .  --  Sometimes I do , sometimes I do not . There are some who believe in nothing ; not even that they live ! Long since , I knew an old Caloro , he was old , very old , upwards of a hundred years ,  --  and I once heard him say , that all we thought we saw was a lie ; that there was no world , no men nor women , no horses nor mules , no olive trees . But whither are we straying ? I asked what induced you to come to this country  --  you tell me the glory of God and Tebleque . Disparate ! tell that to the Busne . You have good reasons for coming , no doubt , else you would not be here . Some say you are a spy of the Londone , perhaps you are ; I care not . Rise , brother , and tell me whether any one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant object , " I replied ; " like a speck on the side of the hill . " The Gypsy started up , and we both fixed our eyes on the object : the distance was so great that it was at first with difficulty that we could distinguish whether it moved or not . A quarter of an hour , however , dispelled all doubts , for within this time it had nearly reached the bottom of the hill , and we could descry a figure seated on an animal of some kind . " It is a woman , " said I , at length , " mounted on a grey donkey . " " Then it is my messenger , " said Antonio , " for it can be no other . " The woman and the donkey were now upon the plain , and for some time were concealed from us by the copse and brushwood which intervened . They were not long , however , in making their appearance at the distance of about a hundred yards . The donkey was a beautiful creature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tail , and moving her feet so quick that they scarcely seemed to touch the ground . The animal no sooner perceived us than she stopped short , turned round , and attempted to escape by the way she had come ; her rider , however , detained her , whereupon the donkey kicked violently , and would probably have flung the former , had she not sprung nimbly to the ground . The form of the woman was entirely concealed by the large wrapping man 's cloak which she wore . I ran to assist her , when she turned her face full upon me , and I instantly recognized the sharp clever features of Antonia , whom I had seen at Badajoz , the daughter of my guide . She said nothing to me , but advancing to her father , addressed something to him in a low voice , which I did not hear . He started back , and vociferated " All ! " " Yes , " said she in a louder tone , probably repeating the words which I had not caught before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time like one astounded and , unwilling to listen to their discourse , which I imagined might relate to business of Egypt , I walked away amidst the thickets . I was absent for some time , but could occasionally hear passionate expressions and oaths . In about half an hour I returned ; they had left the road , but I found then behind the broom clump , where the animals stood . Both were seated on the ground ; the features of the Gypsy were peculiarly dark and grim ; he held his unsheathed knife in his hand , which he would occasionally plunge into the earth , exclaiming , " All ! All ! " " Brother , " said he at last , " I can go no farther with you ; the business which carried me to Castumba is settled ; you must now travel by yourself and trust to your baji ( fortune ) . " " I trust in Undevel , " I replied , " who wrote my fortune long ago . But how am I to journey ? I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gypsy appeared to reflect : " I want the horse , it is true , brother , " he said , " and likewise the macho ; but you shall not go en pindre ( on foot ) ; you shall purchase the burra of Antonia , which I presented her when I sent her upon this expedition . " " The burra , " I replied , " appears both savage and vicious . " " She is both , brother , and on that account I bought her ; a savage and vicious beast has generally four excellent legs . You are a Calo , brother , and can manage her ; you shall therefore purchase the savage burra , giving my daugher Antonia a baria of gold . If you think fit , you can sell the beast at Talavera or Madrid , for Estremenian bestis are highly considered in Castumba . " In less than an hour I was on the other side of the pass , mounted on the savage burra . CHAPTER XI The Pass of Mirabete  --  Wolves and Shepherds  --  Female Subtlety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains  --  The Dark Hour  --  The Traveller of the Night  --  Abarbenel  --  Hoarded Treasure  --  Force of Gold -- The Archbishop  --  Arrival at Madrid I proceeded down the pass of Mirabete , occasionally ruminating on the matter which had brought me to Spain , and occasionally admiring one of the finest prospects in the world ; before me outstretched lay immense plains , bounded in the distance by huge mountains , whilst at the foot of the hill which I was now descending , rolled the Tagus , in a deep narrow stream , between lofty banks ; the whole was gilded by the rays of the setting sun ; for the day , though cold and wintry , was bright and clear . In about an hour I reached the river at a place where stood the remains of what had once been a magnificent bridge , which had , however , been blown up in the Peninsular war and never since repaired . I crossed the river in a ferry-boat ; the passage was rather difficult , the current very rapid and swollen , owing to the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I demanded of the ferryman , on reaching the further bank . " The raya is many leagues from hence , " replied the ferryman ; " you seem a stranger . Whence do you come ? " " From England , " I replied , and without waiting for an answer , I sprang on the burra , and proceeded on my way . The burra plied her feet most nimbly , and , shortly after nightfall , brought me to a village at about two leagues ' distance from the river 's bank . I sat down in the venta where I put up ; there was a huge fire , consisting of the greater part of the trunk of an olive tree ; the company was rather miscellaneous : a hunter with his escopeta ; a brace of shepherds with immense dogs , of that species for which Estremadura is celebrated ; a broken soldier , just returned from the wars ; and a beggar , who , after demanding charity for the seven wounds of Maria Santissima , took a seat amidst us , and made himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and busied herself in cooking my supper , which consisted of the game which I had purchased at Jaraicejo , and which , on my taking leave of the Gypsy , he had counselled me to take with me . In the meantime , I sat by the fire listening to the conversation of the company . " I would I were a wolf , " said one of the shepherds ; " or , indeed , anything rather than what I am . A pretty life is this of ours , out in the campo , among the carascales , suffering heat and cold for a peseta a day . I would I were a wolf ; he fares better and is more respected than the wretch of a shepherd . " " But he frequently fares scurvily , " said I ; " the shepherd and dogs fall upon him , and then he pays for his temerity with the loss of his head . " " That is not often the case , senor traveller , " said the shepherd ; " he watches his opportunity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attacking him , it is no very pleasant task ; he has both teeth and claws , and dog or man , who has once felt them , likes not to venture a second time within his reach . These dogs of mine will seize a bear singly with considerable alacrity , though he is a most powerful animal , but I have seen them run howling away from a wolf , even though there were two or three of us at hand to encourage them . " " A dangerous person is the wolf , " said the other shepherd , " and cunning as dangerous ; who knows more than he ? He knows the vulnerable point of every animal ; see , for example , how he flies at the neck of a bullock , tearing open the veins with his grim teeth and claws . But does he attack a horse in this manner ? I trow not . " " Not he , " said the other shepherd , " he is too good a judge ; but he fastens on the haunches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse when he comes near the dwelling of the wolf . My master was the other day riding in the despoblado , above the pass , on his fine Andalusian steed , which had cost him five hundred dollars ; suddenly the horse stopped , and sweated and trembled like a woman in the act of fainting ; my master could not conceive the reason , but presently he heard a squealing and growling in the bushes , whereupon he fired off his gun and scared the wolves , who scampered away ; but he tells me , that the horse has not yet recovered from his fright . " " Yet the mares know , occasionally , how to balk him , " replied his companion ; " there is great craft and malice in mares , as there is in all females ; see them feeding in the campo with their young cria about them ; presently the alarm is given that the wolf is drawing near ; they start wildly and run about for a moment , but it is only for a moment  --  amain they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre of which they place the foals . Onward comes the wolf , hoping to make his dinner on horse-flesh ; he is mistaken , however , the mares have balked him , and are as cunning as himself : not a tail is to be seen  --  not a hinder quarter  --  but there stands the whole troop , their fronts towards him ready to receive him , and as he runs around them barking and howling , they rise successively on their hind legs , ready to stamp him to the earth , should he attempt to hurt their cria or themselves . " " Worse than the he-wolf , " said the soldier , " is the female , for as the senor pastor has well observed , there is more malice in women than in males : to see one of these she-demons with a troop of the males at her heels is truly surprising : where she turns , they turn , and what she does that do they ; for they appear bewitched , and have no power but to imitate her actions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Galicia , when we heard a howl . ' Those are wolves , ' said my companion , ' let us get out of the way ; ' so we stepped from the path and ascended the side of the hill a little way , to a terrace , where grew vines , after the manner of Galicia : presently appeared a large grey she-wolf , deshonesta , snapping and growling at a troop of demons , who followed close behind , their tails uplifted , and their eyes like fire-brands . What do you think the perverse brute did ? Instead of keeping to the path , she turned in the very direction in which we were ; there was now no remedy , so we stood still . I was the first upon the terrace , and by me she passed so close that I felt her hair brush against my legs ; she , however , took no notice of me , but pushed on , neither looking to the right nor left , and all the other wolves trotted by me without offering the slightest injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could say as much for my poor companion , who stood farther on , and was , I believe , less in the demon 's way than I was ; she had nearly passed him , when suddenly she turned half round and snapped at him . I shall never forget what followed : in a moment a dozen wolves were upon him , tearing him limb from limb , with howlings like nothing in this world ; in a few moments he was devoured ; nothing remained but a skull and a few bones ; and then they passed on in the same manner as they came . Good reason had I to be grateful that my lady wolf took less notice of me than my poor comrade . " Listening to this and similar conversation , I fell into a doze before the fire , in which I continued for a considerable time , but was at length aroused by a voice exclaiming in a loud tone , " All are captured ! " These were the exact words which , when spoken by his daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , the company consisted of the same individuals to whose conversation I had been listening before I sank into slumber ; but the beggar was now the spokesman , and he was haranguing with considerable vehemence . " I beg your pardon , Caballero , " said I , " but I did not hear the commencement of your discourse . Who are those who have been captured ? " " A band of accursed Gitanos , Caballero , " replied the beggar , returning the title of courtesy , which I had bestowed upon him . " During more than a fortnight they have infested the roads on the frontier of Castile , and many have been the gentleman travellers like yourself whom they have robbed and murdered . It would seem that the Gypsy canaille must needs take advantage of these troublous times , and form themselves into a faction . It is said that the fellows of whom I am speaking expected many more of their brethren to join them , which is likely enough , for all Gypsies are thieves : but praised be God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw them myself conveyed to the prison at - . Thanks be to God . Todos estan presos . " " The mystery is now solved , " said I to myself , and proceeded to despatch my supper , which was now ready . The next day 's journey brought me to a considerable town , the name of which I have forgotten . It is the first in New Castile , in this direction . I passed the night as usual in the manger of the stable , close beside the Caballeria ; for , as I travelled upon a donkey , I deemed it incumbent upon me to be satisfied with a couch in keeping with my manner of journeying , being averse , by any squeamish and over delicate airs , to generate a suspicion amongst the people with whom I mingled that I was aught higher than what my equipage and outward appearance might lead them to believe . Rising before daylight , I again proceeded on my way , hoping ere night to be able to reach Talavera , which I was informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unbroken level , for the most part covered with olive trees . On the left , however , at the distance of a few leagues , rose the mighty mountains which I have already mentioned . They run eastward in a seemingly interminable range , parallel with the route which I was pursuing ; their tops and sides were covered with dazzling snow , and the blasts which came sweeping from them across the wide and melancholy plains were of bitter keenness . " What mountains are those ? " I inquired of a barber-surgeon , who , mounted like myself on a grey burra , joined me about noon , and proceeded in my company for several leagues . " They have many names , Caballero , " replied the barber ; " according to the names of the neighbouring places so they are called . Yon portion of them is styled the Serrania of Plasencia ; and opposite to Madrid they are termed the Mountains of Guadarama , from a river of that name , which descends from them ; they run a vast way , Caballero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side is Old Castile . They are mighty mountains , and though they generate much cold , I take pleasure in looking at them , which is not to be wondered at , seeing that I was born amongst them , though at present , for my sins , I live in a village of the plain . Caballero , there is not another such range in Spain ; they have their secrets too  --  their mysteries  - -  strange tales are told of those hills , and of what they contain in their deep recesses , for they are a broad chain , and you may wander days and days amongst them without coming to any termino . Many have lost themselves on those hills , and have never again been heard of . Strange things are told of them : it is said that in certain places there are deep pools and lakes , in which dwell monsters , huge serpents as long as a pine tree , and horses of the flood , which sometimes come out and commit mighty damage . One thing is certain , that yonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those hills , there is a wonderful valley , so narrow that only at midday is the face of the sun to be descried from it . That valley lay undiscovered and unknown for thousands of years ; no person dreamed of its existence , but at last , a long time ago , certain hunters entered it by chance , and then what do you think they found , Caballero ? They found a small nation or tribe of unknown people , speaking an unknown language , who , perhaps , had lived there since the creation of the world , without intercourse with the rest of their fellow creatures , and without knowing that other beings besides themselves existed ! Caballero , did you never hear of the valley of the Batuecas ? Many books have been written about that valley and those people . Caballero , I am proud of yonder hills ; and were I independent , and without wife or children , I would purchase a burra like that of your own , which I see is an excellent one , and far superior to mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteries , and had seen all the wondrous things which they contain . " Throughout the day I pressed the burra forward , only stopping once in order to feed the animal ; but , notwithstanding that she played her part very well , night came on , and I was still about two leagues from Talavera . As the sun went down , the cold became intense ; I drew the old Gypsy cloak , which I still wore , closer around me , but I found it quite inadequate to protect me from the inclemency of the atmosphere . The road , which lay over a plain , was not very distinctly traced , and became in the dusk rather difficult to find , more especially as cross roads leading to different places were of frequent occurrence . I , however , proceeded in the best manner I could , and when I became dubious as to the course which I should take , I invariably allowed the animal on which I was mounted to decide . At length the moon shone out faintly , when suddenly by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight distance . I quickened the pace of the burra , and was soon close at its side . It went on , neither altering its pace nor looking round for a moment . It was the figure of a man , the tallest and bulkiest that I had hitherto seen in Spain , dressed in a manner strange and singular for the country . On his head was a hat with a low crown and broad brim , very much resembling that of an English waggoner ; about his body was a long loose tunic or slop , seemingly of coarse ticken , open in front , so as to allow the interior garments to be occasionally seen ; these appeared to consist of a jerkin and short velveteen pantaloons . I have said that the brim of the hat was broad , but broad as it was , it was insufficient to cover an immense bush of coal-black hair , which , thick and curly , projected on either side ; over the left shoulder was flung a kind of satchel , and in the right hand was held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange about the figure , but what struck me the most was the tranquillity with which it moved along , taking no heed of me , though of course aware of my proximity , but looking straight forward along the road , save when it occasionally raised a huge face and large eyes towards the moon , which was now shining forth in the eastern quarter . " A cold night , " said I at last . " Is this the way to Talavera ? " " It is the way to Talavera , and the night is cold . " " I am going to Talavera , " said I , " as I suppose you are yourself . " " I am going thither , so are you , Bueno . " The tones of the voice which delivered these words were in their way quite as strange and singular as the figure to which the voice belonged ; they were not exactly the tones of a Spanish voice , and yet there was something in them that could hardly be foreign ; the pronunciation also was correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was most struck with the manner in which the last word , bueno , was spoken . I had heard something like it before , but where or when I could by no means remember . A pause now ensued ; the figure stalking on as before with the most perfect indifference , and seemingly with no disposition either to seek or avoid conversation . " Are you not afraid , " said I at last , " to travel these roads in the dark ? It is said that there are robbers abroad . " " Are you not rather afraid , " replied the figure , " to travel these roads in the dark ?  --  you who are ignorant of the country , who are a foreigner , an Englishman ! " " How is it that you know me to be an Englishman ? " demanded I , much surprised . " That is no difficult matter , " replied the figure ; " the sound of your voice was enough to tell me that . " " You speak of voices , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to tell me who you are ? " " That it will not do , " replied my companion ; " you know nothing about me  --  you can know nothing about me . " " Be not sure of that , my friend ; I am acquainted with many things of which you have little idea . " " Por exemplo , " said the figure . " For example , " said I ; " you speak two languages . " The figure moved on , seemed to consider a moment , and then said slowly bueno . " You have two names , " I continued ; " one for the house and the other for the street ; both are good , but the one by which you are called at home is the one which you like best . " The man walked on about ten paces , in the same manner as he had previously done ; all of a sudden he turned , and taking the bridle of the burra gently in his hand , stopped her . I had now a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features and Herculean form still occasionally revisit me in my dreams . I see him standing in the moonshine , staring me in the face with his deep calm eyes . At last he said : " Are you then one of us ? " * * * * It was late at night when we arrived at Talavera . We went to a large gloomy house , which my companion informed me was the principal posada of the town . We entered the kitchen , at the extremity of which a large fire was blazing . " Pepita , " said my companion to a handsome girl , who advanced smiling towards us ; " a brasero and a private apartment ; this cavalier is a friend of mine , and we shall sup together . " We were shown to an apartment in which were two alcoves containing beds . After supper , which consisted of the very best , by the order of my companion , we sat over the brasero and commenced talking . Myself .  --  Of course you have conversed with Englishmen before , else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my voice . Abarbenel.  --  I was a young lad when the war of the Independence broke out , and there came to the village in which our family lived an English officer in order to teach discipline to the new levies . He was quartered in my father 's house , where he conceived a great affection for me . On his departure , with the consent of my father , I attended him through the Castiles , partly as companion , partly as domestic . I was with him nearly a year , when he was suddenly summoned to return to his own country . He would fain have taken me with him , but to that my father would by no means consent . It is now five-and-twenty years since I last saw an Englishman ; but you have seen how I recognized you even in the dark night . Myself .  --  And what kind of life do you pursue , and by what means do you obtain support ? Abarbenel.  --  I experience no difficulty . I live much in the same way as I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his course has been mine . At his death I took possession of the herencia , for I was his only child . It was not requisite that I should follow any business , for my wealth was great ; yet , to avoid remark , I followed that of my father , who was a longanizero . I have occasionally dealt in wool : but lazily , lazily  --  as I had no stimulus for exertion . I was , however , successful in many instances , strangely so ; much more than many others who toiled day and night , and whose whole soul was in the trade . Myself .  --  Have you any children ? Are you married ? Abarbenel.  --  I have no children though I am married . I have a wife and an amiga , or I should rather say two wives , for I am wedded to both . I however call one my amiga , for appearance sake , for I wish to live in quiet , and am unwilling to offend the prejudices of the surrounding people . Myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wealth consist ? Abarbenel.  --  In gold and silver , and stones of price ; for I have inherited all the hoards of my forefathers . The greater part is buried under ground ; indeed , I have never examined the tenth part of it . I have coins of silver and gold older than the times of Ferdinand the Accursed and Jezebel ; I have also large sums employed in usury . We keep ourselves close , however , and pretend to be poor , miserably so ; but on certain occasions , at our festivals , when our gates are barred , and our savage dogs are let loose in the court , we eat our food off services such as the Queen of Spain can not boast of , and wash our feet in ewers of silver , fashioned and wrought before the Americas were discovered , though our garments are at all times coarse , and our food for the most part of the plainest description . Myself .  --  Are there more of you than yourself and your two wives ? Abarbenel.  --  There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one is a youth , and is about to leave , being betrothed to one at some distance ; the other is old ; he is now upon the road , following me with a mule and car . Myself .  --  And whither are you bound at present ? Abarbenel.  --  To Toledo , where I ply my trade occasionally of longanizero . I love to wander about , though I seldom stray far from home . Since I left the Englishman my feet have never once stepped beyond the bounds of New Castile . I love to visit Toledo , and to think of the times which have long since departed ; I should establish myself there , were there not so many accursed ones , who look upon me with an evil eye . Myself .  --  Are you known for what you are ? Do the authorities molest you ? Abarbenel.  --  People of course suspect me to be what I am ; but as I conform outwardly in most respects to their ways , they do not interfere with me . True it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass , they glare at me over the left shoulder , as much as to say  --  " What do you here ? " And sometimes they cross themselves as I pass by ; but as they go no further , I do not trouble myself on that account . With respect to the authorities , they are not bad friends of mine . Many of the higher class have borrowed money from me on usury , so that I have them to a certain extent in my power , and as for the low alguazils and corchetes , they would do any thing to oblige me in consideration of a few dollars , which I occasionally give them ; so that matters upon the whole go on remarkably well . Of old , indeed , it was far otherwise ; yet , I know not how it was , though other families suffered much , ours always enjoyed a tolerable share of tranquillity . The truth is , that our family has always known how to guide itself wonderfully . I may say there is much of the wisdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and with respect to enemies , it is by no means safe to meddle with us ; for it is a rule of our house never to forgive an injury , and to spare neither trouble nor expense in bringing ruin and destruction upon the heads of our evil doers . Myself .  --  Do the priests interfere with you ? Abarbenel.  --  They let me alone , especially in our own neighbourhood . Shortly after the death of my father , one hot-headed individual endeavoured to do me an evil turn , but I soon requited him , causing him to be imprisoned on a charge of blasphemy , and in prison he remained a long time , till he went mad and died . Myself .  --  Have you a head in Spain , in whom is rested the chief authority ? Abarbenel.  --  Not exactly . There are , however , certain holy families who enjoy much consideration ; my own is one of these  --  the chiefest , I may say . My grandsire was a particularly holy man ; and I have heard my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house secretly , merely to have the satisfaction of kissing his head . Myself .  --  How can that be ; what reverence could an archbishop entertain for one like yourself or your grandsire ? Abarbenel.  --  More than you imagine . He was one of us , at least his father was , and he could never forget what he had learned with reverence in his infancy . He said he had tried to forget it , but he could not ; that the ruah was continually upon him , and that even from his childhood he had borne its terrors with a troubled mind , till at last he could bear himself no longer ; so he went to my grandsire , with whom he remained one whole night ; he then returned to his diocese , where he shortly afterwards died , in much renown for sanctity . Myself .  --  What you say surprises me . Have you reason to suppose that many of you are to be found amongst the priesthood ? Abarbenel.  --  Not to suppose , but to know it . There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inferior priesthood either ; some of the most learned and famed of them in Spain have been of us , or of our blood at least , and many of them at this day think as I do . There is one particular festival of the year at which four dignified ecclesiastics are sure to visit me ; and then , when all is made close and secure , and the fitting ceremonies have been gone through , they sit down upon the floor and curse . Myself .  --  Are you numerous in the large towns ? Abarbenel.  --  By no means ; our places of abode are seldom the large towns ; we prefer the villages , and rarely enter the large towns but on business . Indeed we are not a numerous people , and there are few provinces of Spain which contain more than twenty families . None of us are poor , and those among us who serve , do so more from choice than necessity , for by serving each other we acquire different trades . Not unfrequently the time of service is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters of the house . We continued in discourse the greater part of the night ; the next morning I prepared to depart . My companion , however , advised me to remain where I was for that day . " And if you respect my counsel , " said he , " you will not proceed farther in this manner . To-night the diligence will arrive from Estremadura , on its way to Madrid . Deposit yourself therein ; it is the safest and most speedy mode of travelling . As for your animal , I will myself purchase her . My servant is here , and has informed me that she will be of service to us . Let us , therefore , pass the day together in communion , like brothers , and then proceed on our separate journeys . " We did pass the day together ; and when the diligence arrived I deposited myself within , and on the morning of the second day arrived at Madrid . CHAPTER XII Lodging at Madrid  --  My Hostess  --  British Ambassador  --  Mendizabal  - -  Baltasar  --  Duties of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The Higher Orders  --  The Lower Classes  --  The Bull-fighter  --  The Crabbed Gitano . It was the commencement of February when I reached Madrid . After staying a few days at a posada , I removed to a lodging which I engaged at No. 3 , in the Calle de la Zarza , a dark dirty street , which , however , was close to the Puerta del Sol , the most central point of Madrid , into which four or five of the principal streets debouche , and which is , at all times of the year , the great place of assemblage for the idlers of the capital , poor or rich . It was rather a singular house in which I had taken up my abode . I occupied the front part of the first floor ; my apartments consisted of an immense parlour , and a small chamber on one side in which I slept ; the parlour , notwithstanding its size , contained very little furniture : a few chairs , a table , and a species of sofa , constituted the whole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draughts which poured in from three large windows , and from sundry doors . The mistress of the house , attended by her two daughters , ushered me in . " Did you ever see a more magnificent apartment ? " demanded the former ; " is it not fit for a king 's son ? Last winter it was occupied by the great General Espartero . " The hostess was an exceedingly fat woman , a native of Valladolid , in Old Castile . " Have you any other family , " I demanded , " besides these daughters ? " " Two sons , " she replied ; " one of them an officer in the army , father of this urchin , " pointing to a wicked but clever looking boy of about twelve , who at that moment bounded into the room ; " the other is the most celebrated national in Madrid : he is a tailor by trade , and his name is Baltasar . He has much influence with the other nationals , on account of the liberality of his opinions , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed and furious to the Puerta del Sol . He is , however , at present confined to his bed , for he is very dissipated and fond of the company of bull-fighters and people still worse . " As my principal motive for visiting the Spanish capital was the hope of obtaining permission from the government to print the New Testament in the Castilian language , for circulation in Spain , I lost no time , upon my arrival , in taking what I considered to be the necessary steps . I was an entire stranger at Madrid , and bore no letters of introduction to any persons of influence , who might have assisted me in this undertaking , so that , notwithstanding I entertained a hope of success , relying on the assistance of the Almighty , this hope was not at all times very vivid , but was frequently overcast with the clouds of despondency . Mendizabal was at this time prime minister of Spain , and was considered as a man of almost unbounded power , in whose hands were placed the destinies of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means induce him to favour my views , I should have no reason to fear interruption from other quarters , and I determined upon applying to him . Before talking this step , however , I deemed it advisable to wait upon Mr. Villiers , the British ambassador at Madrid ; and with the freedom permitted to a British subject , to ask his advice in this affair . I was received with great kindness , and enjoyed a conversation with him on various subjects before I introduced the matter which I had most at heart . He said that if I wished for an interview with Mendizabal , he would endeavour to procure me one , but , at the same time , told me frankly that he could not hope that any good would arise from it , as he knew him to be violently prejudiced against the British and Foreign Bible Society , and was far more likely to discountenance than encourage any efforts which they might be disposed to make for introducing the Gospel into Spain . I , however , remained resolute in my desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained a letter of introduction to Mendizabal . Early one morning I repaired to the palace , in a wing of which was the office of the Prime Minister ; it was bitterly cold , and the Guadarama , of which there is a noble view from the palace-plain , was covered with snow . For at least three hours I remained shivering with cold in an ante-room , with several other aspirants for an interview with the man of power . At last his private secretary made his appearance , and after putting various questions to the others , addressed himself to me , asking who I was and what I wanted . I told him that I was an Englishman , and the bearer of a letter from the British Minister . " If you have no objection , I will myself deliver it to His Excellency , " said he ; whereupon I handed it to him and he withdrew . Several individuals were admitted before me ; at last , however , my own turn came , and I was ushered into the presence of Mendizabal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his eyes were intently fixed . He took not the slightest notice when I entered , and I had leisure enough to survey him : he was a huge athletic man , somewhat taller than myself , who measure six feet two without my shoes ; his complexion was florid , his features fine and regular , his nose quite aquiline , and his teeth splendidly white : though scarcely fifty years of age , his hair was remarkably grey ; he was dressed in a rich morning gown , with a gold chain round his neck , and morocco slippers on his feet . His secretary , a fine intellectual looking man , who , as I was subsequently informed , had acquired a name both in English and Spanish literature , stood at one end of the table with papers in his hands . After I had been standing about a quarter of an hour , Mendizabal suddenly lifted up a pair of sharp eyes , and fixed them upon me with a peculiarly scrutinizing glance . " I have seen a glance very similar to that amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . My interview with him lasted nearly an hour . Some singular discourse passed between us : I found him , as I had been informed , a bitter enemy to the Bible Society , of which he spoke in terms of hatred and contempt , and by no means a friend to the Christian religion , which I could easily account for . I was not discouraged , however , and pressed upon him the matter which brought me thither , and was eventually so far successful , as to obtain a promise , that at the expiration of a few months , when he hoped the country would be in a more tranquil state , I should be allowed to print the Scriptures . As I was going away he said , " Yours is not the first application I have had ; ever since I have held the reins of government I have been pestered in this manner , by English calling themselves Evangelical Christians , who have of late come flocking over into Spain . Only last week a hunchbacked fellow found his way into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told me that Christ was coming . . . . And now you have made your appearance , and almost persuaded me to embroil myself yet more with the priesthood , as if they did not abhor me enough already . What a strange infatuation is this which drives you over lands and waters with Bibles in your hands . My good sir , it is not Bibles we want , but rather guns and gunpowder , to put the rebels down with , and above all , money , that we may pay the troops ; whenever you come with these three things you shall have a hearty welcome , if not , we really can dispense with your visits , however great the honour . " Myself .  --  There will be no end to the troubles of this afflicted country until the gospel have free circulation . Mendizabal.  --  I expected that answer , for I have not lived thirteen years in England without forming some acquaintance with the phraseology of you good folks . Now , now , pray go ; you see how engaged I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not be within the next three months . " Don Jorge , " said my hostess , coming into my apartment one morning , whilst I sat at breakfast with my feet upon the brasero , " here is my son Baltasarito , the national ; he has risen from his bed , and hearing that there is an Englishman in the house , he has begged me to introduce him , for he loves Englishmen on account of the liberality of their opinions ; there he is , what do you think of him ? " I did not state to his mother what I thought ; it appeared to me , however , that she was quite right calling him Baltasarito , which is the diminutive of Baltasar , forasmuch as that ancient and sonorous name had certainly never been bestowed on a more diminutive personage : he might measure about five feet one inch , though he was rather corpulent for his height ; his face looked yellow and sickly , he had , however , a kind of fanfaronading air , and his eyes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His dress , or rather his undress , was somewhat shabby : he had a foraging cap on his head , and in lieu of a morning gown , he wore a sentinel 's old great coat . " I am glad to make your acquaintance , senor nacional , " said I to him , after his mother had departed , and Baltasar had taken his seat , and of course lighted a paper cigar at the brasero . " I am glad to have made your acquaintance , more especially as your lady mother has informed me that you have great influence with the nationals . I am a stranger in Spain , and may want a friend ; fortune has been kind to me in procuring me one who is a member of so powerful a body . " Baltasar.  --  Yes , I have a great deal to say with the other nationals ; there is none in Madrid better known than Baltasar , or more dreaded by the Carlists . You say you may stand in need of a friend ; there is no fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any of the other nationals will be proud to go out with you as padrinos , should you have any affair of honour on your hands . But why do you not become one of us ? We would gladly receive you into our body . Myself .  --  Is the duty of a national particularly hard ? Baltasar.  --  By no means ; we have to do duty about once every fifteen days , and then there is occasionally a review , which does not last long . No ! the duties of a national are by no means onerous , and the privileges are great . I have seen three of my brother nationals walk up and down the Prado of a Sunday , with sticks in their hands , cudgelling all the suspicious characters , and it is our common practice to scour the streets at night , and then if we meet any person who is obnoxious to us , we fall upon him , and with a knife or a bayonet generally leave him wallowing in his blood on the pavement : no one but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Of course none but persons of liberal opinions are to be found amongst the nationals ? Baltasar.  --  Would it were so ! There are some amongst us , Don Jorge , who are no better than they should be ; they are few , however , and for the most part well known . Theirs is no pleasant life , for when they mount guard with the rest they are scouted , and not unfrequently cudgelled . The law compels all of a certain age either to serve in the army or to become national soldiers on which account some of these Godos are to be found amongst us . Myself .  --  Are there many in Madrid of the Carlist opinion ? Baltasar.  --  Not among the young people ; the greater part of the Madrilenian Carlists capable of bearing arms departed long ago to join the ranks of the factious in the Basque provinces . Those who remain are for the most part grey-beards and priests , good for nothing but to assemble in private coffee-houses , and to prate treason together . Let them prate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spain do not depend on the wishes of ojalateros and pasteleros , but on the hands of stout gallant nationals like myself and friends , Don Jorge . Myself .  --  I am sorry to learn from your lady mother , that you are strangely dissipated . Baltasar.  --  Ho , ho , Don Jorge , she has told you that , has she ; what would you have , Don Jorge ? I am young , and young blood will have its course . I am called Baltasar the gay by all the other nationals , and it is on account of my gaiety and the liberality of my opinions that I am so popular among them . When I mount guard I invariably carry my guitar with me , and then there is sure to be a function at the guard-house . We send for wine , Don Jorge , and the nationals become wild , Don Jorge , dancing and drinking through the night , whilst Baltasarito strums the guitar and sings them songs of Germania : " Una romi sin pachi Le peno a su chindomar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I learnt it from the toreros of Andalusia , who all speak Gitano , and are mostly of Gypsy blood . I learnt it from them ; they are all friends of mine , Montes Sevilla and Poquito Pan . I never miss a function of bulls , Don Jorge . Baltasar is sure to be there with his amiga . Don Jorge , there are no bull-functions in the winter , or I would carry you to one , but happily to-morrow there is an execution , a funcion de la horca ; and there we will go , Don Jorge . We did go to see this execution , which I shall long remember . The criminals were two young men , brothers ; they suffered for a most atrocious murder , having in the dead of night broke open the house of an aged man , whom they put to death , and whose property they stole . Criminals in Spain are not hanged as they are in England , or guillotined as in France , but strangled upon a wooden stage . They sit down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is affixed an iron collar with a screw ; this iron collar is made to clasp the neck of the prisoner , and on a certain signal it is drawn tighter and tighter by means of the screw , until life becomes extinct . After we had waited amongst the assembled multitude a considerable time , the first of the culprits appeared ; he was mounted on an ass , without saddle or stirrups , his legs being allowed to dangle nearly to the ground . He was dressed in yellow sulphur-coloured robes , with a high-peaked conical red hat on his head , which was shaven . Between his hands he held a parchment , on which was written something , I believe the confession of faith . Two priests led the animal by the bridle ; two others walked on either side , chanting litanies , amongst which I distinguished the words of heavenly peace and tranquillity , for the culprit had been reconciled to the church , had confessed and received absolution , and had been promised admission to heaven . He did not exhibit the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was led , not supported , up the scaffold , where he was placed on the chair , and the fatal collar put round his neck . One of the priests then in a loud voice commenced saying the Belief , and the culprit repeated the words after him . On a sudden , the executioner , who stood behind , commenced turning the screw , which was of prodigious force , and the wretched man  --  was almost instantly a corpse ; but , as the screw went round , the priest began to shout , " pax et misericordia et tranquillitas , " and still as he shouted , his voice became louder and louder , till the lofty walls of Madrid rang with it : then stooping down , he placed his mouth close to the culprit 's ear , still shouting , just as if he would pursue the spirit through its course to eternity , cheering it on its way . The effect was tremendous . I myself was so excited that I involuntarily shouted " misericordia , " and so did many others . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; only the priest was thought of , for he seemed at that moment to be the first being in existence , and to have the power of opening and shutting the gates of heaven or of hell , just as he should think proper . A striking instance of the successful working of the Popish system , whose grand aim has ever been to keep people 's minds as far as possible from God , and to centre their hopes and fears in the priesthood . The execution of the second culprit was precisely similar ; he ascended the scaffold a few minutes after his brother had breathed his last . I have visited most of the principal capitals of the world , but upon the whole none has ever so interested me as this city of Madrid , in which I now found myself . I will not dwell upon its streets , its edifices , its public squares , its fountains , though some of these are remarkable enough : but Petersburg has finer streets , Paris and Edinburgh more stately edifices , London far nobler squares , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cooler waters . But the population ! Within a mud wall , scarcely one league and a half in circuit , are contained two hundred thousand human beings , certainly forming the most extraordinary vital mass to be found in the entire world ; and be it always remembered that this mass is strictly Spanish . The population of Constantinople is extraordinary enough , but to form it twenty nations have contributed ; Greeks , Armenians , Persians , Poles , Jews , the latter , by the by , of Spanish origin , and speaking amongst themselves the old Spanish language ; but the huge population of Madrid , with the exception of a sprinkling of foreigners , chiefly French tailors , glove-makers and peruquiers , is strictly Spanish , though a considerable portion are not natives of the place . Here are no colonies of Germans , as at Saint Petersburg ; no English factories , as at Lisbon ; no multitudes of insolent Yankees lounging through the streets as at the Havannah , with an air which seems to say , the land is our own whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however strange and wild , and composed of various elements , is Spanish , and will remain so as long as the city itself shall exist . Hail , ye aguadores of Asturia ! who , in your dress of coarse duffel and leathern skull-caps , are seen seated in hundreds by the fountain sides , upon your empty water-casks , or staggering with them filled to the topmost stories of lofty houses . Hail , ye caleseros of Valencia ! who , lolling lazily against your vehicles , rasp tobacco for your paper cigars whilst waiting for a fare . Hail to you , beggars of La Mancha ! men and women , who , wrapped in coarse blankets , demand charity indifferently at the gate of the palace or the prison . Hail to you , valets from the mountains , mayordomos and secretaries from Biscay and Guipuscoa , toreros from Andalusia , riposteros from Galicia , shopkeepers from Catalonia ! Hail to ye , Castilians , Estremenians and Aragonese , of whatever calling ! And lastly , genuine sons of the capital , rabble of Madrid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second morning of May , worked such grim havoc amongst the legions of Murat ! And the higher orders  --  the ladies and gentlemen , the cavaliers and senoras ; shall I pass them by in silence ? The truth is I have little to say about them ; I mingled but little in their society , and what I saw of them by no means tended to exalt them in my imagination . I am not one of those who , wherever they go , make it a constant practice to disparage the higher orders , and to exalt the populace at their expense . There are many capitals in which the high aristocracy , the lords and ladies , the sons and daughters of nobility , constitute the most remarkable and the most interesting part of the population . This is the case at Vienna , and more especially at London . Who can rival the English aristocrat in lofty stature , in dignified bearing , in strength of hand , and valour of heart ? Who rides a nobler horse ? Who has a firmer seat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or daughter ? But with respect to the Spanish aristocracy , the ladies and gentlemen , the cavaliers and senoras , I believe the less that is said of them on the points to which I have just alluded the better . I confess , however , that I know little about them ; they have , perhaps , their admirers , and to the pens of such I leave their panegyric . Le Sage has described them as they were nearly two centuries ago . His description is anything but captivating , and I do not think that they have improved since the period of the sketches of the immortal Frenchman . I would sooner talk of the lower class , not only of Madrid but of all Spain . The Spaniard of the lower class has much more interest for me , whether manolo , labourer , or muleteer . He is not a common being ; he is an extraordinary man . He has not , it is true , the amiability and generosity of the Russian mujik , who will give his only rouble rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which renders him insensible to fear , and at the command of his Tsar , sends him singing to certain death . 6 There is more hardness and less self-devotion in the disposition of the Spaniard ; he possesses , however , a spirit of proud independence , which it is impossible but to admire . He is ignorant , of course ; but it is singular that I have invariably found amongst the low and slightly educated classes far more liberality of sentiment than amongst the upper . It has long been the fashion to talk of the bigotry of the Spaniards , and their mean jealousy of foreigners . This is true to a certain extent : but it chiefly holds good with respect to the upper classes . If foreign valour or talent has never received its proper meed in Spain , the great body of the Spaniards are certainly not in fault . I have heard Wellington calumniated in this proud scene of his triumphs , but never by the old soldiers of Aragon and the Asturias , who assisted to vanquish the French at Salamanca and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an English jockey criticized , but it was by the idiotic heir of Medina Celi , and not by a picador of the Madrilenian bull ring . Apropos of bull-fighters : - Shortly after my arrival , I one day entered a low tavern in a neighbourhood notorious for robbery and murder , and in which for the last two hours I had been wandering on a voyage of discovery . I was fatigued , and required refreshment . I found the place thronged with people , who had all the appearance of ruffians . I saluted them , upon which they made way for me to the bar , taking off their sombreros with great ceremony . I emptied a glass of val de penas , and was about to pay for it and depart , when a horrible looking fellow , dressed in a buff jerkin , leather breeches , and jackboots , which came half way up his thighs , and having on his head a white hat , the rims of which were at least a yard and a half in circumference , pushed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otra copita ! vamos Inglesito : Otra copita ! " " Thank you , my good sir , you are very kind , you appear to know me , but I have not the honour of knowing you . " " Not know me ! " replied the being . " I am Sevilla , the torero . I know you well ; you are the friend of Baltasarito , the national , who is a friend of mine , and a very good subject . " Then turning to the company , he said in a sonorous tone , laying a strong emphasis on the last syllable of every word , according to the custom of the gente rufianesca throughout Spain : " Cavaliers , and strong men , this cavalier is the friend of a friend of mine . Es mucho hombre . There is none like him in Spain . He speaks the crabbed Gitano though he is an Inglesito . " " We do not believe it , " replied several grave voices . " It is not possible . " " It is not possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , Balseiro , you who have been in prison all your life , and are always boasting that you can speak the crabbed Gitano , though I say you know nothing of it  --  come forward and speak to his worship in the crabbed Gitano . " A low , slight , but active figure stepped forward . He was in his shirt sleeves , and wore a montero cap ; his features were handsome , but they were those of a demon . He spoke a few words in the broken Gypsy slang of the prison , inquiring of me whether I had ever been in the condemned cell , and whether I knew what a Gitana 7 was ? " Vamos Inglesito , " shouted Sevilla in a voice of thunder ; " answer the monro in the crabbed Gitano . " I answered the robber , for such he was , and one , too , whose name will live for many a year in the ruffian histories of Madrid ; I answered him in a speech of some length , in the dialect of the Estremenian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " muttered Balseiro . " It is either that or English , for I understand not a word of it . " " Did I not say to you , " cried the bull-fighter , " that you knew nothing of the crabbed Gitano ? But this Inglesito does . I understood all he said . Vaya , there is none like him for the crabbed Gitano . He is a good ginete , too ; next to myself , there is none like him , only he rides with stirrup leathers too short . Inglesito , if you have need of money , I will lend you my purse . All I have is at your service , and that is not a little ; I have just gained four thousand chules by the lottery . Courage , Englishman ! Another cup . I will pay all . I , Sevilla ! " And he clapped his hand repeatedly on his breast , reiterating " I , Sevilla ! I  --  " CHAPTER XIII Intrigues at Court  --  Quesada and Galiano  --  Dissolution of the Cortes -- The Secretary  --  Aragonese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Three Thieves  --  Benedict Mol  --  The Men of Lucerne  --  The Treasure Mendizabal had told me to call upon him again at the end of three months , giving me hopes that he would not then oppose himself to the publication of the New Testament ; before , however , the three months had elapsed , he had fallen into disgrace , and had ceased to be prime minister . An intrigue had been formed against him , at the head of which were two quondam friends of his , and fellow-townsmen , Gaditanians , Isturitz and Alcala Galiano ; both of them had been egregious liberals in their day , and indeed principal members of those cortes which , on the Angouleme invasion , had hurried Ferdinand from Madrid to Cadiz , and kept him prisoner there until that impregnable town thought proper to surrender , and both of them had been subsequently refugees in England , where they had spent a considerable number of years . These gentlemen , however , finding themselves about this time exceedingly poor , and not seeing any immediate prospect of advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good men as he , and as capable of governing Spain in the present emergency ; determined to secede from the party of their friend , whom they had hitherto supported , and to set up for themselves . They therefore formed an opposition to Mendizabal in the cortes ; the members of this opposition assumed the name of moderados , in contradistinction to Mendizabal and his followers , who were ultra liberals . The moderados were encouraged by the Queen Regent Christina , who aimed at a little more power than the liberals were disposed to allow her , and who had a personal dislike to the minister . They were likewise encouraged by Cordova , who at that time commanded the army , and was displeased with Mendizabal , inasmuch as the latter did not supply the pecuniary demands of the general with sufficient alacrity , though it is said that the greater part of what was sent for the payment of the troops was not devoted to that purpose , but , was invested in the French funds in the name and for the use and behoof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means my intention to write an account of the political events which were passing around me at this period ; suffice it to say , that Mendizabal finding himself thwarted in all his projects by the regent and the general , the former of whom would adopt no measure which he recommended , whilst the latter remained inactive and refused to engage the enemy , which by this time had recovered from the check caused by the death of Zumalacarregui , and was making considerable progress , resigned and left the field for the time open to his adversaries , though he possessed an immense majority in the cortes , and had the voice of the nation , at least the liberal part of it , in his favour . Thereupon , Isturitz became head of the cabinet , Galiano minister of marine , and a certain Duke of Rivas minister of the interior . These were the heads of the moderado government , but as they were by no means popular at Madrid , and feared the nationals , they associated with themselves one who hated the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Quesada , a very stupid individual , but a great fighter , who , at one period of his life , had commanded a legion or body of men called the Army of the Faith , whose exploits both on the French and Spanish side of the Pyrenees are too well known to require recapitulation . This person was made captain general of Madrid . By far the most clever member of this government was Galiano , whose acquaintance I had formed shortly after my arrival . He was a man of considerable literature , and particularly well versed in that of his own country . He was , moreover , a fluent , elegant , and forcible speaker , and was to the moderado party within the cortes what Quesada was without , namely , their horses and chariots . Why he was made minister of marine is difficult to say , as Spain did not possess any ; perhaps , however , from his knowledge of the English language , which he spoke and wrote nearly as well as his own tongue , having indeed during his sojourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals , an honourable occupation , but to which few foreign exiles in England would be qualified to devote themselves . He was a very small and irritable man , and a bitter enemy to every person who stood in the way of his advancement . He hated Mendizabal with undisguised rancour , and never spoke of him but in terms of unmeasured contempt . " I am afraid that I shall have some difficulty in inducing Mendizabal to give me permission to print the Testament , " said I to him one day . " Mendizabal is a jackass , " replied Galiano . " Caligula made his horse consul , which I suppose induced Lord  --  to send over this huge burro of the Stock Exchange to be our minister . " It would be very ungrateful on my part were I not to confess my great obligations to Galiano , who assisted me to the utmost of his power in the business which had brought me to Spain . Shortly after the ministry was formed , I went to him and said , " that now or never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I will do so , " said he , in a waspish tone ; for he always spoke waspishly whether to friend or foe ; " but you must have patience for a few days , we are very much occupied at present . We have been outvoted in the cortes , and this afternoon we intend to dissolve them . It is believed that the rascals will refuse to depart , but Quesada will stand at the door ready to turn them out , should they prove refractory . Come along , and you will perhaps see a funcion . " After an hour 's debate , the cortes were dissolved without it being necessary to call in the aid of the redoubtable Quesada , and Galiano forthwith gave me a letter to his colleague the Duke of Rivas , in whose department he told me was vested the power either of giving or refusing the permission to print the book in question . The duke was a very handsome young man , of about thirty , an Andalusian by birth , like his two colleagues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and enjoyed a certain kind of literary reputation . He received me with the greatest affability ; and having heard what I had to say , he replied with a most captivating bow , and a genuine Andalusian grimace : " Go to my secretary ; go to my secretary  --  el hara por usted el gusio . " So I went to the secretary , whose name was Oliban , an Aragonese , who was not handsome , and whose manners were neither elegant nor affable . " You want permission to print the Testament ? " " I do , " said I. " And you have come to His Excellency about it , " continued Oliban . " Very true , " I replied . " I suppose you intend to print it without notes . " " Yes . " " Then His Excellency can not give you permission , " said the Aragonese secretary : " it was determined by the Council of Trent that no part of the Scripture should be printed in any Christian country without the notes of the church . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded . " I do not know how many years ago it was , " said Oliban ; " but such was the decree of the Council of Trent . " " Is Spain at present governed according to the decrees of the Council of Trent ? " I inquired . " In some points she is , " answered the Aragonese , " and this is one . But tell me who are you ? Are you known to the British minister ? " " O yes , and he takes a great interest in the matter . " " Does he ? " said Oliban ; " that indeed alters the case : if you can show me that His Excellency takes in interest in this business , I certainly shall not oppose myself to it . " The British minister performed all I could wish , and much more than I could expect ; he had an interview with the Duke of Rivas , with whom he had much discourse upon my affair : the duke was all smiles and courtesy . He moreover wrote a private letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I next paid him a visit , and , to crown all , he wrote a letter directed to myself , in which he did me the honour to say that he had a regard for me , and that nothing would afford him greater pleasure than to hear that I had obtained the permission which I was seeking . So I went to the duke , and delivered the letter . He was ten times more kind and affable than before : he read the letter , smiled most sweetly , and then , as if seized with sudden enthusiasm , he extended his arms in a manner almost theatrical , exclaiming , " Al secretario , el hara por usted el gusto . " Away I hurried to the secretary , who received me with all the coolness of an icicle : I related to him the words of his principal , and then put into his hand the letter of the British minister to myself . The secretary read it very deliberately , and then said that it was evident His Excellency did take an interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking a sheet of paper , sat down as if for the purpose of writing the permission . I was in ecstasy  --  all of a sudden , however , he stopped , lifted up his head , seemed to consider a moment , and then putting his pen behind his ear , he said , " Amongst the decrees of the Council of Trent is one to the effect " . . . . " Oh dear ! " said I. " A singular person is this Oliban , " said I to Galiano ; " you can not imagine what trouble he gives me : he is continually talking about the Council of Trent . " " I wish he was in the Trent up to the middle , " said Galiano , who , as I have observed already , spoke excellent English ; " I wish he was there for talking such nonsense . However , " said he , " we must not offend Oliban , he is one of us , and has done us much service ; he is , moreover , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when one of that nation once gets an idea into his head , it is the most difficult thing in the world to dislodge it ; however , we will go to him ; he is an old friend of mine , and I have no doubt but that we shall be able to make him listen to reason . " So the next day I called upon Galiano , at his marine or admiralty office ( what shall I call it ? ) , and from thence we proceeded to the bureau of the interior , a magnificent edifice , which had formerly been the casa of the Inquisition , where we had an interview with Oliban , whom Galiano took aside to the window , and there held with him a long conversation , which , as they spoke in whispers , and the room was immensely large , I did not hear . At length Galiano came to me and said , " There is some difficulty with respect to this business of yours , but I have told Oliban that you are a friend of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him now , and he will do anything to oblige you ; your affair is settled  --  farewell " ; whereupon he departed and I remained with Oliban , who proceeded forthwith to write something , which having concluded , he took out a box of cigars , and having lighted one and offered me another , which I declined as I do not smoke , he placed his feet against the table , and thus proceeded to address me , speaking in the French language . " It is with great pleasure that I see you in this capital , and , I may say , upon this business . I consider it a disgrace to Spain that there is no edition of the Gospel in circulation , at least such a one as would be within the reach of all classes of society , the highest or poorest ; one unencumbered with notes and commentaries , human devices , swelling it to an unwieldy bulk . I have no doubt that such an edition as you propose to print , would have a most beneficial influence on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know nothing of pure religion ; how should they ? seeing that the Gospel has always been sedulously kept from them , just as if civilization could exist where the light of the Gospel beameth not . The moral regeneration of Spain depends upon the free circulation of the Scriptures ; to which alone England , your own happy country , is indebted for its high state of civilization , and the unmatched prosperity which it at present enjoys ; all this I admit , in fact , reason compels me to do so , but  --  " " Now for it , " thought I. " But "  --  and then he began to talk once more of the wearisome Council of Trent , and I found that his writing in the paper , the offer of the cigar , and the long and prosy harangue were  --  what shall I call it ?  --  mere Greek text . By this time the spring was far advanced , the sides though not the tops of the Guadarama hills had long since lost their snows ; the trees of the Prado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighbourhood of Madrid smiled and was happy : the summer heats had not commenced , and the weather was truly delicious . Towards the west , at the foot of the hill on which stands Madrid , is a canal running parallel with the Manzanares for some leagues , from which it is separated by pleasant and fertile meadows . The banks of this canal , which was begun by Carlos Tercero , and has never been completed , are planted with beautiful trees , and form the most delightful walk in the neighbourhood of the capital . Here I would loiter for hours looking at the shoals of gold and silver fish which basked on the surface of the green sunny waters , or listening , not to the warbling of birds  --  for Spain is not the land of feathered choristers  --  but to the prattle of the narangero or man who sold oranges and water by a little deserted watch tower just opposite the wooden bridge that crosses the canal , which situation he had chosen as favourable for his trade , and there had placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about fifty years of age , and about five feet high . As I purchased freely of his fruit , he soon conceived a great friendship for me , and told me his history ; it contained , however , nothing very remarkable , the leading incident being an adventure which had befallen him amidst the mountains of Granada , where , falling into the hands of certain Gypsies , they stripped him naked , and then dismissed him with a sound cudgelling . " I have wandered throughout Spain , " said he , " and I have come to the conclusion that there are but two places worth living in , Malaga and Madrid . At Malaga everything is very cheap , and there is such an abundance of fish , that I have frequently seen them piled in heaps on the sea-shore : and as for Madrid , money is always stirring at the Corte , and I never go supperless to bed ; my only care is to sell my oranges , and my only hope that when I die I shall be buried yonder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the declivity of a gentle hill , at about a league 's distance , shone brightly in the sunshine the white walls of the Campo Santo , or common burying ground of Madrid . He was a fellow of infinite drollery , and , though he could scarcely read or write , by no means ignorant of the ways of the world ; his knowledge of individuals was curious and extensive , few people passing his stall with whose names , character , and history he was not acquainted . " Those two gentry , " said he , pointing to a magnificently dressed cavalier and lady , who had dismounted from a carriage , and arm in arm were coming across the wooden bridge , followed by two attendants ; " those gentry are the Infante Francisco Paulo , and his wife the Neapolitana , sister of our Christina ; he is a very good subject , but as for his wife  --  vaya  --  the veriest scold in Madrid ; she can say carrajo with the most ill-conditioned carrier of La Mancha , giving the true emphasis and genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amigo  --  she has neither formality nor politeness  --  I once saluted her , and she took no more notice of me than if I had not been what I am , an Asturian and a gentleman , of better blood than herself . Good day , Senor Don Francisco . Que tal ( how goes it ) ? very fine weather this  --  vaya su merced con Dios . Those three fellows who just stopped to drink water are great thieves , true sons of the prison ; I am always civil to them , for it would not do to be on ill terms ; they pay me or not , just as they think proper . I have been in some trouble on their account : about a year ago they robbed a man a little farther on beyond the second bridge . By the way , I counsel you , brother , not to go there , as I believe you often do  --  it is a dangerous place . They robbed a gentleman and ill-treated him , but his brother , who was an escribano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested ; but he wanted someone to identify them , and it chanced that they had stopped to drink water at my stall , just as they did now . This the escribano heard of , and forthwith had me away to the prison to confront me with them . I knew them well enough , but I had learnt in my travels when to close my eyes and when to open them ; so I told the escribano that I could not say that I had ever seen them before . He was in a great rage and threatened to imprison me ; I told him he might and that I cared not . Vaya , I was not going to expose myself to the resentment of those three and to that of their friends ; I live too near the Hay Market for that . Good day , my young masters .  --  Murcian oranges , as you see ; the genuine dragon 's blood . Water sweet and cold . Those two boys are the children of Gabiria , comptroller of the queen 's household , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buy much fruit . It is said their father loves them more than all his possessions . The old woman who is lying beneath yon tree is the Tia Lucilla ; she has committed murders , and as she owes me money , I hope one day to see her executed . This man was of the Walloon guard ;  --  Senor Don Benito Mol , how do you do ? " This last named personage instantly engrossed my attention ; he was a bulky old man , somewhat above the middle height , with white hair and ruddy features ; his eyes were large and blue , and whenever he fixed them on any one 's countenance , were full of an expression of great eagerness , as if he were expecting the communication of some important tidings . He was dressed commonly enough , in a jacket and trousers of coarse cloth of a russet colour , on his head was an immense sombrero , the brim of which had been much cut and mutilated , so as in some places to resemble the jags or denticles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bowing to me , forthwith produced two scented wash-balls which he offered for sale in a rough dissonant jargon , intended for Spanish , but which seemed more like the Valencian or Catalan . Upon my asking him who he was , the following conversation ensued between us : " I am a Swiss of Lucerne , Benedict Mol by name , once a soldier in the Walloon guard , and now a soap-boiler , at your service . " " You speak the language of Spain very imperfectly , " said I ; " how long have you been in the country ? " " Forty-five years , " replied Benedict ; " but when the guard was broken up , I went to Minorca , where I lost the Spanish language without acquiring the Catalan . " " You have been a soldier of the king of Spain , " said I ; " how did you like the service ? " " Not so well , but that I should have been glad to leave it forty years ago ; the pay was bad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , for , if I am not much mistaken , you are a German man , and understand the speech of Lucerne ; I should soon have deserted from the service of Spain , as I did from that of the Pope , whose soldier I was in my early youth before I came here ; but I had married a woman of Minorca , by whom I had two children ; it was this that detained me in those parts so long ; before , however , I left Minorca , my wife died , and as for my children , one went east , the other west , and I know not what became of them ; I intend shortly to return to Lucerne , and live there like a duke . " " Have you , then , realized a large capital in Spain ? " said I , glancing at his hat and the rest of his apparel . " Not a cuart , not a cuart ; these two wash-balls are all that I possess . " " Perhaps you are the son of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country wherewith to support yourself . " " Not a heller , not a heller ; my father was hangman of Lucerne , and when he died , his body was seized to pay his debts . " " Then doubtless , " said I , " you intend to ply your trade of soap-boiling at Lucerne ; you are quite right , my friend , I know of no occupation more honourable or useful . " " I have no thoughts of plying my trade at Lucerne , " replied Bennet ; " and now , as I see you are a German man , Lieber Herr , and as I like your countenance and your manner of speaking , I will tell you in confidence that I know very little of my trade , and have already been turned out of several fabriques as an evil workman ; the two wash-balls that I carry in my pocket are not of my own making . In kurtzen , I know little more of soap-boiling than I do of tailoring , horse-farriery , or shoe-making , all of which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hope to live like a hertzog in your native canton , unless you expect that the men of Lucerne , in consideration of your services to the Pope and to the king of Spain , will maintain you in splendour at the public expense . " " Lieber Herr , " said Benedict , " the men of Lucerne are by no means fond of maintaining the soldiers of the Pope and the king of Spain at their own expense ; many of the guard who have returned thither beg their bread in the streets , but when I go , it shall be in a coach drawn by six mules , with a treasure , a mighty schatz which lies in the church of Saint James of Compostella , in Galicia . " " I hope you do not intend to rob the church , " said I ; " if you do , however , I believe you will be disappointed . Mendizabal and the liberals have been beforehand with you . I am informed that at present no other treasure is to be found in the cathedrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " My good German Herr , " said Benedict , " it is no church schatz , and no person living , save myself , knows of its existence : nearly thirty years ago , amongst the sick soldiers who were brought to Madrid , was one of my comrades of the Walloon Guard , who had accompanied the French to Portugal ; he was very sick and shortly died . Before , however , he breathed his last , he sent for me , and upon his deathbed told me that himself and two other soldiers , both of whom had since been killed , had buried in a certain church at Compostella a great booty which they had made in Portugal : it consisted of gold moidores and of a packet of huge diamonds from the Brazils ; the whole was contained in a large copper kettle . I listened with greedy ears , and from that moment , I may say , I have known no rest , neither by day nor night , thinking of the schatz . It is very easy to find , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the place where it lies , that were I once at Compostella , I should have no difficulty in putting my hand upon it ; several times I have been on the point of setting out on the journey , but something has always happened to stop me . When my wife died , I left Minorca with a determination to go to Saint James , but on reaching Madrid , I fell into the hands of a Basque woman , who persuaded me to live with her , which I have done for several years ; she is a great hax , 8 and says that if I desert her she will breathe a spell which shall cling to me for ever . Dem Got sey dank ,  --  she is now in the hospital , and daily expected to die . This is my history , Lieber Herr . " I have been the more careful in relating the above conversation , as I shall have frequent occasion to mention the Swiss in the course of these journals ; his subsequent adventures were highly extraordinary , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XIV State of Spain  --  Isturitz  --  Revolution of the Granja  --  The Disturbance  --  Signs of Mischief  --  Newspaper Reporters  --  Quesada 's Onslaught  --  The Closing Scene  --  Flight of the Moderados  --  The Coffee Bowl . In the meantime the affairs of the moderados did not proceed in a very satisfactory manner ; they were unpopular at Madrid , and still more so in the other large towns of Spain , in most of which juntas had been formed , which , taking the local administration into their own hands , declared themselves independent of the queen and her ministers , and refused to pay taxes ; so that the government was within a short time reduced to great straits for money ; the army was unpaid , and the war languished ; I mean on the part of the Christinos , for the Carlists were pushing it on with considerable vigour ; parties of their guerillas scouring the country in all directions , whilst a large division , under the celebrated Gomez , was making the entire circuit of Spain . To crown the whole , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nationals were disarmed , which measure tended greatly to increase their hatred against the moderado government , and especially against Quesada , with whom it was supposed to have originated . With respect to my own matters , I lost no opportunity of pushing forward my application ; the Aragonese secretary , however , still harped upon the Council of Trent , and succeeded in baffling all my efforts . He appeared to have inoculated his principal with his own ideas upon the subject , for the duke , when he beheld me at his levees , took no farther notice of me than by a contemptuous glance ; and once , when I stepped up for the purpose of addressing him , disappeared through a side door , and I never saw him again , for I was disgusted with the treatment which I had received , and forebore paying any more visits at the Casa de la Inquisicion . Poor Galiano still proved himself my unshaken friend , but candidly informed me that there was no hope of my succeeding in the above quarter . " The duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be granted ; and the other day , when I myself mentioned it in the council , began to talk of the decision of Trent , and spoke of yourself as a plaguy pestilent fellow ; whereupon I answered him with some acrimony , and there ensued a bit of a function between us , at which Isturitz laughed heartily . By the by , " continued he , " what need have you of a regular permission , which it does not appear that any one has authority to grant . The best thing that you can do under all circumstances is to commit the work to the press , with an understanding that you shall not be interfered with when you attempt to distribute it . I strongly advise you to see Isturitz himself upon the matter . I will prepare him for the interview , and will answer that he receives you civilly . " In fact , a few days afterwards , I had an interview with Isturitz at the palace , and for the sake of brevity I shall content myself with saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have lived long in England , " said he ; " the Bible is free there , and I see no reason why it should not be free in Spain also . I am not prepared to say that England is indebted for her prosperity to the knowledge which all her children , more or less , possess of the sacred writings ; but of one thing I am sure , namely , that the Bible has done no harm in that country , nor do I believe that it will effect any in Spain ; print it , therefore , by all means , and circulate it as extensively as possible . " I retired , highly satisfied with my interview , having obtained , if not a written permission to print the sacred volume , what , under all circumstances , I considered as almost equivalent , an understanding that my biblical pursuits would be tolerated in Spain ; and I had fervent hope that whatever was the fate of the present ministry , no future one , particularly a liberal one , would venture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my friend , and was privy to all the steps I had taken throughout the whole affair . Two or three things connected with the above interview with Isturitz struck me as being highly remarkable . First of all , the extreme facility with which I obtained admission to the presence of the prime minister of Spain . I had not to wait , or indeed to send in my name , but was introduced at once by the door-keeper . Secondly , the air of loneliness which pervaded the place , so unlike the bustle , noise , and activity which I observed when I waited on Mendizabal . In this instance , there were no eager candidates for an interview with the great man ; indeed , I did not behold a single individual , with the exception of Isturitz and the official . But that which made the most profound impression upon me , was the manner of the minister himself , who , when I entered , sat upon a sofa , with his arms folded , and his eyes directed to the ground . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice , his dark features wore an air of melancholy , and he exhibited all the appearance of a person meditating to escape from the miseries of this life by the most desperate of all acts  - -  suicide . And a few days showed that he had , indeed , cause for much melancholy meditation : in less than a week occurred the revolution of the Granja , as it is called . The Granja , or Grange , is a royal country seat , situated amongst pine forests , on the other side of the Guadarama hills , about twelve leagues distant from Madrid . To this place the queen regent Christina had retired , in order to be aloof from the discontent of the capital , and to enjoy rural air and amusements in this celebrated retreat , a monument of the taste and magnificence of the first Bourbon who ascended the throne of Spain . She was not , however , permitted to remain long in tranquillity ; her own guards were disaffected , and more inclined to the principles of the constitution of 1823 than to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revive again in the government of Spain . Early one morning , a party of these soldiers , headed by a certain Sergeant Garcia , entered her apartment , and proposed that she should subscribe her hand to this constitution , and swear solemnly to abide by it . Christina , however , who was a woman of considerable spirit , refused to comply with this proposal , and ordered them to withdraw . A scene of violence and tumult ensued , but the regent still continuing firm , the soldiers at length led her down to one of the courts of the palace , where stood her well-known paramour , Munos , bound and blindfolded . " Swear to the constitution , you she-rogue , " vociferated the swarthy sergeant . " Never ! " said the spirited daughter of the Neapolitan Bourbons . " Then your cortejo shall die ! " replied the sergeant . " Ho ! ho ! my lads ; get ready your arms , and send four bullets through the fellow 's brain . " Munos was forthwith led to the wall , and compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another moment would have consigned the unfortunate wight to eternity , when Christina , forgetting everything but the feelings of her woman 's heart , suddenly started forward with a shriek , exclaiming : " Hold , hold ! I sign , I sign ! " The day after this event I entered the Puerta del Sol at about noon . There is always a crowd there about this hour , but it is generally a very quiet motionless crowd , consisting of listless idlers calmly smoking their cigars , or listening to or retailing the  --  in general  --  very dull news of the capital ; but on the day of which I am speaking the mass was no longer inert . There was much gesticulation and vociferation , and several people were running about shouting , " Viva la constitucion ! "  --  a cry which , a few days previously , would have been visited on the utterer with death , the city having for some weeks past been subjected to the rigour of martial law . I occasionally heard the words , " La Granja ! La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the shout of " Viva la constitucion ! " Opposite the Casa de Postas were drawn up in a line about a dozen mounted dragoons , some of whom were continually waving their caps in the air and joining the common cry , in which they were encouraged by their commander , a handsome young officer , who flourished his sword , and more than once cried out with great glee , " Long live the constitutional queen ! Long live the constitution ! " The crowd was rapidly increasing , and several nationals made their appearance in their uniforms , but without their arms , of which they had been deprived , as I have already stated . " What has become of the moderado government ? " said I to Baltasar , whom I suddenly observed amongst the crowd , dressed as when I had first seen him , in his old regimental great coat and foraging cap ; " have the ministers been deposed and others put in their place ? " " Not yet , Don Jorge , " said the little soldier-tailor ; " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brute bull Quesada and a few infantry , who still continue true to them ; but there is no fear , Don Jorge ; the queen is ours , thanks to the courage of my friend Garcia , and if the brute bull should make his appearance  - -  ho ! ho ! Don Jorge , you shall see something  --  I am prepared for him , ho ! ho ! " and thereupon he half opened his great coat , and showed me a small gun , which he bore beneath it in a sling , and then moving away with a wink and a nod , disappeared amongst the crowd . Presently I perceived a small body of soldiers advancing up the Calle Mayor , or principal street which runs from the Puerta del Sol in the direction of the palace ; they might be about twenty in number , and an officer marched at their head with a drawn sword ; the men appeared to have been collected in a hurry , many of them being in fatigue dress , with foraging caps on their heads . On they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying the slightest attention to the cries of the crowd which thronged about them , shouting " Long live the constitution ! " save and except by an occasional surly side glance : on they marched with contracted brows and set teeth , till they came in front of the cavalry , where they halted and drew up in a rank . " Those men mean mischief , " said I to my friend D- , of the Morning Chronicle , who at this moment joined me ; " and depend upon it , that if they are ordered they will commence firing , caring nothing whom they hit ,  --  but what can those cavalry fellows behind them mean , who are evidently of the other opinion by their shouting , why do n't they charge at once this handful of foot people and overturn them ? Once down , the crowd would wrest from them their muskets in a moment . You are a liberal , which I am not ; why do you not go to that silly young man who commands the horse and give him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon me his broad red good-humoured English countenance , with a peculiarly arch look , as much as to say  --  ( whatever you think most applicable , gentle reader ) , then taking me by the arm , " Let us get , " said he , " out of this crowd and mount to some window , where I can write down what is about to take place , for I agree with you that mischief is meant . " Just opposite the post office was a large house , in the topmost story of which we beheld a paper displayed , importing that apartments were to let ; whereupon we instantly ascended the common stair , and having agreed with the mistress of the etage for the use of the front room for the day , we bolted the door , and the reporter , producing his pocket-book and pencil , prepared to take notes of the coming events , which were already casting their shadow before . What most extraordinary men are these reporters of newspapers in general , I mean English newspapers ; surely if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appellation of cosmopolites , it is these ; who pursue their avocation in all countries indifferently , and accommodate themselves at will to the manners of all classes of society : their fluency of style as writers is only surpassed by their facility of language in conversation , and their attainments in classical and polite literature only by their profound knowledge of the world , acquired by an early introduction into its bustling scenes . The activity , energy , and courage which they occasionally display in the pursuit of information are truly remarkable . I saw them during the three days at Paris , mingled with canaille and gamins behind the barriers , whilst the mitraille was flying in all directions , and the desperate cuirassiers were dashing their fierce horses against these seemingly feeble bulwarks . There stood they , dotting down their observations in their pocket-books as unconcernedly as if reporting the proceedings of a reform meeting in Covent Garden or Finsbury Square ; whilst in Spain , several of them accompanied the Carlist and Christino guerillas in some of their most desperate raids and expeditions , exposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of winter , and the fierce heat of the summer sun . We had scarcely been five minutes at the window , when we suddenly heard the clattering of horses ' feet hastening down the street called the Calle de Carretas . The house in which we had stationed ourselves was , as I have already observed , just opposite to the post office , at the left of which this street debouches from the north into the Puerta del Sol : as the sounds became louder and louder , the cries of the crowd below diminished , and a species of panic seemed to have fallen upon all : once or twice , however , I could distinguish the words Quesada ! Quesada ! The foot soldiers stood calm and motionless , but I observed that the cavalry , with the young officer who commanded them , displayed both confusion and fear , exchanging with each other some hurried words ; all of a sudden that part of the crowd which stood near the mouth of the Calle de Carretas fell back in great disorder , leaving a considerable space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general 's uniform , and mounted on a bright bay thorough bred English horse , with a drawn sword in his hand , dashed at full gallop into the area , in much the same manner as I have seen a Manchegan bull rush into the amphitheatre when the gates of his pen are suddenly flung open . He was closely followed by two mounted officers , and at a short distance by as many dragoons . In almost less time than is sufficient to relate it , several individuals in the crowd were knocked down and lay sprawling upon the ground , beneath the horses of Quesada and his two friends , for as to the dragoons , they halted as soon as they had entered the Puerta del Sol . It was a fine sight to see three men , by dint of valour and good horsemanship , strike terror into at least as many thousands : I saw Quesada spur his horse repeatedly into the dense masses of the crowd , and then extricate himself in the most masterly manner . The rabble were completely awed and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street of Alcala . All at once , Quesada singled out two nationals , who were attempting to escape , and setting spurs to his horse , turned them in a moment , and drove them in another direction , striking them in a contemptuous manner with the flat of his sabre . He was crying out , " Long live the absolute queen ! " when , just beneath me , amidst a portion of the crowd which had still maintained its ground , perhaps from not having the means of escaping , I saw a small gun glitter for a moment , then there was a sharp report , and a bullet had nearly sent Quesada to his long account , passing so near to the countenance of the general as to graze his hat . I had an indistinct view for a moment of a well-known foraging cap just about the spot from whence the gun had been discharged , then there was a rush of the crowd , and the shooter , whoever he was , escaped discovery amidst the confusion which arose . As for Quesada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had escaped with the utmost contempt . He glared about him fiercely for a moment , then leaving the two nationals , who sneaked away like whipped hounds , he went up to the young officer who commanded the cavalry , and who had been active in raising the cry of the constitution , and to him he addressed a few words with an air of stern menace ; the youth evidently quailed before him , and probably in obedience to his orders , resigned the command of the party , and rode slowly away with a discomfited air ; whereupon Quesada dismounted and walked slowly backwards and forwards before the Casa de Postas with a mien which seemed to bid defiance to mankind . This was the glorious day of Quesada 's existence , his glorious and last day . I call it the day of his glory , for he certainly never before appeared under such brilliant circumstances , and he never lived to see another sun set . No action of any conqueror or hero on record is to be compared with this closing scene of the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage and impetuosity , ever before stopped a revolution in full course ? Quesada did : he stopped the revolution at Madrid for one entire day , and brought back the uproarious and hostile mob of a huge city to perfect order and quiet . His burst into the Puerta del Sol was the most tremendous and successful piece of daring ever witnessed . I admired so much the spirit of the " brute bull " that I frequently , during his wild onset , shouted " Viva Quesada ! " for I wished him well . Not that I am of any political party or system . No , no ! I have lived too long with Rommany Chals and Petulengres 9 to be of any politics save Gypsy politics ; and it is well known that , during elections , the children of Roma side with both parties so long as the event is doubtful , promising success to each ; and then when the fight is done , and the battle won , invariably range themselves in the ranks of the victorious . But I repeat that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his stout heart and good horsemanship . Tranquillity was restored to Madrid throughout the remainder of the day ; the handful of infantry bivouacked in the Puerta del Sol . No more cries of long live the constitution were heard ; and the revolution in the capital seemed to have been effectually put down . It is probable , indeed , that had the chiefs of the moderado party but continued true to themselves for forty-eight hours longer , their cause would have triumphed , and the revolutionary soldiers at the Granja would have been glad to restore the Queen Regent to liberty , and to have come to terms , as it was well known that several regiments , who still continued loyal , were marching upon Madrid . The moderados , however , were not true to themselves ; that very night their hearts failed them , and they fled in various directions . Isturitz and Galiano to France ; and the Duke of Rivas to Gibraltar : the panic of his colleagues even infected Quesada , who , disguised as a civilian , took to flight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , but was recognised at a village about three leagues from Madrid , and cast into prison by some friends of the constitution . Intelligence of his capture was instantly transmitted to the capital , and a vast mob of the nationals , some on foot , some on horseback , and others in cabriolets , instantly set out . " The nationals are coming , " said a paisano to Quesada . " Then , " said he , " I am lost , " and forthwith prepared himself for death . There is a celebrated coffee-house in the Calle d'Alcala at Madrid , capable of holding several hundred individuals . On the evening of the day in question , I was seated there , sipping a cup of the brown beverage , when I heard a prodigious noise and clamour in the street ; it proceeded from the nationals , who were returning from their expedition . In a few minutes I saw a body of them enter the coffee-house marching arm in arm , two by two , stamping on the ground with their feet in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they walked round the spacious apartment , the following grisly stanza : - " Que es lo que abaja Por aquel cerro ? Ta ra ra ra ra . Son los huesos de Quesada , Que los trae un perro - Ta ra ra ra ra " 10 " What down the hill comes hurrying there ? - With a hey , with a ho , a sword , and a gun ! Quesada 's bones , which a hound doth bear . - Hurrah , brave brothers !  --  the work is done . " A huge bowl of coffee was then called for , which was placed upon a table , around which gathered the national soldiers : there was silence for a moment , which was interrupted by a voice roaring out , " el panuelo ! " A blue kerchief was forthwith produced , which appeared to contain a substance of some kind ; it was untied , and a gory hand and three or four dissevered fingers made their appearance , and with these the contents of the bowl were stirred up . " Cups ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho , Don Jorge , " cried Baltasarito , coming up to me with a cup of coffee , " pray do me the favour to drink upon this glorious occasion . This is a pleasant day for Spain , and for the gallant nationals of Madrid . I have seen many a bull funcion , but none which has given me so much pleasure as this . Yesterday the brute had it all his own way , but to-day the toreros have prevailed , as you see , Don Jorge . Pray drink ; for I must now run home to fetch my pajandi to play my brethren a tune , and sing a copla . What shall it be ? Something in Gitano ? " Una noche sinava en tucue .

At the commencement of November , I again found myself on the salt water , on my way to Spain . I had returned to England shortly after the events which have been narrated in the last chapter , for the purpose of consulting with my friends , and for planning the opening of a biblical campaign in Spain . It was now determined by us to print the New Testament , with as little delay as possible , at Madrid ; and I was to be entrusted with the somewhat arduous task of its distribution . My stay in England was very short , for time was precious , and I was eager to return to the field of action . I embarked in the Thames , on board the M- steamer . We had a most unpleasant passage to Falmouth ; the ship was crowded with passengers , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cold blasts of England 's winter to the sunny shores of Portugal and Madeira . In a more uncomfortable vessel , especially steam ship , it has never been my fate to make a voyage . The berths were small and insupportably close , and of these wretched holes mine was amongst the worst , the rest having been bespoken before I arrived on board ; so that to avoid the suffocation which seemed to threaten me should I enter it , I lay upon the floor of one of the cabins throughout the voyage . We remained at Falmouth twenty-four hours , taking in coal , and repairing the engine , which had sustained considerable damage . On Monday , the seventh , we again started , and made for the Bay of Biscay . The sea was high and the wind strong and contrary ; nevertheless , on the morning of the fourth day , we were in sight of the rocky coast to the north of Cape Finisterre . I must here observe , that this was the first voyage that the captain who commanded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he knew little or nothing of the coast towards which we were bearing . He was a person picked up in a hurry , the former captain having resigned his command on the ground that the ship was not seaworthy , and that the engines were frequently unserviceable . I was not acquainted with these circumstances at the time , or perhaps I should have felt more alarmed than I did , when I saw the vessel approaching nearer and nearer the shore , till at last we were only a few hundred yards distant . As it was , however , I felt very much surprised ; for having passed it twice before , both times in steam vessels , and having seen with what care the captains endeavoured to maintain a wide offing , I could not conceive the reason of our being now so near this dangerous region . The wind was blowing hard towards the shore , if that can be called a shore which consists of steep abrupt precipices , on which the surf was breaking with the noise of thunder , tossing up clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We coasted slowly along , rounding several tall forelands , some of them piled up by the hand of nature in the most fantastic shapes . About nightfall Cape Finisterre was not far ahead ,  --  a bluff , brown , granite mountain , whose frowning head may be seen far away by those who traverse the ocean . The stream which poured round its breast was terrific , and though our engines plied with all their force , we made little or no way . By about eight o'clock at night the wind had increased to a hurricane , the thunder rolled frightfully , and the only light which we had to guide us on our way was the red forked lightning , which burst at times from the bosom of the big black clouds which lowered over our heads . We were exerting ourselves to the utmost to weather the cape , which we could descry by the lightning on our lee , its brow being frequently brilliantly lighted up by the flashes which quivered around it , when suddenly , with a great crash , the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , ceased to play . I will not attempt to depict the scene of horror and confusion which ensued ; it may be imagined , but never described . The captain , to give him his due , displayed the utmost coolness and intrepidity ; he and the whole crew made the greatest exertions to repair the engine , and when they found their labour in vain , endeavoured , by hoisting the sails , and by practising all possible manoeuvres , to preserve the ship from impending destruction ; but all was of no avail , we were hard on a lee shore , to which the howling tempest was impelling us . About this time I was standing near the helm , and I asked the steersman if there was any hope of saving the vessel , or our lives . He replied , " Sir , it is a bad affair , no boat could live for a minute in this sea , and in less than an hour the ship will have her broadside on Finisterre , where the strongest man-of-war ever built must go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The captain , likewise , informed the other passengers in the cabin to the same effect , telling them to prepare themselves ; and having done so , he ordered the door to be fastened , and none to be permitted to come on deck . I , however , kept my station , though almost drowned with water , immense waves continually breaking over our windward side and flooding the ship . The water casks broke from their lashings , and one of them struck me down , and crushed the foot of the unfortunate man at the helm , whose place was instantly taken by the captain . We were now close to the rocks , when a horrid convulsion of the elements took place . The lightning enveloped us as with a mantle , the thunders were louder than the roar of a million cannon , the dregs of the ocean seemed to be cast up , and in the midst of all this turmoil , the wind , without the slightest intimation , VEERED RIGHT ABOUT , and pushed us from the horrible coast faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors on board acknowledged that they had never witnessed so providential an escape . I said , from the bottom of my heart , " Our Father  --  hallowed be thy name . " The next day we were near foundering , for the sea was exceedingly high , and our vessel , which was not intended for sailing , laboured terribly , and leaked much . The pumps were continually working . She likewise took fire , but the flames were extinguished . In the evening the steam-engine was partially repaired , and we reached Lisbon on the thirteenth , where in a few days we completed our repairs . I found my excellent friend W- in good health . During my absence he had been doing everything in his power to further the sale of the sacred volume in Portuguese : his zeal and devotedness were quite admirable . The distracted state of the country , however , during the last six months , had sadly impeded his efforts . The minds of the people had been so engrossed with politics , that they found scarcely any time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of Portugal had of late afforded a striking parallel to that of the neighbouring country . In both a struggle for supremacy had arisen between the court and the democratic party ; in both the latter had triumphed , whilst two distinguished individuals had fallen a sacrifice to the popular fury  --  Freire in Portugal , and Quesada in Spain . The news which reached me at Lisbon from the latter country was rather startling . The hordes of Gomez were ravaging Andalusia , which I was about to visit on my way to Madrid ; Cordova had been sacked and abandoned after a three days ' occupation by the Carlists . I was told that if I persisted in my attempt to enter Spain in the direction which I proposed , I should probably fall into their hands at Seville . I had , however , no fears , and had full confidence that the Lord would open the path before me to Madrid . The vessel being repaired , we again embarked , and in two days arrived in safety at Cadiz . I found great confusion reigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hovering in the neighbourhood . An attack was not deemed improbable , and the place had just been declared in a state of siege . I took up my abode at the French hotel in the Calle de la Niveria , and was allotted a species of cockloft , or garret , to sleep in , for the house was filled with guests , being a place of much resort , on account of the excellent table d'hote which is kept there . I dressed myself and walked about the town . I entered several coffee-houses : the din of tongues in all was deafening . In one no less than six orators were haranguing at the same time on the state of the country , and the probability of an intervention on the part of England and France . As I was listening to one of them , he suddenly called upon me for my opinion , as I was a foreigner , and seemingly just arrived . I replied that I could not venture to guess what steps the two governments would pursue under the present circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards would exert themselves more and call less on Jupiter . As I did not wish to engage in any political conversation , I instantly quitted the house , and sought those parts of the town where the lower classes principally reside . I entered into discourse with several individuals , but found them very ignorant ; none could read or write , and their ideas respecting religion were anything but satisfactory ,  --  most professing a perfect indifference . I afterwards went into a bookseller 's shop and made inquiries respecting the demand for literature , which , he informed me , was small . I produced a London edition of the New Testament in Spanish , and asked the bookseller whether he thought a book of that description would sell in Cadiz . He said that both the type and paper were exceedingly beautiful , but that it was a work not sought after , and very little known . I did not pursue my inquiries in other shops , for I reflected that I was not likely to receive a very favourable opinion from booksellers respecting a publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover , but two or three copies of the New Testament with me , and could not have supplied them had they even given me an order . Early on the twenty-fourth , I embarked for Seville in the small Spanish steamer the Betis : the morning was wet , and the aspect of nature was enveloped in a dense mist , which prevented my observing surrounding objects . After proceeding about six leagues , we reached the north-eastern extremity of the Bay of Cadiz , and passed by Saint Lucar , an ancient town near to the spot where the Guadalquivir disembogues itself . The mist suddenly disappeared , and the sun of Spain burst forth in full brilliancy , enlivening all around , and particularly myself , who had till then been lying on the deck in a dull melancholy stupor . We entered the mouth of " The Great River , " for that is the English translation of Oued al Kiber , as the Moors designated the ancient Betis . We came to anchor for a few minutes at a little village called Bonanca , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we received several passengers , and again proceeded . There is not much in the appearance of the Guadalquivir to interest the traveller : the banks are low and destitute of trees , the adjacent country is flat , and only in the distance is seen a range of tall blue sierras . The water is turbid and muddy , and in colour closely resembling the contents of a duck-pool ; the average width of the stream is from a hundred and fifty to two hundred yards , but it is impossible to move along this river without remembering that it has borne the Roman , the Vandal , and the Arab , and has been the witness of deeds which have resounded through the world and been the themes of immortal songs . I repeated Latin verses and fragments of old Spanish ballads till we reached Seville , at about nine o'clock of a lovely moonlight night . Seville contains ninety thousand inhabitants , and is situated on the eastern bank of the Guadalquivir , about eighteen leagues from its mouth ; it is surrounded with high Moorish walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such durable materials that it is probable they will for many centuries still bid defiance to the encroachments of time . The most remarkable edifices are the cathedral and Alcazar , or palace of the Moorish kings ; the tower of the former , called La Giralda , belongs to the period of the Moors , and formed part of the grand mosque of Seville : it is computed to be one hundred ells in height , and is ascended not by stairs or ladders but by a vaulted pathway , in the manner of an inclined plane : this path is by no means steep , so that a cavalier might ride up to the top , a feat which Ferdinand the Seventh is said to have accomplished . The view from the summit is very extensive , and on a fine clear day the mountain ridge , called the Sierra de Ronda , may be discovered , though upwards of twenty leagues distant . The cathedral itself is a noble Gothic structure , reputed the finest of the kind in Spain . In the chapels allotted to the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art has produced ; indeed the Cathedral of Seville is at the present time far more rich in splendid paintings than at any former period ; possessing many very recently removed from some of the suppressed convents , particularly from the Capuchin and San Francisco . No one should visit Seville without paying particular attention to the Alcazar , that splendid specimen of Moorish architecture . It contains many magnificent halls , particularly that of the ambassadors , so called , which is in every respect more magnificent than the one of the same name within the Alhambra of Granada . This palace was a favourite residence of Peter the Cruel , who carefully repaired it without altering its Moorish character and appearance . It probably remains in much the same state as at the time of his death . On the right side of the river is a large suburb , called Triana , communicating with Seville by means of a bridge of boats ; for there is no permanent bridge across the Guadalquivir , owing to the violent inundations to which it is subject . This suburb is inhabited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gitanos or Gypsies . About a league and a half to the north-west stands the village of Santo Ponce : at the foot and on the side of some elevated ground higher up are to be seen vestiges of ruined walls and edifices , which once formed part of Italica , the birth-place of Silius Italicus and Trajan , from which latter personage Triana derives its name . One fine morning I walked thither , and having ascended the hill , I directed my course northward . I soon reached what had once been bagnios , and a little farther on , in a kind of valley between two gentle declivities , the amphitheatre . This latter object is by far the most considerable relic of ancient Italica ; it is oval in its form , with two gateways fronting the east and west . On all sides are to be seen the time-worn broken granite benches , from whence myriads of human beings once gazed down on the area below , where the gladiator shouted , and the lion and the leopard yelled : all around , beneath these flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , part human part bestial , darted forth by their several doors . I spent many hours in this singular place , forcing my way through the wild fennel and brushwood into the caverns , now the haunts of adders and other reptiles , whose hissings I heard . Having sated my curiosity , I left the ruins , and returning by another way , reached a place where lay the carcass of a horse half devoured ; upon it , with lustrous eyes , stood an enormous vulture , who , as I approached , slowly soared aloft till he alighted on the eastern gate of the amphitheatre , from whence he uttered a hoarse cry , as if in anger that I had disturbed him from his feast of carrion . Gomez had not hitherto paid a visit to Seville : when I arrived he was said to be in the neighbourhood of Ronda . The city was under watch and ward : several gates had been blocked up with masonry , trenches dug , and redoubts erected , but I am convinced that the place would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had proved himself to be a most extraordinary man , and with his small army of Aragonese and Basques had , within the last four months , made the tour of Spain . He had very frequently been hemmed in by forces three times the number of his own , in places whence escape appeared impossible , but he had always battled his enemies , whom he seemed to laugh at . The most absurd accounts of victories gained over him were continually issuing from the press at Seville ; amongst others , it was stated that his army had been utterly defeated , himself killed , and that twelve hundred prisoners were on their way to Saville . I saw these prisoners : instead of twelve hundred desperadoes , they consisted of about twenty poor lame ragged wretches , many of them boys from fourteen to sixteen years of age . They were evidently camp followers , who , unable to keep up with the army , had been picked up straggling in the plains and amongst the hills . It subsequently appeared that no battle had occurred , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand defect of Gomez consisted in not knowing how to take advantage of circumstances : after defeating Lopez , he might have marched to Madrid and proclaimed Don Carlos there , and after sacking Cordova he might have captured Seville . There were several booksellers ' shops at Seville , in two of which I found copies of the New Testament in Spanish , which had been obtained from Gibraltar about two years before , since which time six copies had been sold in one shop and four in the other . The person who generally accompanied me in my walks about the town and the neighbourhood , was an elderly Genoese , who officiated as a kind of valet de place in the Posada del Turco , where I had taken up my residence . On learning from me that it was my intention to bring out an edition of the New Testament at Madrid , he observed that copies of the work might be extensively circulated in Andalusia . " I have been accustomed to bookselling , " he continued , " and at one time possessed a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion to go to Gibraltar , I procured several copies of the Scriptures ; some , it is true , were seized by the officers of the customs , but the rest I sold at a high price , and with considerable profit to myself . " I had returned from a walk in the country , on a glorious sunshiny morning of the Andalusian winter , and was directing my steps towards my lodging : as I was passing by the portal of a large gloomy house near the gate of Xeres , two individuals dressed in zamarras emerged from the archway , and were about to cross my path , when one , looking in my face , suddenly started back , exclaiming in the purest and most melodious French : " What do I see ? If my eyes do not deceive me  --  it is himself . Yes , the very same as I saw him first at Bayonne ; then long subsequently beneath the brick wall at Novogorod ; then beside the Bosphorus ; and last at  --  at  --  Oh , my respectable and cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felicity of seeing your well-remembered and most remarkable physiognomy ? " Myself .  --  It was in the south of Ireland , if I mistake not . Was it not there that I introduced you to the sorcerer who tamed the savage horses by a single whisper into their ear ? But tell me what brings you to Spain and Andalusia , the last place where I should have expected to find you ? Baron Taylor .  --  And wherefore , my most respectable B- ? Is not Spain the land of the arts ; and is not Andalusia of all Spain that portion which has produced the noblest monuments of artistic excellence and inspiration ? Surely you know enough of me to be aware that the arts are my passion ; that I am incapable of imagining a more exalted enjoyment than to gaze in adoration on a noble picture . O come with me ! for you too have a soul capable of appreciating what is lovely and exalted ; a soul delicate and sensitive . Come with me , and I will show you a Murillo , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your compatriot . My dear Monsieur W. , turning to his companion ( an English gentleman from whom and from his family I subsequently experienced unbounded kindness and hospitality on various occasions , and at different periods at Seville ) , allow me to introduce to you my most cherished and respectable friend , one who is better acquainted with Gypsy ways than the Chef des Bohemiens a Triana , one who is an expert whisperer and horse-sorcerer , and who , to his honour I say it , can wield hammer and tongs , and handle a horse-shoe with the best of the smiths amongst the Alpujarras of Granada . In the course of my travels I have formed various friendships and acquaintances , but no one has more interested me than Baron Taylor , and there is no one for whom I entertain a greater esteem and regard . To personal and mental accomplishments of the highest order he unites a kindness of heart rarely to be met with , and which is continually inducing him to seek for opportunities of doing good to his fellow creatures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in existence has seen more of the world and life in its various phases than himself . His manners are naturally to the highest degree courtly , yet he nevertheless possesses a disposition so pliable that he finds no difficulty in accommodating himself to all kinds of company , in consequence of which he is a universal favourite . There is a mystery about him , which , wherever he goes , serves not a little to increase the sensation naturally created by his appearance and manner . Who he is , no one pretends to assert with downright positiveness : it is whispered , however , that he is a scion of royalty ; and who can gaze for a moment upon that most graceful figure , that most intelligent but singularly moulded countenance , and those large and expressive eyes , without feeling as equally convinced that he is of no common lineage , as that he is no common man . Though possessed of talents and eloquence which would speedily have enabled him to attain to an illustrious position in the state , he has hitherto , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoting himself to the study of the arts and of literature , of both of which he is a most bounteous patron . He has , notwithstanding , been employed by the illustrious house to which he is said to be related in more than one delicate and important mission , both in the East and the West , in which his efforts have uniformly been crowned with complete success . He was now collecting masterpieces of the Spanish school of painting , which were destined to adorn the saloons of the Tuileries . He has visited most portions of the earth , and it is remarkable enough that we are continually encountering each other in strange places and under singular circumstances . Whenever he descries me , whether in the street or the desert , the brilliant hall or amongst Bedouin haimas , at Novogorod or Stambul , he flings up his arms and exclaims , " O ciel ! I have again the felicity of seeing my cherished and most respectable B- . " CHAPTER XVI Departure for Cordova  --  Carmona  --  German Colonies  --  Language  --  The Sluggish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  Gomez  --  The Old Genoese  --  The Two Opinions . After a sojourn of about fourteen days at Seville , I departed for Cordova . The diligence had for some time past ceased running , owing to the disturbed state of the province . I had therefore no resource but to proceed thither on horseback . I hired a couple of horses , and engaged the old Genoese , of whom I have already had occasion to speak , to attend me as far as Cordova , and to bring them back . Notwithstanding we were now in the depths of winter , the weather was beautiful , the days sunny and brilliant , though the nights were rather keen . We passed by the little town of Alcala , celebrated for the ruins of an immense Moorish castle , which stand on a rocky hill , overhanging a picturesque river . The first night we slept at Carmona , another Moorish town , distant about seven leagues from Seville . Early in the morning we again mounted and departed . Perhaps in the whole of Spain there is scarcely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this town of Carmona , which occupies the brow of a lofty hill , and frowns over an extensive vega or plain , which extends for leagues unplanted and uncultivated , producing nothing but brushwood and carasco . Here rise tall and dusky walls , with square towers at short distances , of so massive a structure that they would seem to bid defiance alike to the tooth of time and the hand of man . This town , in the time of the Moors , was considered the key to Seville , and did not submit to the Christian arms till after a long and desperate siege : the capture of Seville followed speedily after . The vega upon which we now entered forms a part of the grand despoblado or desert of Andalusia , once a smiling garden , but which became what it now is on the expulsion of the Moors from Spain , when it was drained almost entirely of its population . The towns and villages from hence to the Sierra Morena , which divides Andalusia from La Mancha , are few and far between , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last century , when an attempt was made by a Spanish minister to people this wilderness with the children of a foreign land . At about midday we arrived at a place called Moncloa , which consisted of a venta , and a desolate-looking edifice which had something of the appearance of a chateau : a solitary palm tree raised its head over the outer wall . We entered the venta , tied our horses to the manger , and having ordered barley for them , we sat down before a large fire , which burned in the middle of the venta . The host and hostess also came and sat down beside us . " They are evil people , " said the old Genoese to me in Italian , " and this is an evil house ; it is a harbouring place for thieves , and murders have been committed here , if all tales be true . " I looked at these two people attentively ; they were both young , the man apparently about twenty-five years of age . He was a short thick-made churl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with a gloomy expression , and his eyes were full of sullen fire . His wife somewhat resembled him , but had a countenance more open and better tempered ; but what struck me as most singular in connexion with these people , was the colour of their hair and complexion ; the latter was fair and ruddy , and the former of a bright auburn , both in striking contrast to the black hair and swarthy visages which in general distinguish the natives of this province . " Are you an Andalusian ? " said I to the hostess . " I should almost conclude you to be a German . " Hostess .  --  And your worship would not be very wrong . It is true that I am a Spaniard , being born in Spain , but it is equally true that I am of German blood , for my grandparents came from Germany , even like those of this gentleman , my lord and husband . Myself .  --  And what chance brought your grandparents into this country ? Hostess .  --  Did your worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them in these parts . In old times the land was nearly deserted , and it was very dangerous for travellers to journey along the waste , owing to the robbers . So along time ago , nearly a hundred years , as I am told , some potent lord sent messengers to Germany , to tell the people there what a goodly land there was in these parts uncultivated for want of hands , and to promise every labourer who would consent to come and till it , a house and a yoke of oxen , with food and provision for one year . And in consequence of this invitation a great many poor families left the German land and came hither , and settled down in certain towns and villages which had been prepared for them , which places were called German colonies , and this name they still retain . Myself .  --  And how many of these colonies may there be ? Hostess .  --  There are several , both on this side of Cordova and the other . The nearest is Luisiana , about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and myself come ; the next is Carlota , which is some ten leagues distant , and these are the only colonies of our people which I have seen ; but there are others farther on , and some , as I have heard say , in the very heart of the Sierra Morena . Myself .  --  And do the colonists still retain the language of their forefathers ? Hostess .  --  We speak Spanish , or rather Andalusian , and no other language . A few , indeed , amongst the very old people , retain a few words of German , which they acquired from their fathers , who were born in the other country : but the last person amongst the colonists who could understand a conversation in German , was the aunt of my mother , who came over when a girl . When I was a child I remember her conversing with a foreign traveller , a countryman of hers , in a language which I was told was German , and they understood each other , though the old woman confessed that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Myself .  --  Of what religion are the colonists ? Hostess .  --  They are Christians , like the Spaniards , and so were their fathers before them . Indeed , I have heard that they came from a part of Germany where the Christian religion is as much practised as in Spain itself . Myself .  --  The Germans are the most honest people in the world : being their legitimate descendants you have of course no thieves amongst you . The hostess glanced at me for a moment , then looked at her husband and smiled : the latter , who had hitherto been smoking without uttering a word , though with a peculiarly surly and dissatisfied countenance , now flung the remainder of his cigar amongst the embers , then springing up he muttered " Disparate ! " and " Conversacion ! " and went abroad . " You touched them in the sore place , Signor , " said the Genoese , after we had left Moncloa some way behind us . " Were they honest people they would not keep that venta ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people they might be when they first came over , but at present their ways are not a bit better than those of the Andalusians , but rather worse , if there is any difference at all . " A short time before sunset of the third day after our departure from Seville , we found ourselves at the Cuesta del Espinal , or hill of the thorn tree , at about two leagues from Cordova ;  --  we could just descry the walls of the city , upon which the last beams of the descending luminary were resting . As the neighbourhood in which we were was , according to the account of my guide , generally infested with robbers , we used our best endeavours to reach the town before the night should have entirely closed in . We did not succeed , however , and before we had proceeded half the distance , pitchy darkness overtook us . Throughout the journey we had been considerably delayed by the badness of our horses , especially that of my attendant , which appeared to pay no regard to whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it being thirty years , as he at length confessed to me , since he last mounted in a saddle . Horses soon become aware of the powers of their riders , and the brute in question was disposed to take great advantage of the fears and weakness of the old man . There is a remedy , however , for most things in this world . I became so wearied at last at the snail 's pace at which we were proceeding , that I fastened the bridle of the sluggish horse to the crupper of mine , then sparing neither spur nor cudgel , I soon forced my own horse into a kind of trot , which compelled the other to make some use of his legs . He twice attempted to fling himself down , to the great terror of his aged rider , who frequently entreated me to stop and permit him to dismount . I , however , took no notice of what he said , but continued spurring and cudgelling with unabated activity , and with such success , that in less than half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a river and a bridge , which crossing , we found ourselves at the gate of Cordova , without having broken either our horses ' knees or our own necks . We passed through the entire length of the town ere we reached the posada ; the streets were dark and almost entirely deserted . The posada was a large building , the windows of which were well fenced with rejas , or iron grating : no light gleamed from them , and the silence of death not only seemed to pervade the house , but the street in which it was situated . We knocked for a long time at the gate without receiving any answer ; we then raised our voices and shouted . At last some one from within inquired what we wanted . " Open the door and you will see , " we replied . " I shall do no such thing , " answered the individual from within , " until I know who you are . " " We are travellers , " said I , " from Seville . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " why did you not tell me so before ? I am not porter at this house to keep out travellers . Jesus Maria knows we have not so many of them that we need repulse any . Enter , cavalier , and welcome , you and your company . " He opened the gate and admitted us into a spacious courtyard , and then forthwith again secured the gate with various bolts and bars . " Are you afraid that the Carlists should pay you a visit , " I demanded , " that you take so much precaution ? " " It is not the Carlists we are afraid of , " replied the porter ; " they have been here already , and did us no damage whatever . It is certain scoundrels of this town that we are afraid of , who have a spite against the master of the house , and would murder both him and his family , could they but find an opportunity . " I was about to inquire the cause of this enmity , when a thick bulky man , bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone staircase , which led into the interior of the building . Two or three females , also bearing lights , followed him . He stopped on the lowest stair . " Whom have we here ? " he exclaimed ; then advancing the lamp which he bore , the light fell full upon my face . " Ola ! " he exclaimed ; " Is it you ? Only think , " said he , turning to the female who stood next him , a dark-featured person , stout as himself , and about his own age , which might border upon fifty ; " Only think , my dear , that at the very moment we were wishing for a guest an Englishman should be standing before our doors ; for I should know an Englishman at a mile 's distance , even in the dark . Juanito , " cried he to the porter , " open not the gate any more to-night , whoever may ask for admission . Should the nationals come to make any disturbance , tell them that the son of Belington ( Wellington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand unless they retire ; and should other travellers arrive , which is not likely , inasmuch as we have seen none for a month past , say that we have no room , all our apartments being occupied by an English gentleman and his company . " I soon found that my friend the posadero was a most egregious Carlist . Before I had finished supper  --  during which both himself and all his family were present , surrounding the little table at which I sat , and observing my every motion , particularly the manner in which I handled my knife and fork and conveyed the food to my mouth  --  he commenced talking politics : " I am of no particular opinion , Don Jorge , " said he , for he had inquired my name in order that he might address me in a suitable manner ; " I am of no particular opinion , and I hold neither for King Carlos nor for the Chica Isabel : nevertheless , I lead the life of a dog in this accursed Christino town , which I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of my birth , and did I but know whither to betake myself . Ever since the troubles have commenced , I have been afraid to stir into the street , for no sooner do the canaille of the town see me turning round a corner , than they forthwith exclaim , ' Halloo , the Carlist ! ' and then there is a run and a rush , and stones and cudgels are in great requisition : so that unless I can escape home , which is no easy matter , seeing that I weigh eighteen stone , my life is poured out in the street , which is neither decent nor convenient , as I think you will acknowledge , Don Jorge ! You see that young man , " he continued , pointing to a tall swarthy youth who stood behind my chair , officiating as waiter ; " he is my fourth son , is married , and does not live in the house , but about a hundred yards down the street . He was summoned in a hurry to wait upon your worship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has come at the peril of his life : before he leaves this house he must peep into the street to see if the coast is clear , and then he must run like a partridge to his own door . Carlists ! why should they call my family and myself Carlists ? It is true that my eldest son was a friar , and when the convents were suppressed betook himself to the royal ranks , in which he has been fighting upwards of three years ; could I help that ? Nor was it my fault , I trow , that my second son enlisted the other day with Gomez and the royalists when they entered Cordova . God prosper him , I say ; but I did not bid him go ! So far from being a Carlist , it was I who persuaded this very lad who is present to remain here , though he would fain have gone with his brother , for he is a brave lad and a true Christian . Stay at home , said I , for what can I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it pleases God to send them . Stay at home , at least till your brother , my third son , comes back , for , to my shame be it spoken , Don Jorge , I have a son a soldier and a sergeant in the Christino armies , sorely against his own inclination , poor fellow , for he likes not the military life , and I have been soliciting his discharge for years ; indeed , I have counselled him to maim himself , in order that he might procure his liberty forthwith ; so I said to this lad , Stay at home , my child , till your brother comes to take your place and prevent our bread being eaten by strangers , who would perhaps sell me and betray me ; so my son staid at home as you see , Don Jorge , at my request , and yet they call me a Carlist ? " " Gomez and his bands have lately been in Cordova , " said I ; " of course you were present at all that occurred : how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied the innkeeper , " bravely well , and I wish they were here still . I hold with neither side , as I told you before , Don Jorge , but I confess I never felt greater pleasure in my life than when they entered the gate ; and then to see the dogs of nationals flying through the streets to save their lives  --  that was a sight , Don Jorge  --  those who met me then at the corner forgot to shout ' Halloo , Carlista ! ' and I heard not a word about cudgelling ; some jumped from the wall and ran no one knows where , whilst the rest retired to the house of the Inquisition , which they had fortified , and there they shut themselves up . Now you must know , Don Jorge , that all the Carlist chiefs lodged at my house , Gomez , Cabrera , and the Sawyer ; and it chanced that I was talking to my Lord Gomez in this very room in which we are now , when in came Cabrera in a mighty fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he is as active as a wild cat and as fierce . ' The canaille , ' said he , ' in the Casa of the Inquisition refuse to surrender ; give but the order , General , and I will scale the walls with my men and put them all to the sword ' ; but Gomez said , ' No , we must not spill blood if we can avoid it ; order a few muskets to be fired at them , that will be sufficient ! ' And so it proved , Don Jorge , for after a few discharges their hearts failed them , and they surrendered at discretion : whereupon their arms were taken from them and they were permitted to return to their own houses ; but as soon as ever the Carlists departed , these fellows became as bold as ever , and it is now once more , ' Halloo , Carlista ! ' when they see me turning the corner , and it is for fear of them that my son must run like a partridge to his own home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest they meet him in the street and kill him with their knives ! " " You tell me that you were acquainted with Gomez : what kind of man might he be ? " " A middle-sized man , " replied the innkeeper ; " grave and dark . But the most remarkable personage in appearance of them all was the Sawyer : he is a kind of giant , so tall , that when he entered the doorway he invariably struck his head against the lintel . The one I liked least of all was one Palillos , who is a gloomy savage ruffian whom I knew when he was a postillion . Many is the time that he has been at my house of old ; he is now captain of the Manchegan thieves , for though he calls himself a royalist , he is neither more nor less than a thief : it is a disgrace to the cause that such as he should be permitted to mix with honourable and brave men ; I hate that fellow , Don Jorge : it is owing to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present , afraid to pass through La Mancha , lest they fall into his hands . I wish he were hanged , Don Jorge , and whether by Christinos or Royalists , I care not . " " You recognized me at once for an Englishman , " said I , " do many of my countrymen visit Cordova ? " " Toma ! " said the landlord , " they are my best customers ; I have had Englishmen in this house of all grades , from the son of Belington to a young medico , who cured my daughter , the chica here , of the ear-ache . How should I not know an Englishman ? There were two with Gomez , serving as volunteers . Vaya que gente ; what noble horses they rode , and how they scattered their gold about ; they brought with them a Portuguese , who was much of a gentleman but very poor ; it was said that he was one of Don Miguel 's people , and that these Englishmen supported him for the love they bore to royalty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rey chegou , E en Belem desembarcou ! ' 11 Those were merry days , Don Jorge . By the by , I forgot to ask your worship of what opinion you are ? " The next morning , whilst I was dressing , the old Genoese entered my room : " Signore , " said he , " I am come to bid you farewell . I am about to return to Seville forthwith with the horses . " " Wherefore in such a hurry , " I replied ; " assuredly you had better tarry till to-morrow ; both the animals and yourself require rest ; repose yourselves to-day and I will defray the expense . " " Thank you , Signore , but we will depart forthwith , for there is no tarrying in this house . " " What is the matter with the house ? " I inquired . " I find no fault with the house , " replied the Genoese , " it is the people who keep it of whom I complain . About an hour since , I went down to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found the master and all his family : well , I sat down and called for chocolate , which they brought me , but ere I could dispatch it , the master fell to talking politics . He commenced by telling me that he held with neither side , but he is as rank a Carlist as Carlos Quinto : for no sooner did he find that I was of the other opinion , than he glared at me like a wild beast . You must know , Signore , that in the time of the old constitution I kept a coffee-house at Seville , which was frequented by all the principal liberals , and was , indeed , the cause of my ruin : for as I admired their opinions , I gave my customers whatever credit they required , both with regard to coffee and liqueurs , so that by the time the constitution was put down and despotism re-established , I had trusted them with all I had . It is possible that many of them would have paid me , for I believe they harboured no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to flight , and , as was natural enough , thought more of providing for their own safety than of paying me for my coffee and liqueurs ; nevertheless , I am a friend to their system , and never hesitate to say so . So the landlord , as I told your worship before , when he found that I was of this opinion , glared at me like a wild beast : ' Get out of my house , ' said he , ' for I will have no spies here , ' and thereupon he spoke disrespectfully of the young Queen Isabel and of Christina , who , notwithstanding she is a Neapolitan , I consider as my countrywoman . Hearing this , your worship , I confess that I lost my temper and returned the compliment , by saying that Carlos was a knave and the Princess of Beira no better than she should be . I then prepared to swallow the chocolate , but ere I could bring it to my lips , the woman of the house , who is a still ranker Carlist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to me struck the cup into the air as high as the ceiling , exclaiming , ' Begone , dog of a negro , you shall taste nothing more in my house ; may you be hanged even as a swine is hanged . ' So your worship sees that it is impossible for me to remain here any longer . I forgot to say that the knave of a landlord told me that you had confessed yourself to be of the same politics as himself , or he would not have harboured you . " " My good man , " said I , " I am invariably of the politics of the people at whose table I sit , or beneath whose roof I sleep , at least I never say anything which can lead them to suspect the contrary ; by pursuing which system I have more than once escaped a bloody pillow , and having the wine I drank spiced with sublimate . " CHAPTER XVII Cordova  --  Moors of Barbary  --  The English  --  An Old Priest  --  The Roman Breviary  --  The Dovecote  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Innkeeper 's Proposal . Little can be said with respect to the town of Cordova , which is a mean dark gloomy place , full of narrow streets and alleys , without squares or public buildings worthy of attention , save and except its far-famed cathedral ; its situation , however , is beautiful and picturesque . Before it runs the Guadalquivir , which , though in this part shallow and full of sandbanks , is still a delightful stream ; whilst behind it rise the steep sides of the Sierra Morena , planted up to the top with olive groves . The town or city is surrounded on all sides by lofty Moorish walls , which may measure about three quarters of a league in circumference ; unlike Seville , and most other towns in Spain , it has no suburbs . I have said that Cordova has no remarkable edifices , save its cathedral ; yet this is perhaps the most extraordinary place of worship in the world . It was originally , as is well known , a mosque , built in the brightest days of Arabian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a low roof , supported by an infinity of small and delicately rounded marble pillars , many of which still remain , and present at first sight the appearance of a marble grove ; the greater part , however , were removed when the Christians , after the expulsion of the Moslems , essayed to convert the mosque into a cathedral , which they effected in part by the erection of a dome , and by clearing an open space for a choir . As it at present exists , the temple appears to belong partly to Mahomet , and partly to the Nazarene ; and though this jumbling together of massive Gothic architecture with the light and delicate style of the Arabians produces an effect somewhat bizarre , it still remains a magnificent and glorious edifice , and well calculated to excite feelings of awe and veneration within the bosoms of those who enter it . The Moors of Barbary seem to care but little for the exploits of their ancestors : their minds are centred in the things of the present day , and only so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly distinguishing mark of a noble mind , and admiration for what is great , good , and grand , they appear to be totally incapable of feeling . It is astonishing with what indifference they stray amongst the relics of ancient Moorish grandeur in Spain . No feelings of exultation seem to be excited by the proof of what the Moor once was , nor of regret at the consciousness of what he now is . More interesting to them are their perfumes , their papouches , their dates , and their silks of Fez and Maraks , to dispose of which they visit Andalusia ; and yet the generality of these men are far from being ignorant , and have both heard and read of what was passing in Spain in the old time . I was once conversing with a Moor at Madrid , with whom I was very intimate , about the Alhambra of Granada , which he had visited . " Did you not weep , " said I , " when you passed through the courts , and thought of the , Abencerrages ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not weep ; wherefore should I weep ? " " And why did you visit the Alhambra ? " I demanded . " I visited it , " he replied , " because being at Granada on my own affairs , one of your countrymen requested me to accompany him thither , that I might explain some of the inscriptions . I should certainly not have gone of my own accord , for the hill on which it stands is steep . " And yet this man could compose verses , and was by no means a contemptible poet . Once at Cordova , whilst I was in the cathedral , three Moors entered it , and proceeded slowly across its floor in the direction of a gate , which stood at the opposite side ; they took no farther notice of what was around them than by slightly glancing once or twice at the pillars , one of them exclaiming , " Huaije del Mselmeen , huaije del Mselmeen " ( things of the Moors , things of the Moors ) ; and showed no other respect for the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing about on arriving at the farther door and making their egress backwards ; yet these men were hajis and talebs , men likewise of much gold and silver , men who had read , who had travelled , who had seen Mecca , and the great city of Negroland . I remained in Cordova much longer than I had originally intended , owing to the accounts which I was continually hearing of the unsafe state of the roads to Madrid . I soon ransacked every nook and cranny of this ancient town , formed various acquaintances amongst the populace , which is my general practice on arriving at a strange place . I more than once ascended the side of the Sierra Morena , in which excursions I was accompanied by the son of my host ,  --  the tall lad of whom I have already spoken . The people of the house , who had imbibed the idea that I was of the same way of thinking as themselves , were exceedingly courteous ; it is true , that in return I was compelled to listen to a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the ruling powers in Spain , to which , however , I submitted with patience . " Don Jorgito , " said the landlord to me one day , " I love the English ; they are my best customers . It is a pity that there is not greater union between Spain and England , and that more English do not visit us . Why should there not be a marriage ? The king will speedily be at Madrid . Why should there not be bodas between the son of Don Carlos and the heiress of England ? " " It would certainly tend to bring a considerable number of English to Spain , " said I , " and it would not be the first time that the son of a Carlos has married a Princess of England . " The host mused for a moment , and then exclaimed , " Carracho , Don Jorgito , if this marriage could be brought about , both the king and myself should have cause to fling our caps in the air . " The house or posada in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing an infinity of apartments , both large and small , the greater part of which were , however , unfurnished . The chamber in which I was lodged stood at the end of an immensely long corridor , of the kind so admirably described in the wondrous tale of Udolfo . For a day or two after my arrival I believed myself to be the only lodger in the house . One morning , however , I beheld a strange-looking old man seated in the corridor , by one of the windows , reading intently in a small thick volume . He was clad in garments of coarse blue cloth , and wore a loose spencer over a waistcoat adorned with various rows of small buttons of mother of pearl ; he had spectacles upon his nose . I could perceive , notwithstanding he was seated , that his stature bordered upon the gigantic . " Who is that person ? " said I to the landlord , whom I presently met ; " is he also a guest of yours ? " " Not exactly , Don Jorge de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely call him a guest , inasmuch as I gain nothing by him , though he is staying at my house . You must know , Don Jorge , that he is one of two priests who officiate at a large village at some slight distance from this place . So it came to pass , that when the soldiers of Gomez entered the village , his reverence went to meet them , dressed in full canonicals , with a book in his hand , and he , at their bidding , proclaimed Carlos Quinto in the market-place . The other priest , however , was a desperate liberal , a downright negro , and upon him the royalists laid their hands , and were proceeding to hang him . His reverence , however , interfered , and obtained mercy for his colleague , on condition that he should cry Viva Carlos Quinto ! which the latter did in order to save his life . Well ; no sooner had the royalists departed from these parts than the black priest mounts his mule , comes to Cordova , and informs against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So his reverence was seized and brought hither to Cordova , and would assuredly have been thrown into the common prison as a Carlist , had I not stepped forward and offered to be surety that he should not quit the place , but should come forward at any time to answer whatever charge might be brought against him ; and he is now in my house , though guest I can not call him , for he is not of the slightest advantage to me , as his very food is daily brought from the country , and that consists only of a few eggs and a little milk and bread . As for his money , I have never seen the colour of it , notwithstanding they tell me that he has buenas pesetas . However , he is a holy man , is continually reading and praying and is , moreover , of the right opinion . I therefore keep him in my house , and would be bail for him were he twenty times more of a skinflint than he seems to be . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor , I observed the old man in the same place , and saluted him . He returned my salutation with much courtesy , and closing the book , placed it upon his knee as if willing to enter into conversation . After exchanging a word or two , I took up the book for the purpose of inspecting it . " You will hardly derive much instruction from that book , Don Jorge , " said the old man ; " you can not understand it , for it is not written in English . " " Nor in Spanish , " I replied . " But with respect to understanding the book , I can not see what difficulty there can be in a thing so simple ; it is only the Roman breviary written in the Latin tongue . " " Do the English understand Latin ? " exclaimed he . " Vaya ! Who would have thought that it was possible for Lutherans to understand the language of the church ? Vaya ! the longer one lives the more one learns . " " How old may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am eighty years , Don Jorge ; eighty years , and somewhat more . " Such was the first conversation which passed between his reverence and myself . He soon conceived no inconsiderable liking for me , and favoured me with no little of his company . Unlike our friend the landlord , I found him by no means inclined to talk politics , which the more surprised me , knowing , as I did , the decided and hazardous part which he had taken on the late Carlist irruption into the neighbourhood . He took , however , great delight in discoursing on ecclesiastical subjects and the writings of the fathers . " I have got a small library at home , Don Jorge , which consists of all the volumes of the fathers which I have been able to pick up , and I find the perusal of them a source of great amusement and comfort . Should these dark days pass by , Don Jorge , and you should be in these parts , I hope you will look in upon me , and I will show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dovecote , where I rear numerous broods of pigeons , which are also a source of much solace and at the same time of profit . " " I suppose by your dovecote , " said I , " you mean your parish , and by rearing broods of pigeons , you allude to the care you take of the souls of your people , instilling therein the fear of God , and obedience to his revealed law , which occupation must of course afford you much solace and spiritual profit . " " I was not speaking metaphorically , Don Jorge , " replied my companion ; " and by rearing doves , I mean neither more nor less than that I supply the market of Cordova with pigeons , and occasionally that of Seville ; for my birds are very celebrated , and plumper or fatter flesh than theirs I believe can not be found in the whole kingdom . Should you come into my village , you will doubtless taste them , Don Jorge , at the venta where you will put up , for I suffer no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the souls of my parishioners , I trust I do my duty  --  I trust I do , as far as in my power lies . I always took great pleasure in these spiritual matters , and it was on that account that I attached myself to the Santa Casa of Cordova , the duties of which I assisted to perform for a long period . " " Your reverence has been an inquisitor ? " I exclaimed , somewhat startled . " From my thirtieth year until the time of the suppression of the holy office in these afflicted kingdoms . " " You both surprise and delight me , " I exclaimed . " Nothing could have afforded me greater pleasure than to find myself conversing with a father formerly attached to the holy house of Cordova . " The old man looked at me steadfastly ; " I understand you , Don Jorge . I have long seen that you are one of us . You are a learned and holy man ; and though you think fit to call yourself a Lutheran and an Englishman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take the interest in church matters which you do , and with respect to your being an Englishman , none of that nation can speak Castilian , much less Latin . I believe you to be one of us  --  a missionary priest , and I am especially confirmed in that idea by your frequent conversations and interviews with the Gitanos ; you appear to be labouring among them . Be , however , on your guard , Don Jorge , trust not to Egyptian faith ; they are evil penitents , whom I like not . I would not advise you to trust them . " " I do not intend , " I replied ; " especially with money . But to return to more important matters :  --  of what crimes did this holy house of Cordova take cognizance ? " " You are of course aware of the matters on which the holy office exercises its functions . I need scarcely mention sorcery , Judaism , and certain carnal misdemeanours . " " With respect to sorcery , " said I , " what is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime ? " " Que se io 12 ? " said the old man , shrugging up his shoulders . " How should I know ? The church has power , Don Jorge , or at least it had power , to punish for anything , real or unreal ; and as it was necessary to punish in order to prove that it had the power of punishing , of what consequence whether it punished for sorcery or any other crime . " " Did many cases of sorcery occur within your own sphere of knowledge ? " " One or two , Don Jorge ; they were by no means frequent . The last that I remember was a case which occurred in a convent at Seville : a certain nun was in the habit of flying through the windows and about the garden over the tops of the orange trees ; declarations of various witnesses were taken , and the process was arranged with much formality ; the fact , I believe , was satisfactorily proved : of one thing I am certain , that the nun was punished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these parts ? " " Wooh ! Nothing gave so much trouble to the Santa Casa as this same Judaism . Its shoots and ramifications are numerous , not only in these parts , but in all Spain ; and it is singular enough , that even among the priesthood , instances of Judaism of both kinds were continually coming to our knowledge , which it was of course our duty to punish . " " Is there more than one species of Judaism ? " I demanded . " I have always arranged Judaism under two heads , " said the old man , " the black and the white : by the black , I mean the observance of the law of Moses in preference to the precepts of the church ; then there is the white Judaism , which includes all kinds of heresy , such as Lutheranism , freemasonry , and the like . " " I can easily conceive , " said I , " that many of the priesthood favoured the principles of the reformation , and that the minds of not a few had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is almost inconceivable to me that there should be Jews amongst the priesthood who follow in secret the rites and observances of the old law , though I confess that I have been assured of the fact ere now . " " Plenty of Judaism amongst the priesthood , whether of the black or white species ; no lack of it , I assure you , Don Jorge ; I remember once searching the house of an ecclesiastic who was accused of the black Judaism , and after much investigation , we discovered beneath the floor a wooden chest , in which was a small shrine of silver , inclosing three books in black hogskin , which , on being opened , were found to be books of Jewish devotion , written in Hebrew characters , and of great antiquity ; and on being questioned , the culprit made no secret of his guilt , but rather gloried in it , saying that there was no God but one , and denouncing the adoration of Maria Santissima as rank idolatry . " " And between ourselves , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria Santissima ? " " What is my opinion ! Que se io ? " said the old man , shrugging up his shoulders still higher than on the former occasion ; " but I will tell you ; I think , on consideration , that it is quite right and proper ; why not ? Let any one pay a visit to my church , and look at her as she stands there , tan bonita , tan guapita  --  so well dressed and so genteel  --  with such pretty colours , such red and white , and he would scarcely ask me why Maria Santissima should not be adored . Moreover , Don Jorgito mio , this is a church matter and forms an important part of the church system . " " And now , with respect to carnal misdemeanours . Did you take much cognizance of them ? " " Amongst the laity , not much ; we , however , kept a vigilant eye upon our own body , but , upon the whole , were rather tolerant in these matters , knowing that the infirmities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished , save in cases where the glory of the church and loyalty to Maria Santissima made punishment absolutely imperative . " " And what cases might those be ? " I demanded . " I allude to the desecration of dovecotes , Don Jorge , and the introduction therein of strange flesh , for purposes neither seemly nor convenient . " " Your reverence will excuse me for not yet perfectly understanding . " " I mean , Don Jorge , certain acts of flagitiousness practised by the clergy in lone and remote palomares ( dovecotes ) in olive grounds and gardens ; actions denounced , I believe , by the holy Pablo in his first letter to Pope Sixtus. 13 You understand me now , Don Jorge , for you are learned in church matters . " " I think I understand you , " I replied . After remaining several days more at Cordova , I determined to proceed on my journey to Madrid , though the roads were still said to be highly insecure . I , however , saw but little utility in tarrying and awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive . I therefore consulted with the landlord respecting the best means of making the journey . " Don Jorgito , " he replied , " I think I can tell you . You say you are anxious to depart , and I never wish to keep guests in my house longer than is agreeable to them ; to do so , would not become a Christian innkeeper : I leave such conduct to Moors , Christinos , and Negroes . I will further you on your journey , Don Jorge : I have a plan in my head , which I had resolved to propose to you before you questioned me . There is my wife 's brother , who has two horses which he occasionally lets out for hire ; you shall hire them , Don Jorge , and he himself shall attend you to take care of you , and to comfort you , and to talk to you , and you shall pay him forty dollars for the journey . Moreover , as there are thieves upon the route , and malos sujetos , such as Palillos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a covenant , Don Jorge , that provided you are robbed and stripped on the route , and the horses of my wife 's brother are taken from him by the thieves , you shall , on arriving at Madrid , make good any losses to which my wife 's brother may be subject in following you . This is my plan , Don Jorge , which no doubt will meet with your worship 's approbation , as it is devised solely for your benefit , and not with any view of lucre or interest either to me or mine . You will find my wife 's brother pleasant company on the route : he is a very respectable man , and one of the right opinion , and has likewise travelled much ; for between ourselves , Don Jorge , he is something of a Contrabandista and frequently smuggles diamonds and precious stones from Portugal , which he disposes of sometimes in Cordova and sometimes at Madrid . He is acquainted with all the short cuts , all the atajos , Don Jorge , and is much respected in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me your hand upon the bargain , and I will forthwith repair to my wife 's brother to tell him to get ready to set out with your worship the day after to-morrow . " CHAPTER XVIII Departure from Cordova  --  The Contrabandista  --  Jewish Cunning  --  Arrival at Madrid . One fine morning , I departed from Cordova , in company with the Contrabandista ; the latter was mounted on a handsome animal , something between a horse and a pony , which he called a jaca , of that breed for which Cordova is celebrated . It was of a bright bay colour , with a star in its forehead , with strong but elegant limbs , and a long black tail , which swept the ground . The other animal , which was destined to carry me to Madrid , was not quite so prepossessing in its appearance : in more than one respect it closely resembled a hog , particularly in the curving of its back , the shortness of its neck , and the manner in which it kept its head nearly in contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hog , and meandered over the ground much like one . Its coat more resembled coarse bristles than hair , and with respect to size , I have seen many a Westphalian hog quite as tall . I was not altogether satisfied with the idea of exhibiting myself on the back of this most extraordinary quadruped , and looked wistfully on the respectable animal on which my guide had thought proper to place himself ; he interpreted my glances , and gave me to understand that as he was destined to carry the baggage , he was entitled to the best horse ; a plea too well grounded on reason for me to make any objection to it . I found the Contrabandista by no means such pleasant company on the road as I had been led to suppose he would prove from the representation of my host of Cordova . Throughout the day he sat sullen and silent , and rarely replied to my questions , save by a monosyllable ; at night , however , after having eaten well and drank proportionably at my expense , he would occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up smuggling , " said he , on one of these occasions , " owing to a trick which was played upon me the last time that I was at Lisbon : a Jew whom I had been long acquainted with palmed upon me a false brilliant for a real stone . He effected it in the most extraordinary manner , for I am not such a novice as not to know a true diamond when I see one ; but the Jew appears to have had two , with which he played most adroitly , keeping the valuable one for which I bargained , and substituting therefor another which , though an excellent imitation , was not worth four dollars . I did not discover the trick until I was across the border , and upon my hurrying back , the culprit was not to be found ; his priest , however , told me that he was just dead and buried , which was of course false , as I saw him laughing in the corners of his eyes . I renounced the contraband trade from that moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various incidents of this journey . Leaving at our right the mountains of Jaen , we passed through Andujar and Bailen , and on the third day reached Carolina , a small but beautiful town on the skirts of the Sierra Morena , inhabited by the descendants of German colonists . Two leagues from this place , we entered the defile of Despena Perros , which , even in quiet times , has an evil name , on account of the robberies which are continually being perpetrated within its recesses , but at the period of which I am speaking , it was said to be swarming with banditti . We of course expected to be robbed , perhaps stripped and otherwise ill-treated ; but Providence here manifested itself . It appeared that , the day before our arrival , the banditti of the pass had committed a dreadful robbery and murder , by which they gained forty thousand rials . This booty probably contented them for a time ; certain it is that we were not interrupted : we did not even see a single individual in the pass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered La Mancha , where I expected to fall into the hands of Palillos and Orejita . Providence again showed itself . It had been delicious weather , suddenly the Lord breathed forth a frozen blast , the severity of which was almost intolerable ; no human beings but ourselves ventured forth . We traversed snow-covered plains , and passed through villages and towns to all appearance deserted . The robbers kept close in their caves and hovels , but the cold nearly killed us . We reached Aranjuez late on Christmas Day , and I got into the house of an Englishman , where I swallowed nearly a pint of brandy ; it affected me no more than warm water . On the following day we arrived at Madrid , where we had the good fortune to find everything tranquil and quiet . The Contrabandista continued with me for two days , at the end of which time he returned to Cordova upon the uncouth animal on which I had ridden throughout the journey . I had myself purchased the jaca , whose capabilities I had seen on the route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journeys . The Contrabandista was so satisfied with the price which I gave him for his beast , and the general treatment which he had experienced at my hands during the time of his attendance upon me , that he would fain have persuaded me to retain him as a servant , assuring me that , in the event of my compliance , he would forget his wife and children and follow me through the world . I declined , however , to accede to his request , though I was in need of a domestic ; I therefore sent him back to Cordova , where , as I subsequently learned , he died suddenly , about a week after his return . The manner of his death was singular : one day he took out his purse , and , after counting his money , said to his wife , " I have made ninety-five dollars by this journey with the Englishman and by the sale of the jaca ; this I could easily double by one successful venture in the smuggling lay . To-morrow I will depart for Lisbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be shod ? " He then started up and made for the door , with the intention of going to the stable ; ere , however , his foot had crossed the threshold , he fell dead on the floor . Such is the course of the world . Well said the wise king : Let no one boast of the morrow . CHAPTER XIX Arrival at Madrid  --  Maria Diaz  --  Printing of the Testament  --  My Project  --  Andalusian Steed  --  Servant Wanted  --  An Application  --  Antonio Buchini  --  General Cordova  --  Principles of Honour . On my arrival at Madrid I did not repair to my former lodgings in the Calle de la Zarza , but took others in the Calle de Santiago , in the vicinity of the palace . The name of the hostess ( for there was , properly speaking , no host ) was Maria Diaz , of whom I shall take the present opportunity of saying something in particular . She was a woman of about thirty-five years of age , rather good-looking , and with a physiognomy every lineament of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were keen and penetrating , though occasionally clouded with a somewhat melancholy expression . There was a particular calmness and quiet in her general demeanour , beneath which , however , slumbered a firmness of spirit and an energy of action which were instantly displayed whenever necessary . A Spaniard and , of course , a Catholic , she was possessed of a spirit of toleration and liberality which would have done honour to individuals much her superior in station . In this woman , during the remainder of my sojourn in Spain , I found a firm and constant friend , and occasionally a most discreet adviser : she entered into all my plans , I will not say with enthusiasm , which , indeed , formed no part of her character , but with cordiality and sincerity , forwarding them to the utmost of her ability . She never shrank from me in the hour of danger and persecution , but stood my friend , notwithstanding the many inducements which were held out to her by my enemies to desert or betray me . Her motives were of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of hospitality ; no prospect , no hope of self-interest , however remote , influenced this admirable woman in her conduct towards me . Honour to Maria Diaz , the quiet , dauntless , clever Castilian female . I were an ingrate not to speak well of her , for richly has she deserved an eulogy in the humble pages of The Bible in Spain . She was a native of Villa Seca , a hamlet of New Castile , situated in what is called the Sagra , at about three leagues ' distance from Toledo : her father was an architect of some celebrity , particularly skilled in erecting bridges . At a very early age she married a respectable yeoman of Villa Seca , Lopez by name , by whom she had three sons . On the death of her father , which occurred about five years previous to the time of which I am speaking , she removed to Madrid , partly for the purpose of educating her children , and partly in the hope of obtaining from the government a considerable sum of money for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his decease , for various useful and ornamental works , principally in the neighbourhood of Aranjuez . The justness of her claim was at once acknowledged ; but , alas ! no money was forthcoming , the royal treasury being empty . Her hopes of earthly happiness were now concentrated in her children . The two youngest were still of a very tender age ; but the eldest , Juan Jose Lopez , a lad of about sixteen , was bidding fair to realize the warmest hopes of his affectionate mother ; he had devoted himself to the arts , in which he made such progress that he had already become the favourite pupil of his celebrated namesake Lopez , the best painter of modern Spain . Such was Maria Diaz , who , according to a custom formerly universal in Spain , and still very prevalent , retained the name of her maidenhood though married . Such was Maria Diaz and her family . One of my first cares was to wait on Mr. Villiers , who received me with his usual kindness . I asked him whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any more applications to government . His reply was satisfactory : " You obtained the permission of the government of Isturitz , " said he , " which was a much less liberal one than the present . I am a witness to the promise made to you by the former ministers , which I consider sufficient . You had best commence and complete the work as soon as possible , without any fresh application ; and should any one attempt to interrupt you , you have only to come to me , whom you may command at any time . " So I went away with a light heart , and forthwith made preparation for the execution of the object which had brought me to Spain . I shall not enter here into unnecessary details , which could possess but little interest for the reader ; suffice it to say that , within three months from this time , an edition of the New Testament , consisting of five thousand copies , was published at Madrid . The work was printed at the establishment of Mr. Borrego , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an influential newspaper called El Espanol . To this gentleman I had been recommended by Isturitz himself , on the day of my interview with him . That unfortunate minister had , indeed , the highest esteem for Borrego , and had intended raising him to the station of minister of finance , when the revolution of the Granja occurring , of course rendered abortive this project , with perhaps many others of a similar kind which he might have formed . The Spanish version of the New Testament which was thus published , had been made many years before by a certain Padre Filipe Scio , confessor of Ferdinand the Seventh , and had even been printed , but so encumbered by notes and commentaries as to be unfitted for general circulation , for which , indeed , it was never intended . In the present edition , the notes were of course omitted , and the inspired word , and that alone , offered to the public . It was brought out in a handsome octavo volume , and presented , upon the whole , a rather favourable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the New Testament at Madrid could be attended with no utility whatever , unless measures , and energetic ones , were taken for the circulation of the sacred volume . In the case of the New Testament , it would not do to follow the usual plan of publication in Spain , namely , to entrust the work to the booksellers of the capital , and rest content with the sale which they and their agents in the provincial towns might be able to obtain for it , in the common routine of business ; the result generally being , the circulation of a few dozen copies in the course of the year ; as the demand for literature of every kind in Spain was miserably small . The Christians of England had already made considerable sacrifices in the hope of disseminating the word of God largely amongst the Spaniards , and it was now necessary to spare no exertion to prevent that hope becoming abortive . Before the book was ready , I had begun to make preparations for putting a plan into execution , which had occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which I had never subsequently abandoned . I had mused on it when off Cape Finisterre in the tempest ; in the cut-throat passes of the Morena ; and on the plains of La Mancha , as I jogged along a little way ahead of the Contrabandista . I had determined , after depositing a certain number of copies in the shops of the booksellers of Madrid , to ride forth , Testament in hand , and endeavour to circulate the word of God amongst the Spaniards , not only of the towns but of the villages ; amongst the children not only of the plains but of the hills and mountains . I intended to visit Old Castile , and to traverse the whole of Galicia and the Asturias ,  --  to establish Scripture depots in the principal towns , and to visit the people in secret and secluded spots ,  --  to talk to them of Christ , to explain to them the nature of his book , and to place that book in the hands of those whom I should deem capable of deriving benefit from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended with considerable danger , and very possibly the fate of St. Stephen might overtake me ; but does the man deserve the name of a follower of Christ who would shrink from danger of any kind in the cause of Him whom he calls his Master ? " He who loses his life for my sake , shall find it , " are words which the Lord himself uttered . These words were fraught with consolation to me , as they doubtless are to every one engaged in propagating the gospel in sincerity of heart , in savage and barbarian lands . I now purchased another horse ; for these animals , at the time of which I am speaking , were exceedingly cheap . A royal requisition was about to be issued for five thousand , the consequence being , that an immense number were for sale , for , by virtue of this requisition , the horses of any person not a foreigner could be seized for the benefit of the service . It was probable that , when the number was made up , the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration induced me to purchase this animal before I exactly wanted him . He was a black Andalusian stallion of great power and strength , and capable of performing a journey of a hundred leagues in a week 's time , but he was unbroke , savage , and furious . A cargo of Bibles , however , which I hoped occasionally to put on his back , would , I had no doubt , thoroughly tame him , especially when labouring up the flinty hills of the north of Spain . I wished to have purchased a mule , but , though I offered thirty pounds for a sorry one , I could not obtain her ; whereas the cost of both the horses , tall powerful stately animals , scarcely amounted to that sum . The state of the surrounding country at this time was not very favourable for venturing forth : Cabrera was within nine leagues of Madrid , with an army nearly ten thousand strong ; he had beaten several small detachments of the queen 's troops , and had ravaged La Mancha with fire and sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving every hour , bringing tidings of woe and disaster , and I was only surprised that the enemy did not appear , and by taking Madrid , which was almost at his mercy , put an end to the war at once . But the truth is , that the Carlist generals did not wish the war to cease , for as long as the country was involved in bloodshed and anarchy , they could plunder and exercise that lawless authority so dear to men of fierce and brutal passions . Cabrera , moreover , was a dastardly wretch , whose limited mind was incapable of harbouring a single conception approaching to grandeur ; whose heroic deeds were confined to cutting down defenceless men , and to forcing and disembowelling unhappy women ; and yet I have seen this wretched fellow termed by French journals ( Carlist of course ) the young , the heroic general . Infamy on the cowardly assassin ! The shabbiest corporal of Napoleon would have laughed at his generalship , and half a battalion of Austrian grenadiers would have driven him and his rabble army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my journey into the north . I was already provided with horses well calculated to support the fatigues of the road and the burdens which I might deem necessary to impose upon them . One thing , however , was still lacking , indispensable to a person about to engage on an expedition of this description ; I mean a servant to attend me . Perhaps there is no place in the world where servants more abound than at Madrid , or at least fellows eager to proffer their services in the expectation of receiving food and wages , though , with respect to the actual service which they are capable of performing , not much can be said ; but I was in want of a servant of no common description , a shrewd active fellow , of whose advice , in cases of emergency , I could occasionally avail myself ; courageous withal , for it certainly required some degree of courage to follow a master bent on exploring the greater part of Spain , and who intended to travel , not under the protection of muleteers and carmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , I might have sought for years without finding ; chance , however , brought one to my hand at the very time I wanted him , without it being necessary for me to make any laborious perquisitions . I was one day mentioning the subject to Mr. Borrego , at whose establishment I had printed the New Testament , and inquiring whether he thought that such an individual was to be found in Madrid , adding that I was particularly anxious to obtain a servant who , besides S//
