Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : CLEORA. from Cleora ( 1849 ) A fair girl fled through the forest , Like hunted roe , to gain A haunt where the holy stillness Was balm to her burning brain . In vain would the warning brooklet Have checked her as she fled ,  --  Like pearly shells through the water Her twinkling feet have sped . She gains , like her of Dodona , A place of cloister calm , Where the flowers look up like worshipers To the towering minster palm . And there , in the shrine of Nature , Her heart is opening free , As opens a rose in the morning When none are near to see . And there to her absent lover Her vows she will renew , And read in his pictured semblance The proof that he is true . And often , amid the thraldom , The world around us throws , Would the soul , like fair Cleora , Escape her watching foes ; And fly to some far-off mountain Where trusting Faith may stand , As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . It is in the heart 's lone musing Love 's sweetest thoughts have birth ; And ' t is in the Sabbath stillness That Heaven comes nearest Earth .
