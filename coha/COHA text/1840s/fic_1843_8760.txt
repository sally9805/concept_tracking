SCENERY With a view to obviate the great difficulty experienced by amateurs ( particularly in country houses ) in obtaining Scenery , &c.,; to fix in a Drawing Room , and then only by considerable outlay for hire and great damage caused to walls , we have decided to keep a series of Scenes , &c.,; coloured on strong paper , which can be joined together or pasted on canvas or wood , according to requirement .

Scene I.  --  Plain Apartment at Mr. Ostrand 's , 1 G Table and two chairs on R. H. Cricket on R. H. Enter Lieutenant Ostrand , R. H. 1 E. Os . Lieutenant Ostrand Why tarries my child ? She should not leave me at a moment when my fate seems to urge me to despair . My stern oppressor refuses to defer his demand , even till the last remaining pittance of my wasted fortune can be transmitted from my agent in London . Enter Harvy Ashton , L. H. 1 E. Har . Harvy Ashton Pardon me , sir , if I break upon your privacy ; but my business requires your immediate attention . Malson , your inexorable landlord , bade me say , in answer to your solicitation , that he will wait no longer for his money . He now forbids , what but a week ago he so strongly urged , your removal . He hinted mysteriously that you not only had it in your power to discharge the debt , but also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to the premises you occupy . Os . Lieutenant Ostrand The means I  --  Has he dared to asperse my honor ? accuse me of a fraudulent design to evade the honest dues of a creditor ? This instant shall he retract his insinuation , or by the honor of a soldier !  --  but no , no  --  Enter Josephine , R. H. Har . Harvy Ashton Josephine ! Jo . Josephine Father ! Os . Lieutenant Ostrand Have you returned at last ? Why did you leave me for so long a time , Josephine , when your presence here was necessary ? Jo . Josephine My presence necessary : I did not know that , father , or I should have returned sooner . I met our landlord , Mr. Malson . He is rather mysterious , to be sure ; but , no doubt , he will explain himself to you , for he says he intends seeing you on particular business . Har . Harvy Ashton His errand may require privacy . If my sincere friendship can be of service to you , I respectfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming its assistance . Perhaps , dear sir , I speak freely ; but when I see honorable poverty in one scale , and grasping cupidity in the other , the horse that carries me and the true rifle I carry shall be turned into dollars to make the griping rascal kick the beam . ( Exit , L. H. 1 E. ) Jo . Josephine Bless me , he never said good by . ( Runs to , L. H. 1 E. ) Os . Lieutenant Ostrand Josephine , what did Mr. Malson say to you ? Jo . Josephine Nothing , father ; that is , nothing worth repeating . Os . Lieutenant Ostrand Yet you said it was something mysterious . Jo . Josephine Well , all that is strange is not worth repeating . Harvy went away without saying " good by "  --  that is strange ; but that 's not worth repeating . ( Knock , 1 E. L. H. ) Some one knocks . ( Knock , 1 E. L. H. ) The knock seems worth repeating .

Lieutenant Ostrand Mr. Malson , I will not for a moment affect ignorance of the object of your visit  --  you want money . Mal . Mr. Malson You are ignorant of the object of my visit .  --  I do not want money . Os . Lieutenant Ostrand What , then , has procured me the honor of this conference ? Mal . Mr. Malson Hear me , sir . I am a straightforward personage , and use no more words than serve to express my meaning . I would marry your daughter . Os . Lieutenant Ostrand You marry my daughter ? Mal . Mr. Malson Why not ? She is poor  --  I am the richest man in the country . Why should she not , and you consider the match a good one ? Lot Sap Sago . Lot Sap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ; I guess you , all on ye , had better stay outside a spell . I want to talk to the lootenant . ( Enters , 1 E. L. H. , with gun , game bag with rabbit , flask , shot pouch , and powder horn . ) Why , lootenant , how are ye ? Hallo , Malson ! you look rather riled ; you a n't got the cramp in your eyebrows , have ye ? Mal . Mr. Malson Fool , what brought you here ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago What brought me here ? Why , the biggest skunk you ever did see . We chased that critter more than three miles and a half  --  at last he div into a swamp , and we could n't see nothing on him after that but the smell . ( Places the gun against the wing , L. H. ) Mal . Mr. Malson Launcelot , you had better withdraw . Lieutenant Ostrand and myself are conversing on a subject interesting to ourselves , but of no consequence to you . Lot . Lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint that you want me to go . Why , now look here , Malson . You come this browbeaten purty strong to hum , and in your own house I do n't like to say much about it . But the lootenant lives here ; he and I are friends ; so , if you 've any thing to say , blaze away ; and as that skunk give me a pretty loud run , I 'll set down on this cricket and rest , for I 've got a kind of a jumping colic in my knees . You need n't mind me none . ( Bone . ) I 'll amuse myself demolishing this knuckle of ham .  --  Have a bite , lootenant ?  --  No  --  why , it 's clean . I raised the shote myself , and killed it , and cured it tu  --  and now I 'm going to eat it tu . Enter Josephine , R. H. Miss Josey , how de du ? I seed you on the beach , hollered out to you to head that skunk  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd a headed him he would n't a doubled , and I should a let slip , and may be I would n't a shot you . Mal . Mr. Malson Miss Ostrand , your father and myself have had some conversation of which you were the subject ; he will detail to you the purport of it , and when I call again I hope to find your father reasonable , and you obedient . ( Exit Malson , 1 E. L. H. ) Lot . Lot Sap Sago Hallo , Malson  --  if you meet that skunk you need n't tell him I 'm here waiting for him . Jo . Josephine Father , you look displeased . Have I offended you ? Os . Lieutenant Ostrand ( C. ) You , my child ? No , no . ' T is nothing . Lot . Lot Sap Sago O , I 'll go now . I never intrude on folks . I was n't going to go ' cause that old Malson told me  --  if he did raise me  --  a purty kind of a raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apple orchard , and I was n't no highern a corn cob . I wonder who on arth put me there  --  they must have thought I was fond of fruit . Malson says , when he found me , I was playing ninepins with the rotten apples . He made a kitchen maid of me till I got old enough to find out I was the wrong gender for such chores ; and since that I 've shot woodchucks enough , if they was all harnessed up , to work a steamboat  --  that is , if it went by horse power . ( Exit Lot , 1 E. L. H. ) Os . Lieutenant Ostrand ( L. H. ) Josephine , my child , I have news for you . Our landlord , Mr. Malson , has proposed for your hand . Jo . Josephine ( R. H. ) Sir ! Mr. Malson ! O father , you are jesting with me ! My hand ! Excuse me , but positively , sir , I can not help laughing at such an odd conceit . Ha , ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the time 's unfitting . Mr. Malson is wealthy ; and in an alliance with him you would change the prospect of poverty and destitution for easy affluence . Jo . Josephine And an aching heart . O sir , gladly would I relieve your distresses by any sacrifice ; but this is full of bitterness ! and I feel  --  I know you would spurn the relief purchased by the misery of your child . Os . Lieutenant Ostrand Then nothing would induce you to become the wife of Mr. Malson ? Jo . Josephine Nothing , sir , your commands alone excepted . Os . Lieutenant Ostrand Then never shall a father 's authority seek to sway those sacred feelings in which the first blessings of life are compressed ; but as with a parent 's solicitude I watched and guided the footsteps of thy childhood , so will I shelter thy young hopes and affections from the disasters which have blighted mine . ( Exeunt , R. H. ) Scene II .  --  A Room in Malson 's House , 2 and 3 G. Set door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. ; C. door practical , backed by chamber Enter Senil and Miss Starchington , L. H. 1 E. Sen. Senil ( R. H. ) Nay , nay , do n't fly out so , Miss Starchington . I do n't say for a certainty , I only surmise ; from what I overheard , ' t is certain your master  --  Miss S. Miss Starchington ( R. H. ) Master ! Mr. Senil , let me inform you that I have no master . I am the mistress of this house  --  that is , I am the housekeeper ; I have been these twenty years . It must be confessed the household was small at first , consisting of Mr. Malson ,  --  and a personable sort of a man he was then , Mr. Senil ,  --  a foundling boy , and myself . I was then a buxom lass , as fresh and as free as a trout in a stream . Sen. Senil And now you 're as staid and as stale as a pickled mackerel . Miss S. Miss Starchington Your comparisons , Mr. Senil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impression on my susceptibility , comparing me to a pickled mackerel is not the way to succeed . Sen. Senil Nay , Miss Starchington , as to impressions , I thought that business was settled  --  you told me a month ago you would be mine . Miss S. Miss Starchington Why , Mr. Senil , now you mention the circumstance , I believe your ardent professions may have prevailed on my tender nature to accord you a smile ; but then the agitation I should experience ! How much did you say you had saved in the service of your mistress ? Sen. Senil Upwards of four hundred pounds . With your earnings and mine we might buy a genteel farm . Miss S. Miss Starchington And as I live , now I think of it , the farm occupied by the English officer , Lieutenant Ostrand , is for sale . I heard Mr. Malson say this morning that he meant to sell it over his head ; and I doubt not , in consideration of my long services , Mr. Malson would let us have it cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I heard nothing of this . Miss S. Miss Starchington ' T is true ; and this circumstance makes me discredit what you tell me of Mr. Malson 's marrying the daughter of the lieutenant ; and I think Mr. Malson would be mad to bring an ignorant young chit like that into a house where a woman of my experience has presided for twenty years . Sen. Senil Ah , Miss Starchington , there are soft places in a man 's heart , even at Mr. Malson 's age , which the bright eyes of Miss Josephine would not find impregnable , I warrant . Miss S. Miss Starchington When I was at her age , Mr. Senil , I was taught something else than looking after soft places in old men 's hearts ; but what can be expected of one who has been brought up among soldiers , who has seen no other society but twaddling drummers and drill sergeants ? Enter Lot . L. H. 1 E. Lot . Lot Sap Sago Hallo , Senil , my old codger . What ! soft-soaping the old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Launcelot , shall I never be able to teach you any thing ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago No , you never have been . ( Round to R. ) Miss S. Miss Starchington ( Aside . ) Now that young bear has come : there 's an end of all quiet and privacy .  --  Mr. Senil , good day . I shall be glad to see you again this evening ( Pushes Lot . ) Out of the way , you unmannerly porpoise . ( Exit , 1 E. R. H. ) Lot . Lot Sap Sago Whew ! there she streaks it . So , old slow and easy , you 've been bucking up to the old woman , have ye ? Sen. Senil And what then , sir ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago ( R. H. ) O , nothing , only she 's a nice woman  --  ai n't she ? Sen. Senil Certainly  --  a very fine woman . Lot . Lot Sap Sago How long have you know 'd her ? Sen. Senil I have known her for several years . Lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her most a fortnight longer than that .  --  She never was married , was she ? Sen. Senil Of course not ! I shall be the first happy man to press her maiden lips . Lot . Lot Sap Sago O , no , you wo n't !  --  Her maiden lips was pressed by a happy man twenty years ago . Sen. Senil Eh ! what do you mean , Launcelot ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago O , I ca n't tell you . Sen. Senil Do , for Heaven 's sake , relieve my suspense . She surely was never married ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago No , she never was  --  more 's my misfortune . Sen. Senil Yours ! What have you to do with it ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago O , nothing now ; but I rather guess I had something to do with it .  --  You know I 'm a foundling . Sen. Senil Yes , I know  --  well . Lot . Lot Sap Sago I was found in an apple orchard . Sen. Senil I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's my mother . Sen. Senil Wha  --  what ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago She 's my natural born mother . Sen. Senil She is  --  the devil ! Lot . Lot Sap Sago No , she ai n't  --  she 's my mother . Sen. Senil ( In a passion . ) How came she your mother ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago Do n't know  --  never inquired how she come so . Sen. Senil I 'll  --  I 'll  --  I 'll  --  Lot . Lot Sap Sago I would n't , if I was you . Sen. Senil No , I wo n't . I 'll  --  I 'll  --  ( Walks about , Lot following . ) Lot . Lot Sap Sago So I would . Sen. Senil O , faithless Miss Starchington ! Lot . Lot Sap Sago She 's my mother considerably . Sen. Senil Who the devil was your father ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago Never had none .  --  I was found in an apple orchard . ( Lot follows Senil across the stage . ) Enter Malson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. ) What 's this disturbance ? Sen. Senil ( L. H. ) Curse your apple orchard . Mal . Mr. Malson Are you mad ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago ( On R. H. ) In a state of nudity . Mal . Mr. Malson ( Comes down and seizes Senil , on L. H. ) You old scoundrel , what do you want ? Sen. Senil Miss Starchington . Mal . Mr. Malson Leave the house , doting idiot . ( Pushes Senil off , 1 E. L. H.  --  To Lot . ) Now , sir , a word with you . What was your business at the house of Mr. Ostrand to-day ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago Had n't no business , only stopped in to rest myself . Mal . Mr. Malson Seek another resting place in future , sir ; visit that family no more , without my permission . Lot . Lot Sap Sago Why , look here , Malson ; it do n't look friendly to stop going to a house where a feller 's been used to going . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mal . Mr. Malson What ! like his daughter ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago Yes ; do n't you ? O , Deuteronomy , how I should like to marry that gal ! Mal . Mr. Malson You marry ! you  --  a foundling  --  a beggar . Lot . Lot Sap Sago I ai n't a beggar  --  I never was one  --  never want to be  --  I never begged but once ; that was when I took Ike Jasper for a moose , and plugg 'd him through the shoulder , and then I begged his pardon . Mal . Mr. Malson Unthinking fool ! what provision could you make for a wife ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago Why , as for provisions , punkins is cheap , and peneryal you can get for nothing . But now you talk bout my being a foundling ,  --  do n't you never hear nothing about that rascally father of mine ? nor my mother nuther ? Mal . Mr. Malson How often have I told you not to speak on this subject ! Lot . Lot Sap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left me in that apple orchard they must have had hearts as hard as the rule of three ; but I 've been of some use to you ever since I was knee high to a tadpole . When I wa n't bigger than a lump of cheese , you used to smear me all over with milk , and bait the rat traps with me ; and when that saw mill catched fire , and you had n't no bucket , did n't you souse me into the river , and squeeze me till the water squirted the fire out ? And now I want to do suthing for myself , you wo n't let me . Last spring I wanted to go to the Banks of Newfoundland a-fishing , and you would n't give me a flannel shirt , and said I should n't go no how . You only give me four and sixpence , and I 'll start off for Boston to-morrow morning . Mal . Mr. Malson No more of this . Press not rashly on a temper the dark points of which you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being urged beyond control , you rouse a passion in which all former tenderness may be forgotten . ( Exit , R. H. ) Lot . Lot Sap Sago Dark pints  --  I hai n't seen none of your light ones yet , ( Knock at C. D. R. H. ) What 's the use thumping on the door ? Why do n't you open it ? Enter Mr. Otto Mannikin , C. D. , his dress the extreme of modern foppery , with hunting equipments and carrying a fowling piece , which he places against flat , L. H. Why , what in the name of the great sea sarpent is this ? Man . Mr. Otto Manikin Young man , do you live here ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago Yes . Do you ? Man . Mr. Otto Manikin No  --  I 'm lost . Lot . Lot Sap Sago Is there any reward offered for you ? Man . Mr. Otto Manikin No . I 'm one of a deputation who came , of our own accord , from Portland , to inquire into the merits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisure , I set out on an expedition of discovery , in hopes to take home some specimens of zology , ornithology , and conchology . Lot . Lot Sap Sago We 've got some first rate clamology . Man . Mr. Otto Manikin I saw a little reddish animal , with a bushy tail . Supposing it to be a rare variation of the lizard genus , I ran after it , and the diminutive creature ran away , till it led me into a swamp , where I stuck ; at last it got away , and I see I have spoiled one leg of my pants . Lot . Lot Sap Sago Why , the critter 's a natural born fool .  --  Ha , ha ! Take a chipmunk for a lizard , and chase him into the swamp . I suppose , as you took it for a lizard genius , you thought it was a young crocodile . Man . Mr. Otto Manikin Would you have the humanity to show me to the settlement ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago Why , as you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must be hungry . Man . Mr. Otto Manikin Five miles ! Am I five miles from town ? Have you a horse you could lend me ? Lot .

Mr. Otto Manikin I ride straddle of a yoke between two oxen ? I , who used to sport my silk-reined tandem sulky in Broadway ! Lot . Lot Sap Sago O , if you like to go tandem , you can get on Jehosaphat 's back , and I 'll put the old blind bull in the lead . Man . Mr. Otto Manikin Back ! Blind bull ! Enter Harvy , C. D. L. H. Har . Harvy Ashton Launcelot ! quick !  --  get your rifle and some balls : there is a bear in the swamp . Lot . Lot Sap Sago A bear ! and I left my rifle at the lootenant 's . What on arth shall I do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece . ( Lot takes it . ) Man . Mr. Otto Manikin Do n't take my gun . Lot . Lot Sap Sago Why , you ca n't make no use o n't , and I do n't know as I can , for it 's a darn 'd flimsy consarn : it ai n't fit to shoot any thing but gallinippers . I say , lizard genius , you stay here , and I 'll bring you a bear home for dinner . ( Exeunt Lot and Harvy , C. D. L. H. ) Man . Mr. Otto Manikin A bear for dinner ! and one of my legs was in that same swamp where the bear now is.  --  Well , ' pon honor , instead of having a bear for dinner , I had like to have been a dinner for a bear . ( Gun fired without , U. E. R. H. ) They are discharging their firearms at the horrid creature . I begin to feel quite alarmed . Suppose the savage animal should take refuge in this house .

Josephine O , dear , I wish I was a man ! then I should have been at the bear hunt to-day .  --  O , how I should like to have had a pop at him ! to have seen him grinning and gnashing his teeth with pain and rage  --  then the deadly spring , the cracking of the rifles , the shouts of the victors  --  he reels  --  he falls  --  he dies . O , how I wish I was a man ! Enter Lot , L. H. 1 E. Lot . Lot Sap Sago Well , I 'm a man . Wo n't I do ? Jo . Josephine You ? no . You are fit for no human purpose . Now what , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has just been killed , was making towards you ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago Du ? what I dun jest now . Jo . Josephine What was that ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago Shoved a bullet through his head with such all-fired force that I driv the ball clean through , and picked it up behind him . Jo . Josephine O Launcelot , my friend , that is stretching it too far , to send your bullet lengthwise through the body of a large bear . Lot . Lot Sap Sago Why , yes , I had to stretch considerable .  --  I had to gin the trigger an almighty hard pull . Jo . Josephine Now , Launcelot , I am certain that you did not even shoot at the bear ; for I know that when you were here this morning , you left your rifle standing in that corner . How could you shoot without a rifle ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago I had a fowling piece , and the infernal machine never had a bullet in it afore , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twisted so like the devil , that I was glad to fire it off to ease it . Jo . Josephine Now , Launcelot , I know you do n't own a fowling piece . Lot . Lot Sap Sago Well , I guess I borrowed one of a strange critter that 's got hair enough on his upper lip to stuff a cart saddle . Jo . Josephine Indeed . Who is he ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago He 's a lizard hunter . Jo . Josephine A lizard hunter ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago Yes ; he takes red squirrels for crocodiles , and chases'em into mud swamps . Jo . Josephine Where did he come from ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago New York , he says . Jo . Josephine Where is he now ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago Ca n't find him , high or low . I rather guess he must have melted away , and his whiskers have soaked up the fat . Jo . Josephine Ha , ha ! Come , Lot , tell me all about the chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the particulars and result . Lot . Lot Sap Sago Why , you see , there was nine of us , including your father , and we surrounded that animal . When he seed himself hemmed in , he wanted to sneak out the worst kind . He kept turning round and round , jest to make us think he wanted to chastise his tail ; but he was only looking for an opening to get out of . I know 'd what was passing in that feller 's mind ; so I jest stretched out jest so . He come towards me , and I blazed away . I meant to hit him in the eyeball , but that crocodile hunter 's gun was crooked , so I bored a new hole in his nose . That staggered him ; and just then your father let slip , and that wound up his airthly affairs ; and Harvy and I had him skun and slung on our shoulders before the sarpent know 'd he was hurt .

I was talking of provisions . Har . Harvy Ashton Would you like to marry her ? Lot . Lot Sap Sago She 's a nice gal , ai n't she ? Her eye rolls up jest like that bear 's when he wanted to get out . She squirled me all up one-sided . Har . Harvy Ashton Here 's her father . I 'll urge your suit to him . Lot . Lot Sap Sago No , do n't , Harvy ; I ca n't stand it . Enter Lieutenant Ostrand , R.

Har . Harvy Ashton That 's not to the purpose , Lot . Lot . Lot Sap Sago No ; but I cal'late it settled his purpose  --  do n't you ? Har .

Lieutenant Ostrand Listen to me , Josephine , and from the fate of your parents receive the first lesson of your life . Though the recital must wring my heart with shame and anguish , yet it is necessary you should become acquainted with the circumstances attending your birth . I first beheld your mother in an obscure village in England . We loved ; she was simple , confiding , and devoted . She was betrayed : Josephine , you are the offspring of guilt . Jo . Josephine I ?  --  O father ! Os . Lieutenant Ostrand Be calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiment in a distant part of England . Obstacles , not necessary to be mentioned now , had prevented our marriage at that period ; but it was my full intention to have the ceremony performed as soon as those obstacles could be removed . Of this your mother was aware , and seemed satisfied with the arrangement . Judge then my surprise and horror , when I read in a public newspaper the intended marriage of the honorable daughter of Sir George Forrester ( your mother ) to a Sir Cameron Ogleby ! In a state of mind bordering , I fear , on insanity , I flew to London , and arrived at the porch of the church at the very moment the ceremony was concluded . I saw your faithless mother borne home the bride of another . Burning with my wrongs , I penned a challenge to Sir Cameron Ogleby : he sent a cold reply . He said he did not know me , had not injured me , and would not flight . I wrote again , declaring myself the affianced husband of his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's shame . To this no answer came . Lashed to madness , I rushed forth into the street , and encountered him in the dark . He was skilful and collected . But what could skill or coolness do against the tiger fury of my assault ? I shivered his useless weapon in his hand , and drove mine madly through his heart . Jo . Josephine Horror ! horror ! Os . Lieutenant Ostrand I sought the cottage where your mother had left you , engaged your nurse to accompany us , and set off with you to the continent . I fixed my abode in a remote town in Switzerland , where , as you know , we lived , until two years ago we moved , for greater security , to this eastern wilderness . Jo . Josephine And my mother  --  does she yet live ? Os .

As soon as the beast found the foolish critter astride on him , he knowed he had a simpleton on his back ; so he give one loud snort , and set off full chisel .

The old woman at the post office gin me this letter to give to Mr. Malson  --  had to pay ninepence and fourpence halfpenny for it . Malson shall pay me a quarter , or he sha n't have it . Boston  --  I never knowed Malson to get a letter from Boston afore . I wonder what it 's all about . Why , it 's prying open at t' other end , and I do believe that old woman at the post office has been prying into it .

Scarce had he breath to utter his commands ; yet , after twenty years , he rises like a spectre from his grave , to blast me with his presence .

Mr. Malson This is the path : the darkness of the night may detain him at the village . If so , my scheme may be foiled .

I have been to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one part of it ; but perhaps the family have retired for the night . Sir C. Sir Cameron Ogleby I should have preferred travelling over the road by daylight ; but the small inn at the village was so crowded that I chose rather to grope my way to the house of Malson , where I am sure of a good supper and comfortable bed . Man . Mr. Otto Manikin Do you own the bear swamp , sir ? Sir C. Sir Cameron Ogleby I believe the estate includes this marsh . Man . Mr. Otto Manikin Then , sir , you should take some pains to improve the breed of the bruin community : they are a very uncivil family at present . The patriarch of the tribe was killed to-day ; and now , I presume , the lady mother rules with gentle sway . But as the juvenile members of the bear family may be early risers , had we not better proceed ? Sir C. Sir Cameron Ogleby Certainly . Are you sure you know the house ? Man .

' t was nothing but the distant surf upon the beach . The pale moon , as if conscious of my purpose , shrinks appalled , and draws her veil , as horror-stricken at the dreadful deed . Away with such weak fancies ! Hark ! his jocund laugh . I silence it forever . ( Exit , 1 E. L. H. ) Enter Lot , R. H. 1 E. Lot .

Would I then have sought his life ? Your letter informed me you would arrive to-night . I apprehended you might attempt to pass the solitary road between the village and your house alone  --  perhaps unarmed . Ferocious bears have been this very day seen in the path you had to travel . Is it unaccountable , then , that I should have armed myself , not only for your defence , but my own , and have proceeded towards the village to meet and protect you ? Man . Mr. Otto Manikin That 's very natural , upon my honor . The bears about here are very ferocious . You are a very considerate gentleman ; and had you met us before we had got to the swamp , you would have saved me a devilish deal of fear . Sir C. Sir Cameron Ogleby But why did you fire ? Mal . Mr. Malson My foot struck a mound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cameron Ogleby True , true , it must have been ; for surely you could have no cause for the perpetration of such an act .  --  Malson , my old friend , forgive me .

Sir Cameron Ogleby I rejoice to say it did not hit at all . Mr. Malson had no intention of injuring me . Lot . Lot Sap Sago That 's because he could n't get a fair crack at you . Mal . Mr. Malson Hence , babbling fool ! Lot . Lot Sap Sago Look here , Malson ; you need n't come any of your conglomerated exhibitions of coadulated wrath round here : nobody cares nothin about it .

Lot Sap Sago Yes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that old codger there ; but just as he was going to fire , I shied this jackknife at him ; it struck him on the knuckle ; so he fired a leetle sooner than he meant tu , and missed his man .

Lot . Lot Sap Sago False ! Look here , Malson . I care nothin about your saying it 's false ; but if you was to just mention I lie , I would hit you such a poke under the short ribs , you would n't get sight of your breath again for half an hour .
