txt THE sort of biography which this work contains is entertaining , and valuable for its illustrations of character , but not // calculated to throw much light on the history of England by reflecting to us the spirit and influences of the times in which these Chancellors lived . It is no easy matter to determine what the office was in its origin ; nor is it of any importance . They might have received their name from sitting behind a screen or chancel , or possibly from their cancelling the king 's writs and letters when issued contrary to law , - a piece of loyal service which few of them , except perhaps Becket , would ever have been in haste to do . In theory , they were the king 's casuists ; in fact , they were the creatures of the crown . As they owed their official existence to royal favor , they were not restricted in the dimensions of their authority this was regulated chiefly by their taste and pfeasure . They were churchmen by profession , but worldly enough always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges , they held courts of equity and common-law jurisdiction ; they also presided , by virtue of their office , in the deliberations of the Lords . Various other rights and duties were associated with this high trust , which , however , are no indication of the extent of prerogative or freedom in different ages . Lord Campbell has done wisely not to spend time in magnifying the office , but has rather given his attention to the men by whom it was successively filled . Among the Saxons to whom this high trust was confided before the conquest was St. Swithin , - who is sufficiently distinguished by that title of sacred honor , for there have been few of his successors to whom the designation would apply . His reputation , of course , is traditional , but in his own time it was surpassingly great ; and as he had charge of the education of Alfred , it is natural to infer that he communicated to that illustrious person some of the elements of that wisdom and excellence for which he was so renowned . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their wild and inspiring legends of the past ; he also accompanied him on a visit to Rome , and pointed out the classical remains which had then attracted the attention of but few . Of his legal proceedings but a single trace remains , which bears very little resemblance to modern processes of law . An old woman came to complain , that all the eggs in her basket which she was carrying to market had been feloniously broken . Instead of recommending an action of trespass , which might have cost the ancient person more than the eggs // were worth , he made the sign of the cross , and restored the eggs to their former soundness , thus relieving himself from tedious forms , and sending the lady on her way rejoicing . Either he had uncommon sympathy with the poor and lowly , or he had marvellously anticipated the republicanism of our day ; for when he died , he enjoined that his body should be buried , not in the cathedral , but in the church-yard among the poor . When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transfer his remains to the high altar , with solemn forms and processions . But as soon as he found out what was in contemplation , he sent a tremendous rain , which lasted without cessation forty days , so as to damp the ardor of his admirers , and put a stop to the unwelcome honors which they intended to bestow. * Lord Campbell says there is great difficulty in distinguishing what is true from what is false in his history ; we should think the limits were , as Colonel Bath , in Fielding 's Amelia , terms it , " pretty transparent , " though we would speak with great diffidence - when such a forbearing reserve is exhibited by one of the lights of the law . After the Norman invasion , the object of the conquerors seemed to be to displace all the old Saxon institutions by inventions of their own . The office continued in name , but was superseded in fact by that of Grand Justiciar , equivalent to chief justice ; but names were of little value or significance under that base and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trodden into the dust . That the post of chancellor had its attractions , after it had been shorn of its former splendor , is evident from the fact , that , in the reign of Henry the First , it was sold for three thousand pounds . This was an immense sum for the times , and one which gives us some insight into the worth of money , the freedom of the subject , and the importance attached to the weightier matters of the law . It is not clear whether this office was disposed of by private contract or public auction ; but the king was the peddler who sold it , as he had * Hence the proverb , which is still current and popular , both in Scotland and England ,  --  " St. Swithin 's day , gif ye do rain , For forty days it will remain ; St. Swithin 's day , an ye be fair , For forty days t will rain na mair. " // that unfailing symptom of royalty , a desperate want of resources , without any honorable means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the office are , as we have said , of little interest , when compared with the character of those who held it ; and quite early in the English annals , a chancellor appeared whose power of heart and resistless energy made him a wonder to his own times and a problem to all succeeding . We refer to Thomas * Becket , who upheld the claims of the church against the wrath and revenge of the king . Historians speak doubtfully of his proceedings , as if they were quite uncertain how far to give him credit for sincerity , and how much to ascribe to unsanctifled ambition . They can not quite determine what he was to gain by defying the sovereign , and at the same time they are not ready to believe that conscience inspired him . It was unquestionably true , that his movements were violent , insurrectionary , and sometimes in the worst possible taste . But when we consider that he was in early life the prime favorite of the king ; that every path of luxury , honor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed to make him Archbishop of Canterbury , he entreated to be spared , foreseeing and foretelling that a faithful discharge of its duties would bring him into conflict with his royal master ; it seems to us , that the obvious and simple solution of his conduct is , that he had a strong sense of duty , - somewhat dark and irregular , certainly , according to the fashion of his times ; but nevertheless , deep and true . He felt , that , if he held the office , though it was forced upon him , he must be governed by its obligations ; and as allegiance to the church was understood to stand foremost among religious duties , his conscience would naturally lead him to stand up for its rights , and resist all aggressions , as the surest way to establish the kingdom of heaven in the world . This matter , of course , presents itself in a different light to us ; it is not so easy now to understand how the sense of religious duty could have maintained excessive claims , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still farther from the position in which we could read such men aright , by our sympathy with the military barons of feudal times . They were a coarse , bloody , and rapacious crexv ; while the clergy , though equally grasping , had some pretensions to refinement and humanity . And yet , strange // as it seems , we feel as if the cause of civilization and human progress depended on the success of those bull-dogs of chivalry ; we set down the churchmen who opposed them as unquestionably insolent and usurping , and whenever we see them defeated , we rejoice in their fall . With the general sympathy inclining so much in that direction , it is not strange that Becket should be misunderstood . Like much other prevailing darkness , it is owing to the shadow cast upon mankind by the traditional barbarisms of war , to which we are still in bondage , while the influence of superstition , at least in its ancient forms , is now comparatively small . XVhen Henry the Eighth wished to destroy the influence of Rome , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and to prevent this , he ordered his attorney-general to file a quo warranto information against St. Thomas for assuming the office of saint , and summoned him into court to answer to the charge . As it was not convenient for Becket to appear in person , the king assigned him counsel at his own expense ; but , as might have been expected , he was found guilty , and the sentence was , that his bones should be publicly burned , as a warning to all other incipient Beckets , and the offerings at his shrin* were forfeited to the crown . Such was the stupid precaution of the IDefender of the Faith ; a man , if he was a man , in whom the violence of passion was mistaken for energy of mind , and whose only real eminence was that of approaching as near to unmitigated wickedness as the infirmity of human nature would allow . Though the evils and sorrows brought on Henry the Second by the murder of Becket taught a lesson to sovereigns , his fate may also have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were , showing them that the crown of martyrdom is hard both to win and wear . We hear no more of this bold resistance ; the barons of England take their ground and firmly maintain it , but the chancellors are on the other side . In fact , there is nothing remarkable either in the circumstances or character of those who bear the office , till , in the reign of Henry the Third , the great seal was intrusted to a female hand . When about leaving the country on one of his military expeditions , the king made his queen , Eleanor , lady keeper for the time ; from which we may infer , that the main design was to secure the royal prerogative , // 164 Campbell 's Lives of the Chancellors . July , and that the judicial duties of the office were held in but low esteem . He may have thought her better suited to he the keeper of his conscience , from having none to look after of her own . Her services , whatever they may have been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as a Frenchwoman in all her tastes and associations . She was ingenious in devising means of extortion to plunder them under the forms of law ; and they returned her favors , according to the long-established etiquette of the English mob , with volleys of abuse , sometimes with showers of stones , but more frequently with salutes of eggs in that independent state in which they have nothing to fear from decay . Without stopping to say any thing of Langton , the ancestor of the one who was more distinguished by the respect and confidence of Johnson than his fathers by their rank and station , we find a pleasant mention of Richard de Bury , Bishop of Durham in the reign of Edward the Third . He was eminent as a scholar , statesman , judge , and divine though all these various qualifications were not so efficient in raising him to the high offices which he filled , as the circumstance that he flad been tutor to his royal master . As chancellor , he presided in Parliament , when only one act was passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this savors of Massachusetts legislation ; it was " to regulate the herring-fishery at Yarmouth . " We have no record either of his judicial proceedings ; in fact , his whole heart was given to the collection and study of hooks , for which his desire was not less intense , and rather more intellectual , than that of bibliomaniacs at the present day . His office and character aided him very much in making his collections ; he says , that instead of presents and jewels , which had been the customary offerings , crazy quartos and tottering folios were rescued from moths , worms , and dust , to be laid at the chancellor 's feet . It is edifying to witness his enthusiasm . He speaks of libraries redolent of aromatics ; of flourishing green-houses of all sorts of volumes ; of porticos of Stoics , promontories of Parnassus , and academic meads ; from all which one would infer , that , so far as beauty and fragrance were concerned , his senses must have been steeped in some considerable illusion . For he complains bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been used ; that they had been read by some clown , and marked by his dirty fingers and " the falling dewdrop from bis nose " ; that places of interest were marked with musty straws , and the pages ornamented with crumbs of bread and cheese , together with the liquid accompaniments of his dinner ; that in his sleep , which is both loud and long , his elbows were ground into the book , displacing and tearing the leaves ; and if he were smitten with a botanical propensity , flowers with the earth still clinging to their roots were stuffed into the volume , till it no longer yielded to the efforts of the closer . Prom this , it would seem that his passion had its abatements as well as its delights ; and when he speaks of laymen , it is with a kind of asperity which is very unlike his usual tone . Laymen , he says , are altogether unworthy of communion with books ; they do not know , when the volume is before them , whether it is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ! In this ancient state of things the clergy may find consolation under the faith which so many now maintain , that a clergyman is ex officio incapable of forming a judgment on questions of business and politics , which any fool not thus unfortunately disqualified can easily see through . One of the most respected names associated with this office is that of William of Wickham , so well known as an admirer of Gothic architecture and a generous patron of learning . It was his architectural taste and talent which first brought him forward in life . He was employed by Edward the Third to make designs for a splendid structure , in place of the mean buildings of Windsor castle ; and the present age has the means of determining how well he succeeded . The king was delighted with his palace , and commemorated the event of its completion by the not very appropriate ceremony of founding the order of the garter , till it was suggested to him that there was something presumptuous in the inscription , Hoc fecit Wichem , which was engraven on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sentence was misunderstood ; it did not state that he made the castle , but that the castle was the making of him ; which was undeniably true , for he took orders immediately after , and preferment came in a golden shower . But the office of chancellor , to which he was appointed , was beyond his legal knowledge ; and when he had held the // 166 July , station four years , the commons and the lords temporal prayed that the seal might not be continued in his , nor any other churchman 's , hands . He was not much concerned at his removal , but went on with his favorite work of building , till , eighteen years after , he was replaced in the office by Richard the Second , with the general approbation of the community , who thought his honesty quite as much to be trusted as a more extensive knowledge of the law . But whatever his faithfulness may have been , St. Mary 's College of Winchester , at Oxford , is the monument which has insured his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of Beaufort , who was cardinal , and four times chancellor , and who , though , according to Shakspeare , " he died and made no sign , " made more while living than his generation desired to see . P he son of John of Gaunt , and halfbrother to the king , he had the way of preferment open before him ; and as to his piety , which some presumed to piestion , a pilgrimage to Jerusalem had removed the doubt from all reasonable minds . He contrived to set the church against him by advising the king to make free with the ecclesiastical revenues , a thing which it was easier to advise than to do . When the king was obliged to come to him for a loan , which his great wealth enabled him to supply , he refused to furnish it , till the crown itself was lodged as security in his hands . Luckily for him , Henry the Fifth died soon after , and in the minority of Henry the Sixth , then an infant , commenced that rivalship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of the latter in a way somewhat mysterious , but universally ascribed to Beaufort 's hatred and revenge . But the murderer , if such he was , did not long enjoy his triumph , for six weeks after he followed his nephew to the tomb . Some writers are unwilling to believe , that a person so high in spiritual office should have been guilty of such crimes . But history is imperative as Pilate , - what it has written , it has written ; and whatever historical doubts may arise , it is not likely that the record will ever be altered . But these names , though important in their time , can not detain us now , when we come near the age of Wolsey , who dazzled the world with the suddenness and splendor of his elevation , and almost effaced the remembrance of his faults , // which were many , by the depth and sadness of his fall , and still more , by the tender charm which poetical genius has thrown around it . Nothing could be more difficult than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those of ' Henry the Eighth and Wolsey . A slight defect in the execution of such portraits might have been a serious matter , with a stormy virago , like Elizabeth , looking over him . He appears to have evaded the delicacies of the attempt by the expedient , so new to dealers in fiction , of simply telling the truth , and painting Wolsey as he was . The future chancellor was of humble birth ; at least , that he was the son of a butcher was constantly thrown in his teeth , when , such is this world 's inconsistency , it might have been counted a high honor if his father , instead of despatching cattle in the shambles , had slaughtered human victims in a field of blood . It was one of the great recommendations of the church , that it enabled men of talent to overleap those hereditary bars which otherwise they could not have passed and it is not unlikely that the haughtiness of Wolsey and other dignitaries of the church may have been assumed , not wholly from choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , who , had they submitted to indignity , would have made haste to tread them down . The accounts of his ascension to power , which we derive from various sources , all agree in ascribing to him an influence amounting to fascination over those who came in his way . His person was dignified , and his expression of countenance fine . He had that natural superiority of manner , which art can not imitate , and which no practice in society is ever able to form . His eloquence was always at command , both in public and private ; and the effect of his address was aided by his quick and accurate discernment of the characters and feelings of men . It is not clear whether he had any natural taste for business , or whether it was assumed to recommend himself to Henry the Seventh , a dry and calculating person , better fitted by nature for a trader than for a king . The sort of business , however , in which that prince employed him , negotiating for the Emperor Maximilian 's daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The moment Wolsey received his despatches , he set out , and returned so soon that the king scolded him for his delay , supposing that the messenger had not yet left // home . When he was told that all arrangements had been completed , he was amazed at Wolsey 's despatch , and conceived a high opinion of his efficiency , which , had the monarch lived , would have placed the highest honors within his reach . But this was not necessary ; for he was equally in favor with the heir-apparent , who , at his father 's death , which took place soon after , delighted much in his society , and was ready to invest him with the amplest powers . It has been very common to say , that so long as Wolsey 's influence lasted , the life of Henry the Eighth was decent and inoffensive , compared with his later days ; and this is ascribed to Wolsey 's management , as if his influence , so long as he flourished , was a signal blessing to that worthless king . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Henry 's ungovernable passions ; no Van Amburgh could have tamed or controlled a beast so wild and ferocious . The truth seems rather to have been , that in the early part of his reign he gave himself up to pleasures of every kind , and left the direction of public affairs in the hands of others . It was not till he was partially satiated with dissipation , and had begun to use his powers to accomplish other plans of self-indulgence , that he appeared as he really was ; it was not that he had been controlled , but that he had had no call to manifest his disposition before . Wolsey had influence enough to secure all kinds of preferment , not only deaneries and bishoprics , but such posts as that of commissary-general to the army , which was a source of vast wealth in an unscrupulous hand . To show that he was not afflicted with delicacy in such matters , it is enough to say , that he held the archbishopric of York united with the rich sees of Winchester and Durham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to foreigners , who paid over to him a large proportion of their income , and followed his own holy example in the discharge of their duties . But grasping though he was , it was not from avarice ; he was generous in his expenditures , particularly in his appropriations for the support of learning ; and , however he may have been lifted up by his public honors , the attachment of his friends and servants testified that he was amiable in private life . Their devotion endured the strong trial of his disgrace , when he had lost the power to reward it , and it held on unchanged to the last . // Not much is known of the manner in which Wolsey discharged the duties of chancellor , except on the authority of tradition , which , as it betrays a strong prejudice against his memory , may be supposed to do him no more than justice when it allows that he was just , diligent , and impartial . Governing himself in some cases by the light of his own clear understanding , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much confidence , that the business of the office grew beyond all former bounds&gt; Sir Thomas More says , in writing to Erasmus , that Wolsey in his performance of the duties of that office had exceeded the expectations of all , which were high , and had surpassed the greatest of his predecessors . The difficulty with him was , that he was jealous of every thing which came in the way of his own pretensions ; like all others in the same pride and power , he found Mordecais in the king 's gate . Unluckily for himself , he had the power , which Haman had not , to punish their contumacy ; and he had never learned tbat moral which is so clearly taught in his own history , as well as elsewhere , that success is retribution to the unworthy , and triumph the sure prelude to their fall . The deepest stain upon his memory is owing to his hatred of Buckingham , who , as a descendant of Edward the Third , and chief subject in the kingdom , was not disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When this prince , who was extremely popular , was brought to the block for treason , his death was ascribed to the machinations of Wolsey , not because there was direct proof of it , but because every thing was thought to be controlled and directed by his will . It should be remembered , however , that Henry himself had a deadly hatred of every one who had the most distant pretensions to the throne ; and the bearing of the Duke had been such as to awaken his suspicions . Considering the king 's cannibal propensities , it is more reasonable to ascribe this judicial murder to him , when it was of a piece with all his subsequent proceedings , than to account for it by the influence of Wolsey , which there was no need of his exerting , and who never had betrayed a thirst for blood . On the whole , we may acquiesce in Mackintosh 's safe remark , that he was not worse than contemporary statesmen , which , if not a compliment , is a defence so far as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person // whom Satan more severely tempted by making rich , an ordeal through which few can pass unsinged , it is rather creditable to him than otherwise that he did not sink below the standard of his day . As to the fall of this ambitious and eminent person , it is not necessary to look far for the cause of it . The king whom he served was as desPtute of religion , and even of superstition , as are other beasts of prey . He had already cast a lustful eye on the revenues of the church as a means of supplying his own prodigality ; and the example of worldly churchmen gave him the impression that it could be no damning sin . The causes which led to the Reformation also were in action , and the church had lost so much of its hold on the fear and reverence of laymen , that he saw it would be no difficult matter to appropriate what he wanted , if he could only find some pretext for disowning the spiritual power . It is obvious that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , or to clear it out of his way . But he could not use the instrumentality of its leading dignitary for such a purpose ; should Wolsey lend himself to such designs , it could only destroy his influence and standing , and thus disarm him of the power to be useful . Besides , as a cardinal and a candidate for the tiara , he must necessarily have other interests coming in conflict with those of his master . Henry was glad to avail himself of Wolsey 's ability so long as it could serve him ; but when that was no longer the case , he was easily alienated from his former favorite . When such estrangement begins , every thing tends to increase it ; when displeasure exists , good reasons for it are never wanting ; and thus we imagine that the faults and imprudences of Wolsey , though they were convenient reasons to give for his disgrace , and were indeed sufficiently offensive to unfriendly observers , were not the real cause of his memorable fall . rrhe king xvanted other instruments for work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolsey in the office of chancellor was as much before him in character and public estimation , as he was inferior in station , preferment , and those transient honors which the best minds are not ambitious to reach . Sir Thomas More , in his place as Speaker of the Commons , had firmly resisted Wolsey 's attempts to override the law , for which the cardinal felt strong resentment against // him in his heart . It was undoubtedly the sight of Wolsey 's usurpations of authority , on his visit of remonstrance to Parliament , and on other occasions , which induced Sir Thomas More to sign the articles of impeachment , which did not amount to serious charges , though all the world knew how lawless and tyrannical the course of the favorite had been . It is a curious fact , that , when it seemed perfectly natural for the butcher 's son to ascend by means of the church staircase to any pride of place , it should have been thought a grave departure from propriety and precedent to intrust the great seal to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of King 's Bench , and himself experienced and distinguished in many great public affairs . Yet so it was ; and had not the universal conviction of his eminent fitness for the station made any other selection impossible , he could not have reached that office which his wisdom and virtue adorned . The early influences under which Sir Thomas More was formed are said to have been favorable to his improvement . His father , besides being learned in the law , was also something of a wag . But one specimen of his humor has been preserved , which must have been valued by reason of its rarity , since no other brilliancy about it is obvious to the naked eye . It is a comparison of one about to marry to one who puts his hand into a bag containing one eel to a hundred snakes , where the adventurer is more likely to be bitten than to secure a prize . Prom the tone of this sharp jest , one would apprehend that he was among those who had been very unfortunate in their selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means in his youth , and required him to write an exact account of his expenses ; all which he thought very hard at the time , though he afterwards declared that the system had been a singular blessing , saving him from foppery and foolishness , into which he would otherwise have fallen . While he was still young , and diligently engaged in selfeducation , he became acquainted with Erasmus , a kindred spirit , who , having come over to England , was fast diffusing a taste for classical leaming . Their correspondence , which is still extant , throws much illustrative light on the tastes and attainments of these eminent correspondents , besides giving us valuable information respecting those less public matters which history does not consider it her duty , or perhaps is not able , to tell . // In his early manhood , he made some approaches to religious enthusiasm , which one would have thought could not have been in harmony with his nature ; He was so transported with the spirit and example of Augustine , that he determined to join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , he thought it better to make the experiment of that way of life before hazarding a final choice . Accordingly , he wore a hair shirt , scourged himself every Friday , watched and fasted often , slept on a stone bench with a log for a pillow , denying himself every indulgence , and after a long and faithful attempt to secure the spiritual good which such austerities were imagined to bestow , he came to the conclusion that they were not particularly edifying , that Christian graces might be attained quite as well without them , and that inflictions upon the body spent their strength before reaching the heart . Having given up all thoughts of the monastic life , he turned his attention to the priesthood . But he could not reconcile himself to the inconsistencies of the profession , as he saw it in the lives of the Catholic clergy ; so that , on the whole , he determined to establish himself in the practice of the law , and to have domestic claims which should drive him to the necessary exertion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters , offered him his choice of the assortment ; the second was the fairest , and in other respects most to his taste ; but when he thought what a pity it was to mortify the eldest by such a preference of the younger , he renounced his own inclinations , and paid proper deference to the claims of age . He was well repaid for his disinterestedness , for there never was a happier union . We would not speak with coiifidence on subjects not within our range ; but perhaps one reason why the course of true love never runs smooth is , that it is not content to flow in the channels of ddty , but rather delights in going out of its way to encounter ohstacles , besides having a determined propensity for running up hill , which the laws of hydrostatics will not readily allow . His popularity and reputation were such that he was soon returned for Parliament , where he soon manifested an independence not common in that day , when any resistance to the court was apt to be punished by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laxvless demand from the Commons ; no one else dared say a word against it ; but // More spoke freely of the illegality of the exaction , and it was in consequence denied . Henry was full of vengeful rage at this resistance ; but as More had no property , he could not resent it profitably except by coming upon the old judge , his father , who , for the iniquity of his child , was thrown into the Tower , and kept there till he had paid a fine to the crown . More was earnestly advised by Fox , Bishop of Winchester , to make submissions to the king . But the bishop 's chaplain counselled him not to heed the instigation of his master , who , he said , would consent to the murder of his own father for the sake of paying court to the king . As this last advice agreed with his own feeling , he followed it ; and it was well that he did ; for when Dudley and Empson were led to execution , the former of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - " 0 More , More ! God was your good friend that you did not ask the king 's forgiveness , as many would have had you do ; for had you done so , perhaps you would bave been in the like case with us now . " This must mean , that the tyrant could not help respecting those who held fast their integrity and neither feared nor defied his power . It is certain that Henry the Eighth , as soon as he became acquainted with More , was delighted with the richness and humor of his conversation ; and , as he never lost sight of his own interest , was also desirous to engage him as a responsible agent in those public and private conspiracies of sin , which it required no s*mall ability to explain and defend . But More understood him thoroughly , and kept his distance as far as possible . On one occasion , Henry came to him at his house , and walked with him in the garden with his arm thrown familiarly over his shoulder . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " I may tell thee I have no cause to be proud thereof , for if my head would win him a castle in France , it should not fail to go . " The manner in which he discharged the duties of the chancellor 's office was the subject of universal praise . Wolsey , though he was desirous to shine in that , as in every thing else , was hedged in by those minions who guard all the avenues to their master ; and while he did not himself descend to mean extortion , they were so rapacious that it became a common saying , that no one could have justice in chancery unless his fingers were tipped with gold . More 15 * // had no such retinue ; he was so simple and unostentatious as to excite the wonder , not to say displeasure , of some of the nobility , who swore , somewhat profanely , when they found him singing in a church , that it would never do for him to worship God like an ordinary man . As to his impartiality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Satan on the other , the latter should have his rights , suffer who would . His fearlessness was manifested by his admitting the complaint of a beggar against his own second wife , a formidable Xantippe , who had bought and highly valued a little dog which had been stolen from the former . He took the dog in his arms , and directed each party to call it ; upon which it left the lady and went to its former owner , to whom , much to the dissatisfaction of his wife , he commanded it to be surrendered . He was charged , in some gossiping stories , with cruelties to heretics who were brought before him ; but this appears to have been a mistake , perhaps a wilful one , as it certainly was inconsistent with all that is known of his feelings . As Erasmus remarks , it is sufficient to say that no man was put to death for heresy in England while he was chancellor , though the blood of the persecuted was constantly flowing in other countries . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood the right and duty of toleration , which was as far from the reach of that age as Newton 's theory of the solar system ; but though he could not alter the law , his mercy in the administration of it was such as might have been expected from his kind and excellent heart . The unbounded liberality of sentiment which he expressed in his Utopia may have been afterwards modified by the revolutionary aspect of the times ; and he began to apprehend that the principle might be dangerously extended . Still , it was never toleration which he feared , but only the abuse of it ; and it is not strange that in that day , when utter darkness rested , on the whole subject , he should have been somewhat startled by the agitations which it seemed to be creating in the world . It is really difficult to conceive how an Englishman can look back without humiliation to the period in his history when such a man as this could be murdered in cold blood , under the forms of law , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Audley , without one vestige of conscience or manliness , were all the while subservient as a // pack of hounds to their master . Infinite pains were taken to make Sir Thomas own the king 's supremacy , that is , his power to do as he pleased ; but nothing could bend his firm uprightness , though he well knew , that , when once the king had determined to be revenged , no mean submission could avert his doom . It is marvellous to see the sagacity with which he foresaw all that was to come . When one of the attempts to crush him by law had failed , from its manifest iniquity , and he was congratulated on his escape , he said that his fate was deferred , not abandoned ; which soon proved sadly true . When Anne Boleyn , who was bitter against him on account of his opposition to the divorce from Catharine , was in the height of her triumph , and he was told of her revels and dances , he said to his daughter that it grieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly to come ; for , though at the time she could dance off men 's heads like footballs , the day would soon come when her bead would dance off like theirs . Even the progress of the Reformers , then in its beginning , was obvious to his calm , discerning mind ; he said , that , high as the Roman church then sat , treading heretics like ants into the dust , some would see the day when the Catholics would be glad to allow them full privileges , on condition that the Reformers would leave them in possession of theirs . It was Henry 's double aim to gain More 's great authority in favor of resistance to the Pope , and then to degrade him by this display of inconsistency , before he died . But the keen penetration of More , who understood the dark windings of royal art , and the firm principle which could neither be bent nor misled , defeated these machinations , and therefore hurried on his fate . It would have been impossible to find any pretext for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , become a perjured witness against him . This wretch was afterwards rewarded with the place of keeper of the king 's conscience , and became the founder of a noble family , of which that Earl of Warwick who was under the charge of Addison was the last . To his latest moments , More maintained the same patient and manly composure , being earnestly affectionate to his family , having no words of reproach for his enemies , and remaining steadfast in his faith and devotion to God . Some exception has been taken to his cheerfulness at the // 176 July , time of his execution , as if it were unbecoirting at such an hour ; but if properly considered , it is seen to be in his usual manner , which was easy and natural , never stilted . The whole amount of it is , that he was a genuine man at that time , as at all others , and that nothing was got up to grace his closing scene . But this subject has been so well set forth by the master hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needless to say that his life of excellence was crowned by a graceful , dignified , and sacred close . Nor is it easy to find in the records of human character a life and death more free from infirmity or more worthy to be honored . Besides the superiority of talent which appears in his writings , he shows himself far before his age in humanity , suggesting reforms in law and in social arrangements , such as had not then entered any other mind or heart . In his wonderfully enlightened views of toleration he then stood entirely alone , believing that every one should adopt what religious system recommended itself to his conscience , and that others might use argument and persuasion to convince him of its untruth ; but that nothing could be more absurd than to threaten or torment another by way of inducing him to believe that which did not seem to him true . On the whole , he was a specimen almost perfect of Anglo-Saxon character refined of its barbarism by humane and religious feeling ; and perhaps the best eulogy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct and conspicuous opposition to his royal master , - More being the glory of humanity , the other its everlasting shame . There is very little to detain a reader in the history of several succeeding chancellors , some of whom were bigots , others timeservers , and several , like Gardiner , of Smithfield memory , darkly stained with blood . This imputation rests also on Hatton , the dancer , whose graceful capers can not atone for his share in the murder of Queen Mary , an act which Lord Campbell says " was not creditable to the English nation " ; - rather a gentle tap with the fan to administer for such an atrocious deed . Sir Nicholas Bacon held the office , with reputation to himself and equally to the public satisfaction , for many years . Lord Ellesmere , also , with the exception of that courtly compliance which was apt to disgrace the station , was greatly honored in comparison with several who went before him . // But the great form of Lord Bacon , the son of Sir Nicholas , soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his overshadowing powers , but also by the weakness and inconsistency which were so sadly associated with them , so fastens the gaze of mankind upon himself , that all other names are disregarded . It is painful to think of meanness , avarrce , and ingratitude in connection with his wonderful ability ; and many attempts have been made to clear his memory , but without success . The facts can not be denied ; he is only to be defended by a forced and unnatural interpretation of them . The truth is , we are often compelled to witness this unholy alliance of the highest intellectual gifts with a cold and selfish heart . In such cases , men may be raised , to a certain extent , by means of their intellectual powers ; but having no conscience and no development of the moral or spiritual nature , they can not be trusted ; temptation easily reaches them , and then they employ their subtilty in justifying their conduct to themselves , so that , however degraded they may be in the sight of others , no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do much also to prepare ourselves for disappointment , and flatter such offenders into the blindest self-delusion . There is no more reason to assume that a man must have a true and generous moral nature , because he has great talents , than there is for inferring that his mind is powerful because his bodily frame is active and strong . It was a misfortune to Bacon to be in such a condition that he was surrounded by the attractions of court life in his childhood , while his fortune , or rather his prospect of inheritance from his father , was exceedingly small . Like many others so situated , he probably overestimated the advantages of wealth which he did not possess ; and as he stood where more fortunate persons were constantly flourishing their splendor before his eyes , he came into life with the impression that want of riches is want of every thing , and with a disposition to submit to any exertion or sacrifice for the sake of securing this highest good . The pious adventurer , who , when asked if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been troubled with them lately , was more fortunate than he ; for it was the calamity of Bacon to have an uncle , Lord Burghley , at the head of affairs , and to indulge the hope that the selfish old man would feel some sympathy for // his relations . But it Was the constant aim of the lordtreasurer to advance the interest of his own hopeful son ; and as Bacon was immensely superior to Cecil , who was nothing but a cunning and unprincipled courtier , it was obvious to the father , that his nephew would be an obstacle to the fulfilment of his wishes . On this account , he did all he could to discourage and keep him back . His influence with the queen was such , that he could make her see every thing as he did , by flattery sagaciously applied ; and it was evidently her impression , obtained from him , that while there was no denying the abilities of Bacon , they were rather of the speculative than the practical kind , and that , just so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was wanting in that sound sense and efficiency which are required in public affairs . In order , however , to escape from importunity and reproach , the old lord administered to him one of those favors which whosoever receives is in no hurry to ask for another . He procured for him the reversion of an office which did not come into possession till the end of twenty years ; thus making sure that he should not have a support in his poverty when he wanted it , and , calculatin.g . on the chances of life , that he might never reach the prize . But while the aspirant for office could not induce his relations to take an interest in any thing but their own selfish aims , which they always cherished with the most affectionate regard , he found a generous and true friend in the Earl of Essex , a manly and open-hearted cavalier , whose misfortune was , that Elizabeth fell in love with him , and . treated him with a sort of wolfish tenderness , which he returned with respectful deference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had bloomed for more than half a century , ought by all means to inspire . Bacon , like other courtiers , many of whom were ill able to afford it , made annual presents to the queen ; one of his oblations was " one pettycoat of white sattin embroidered all over like feathers and billets , with three broad borders embroidered with snakes and fruitage , emblems of Wisdom and Beauty . " But neither this happy selection of presents and illustrations , nor the earnest good offices of Essex , could sustain him against the malignant influence of the Cecils , who were careful to prevent the wind of royal favor from filling any sails but their own . // Essex , finding that he could not serve his proteg* in the way he desired , insisted upon his accepting a tract of land at Txvickenham , which must have been considerable , as Bacon afterwards sold it , at an under price , for eighteen hundred pounds . It is difficult to believe , that after receiving an unbroken succession of favors , bestowed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as this same noble benefactor was accused of treason , Bacon offered his services to the queen to appear against him ; and at the trial , he actually confronted him with insult and injury , as if to show that no feeling of gratitude , nor sense of decency even , could bind him to those who no longer had any thing to bestow . There is no bright side to this matter ; all the attempts of his apologists to defend it are pitiful in the extreme . He admits his guilt in the work which he published to prove that Essex deserved his fate . It was written at the instance of Elizabeth , who , after the death of Essex , was received by the multitude with cold and gloomy silence , instead of the applause to which she had been accustomed ; and the effect of the publication was , not so much to increase the general respect for his ability , as to produce a universal feeling of abhorrence for the icy hardness of his heart . At the very time while Bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend himself to the court by mean comphiances , and even by the perversion of law , he was also engaged in writing those immortal works which , one would have thought , could only proceed from a mind dwelling in some higher sphere , above the cares and passions of the world . It is a proof , though a sad one , of the power and versatility of his mind , that he could at the same moment soar so high and stoop so low . His moral sensibilities were so dull , that conscious unworthiness did not impair his energies of mind ; if he ever had misgivings as to the honor and manliness of his proceedings , he had ingenious excuses ready , which were easily accepted by his self-deceiving heart . When a threatened resistance to the crown made it convenient to sacrifice some person as an example , he takes an old clergyman , on the strength of a sermon found in his study , which was never meant to be preached , has him put to the torture in his presence , and throws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder of Overbury is brought home to the favorite Somerset , and the king is forced hy // public feeling to bring that idiot to a trial , Bacon stands ready to screen the murderer , and has a pardon ready in case he shall be found guilty . When the overbearing Villiers begins to rise in James 's favor , with no other title than his stupendous impudence , Bacon takes observations of the ascending star , and . hastens with the earliest flattery to humble himself before one whom he could not respect . By thus watching every opportunity , and pulling at every string , he succeeded , after serving longer than Jacob did for Rachel , in reaching the office of lord keeper , which was the summit of his desires . As he owed this elevation to the favor of Buckiugham , he was compelled to become . accessory to all manner of wrong . The most iniquitous monopoly was to be countenanced , if the favorite or any other minion was interested in it . The Duke also had the impudence to in* terfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of the party which had bribed him . Having once given offence to this great patron , the chancellor actually threw himself at his feet to avert his displeasure . It was the same court influence which made him consent to the execution of Raleigh , under a sentence pronounced sixteen years before . It is wonderful to relate , that while he was thus steeped to the lips in all manner of degradation , he finished his immortal work , the . JVovum Organum , and sent it forth to the surprise and admiration of the world . No recorded life affords a more striking example than his , of retribution in the present world . Having travelled in winding ways up to this envied station , cherishing all the while an excessive thirst for wealth , and learning from the court the means by which to gain it , by way of enjoying his prosperity he launched out into lavish expenses , which the revenues of his office were not sufficient to supply . But there were means to make up what was wanting , such means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and favorites of that age , but which never could be tolerated in a minister of the law . The parties who had causes on trial had no delicacy about making presents to the judge ; nor did he betray any unwillingness to receive them . The consesequence was , that public sentiment turned strongly against him , and very soon after he had reached the station for which he had defiled his conscience , he was impeached for bribery and corruption . The king and the favorite were perfectly // willing to sacrifice him in order to withdraw the general clamor from themselves . When he found that he must be brought to trial , and that the court would not sustain him , he made an humble confession of those practices which he could not deny ; and within four years from the time of his appointment , he was forsaken , humbled , and undone . It is true , there are worse crimes than those for which he suffered ; and they seem almost white , when compared with the crimson proceedings in the courts of criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him , that , without any general prejudice against his person or any wish for his ruin , there was a singular acquiescence in the justice of his sentence . The feeling was universal , that the sale of justice was one of those offences which strike at the heart of the social system , and which no people , who care for their own well-being , ought on any account of mercy or tenderness to allow or to forgive . Though the whole effect of Lord Bacon 's worldly efforts had been to bring himself to want and dishonor , he could not resist the tendency which was strong within him ; and after his fall , he indulged the hope of rising again , if rising it was , to those heights from which he had so ungracefully descended . James had pity upon him , and in substance remitted the immense fine which was imposed upon him hy the Lords . Buckiugham cared for his own selfish will infinitely more than for his adherents , and perhaps was aware that he had no real friends to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sympathy for Bacon , which soon vanished , when he saw how eagerly the man who should have been a sage clung to the vain show of honor and power . But there was no real disposition anywhere to relieve him from the penalties of his transgression , because , with all men 's admiration of his talents , they had no confidence in his integrity . The accession of Charles inspired him with hopes which were soon darkened by the sight of Buckingham , and the Lord Keeper Williams , his bitter enemy , flourishing in greater power than ever . Then , for the first time , the startling conviction came over him , that he had lost and wasted a life , which , if devoted to high objects , might have been prosperous , honorable , and happy . He said that he had misspent the talent which God had given him , and that he renounced those vanities which had been so dear and so fatal . // He began to gather his garments about him in preparation for that close which was soon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful sunset which followed his changeful and lowering day . His philosophical studies he did not abandon ; but he declined to attend the coronation as a peer , which he was entitled to do , and to take precedence of the ancient barons . The exciting scenes in politics which he saw passing around were matters of indifference to him ; he was so far advanced in Christian charity as to become reconciled to Bishop Williams , who had done him so many ill offices , and to admit him to his friendly regard . In his will , he said , with a tone which rises into sublimity , - " For my name and memory , I leave them to men 's charitable speeches , and to foreign nations and the next ages . " The love and reverence , which he could not secure in his elevation , came to him unsolicited in his obscure retirement , to brighten his evening close . All his errors were forgotten both his countrymen and foreigners hastened to do reverence to the great mind which was passing away . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of this world 's experience , came to him too late to be of service in the direction of his life . But it may be well for others , who are tempted with high visions , to consider how this man 's ambition brought him nothing but shame and sorrow , while the small measure of happiness and the only real respect which he enjoyed came from the silent and retired exertions of his glorious and immortal mind . His fate had no influence on public affairs ; Williams was flourishing in the chancellorship , with great industry , and sufficient courtliness to satisfy the king , who had appointed him with great misgivings , not whether he would do justice , which was not much thought of , but whether he would he unscrupulous enough in support of the interests of the crown . James is reported to have said , - " By my saul , I am pained to the heart to know where to bestow the seal ; for as to my lawyers , I think they be all knaves. ' * This character one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service which he expected them to do . He appeared at one time to think of dispensing with the office , since he attended the court himself , and conducted the proceedings in his own inimitable way . Bacon , however , who was chancellor at the time , reminded him of the necessity of hearing // both sides ; but the king said , what no doubt was true , that the case was perfectly clear to his judgment when he had heard one side , but all was thrown into mist and darkness when he came to hear the other . It seemed to him a pity to disturb the operations of his own luminous mind by any such embarrassing operation ; and if it was necessary to hear both sides , he declared that he would hear neither , - a determination to which , happily for those who had suits in chancery , he adhered as long as he lived . The account of Bishop Williams 's labors while he held this office forms a singular contrast with the fashions of the present day . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remained there till between eight and nine , when the peers assembled . Over them he presided till twelve , and sometimes , when there was a protracted debate , did not return till past one . After a hasty dinner , he returned to finish his business in chancery , in which he was engaged till eight , when he attended to his letters and papers , and then employed himself far into the night in preparing his business for the Lords on the next day . But his time was not so much engaged as to leave no opportunity for courtly intrigues . He always looked sharply to his own interest , and if , by any miscalculation , he found it endangered , he was ready to stoop to any submission , however low . At one time , he was rash enough to attempt to supplant Buckingham ; and for this unsuccessful endeavour , he was threatened with an entire overthrow of his fortunes , till he contrived to make himself again useful to that great personage , after which he was partially forgiven . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as Charles ascended the throne , the favorite , whose influence was stronger than ever , made use of it to displace the bishop in favor of one more tractable and complying . After being freed from official restraint , Williams showed signs of sagacity and independence . He distrusted and opposed the proceedings of Laud , who became his bitter enemy . Well would it have been for the king , if , instead of exasperating the nation by his arbitrary course , he had adopted the counsels of this more temperate and far-seeing adviser . Laud tried hard to destroy him , and succeeded in plundering him by fines and confiscations . But he could not make him resign his bishopric , as he wished ; and when the Commons // party gained the ascendency , the circumstance that one so odious as Laud had persecuted him was of itself a passport to popular applause . How sharp-sighted he was in his judgment of character appears from the warning which he gave Charles , who consulted him much in his troubles , of the danger to be apprehended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be a most daring and formidable opponent . The smile of incredulity with which Charles received the caution was probably one of the last ever seen on his careworn features . Though his advice was not always followed , the bishop exerted himself with the greatest energy , even levying forces in his master 's falling cause ; and after the king 's execution , though from infirmity he kept his bed at all other times , he rose regularly at midnight , knelt at his bedside , and prayed earnestly that the short and sorrowful remnant of his life might be faithfully spent , till he should be permitted to depart in peace . Those were times which tried not only men 's souls , but also their adroitness in maintaining their position , when all the social elements were in agitation , and the waves of the people were dashing so high against the throne , that it seems mysterious that even courtiers , with the self-securing instinct of the race , should not have foreseen that the many would soon be too strong for the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression that the throne was founded in the laws of nature ; and while the king was coldly indifferent , and Buckingham despised all opposers , there were men wise enough to fill the place of chancellor , and weak enough to sell their souls for office . But they were not likely to be persons of high character and commanding powers . The Lord Keeper Coventry was one of these politicians ; Clarendon says that he had " a strange power of making himself believed , " a phrase which does not imply the highest compliment to the goodness of his word . But he was honor and independence itself , compared with his successor , Finch , who advised and aided to carry out the worst measures of the court , with a professed and determined regard to his own interest , as the first and last thing which lie regarded . No man , he said , should ever force him to do any thing toward his own ruin , He was little aware , that , in his poor calculations to keep the royal favor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin which // he held so much in dread . The impeachment of Strafford dispelled his illusion ; and after a vain attempt to join the popular party , who feared nothing but his friendship and therefore rejected his overtures , he escaped a similar fate by a sudden flight from the kingdom . The office of chancellor was rather to be declined than solicited . Littleton , who was taken from the bench , accepted the place reluctantly , and found nothing but trouble , mortification , and sorrow all the rest of his days . At his death , the trust was accepted by Sir Richard Lane , an able and manly person , who , perilous as the station was , maintained a high character for talent and uprightness , at a time when those gifts were not always found walking together the civil wars commenced , the Parliament were for a time in trouble for want of the great seal , which of course was out of their reach . In such cases , the appearance will sometimes be formidable to those who do not fear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , it seemed a serious thing to stamp sealing-wax with a new image and superscription , though every thing else bore the crushing impress of their hands . It was done , however ; and having once tried the experiment , they repeated it , till , after breaking severaJ , they got one at last which had nothing to remind them of a king . This mystic signet was then intrusted to a commission , of which Whitelock was the chief , supported by two nothings at his side . Carlyle , in his romance of Cromwell , presuming largely on the ignorance of his readers , treats Whitelock in the same lofty and patronizing way which Dogherry extended to Verges . It is one of the arts of his brilliant quackery to shape some leading figure , not as it was , but as he chooses it shall be , and to sweep away into insignificance all those who ever came in conflict with his idols ; it takes but a dash of the pen to transform them into knaves and fools . But Whitelock , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a blind man , " was a man of sense and learning , diligent in his office , and earnest in his endeavours to reform the administration of law . He saw through Cromxvell 's designs , which were not altogether so saintly as his ingenious worshipper is pleased to make them , and gave him advice , which was received with special disgust , because it took for granted that 16* // 1S6 July , ambition which the Lord Protector designed to conceal ; - a design in which , so far as his last biographer is concerned , he has triumphantly succeeded , though most other readers of history retain the use of their eyes . Whitelock was de*cient in moral courage ; but he dealt faithfully with Cromwell , strongly advising him to renounce that hollow pageant of royalty which was floating before his eyes , as a prize which , should he secure it , was of very doubtful value , and would be fatal to his immediate popularity and his lasting renown . For this faithful advice , which was one of the most honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coldness , and Mr. Carlyle cuts him up with no very Christian spirit of revenge , and without any reason , that we can discover , except that what he said was true . There is some comfort in turning from the list of courtiers to the great Earl of Clarendon , who has made us familiar with himself by his own writings , and to whom we are indebted for admirable portraits of the distinguished men of those times ; portraits which , with some allowance for prejudice , such as can be easily made , are characteristic , discriminating , and true . He has been the subject of much criticism and censure , and there are passages in his life which no friend would willingly remember . But when we consider the heartless rowdy whom he served after the Restoration , and the base crexv who had control of the vessel of state , not to speak of the licentiousness and corruption which everywhere abounded , the stains on his memory fade into snowy purity , contrasted with the Ethiopian blackness of theirs . In his early life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend Lord Falkland , he was a supporter of constitutional freedom , and at the same time felt bound to uphold the rights of the throne . He was not so much given to study and ambition as to neglect the graces of life . When a mask was got up by the Inns of Court , for the entertainment of the queen , he had a leading part in the arrangements , and Whitelock , who superintended the music , said , with great sincerity no doubt , that it was better than had before been heard in England . It is rather comical to think of the two chancellors thus engaged in their early history ; but the scene changed into a drama sufficiently tragical , before all was done . The young man , in his professional career , showed spirit and independence . The merchants of // London , on attempting to resist some exactions of the Treasury , could not find any among the elder advocates who were willing to plead their cause ; he undertook it , without regard to personal consequences , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed a wish to see the person who was so hardy in his defiance of power . He also attacked the Herald 's Court , instituted to guard the privileges of the nobility , who in general were quite able to protect themselves . Its character may be inferred from the sentence inflicted on a tailor , who , on being grievously insulted and threatened by a nobleman to whom he presented his bill , had the audacity to say that he was as good as the man that owed him ; for which enormous disrespect to his betters , he was thought to be mercifully punished by the forfeiture , of the debt . Hyde did not , however , factiously oppose the crown ; he endeavoured to serve it faithfully and wisely , but was prevented by the angry dissolution of Parliament one of those successive steps by which the king marched to his ruin , since it was evident to all but himself and his immediate counsellors , that each new legislature came together with a spirit more hostile to him than the last . When the Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , though he had little sympathy with gloomy and vindictive persons , such as St. John ; he was moderate , fair , and impartial , and therefore well calculated to have influence before the times of violent passion and conflict began . He took up with zeal and energy the conduct of the judges in the celebrated case of ship-money , censuring them in the strongest terms for their slavish doctrines , their denial of protection to the subject , and their open perversions of the law . The Council of the North was another of the abuses which he assailed . It was established by Henry the Eighth after an insurrection , and afterwards continued in existence , as a convenient engine of oppression , though wholly in violation of liberty and law . The celebrated Strafford had used it in that arbitrary course for which he suffered , and the memory of which was almost effaced by the loftiness and even grandeur of his bearing after his fall , - that being the term applied to ministers out of office and favor , though in every moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part which the future chancellor took in the proceedings against that nobleman is somewhat doubtful ; // like Falkland , he thought that Strafford deserved punishment for his tyranny , but , like many others , he did not believe that his crimes against English liberty came within the definition of treason according to the law . It was at this time that Hyde became an adherent of the crown , but not under circumstances which would bring any doubt upon his disinterestedness , for certainly there was nothing bright in the prospects of Charles ; he had a mere traditional feeling of loyalty on his side , while all substantial power was on the other . The king did not himself despair of prevailing by force or by such stratagems as he thought fit to employ , and which brought him nothing but dishonor ; while clear-headed men saw plainly that the spell of royalty was broken , and that the strongest efforts of the wise and good were required to keep the Parliament from growing as mighty and tyrannical as the most absolute kings had been . Charles selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private advisers , pledging his honor to them , that , without their assent , he would take no step in Parliament whatever . This arrangement inspired a general confidence very propitious to his cause ; but after a time , every one was struck with dismay to hear of his suicidal attempt to seize the five members of the Commons , a movement which made it manifest that his purposes were tyrannical , and also brought suspicion on the fair fame of his counsellors , who , by this act of bad faith on his part , appeared to the world as the instigators of a proceeding which they unanimously condemned and deplored . No one could have blamed them , if , disgusted by such treatment , they had renounced the service of the king . They did , in truth , almost give up the hope of being able to serve him ; and it is much to the honor of Hyde , that he should have persevered in his endeavours to sustain a falling cause by the most laborious and incessant exertions , till the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince was given to his charge to be placed in the security of a foreign land . He did not covet this office of managing a cold-hearted and self-indulgent boy , who learned nothing by experience , and was not made serious by suffering , but remained the same , caring for nothing but play and pleasure , to his dying day . Still , it is well for the world that Hyde was thus exiled ; since it was in this retirement that he engaged in the preparation of that history which , though some // objections on the score of prejudice may be made to it , is certainly one of the most pleasing and instructive ever written , and in its delineations of individual character has never been exceeded . To this undertaking he devoted ten hours a day ; and the constant employment and interest which it affordqd him relieved the weariness of a life of banishment , which was never cheered by any good news from home . After the death of Charles the First , it followed as a matter of necessity that Hyde should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being completely lost in disgraceful sensuality , and his favorite companions being Buckingham and a knot of similar spirits , who would have deserted his fallen fortunes very soon , if there had been any one willing to receive them . While they kept up their own and their master 's spirits by frolic and buffoonery , every thing which involved deliberation and responsibility came on this wise and faithftil friend . Among other anxieties , he had to provide the means of subsistence for the court . How much the exiles were reduced appears from his desponding remark - " Every bit of meat , every drop of drink , all the fire and candles that have been used , are owed for ; and how to get credit for a week more is no easy matter . " Hyde contrived to keep up a show of respectability in a discreditable concern , not by bringing the king and his companions to a sense of decency , which was impossible , but by holding up his own high character before the extreme worthlessness of theirs . At this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment which Lord Campbell rather superfluously ascribes to his own ambitious suggestion , while he hypocritically pretended to decline it . Why such a charge should be made , in the absence of all evidence to support it , does not appear . Such an officer was necessary in any court , and particularly so in one like that of Charles , in which there were commissions to be prepared , papers to be signed and sealed , and even a greater variety of concerns to be attended to than in more prosperous days . Surely , one should be permitted to take an office , when it brings him no compensation but labor , want , and sorrow , without being charged with mercenary feelings . The court of Charles at Bruges was about the last place which men of low ambition would have chosen for their field of glory . But however Hyde // may have reached the office , he managed the interests of the banished king with great judgment and discretion . It required considerable negotiation with Monk before that accidental dictator could ascertain his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter , to be determined by the side which fell uppermost . He finally concluded that restoration would be more grateful and symmetrical in itself , as well as more acceptable to Charles , if it was not embarrassed with any conditions about amnesty , civil rights , and liberty of conscience , which it was then the time to impose . After the Restoration , Hyde , as a matter of course , remained at the head of affairs . It could not be expected , that , after all his sufferings , he should retain much enthusiasm for liberty ; but his aim seemed to be , not merely to exalt the prerogative , but to make his master a constitutional king . He was somewhat corrupted by the licentious maxims of that abandoned and shameless time , yet not by avarice , for he rejected a bribe from the French court , and a magnificent grant of lands from the king . The greatest discredit attached to his memory comes from his consenting to urge the queen to receive the mistress of her husband as one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can hardly conceive of his lending himself to such counsels of sin and shame ; but the truth seems to have been , that he yielded to Charles in personal matters , while he was firm and independent where the public welfare was concerned . We see no reason to believe , what is commonly assumed as the ground of a charge of hypocrisy , that he promoted the marriage of James to his daughter , an event which he professed to deplore . He must have foreseen that much trouble would arise from this ill-assorted union , and may very well be supposed to have looked on it with more fear than rejoicing . Besides , those who say that the anger which he manifested on this occasion was affected and hypocritical should remember , that though the parties were called husband and wife , the marriage service had not then been performed for them , so that there was reason enough for displeasure . Hyde , now created IEarl of Clarendon , was a zealot in support of the claims of the church of England , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure it . This course of conduct was distasteful to the king , who was himself a Catholic , because , conscious of // his own profligacy , he wanted a faith in which he could find some absolution for his crimes . The chancellor also wounded him by his stern disapprobation of the folly and unfaithfulness in which his life was passed , while the shameless women who surrounded the king taunted him with his submission to an old and rigid master . If the integrity of Clarendon made him many enemies , it must be confessed that his overbearing spirit needlessly increased their number though injuries are sometimes forgiven , contempt is never forgotten nor pardoned . When his influence was once shaken , his opposition to the Dutch war , and other measures tending to iniquity and disgrace , which Charles supported because they gave him a chance to pick the pocket of the nation , inflamed the king to such a pitch as to give him courage to dismiss his most faithful adviser . Lady Castlemaine also insisted upon his dismissal , and she was supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the court was composed . Clarendon was disgraced , chiefly for the reason that he was , as Lord Southampton said , " a true Protestant , and an honest Englishman ; and while he enjoyed power , men were secure of their laws , liberties , and religion . " Clarendon was a man of great talents and great virtues ; and though he was not exempt from many failings , though there were grievous errors in his administration and his private life , he will always deserve respect for his integrity and wisdom . Among most of those who surrounded him , he towered as a son of light . It is painful to think of him as an infirm and suffering man , a second time exiled from his country , and this time never to return , wandering without a resting-place , driven from one city to another , ordered to quit the French territory when he was too sick to leave his bed , and abused by Englishmen abroad even to the danger of his life . Yet nothing could damp the ardor of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not walk without the support of two men , he diligently continued his historical studies and writings , improved himself in the French language and began the Italian , reviewed Hobbes 's Leviathan and various polemical works , commenced a narrative of his own life , and even contemplated a history of England . Finding that his end was approaching , he earnestly solicited permission to die in his native land ; but even this // was denied him , and a second application met with no reply . He said that it was in nobody 's power to prevent his dying , and it did not seem to him unreasonable to wish for a place in which to die ; but he submitted without complaining , and simply remarked in his will , that he had never committed any fault against the king . His remains were carried over to the land which he was not permitted to see , and privately buried in Westminster Abbey . But though his two granddaughters reigned in succession in England , they had no feeling of reverence to induce them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscription to show where his body returned to the dust . Much is said of the thanklessness of republics ; but rather a longer chapter might be written on the ingratitude of kings . In a commonwealth , the people have the impression that they are not served with perfect disinterestedness ; their benefactors might adopt the language of one of the German women who came over with George the First , when she was followed by the populace of London - " Good people , we are come over here for nothing but your goods " ; - which the uncourtly mob declared they had no difficulty whatever in believing . But Clarendon in the service of Charles was disinterested as well as faithful ; xvhatever his errors may have been , he was not , like his master , the proprietor and the victim of a cold and selfish heart . In the ministry of the Cabal , when the moral condition of England was lower than , it is to be hoped , it will ever be again , the great seal was placed in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , that extraordinary personage , Lord Shaftesbury , had become one of the ministry , and aspired to be something better . The opportunity was not long wanting . The king had commenced his machinations for restoring absolutism and Popery , with the suicidal Dutch war , and the London bankers had advanced him large sums , for the repayment of which orders on the treasury were issued . These bankers relied on his promise , " that he would not , on any occasion whatever , suffer an interruption of the payment of these orders . " But his word was no better than he was himself ; and by the direction of the Cabal , the exchequer suddenly stopped payment . This measure shook the commercial world with an explosion like that of a thunderbolt , and threw the king 's affairs into irremediable disgrace and confusion . // The bankers had borrowed the money from others , who at once brought actions against them for the recovery of their property . When they applied to Shaftesbury , who then presided in the Treasury , he remembered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to go to the lord keeper for an injunction to stay all such proceedings . This officer , of course , had no authority to stay the operation of the law but while he hesitated , not willing to give offence , and not feeling easy to violate his conscience and the law , Shaftesbury went to the king , and declared that the lord keeper was an old fool , and that he himself could discharge the duties of that station much more to the public satisfaction . The king laughed at the idea ; but the rest of the Cabal , who wished him out of their way , were pleased at the suggestion . Accordingly he was appointed , though the nearest approach which he made to qualification for the duty was that of having married the daughter of the Lord Keeper Coventry . But Shaftesbury 's previous life had been such as to make him feel easy in any situation . In the Rebellion he was at first on the king 's side ; then , with perfect consistency , as he always maintained , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . In like manner , he was for a time on good terms with Cromwell ; then he quarrelled with him , and exerted himself so vigorously against the Protectorate , that Cromwell declared him the worst person to manage he ever saw . When Richard Cromwell succeeded , Shaftesbury took the oath to support the new Protector , and abjured the Stuarts ; and then was soon found intriguing so as to confuse and embarrass all public movements , in order to create a necessity for the restoration of the king . For seven years after the return of Charles , Shaftesbury was quiet , which conduct remains an unexplained mystery in his life ; but after this unnatural repose , he began to lay plans to ruin Clarendon , in which he . at last succeeded , by using all manner of arts , and even contriving to throw on the old chancellor the odium of the Dutch war , which he had always steadily opposed . The king pronounced Shaftesbury the weakest and wickedest man of his age ; but he was not entitled to either distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days of corruption he had never received money from France , which could be said of few English statesmen . // When he danced from one side to another , he was always amazingly conscientious on the subject of betraying the confidence of the former party . When he left the service of Charles the First for the Parliament , that body rejoiced in the expectation of learning all the secrets of the royal camp but he refused to speak a single word . This faithfulness after the manner of Dalgetty was somewhat better than none . On one occasion , Charles complimented him by saying that he considered him the most profligate man in his dominions his easy reply was , - " Of a subject , Sir , I believe I am . " But even this could not be said with truth , when so many were destitute of every vestige of decency and shame . Still , his history and reputation , combined with an entire ignorance of law and other matters which chancellors are supposed to know , were not very auspicious to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaftesbury was a member of the Cabal , the other ministers had no affection for him ; and their jealousy , together with the king 's want of confidence , made him rather disposed to form a cabal by himself . In his contrivances to gain influence , his sagacity led him , against his taste , to fall in with the tendencies of the times towards political freedom . Nothing could exceed his sharpness of discernment in all public and private affairs . When he dined once with Clarendon , he found out , from a certain deference of manner on the part of her mother , the secret of Anne Hyde 's marriage to the Duke of York , which was then unsuspected by others ; and so , in all public concerns , it was impossible to conceal any thing which he was interested to know . He saw that the commercial interest was growing in importance , and that more toleration in matters of religion must soon be granted . He therefore became a sort of patron of the merchants , and carried his favor to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them from the king . Charles was not firm in maintaining his ground in opposition to the Commons , who questioned his right to issue such a declaration and Shaftesbury , who had secretly encouraged their proceedings against it , said that he should not advise persisting against so august a body . The monarch hated and feared Shaftesbury , longed to get rid of him , and yet doubted whether his powers of annoyance might not be increased by his dismissal from oflice. // He concluded , on the whole , to follow his inclination and take away the seals ; but he could not deprive the dismissed chancellor of the reputation of being the head of the Protestant party . Though it was very doubtful if he believed in revelation , he was held up as the saviour of true religion and though no man had carried royal pretensions farther , he was welcomed by acclamation as the leader of the liberal party . It was not greatly to the credit of any patriotic or religious body to be under the marching orders of so unscrupulous a chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the path and the direction in which he would have them go . But he showed such courage and resources , his tactics in managing the Parliament and people were so brilliant , and , above all , he was so well qualified and disposed to resist the king and the Duke of York , that all seemed glad to arrange themselves under his banner , though there was so much in his character and proceedings which no one could approve . It was Shaftesbury 's great distinction , that he forced himself into a leading ministerial office in opposition not only to the known wishes , but to the strenuous efforts , of the king . The same thing has happened since ; when George the Third was compelled to receive Fox , whom he hated , as his minister , it was thought a great victory of freedom ; and so it was . But kings had by that time learned to put up with much that was distasteful ; while in Shaftesbury 's day it was a novelty strange and fearful , " with fear of change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held to the royal lips by a subject 's uncourtly hand . It should be remembered , too , that to Shaftesbury the English nation is indebted for the Habeas Corpus act , by which the liberty of the subject has been since so effectually guarded . Partly by argument , and partly by that Parliamentary management in which no man was a match for him , he carried the measure against the coldness of the Lords , and the resistance of the court party . Charles happily had not the courage to refuse his sanction , and the act has ever since been regarded as the glorious and happy union of English liberty and English law . It was marvellous to see the fearlessness and talent with which Shaftesbury braved the court , not hesitating to offer the most grievous affronts , though he was conscious of the tremendous powers which , after all that had been gained to freedom , // still remained in the royal hand . He openly attempted to pass an act excluding the Duke of York from the succession , and threatened to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a proper and decent measure . But meantime he was in the condition of De Retz , whom he otherwise resembled ; the moment the court laid hands upon him , the spell of his influence was broken , and his adherents began to take thought for themselves . When he was arrested and carried to the Tower , a friend by the way said , - " God deliver you from your enemies " He replied with  --  a smile , - " They have more reason to pray that he would deliver them from me . " He applied for the benefit of his own Habeas Corpus act ; but it was refused , on false pretences . Still , it was necessary that he should be indicted by a London grand jury , and they refused to find a bill . But the court left no stone unturned to change the public mind ; not only pamphlets , addresses , reports , and falsehoods were put into circulation , but the king suggested to Dryden the writing of a poem to aid the work ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell how long Shaftesbury could have maintained his position of defiance ; he was induced , partly by the desire of troubling the court , and still more by his own restlessness of spirit , to take part in the rash designs of Monmouth . But the public mind , though it welcomed agitation , was not ready for another downfall of the throne ; and the general feeling swung back in such a manner , that the king became absolute . Shaftesbury fled from the kingdom ; Russell and Sydney died without creating excitement ; and the hopes of liberty were adjourned to a future day , under the direction of that Providence which generally moves in darkness , but which shone forth encouragingly in the subsequent revolution , that swept the Stuarts for ever from the throne . Such a man as this could not be fairly estimated in his own times , and hardly in those which followed ; for the distinction of Whig and Tory , which then began , lasted , with all the passions connected with it , through many following generations . His private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of his associates in that most depraved of courts ; and yet it is easier to believe that he should have been misrepresented , than that such a wretch as he is sometimes described should have enjoyed // the respect and esteem of Locke . As to his enthusiasm in favor of liberty and toleration , he appears to have regarded them not as ends , but rather as means to make himself formidable . Still , whatever were his motives , his efforts were of service to the great cause of mankind . As a Parliamentary orator , he was without a rival or any approach to rivalship ; he was clear in comprehension , eloquent in language , and sometimes powerfully sarcastic in reply ; witness his cool remark to a hostile bishop , who , when Shaftesbury was speaking , wondered , in a loud undertone , when he would be done preaching : - " As soon as I am made a bishop , ** was his easy and indifferent answer . His great passion was a restless craving for political excitement ; while most men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was like a petrel , serene and happy in all the thunders of the storm . The same thirst for intense action went with him to the moment when , having left his country , he was welcomed to the United Provinces , where the hospitable attentions which were paid him probably brought on the sudden attack of gout in the stomach which terminated his life , bringing , it is to be hoped , that peace and rest of which he knew nothing before . After Shaftesbury came the Earl of Nottingham , who was content to be an humble servant , and not a rival , of the king . Whenever he was called upon for the purpose , he was submissive enough to the arbitrary pleasure of a monarch , who , having gained the ascendency by a strange turn of public feeling , was determined to use the advantage to the utmost of his power . The reputation of this chancellor stands high with judicial writers ; Lord Campbell quotes " the great Chancellor Kent , " and Jud6e Story , who speak of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may have been in that department , in matters of state he does not stand clear from the reproach of slavish compliance with his master 's lawless will . But he was decency and honor itself , compared with the Lord Keeper Guilford , who seems to have been appointed because Jeffreys , by all acknowledgment the basest of mankind , was not yet ready for the station which he afterwards so infamously filled . Lord Guilford was early instructed in the art of hypocrisy by his mother , a sanctified vixen , who made her children practise " praying by the spirit " in their 17* // earliest childhood . His father kept him very much restricted in his resources , which , as soon as he became a lawyer , he improved by residing with his grandfather , a most tyrannical old man , whose humors he bore patiently , avenging himself meantime by all manner of legal extortion . By steadily paying court to every one who could advance his interests , and never suffering any thing like sympathy or generous feeling to turn him for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast in his profession , allowing himself no recreation except music , on which he wrote some very poor essays , occasionally hearing Hugh Peters , and , as his biographer says , by way of climax , indulging himself at times in " a petit supper and a bottle , " for the law was by no means as dry then as it has been in later years . By stepping forward to argue against reversing the sentence of Hollis and other members of the Commons in the reign of Charles the First , he attracted the attention of the court , as one likely to be sufficiently able and unprincipled , and in due time to become lord keeper of the great seal . After defiling his conscience by silence in the delusion of witchcraft , and suffering his brother judges to murder the victims who he knew were innocent ; by pursuing the same policy in the case of Gates 's plot , where he was equally free from delusion ; by observing silence also when Stafford was executed , though in private he condemned the proceeding ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply because it would be pleasant to the king ; by attempting to pervert justice in order to bring ruin on Shaftesbury , which crime was prevented by the firmness of the jury ; by engaging actively in the successful conspiracy for disfranchising the city of London ; by his acquiescence in the cruelties of Jeffreys , which , as Hallam says , is proved to be true , though Roger North denies it ; - by these and various other degrading compliances he reached the highest honors , but only to be torn down at last by his detested rival , whose success , however , has since been a shield and blessing to him , by holding up before him a memory more infamous than his own . He was succeeded by Jeffreys , who had long been browbeating and insulting him on all occasions , with a view to drive him from the office ; but he refused to resign , out of a manly spirit , as his brother maintained , though what was the spirit and manliness of remaining where he was not wanted // it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor is spelt in eight different ways , of which " Jeffreys " is found in his patent of peerage . He was a person of superior talents and attractive manners , which unfortunately covered from observation his inherent brutality , and aided him to gain that influence which he afterwards so fearfully abused . In his youth , his father had discernment enough to foresee his tendencies , and sometimes complimented him , more in sorrow than in anger , by expressing the fear that " he would die with his shoes and stockings on . " But he contrived to make himself everywhere acceptable by his social powers , and when he came to the practice of his profession , had the art of seeming to know every thing ; and as his talents for conversation brought him into acquaintance with the great , he was able , at the early age of twenty , to give the impression of one who was to take a distinguished part in public affairs . He had also a bold aspect and a commanding voice , and as he was wholly destitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed for a man of great energy and resource , being aided , too , by the good word and the services of his bacchanal companions , who were all the trumpeters of his fame . The hard drinking in which he constantly indulged not only recommended him to a wealthy and influential citizen of London , who loved him for being able to drink and smoke when all the other lights of the festive board were extinguished beneath it , but served him equally well in fashionable circles , where licentiousness was accompanied by its kindred vices , and all in their worst excess . But what was most in favor of his success in life , he became well acquainted with Chiffinch , the pander to the vices of the king , who , by a natural instinct , took to him as a bird of a feather as dark and infamous as his own . When he reached the office of Recorder , which he gained by the aid of the Whig party , whose power he had courted , be renounced every thing like patriotism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown into obscurity by the Popish plot , which Shaftesbury , though he did not invent it , used for his own purposes . Jeffreys suggested to the government , that they had better hold Shaftesbury answerable for it if it should come to nothing , and , meantime , that they should profess the strongest Protestant zeal , without the least regard to the innocent blood which he knew it would cause // to flow . This mean and villanous advice they had no scruple in adopting , and he immediately addressed himself with vigor and delight to the wholesale murders which followed . For this service he was made chief justice of Chester , an appointment which even Charles could not think of without some sense of shame , and which had the effect to make him so insolent that the English spirit was roused . He was confronted by members of juries , and treated with contempt by the other judges , before whom he continued to practise in order to increase his income . The feeling rose so high in the city of London , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to the displeasure of the king . It only made him more ferocious in his conduct at the time of the Rye-house plot , and the trial of Lord Russell , whom he was the means of convicting . It is hardly possible to conceive of any thing more vile and outrageous than his bearing on those occasions , and really it is only to be accounted for by the never-ceasing drunkenness in which he passed his nights and a great proportion of his days . As some of his associates wanted nerve in Russell 's trial , and there was more work of the same kind to be done , he was made chief justice by his abandoned master ; and when he had taken the life of Sydney , and afterwards of Sir Thomas Armstrong , he was greatly endeared to Charles , who presented him with a ring of value , which he had most appropriately called his bloodstorte . Having already exceeded our limits , we shall not trace any farther the rise of this wretch to power , nor moralize upon his miserable end when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most others who are overbearing in prosperity , he was weak and timid in his fall . He died in prison , of what disease it is not easy to tell . One of his friends says that he died a Roman death , which he explains by saying that he killed himself by drinking an enormous quantity of brandy . We were not aware that this death was particularly Roman ; but it was a fit termination of the career of the greatest scoundrel that ever held high judicial office in England . Lord Campbell 's work contains much valuable information , but the literary execution of it is not of the high6st order . Such words as earwigging may possibly he English , but they belong to no family of that language which we have ever had // the honor to know . We shall look with much interest for the second series , which will afford the author better subjects for his biography , and which he will probably bring down to our own times.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
