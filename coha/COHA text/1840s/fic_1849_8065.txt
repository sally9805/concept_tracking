Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : THE LIGHT OF THE LIGHTHOUSE . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) I. The closing of a day in June , Mild , beautiful , and bright ! The setting sun , the crescent moon , Mingling their doubtful light ! The west wind brings the odor sweet Of flowers and new-mown hay ; While murmuring billows at our feet Breathe of the salt sea spray . II . We stroll along the wide sea-beach , A ladye faire and I , And con what Nature 's page may teach In ocean , earth , and sky . And , as across the waters blue , With roving glance we gaze , A light springs suddenly to view  --  It is a beacon 's blaze ! III . O , lambently the new-born flame Disparts the purple air ; In childlike wonder we exclaim , To see a sight so fair . " How bright , " the ladye saith , " its ray Shoots o'er the tranquil tide ! Now listen to the tale , I pray , With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's narrow ledge Of rocks with sea-weed strown , Fringed by the thinly-scattered sedge , The lighthouse towers alone . There , ' mid the sea 's perpetual swell , The dash of breakers wild , Two solitary beings dwell  --  A father and his child ! V. " Three years ago , no friendly light Across the dark reef beamed ; A white flag on the rocky height , The only signal , streamed . Poor Francis Lorne had then a wife , And he had children five ; He led a fisherman 's bold life , And merrily did he thrive . VI . " It was on Independence Day , To Mary Lorne he said , ' My sloop is rocking in the bay , Our flag at her mast-head . Come , gentle wife , your work throw down , And , children , come with me ; And we 'll all take a trip to town , This day 's great sights to see . VII . " ' On board ! on board ! Fair blows the gale ; My boat is swift and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sweep along ! The sky is clear and beautiful , Bright gleams the breezy morn ; We 'll skim the blue waves like a gull ! We will ! ' said Francis Lorne . VIII . " O , joyful heart , exult not so ! Mistrust that prospect fair ; It is the lure of death and woe , The ambush of despair ! That night the storm , in wild array , Clove through the billows dark , And , in a cloud of foam and spray , Rushed on the fated bark . IX . " The morning 's dim , unconscious smile , That hushed the raging blast , Disclosed upon that rock-bound isle Two forms the surge had cast . There , folded to the father 's breast , His youngest daughter lay ; They are but two  --  where be the rest ? Ye ruthless billows , say ! X. " Alas for him ! From death-like sleep , When memory was recalled , He could not groan  --  he could not weep  --  His reason was appalled ! A grief , that blanched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief that time could not erase , And hope could not subdue . XI . " And when , at length , on yonder spot , Was reared the lighthouse spire , To him was given the lonely lot To tend the beacon fire . There , from the busy world apart , Its clamor and its care , He lives , with but one human heart His solitude to share . XII . " But O , Aurora 's crimson light , That makes the watch-fire dim , Is not a more transporting sight Than Ellen is to him ! He pineth not for fields and brooks , Wild-flowers and singing birds , For Summer smileth in her looks , And singeth in her words . XIII . " A fairy thing , not five years old , So full of joy and grace , It is a rapture to behold The beauty of her face ! And O , to hear her happy voice , Her laughter ringing free , Would make the gloomiest heart rejoice , And turn despair to glee ! XIV . " The ocean 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips ; And , in her cheek , the mingled dyes , No sea-shell could eclipse ! And , as she climbs the weedy rocks , And in the sunshine plays , The wind that lifts her golden locks Seems more to love their rays . XV . " When the smoothed ocean sleeps unstirred , And , like a silver band , The molten waters circling gird The island 's rim of sand , She runs her tiny feet to lave , And breaks the liquid chain ; Then laughs to feel the shivered wave Coil down to rest again . XVI . " And , when the black squall rends the deep , The tempest-cradled maid , To see the white gulls o'er her sweep , Mounts to the balustrade : Above her head and round about , They stoop without alarm , And seem to flout her threatening shout , And her up-stretching arm . XVII . " Once , Francis sought the neighboring town , And she was left alone ; When such a furious storm came down As never had been known . ' My child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , withhold me not ! The bravest man , in such a tide , Would quail on that bleak spot . ' XVIII . " He strove , till faint and out of breath , His fragile boat to gain ; But all knew it was certain death To tempt the hurricane : And wilder grew the tempest 's power , And doubly black the night , When , lo ! at the appointed hour , Blazed forth that beacon-light ! XIX . " The sea-fog , like a fallen cloud , Rolled in and dimmed its fire ; Roared the gale louder and more loud , And sprang the billows higher ! Above the gale that wailed and rang ,  --  Above the booming swell , With steady and sonorous clang , Pealed forth the lighthouse bell ! XX . " Warned by the sound , ships inward bound Again the offing tried ; And soon the baffled Tempest found His anger was defied : The billows fell , the winds , rebuked , Crept to their caverns back ; And placidly the day-star looked Out from the cloudy rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon the little bed , Where , wrapped in slumber deep and mild , Ellen reposed her head . Her friends , her father seek the place ; Good saints have watched her charms ! Her blue eyes open on his face , And she is in his arms ! " XXII . The voice was mute , the tale was told ; Sacred be my reply ! Along the wide sea-beach we strolled , That ladye faire and I. Blessed , ever blessed and unforgot , Be that sweet summer night ! And blessings on that wave-girt spot , The lighthouse and the light ! SHELLS AND SEAWEEDS . RECORDS OF A SUMMER VOYAGE TO CUBA . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : I. THE DEPARTURE . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) Again thy winds are pealing in mine ear ; Again thy waves are flashing in my sight ; Thy memory-haunting tones again I hear , As through the spray our vessel wings her flight . On thy cerulean breast , now swelling high , Again , thou broad Atlantic , am I cast . Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since , an adventurous boy , I hailed thee last . The sea-birds o'er me wheel , as if to greet An old companion ; on my naked brow The sparkling foam-drops not unkindly beat ; Flows thro ' my hair the freshening breeze : and now The horizon 's ring enclasps me ; and I stand Gazing where fades from view , cloud-like , my fatherland . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : II . THE AWAKENING . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) How changed the scene ! Our parting gaze , last night , Was on the three-hilled city 's swelling dome ,  --  The dome o'erlooking from its stately height Full many a sacred spire and happy home . Rose over all , clouding the azure air , A canopy of smoke , swart Labor 's sign ; While like a forest Winter has stripped bare , Bristled the masts along the water 's line . But now the unbroken ocean and the sky Seem to enclose us in a crystal sphere ; A new creation fills the straining eye ; No bark save ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brightening east , a crimson haze Floats up before the sun , his incense fresh of praise . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : III . THE GALE . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) The night came robed in terror . Through the air Mountains of clouds , with lurid summits , rolled ,  --  The lightning kindling with its vivid glare Their outlines , as they rose heaped fold on fold . The wind , in fitful soughs , swept o'er the sea ; And then a sudden lull , serene as sleep , Soft as an infant 's breathing , seemed to be Cast , like enchantment , on the throbbing deep . But false the calm ! for soon the strengthened gale Burst in one loud explosion , far and wide , Drowning the thunder 's voice ! With every sail Close-reefed , our groaning ship heeled on her side ; The torn waves combed the deck ; while , o'er the mast , The meteors of the storm a ghastly radiance cast . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : IV . MORNING AFTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Bravely our trim ship rode the tempest through ; And when the exhausted gale had ceased to rave , How broke the day-star on the gazer 's view ! How flushed the orient every crested wave ! The sun threw down his shield of golden light In proud defiance on the ocean 's bed ; Whereat the clouds betook themselves to flight , Like routed hosts , with banners soiled and red . The sky was soon all brilliance , east and west ; All traces of the gale had passed away ; The chiming billows , by the breeze caressed , Shook lightly from their heads the feathery spray . Ah ! thus may Hope 's auspicious star relume The sorrow-clouded soul , and end its hour of gloom ! Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : V. TO A LAND BIRD . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) Thou wanderer from green fields and leafy nooks ! Where blooms the flower and toils the honey-bee ,  --  Where odorous blossoms drift along the brooks , And woods and hills are very fair to see ,  --  Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drooping wing , far o'er the briny billow ? Thou canst not , like the ospray , cleave the foam , Nor like the petrel make the wave thy pillow . Thou'rt like those fine-toned spirits , gentle bird , Which from some better land to this rude life Seem borne . They struggle , ' mid the common herd , With powers unfitted for the selfish strife : Haply , at length , some zephyr wafts them back To their own home of peace , across the world 's dull track . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : VI . A THOUGHT OF THE PAST . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) I waked from slumber at the dead of night , Moved by a dream too heavenly fair to last  --  A dream of boyhood 's season of delight ; It flashed along the dim shapes of the past ; And , as I mused upon its strange appeal , Thrilling me with emotions undefined , Old memories , bursting from Time 's icy seal , Rushed , like sun-stricken fountains , on my mind . Scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; My favorite haunts , the shores , the ancient woods , Where , with my schoolmates , I was wont to stray ; Green , sloping lawns , majestic solitudes  --  All rose to view , more beautiful than then ;  --  They faded , and I wept  --  a child indeed again ! Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : VII . TROPICAL WEATHER . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) Now we 're afloat upon the tropic sea : Here Summer holdeth a perpetual reign . How flash the waters in their bounding glee ! The sky 's soft purple is without a stain . Full in our wake the smooth , warm trade-winds , blowing , To their unvarying goal still faithful run ; And , as we steer , with sails before them flowing , Nearer the zenith daily climbs the sun . The startled flying-fish around us skim , Glossed like the humming-bird , with rainbow dyes ; And , as they dip into the water 's brim , Swift in pursuit the preying dolphin hies . All , all is fair ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torrid languor steal . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : VIII . A CALM . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) O for one draught of cooling northern air ! That it might pour its freshness on me now ; That it might kiss my cheek and cleave my hair , And part its currents round my fevered brow ! Ocean , and sky , and earth  --  a blistering calm Spread over all ! How weary wears the day ! O , lift the wave , and bend the distant palm , Breeze ! wheresoe'er thy lagging pinions stay ! Triumphant burst upon the level deep , Rock the fixed hull and stretch the clinging sail ! Arouse the opal clouds that o'er us sleep ! Sound thy shrill whistle ! we will bid thee hail ! Though wrapped in all the storm-clouds of the North , Yet , from thy home of ice , come forth , O breeze , come forth ! Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : IX . A WISH . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) That I were in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud old elms ; Where a clear streamlet gurgled at my feet  --  Its wavelets glittering in their tiny helms ! Thick clustering vines in many a rich festoon From the high , rustling branches should depend ; Weaving a net , through which the sultry Noon Might stoop in vain its fiery beams to send . There , prostrate on some rock 's gray sloping side , Upon whose tinted moss the dew yet lay , Would I catch glimpses of the clouds that ride , Athwart the sky  --  and dream the hours away ; While through the alleys of the sunless wood The fanning breeze might steal , with wild-flowers ' breath imbued . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : X. TROPICAL NIGHT . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) But O ! the night  --  the cool , luxurious night , Which closes round us when the day grows dim , And the sun sinks from his meridian height Behind the ocean 's occidental rim ! Clouds in thin streaks of purple , green and red , Lattice his dying glory , and absorb  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like love 's last tender glances , from his orb . And now the moon , her lids unclosing , deigns To smile serenely on the charmd sea , That shines as if inlaid with lightning-chains , From which it faintly struggled to be free . Swan-like , with motion unperceived , we glide , Touched by the downy breeze , and favored by the tide . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : XI . THE PLANET JUPITER . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) Ever at night have I looked up for thee , O'er thy sidereal sisterhood supreme ! Ever at night have scanned the purple sea For the reflection of thy quivering beam ! When the white cloud thy diamond radiance screened , And the Bahama breeze began to wail , How on the plunging bows for hours I 've leaned , And watched the gradual lifting of thy veil ! Bright planet ! lustrous effluence ! thou ray From the Eternal Source of life and light ! Gleam on the track where Truth shall lead the way , And gild the inward as the outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And Hope , from earth to thee , from thee to Heaven , shall rise ! Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : XII . TO EGERIA. from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) The flying wave reflects thy angel face , But soon the liquid mirror breaks in foam ; The severing cloud reveals thy form of grace , And then thou'rt standing in thy fittest home ; A drifted vapor hides thy maiden shape  --  Ocean and sky are all the gazer sees ; But , while he murmurs at thy swift escape , He starts to hear thy whisper in the breeze . Capricious phantom ! why within my heart Create the void of beauty and of love ? A spirit tells me , coy one , who thou art ,  --  Heard in the gale , or shadowed forth above  --  The bright prefigurement of her who waits , With snow-white veil and wreath , beside the Future 's gates ! Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : XIII . CUBA . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) What sounds arouse me from my slumbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! "  --  I 'm on the deck : ' T is early dawn : the day-star yet is bright ; A few white vapory bars the zenith fleck ; And lo ! along the horizon , bold and high , The purple hills of Cuba ! Hail , all hail ! Isle of undying verdure , with thy sky Of purest azure ! Welcome , odorous gale ! O , scene of life and joy ! thou art arrayed In hues of unimagined loveliness . Sing louder , brave old mariner ! and aid My swelling heart its rapture to express ; For , from enchanted memory , never more Shall fade this dawn sublime , this fair , resplendent shore . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : XIV . THE SEA-BREEZE AT MATANZAS. from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) After a night of languor without rest ,  --  Striving to sleep , yet wishing morn might come , By the pent , scorching atmosphere oppressed , Impatient of the vile mosquito 's hum ,  --  With what reviving freshness from the sea , Its airy plumage glittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyously Into the bright arms of the encircling bay ! It tempers the keen ardor of the sun ; The drooping frame with life renewed it fills ; It lashes the green waters as they run ; It sways the graceful palm-tree on the hills ; It breathes of ocean solitudes , and caves , Luminous , vast , and cool , far down beneath the waves . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : XV . MIDSUMMER RAINS . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) The morning here , how beautiful and bright ! Look forth , and not a cloud-flake may be seen ; But , ere the sun has reached his noonday height , Up from the horizon slides a vapory screen ; And now the firmament is all o'ercast : Peals the hoarse thunder with stupendous roar ; The rain , a crushing torrent , lays the blast , Foams on the wave , and hides the adjoining shore . But , with a breath , it pauses ; and a ray Cleaves the huge keystone of the arch of gloom ; The shower attenuates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth is bloom ; And , while the sun pours down a fiercer blaze , The moisture reascends fast on his flaming rays . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : XVI . WEIGHING ANCHOR . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) Like sweetest music are those cries that tell Of weighing anchor ;  --  ay , we 're homeward bound ! Ye orange groves and coffee walks , farewell ! Farewell , thou fire-scooped summit , forest-crowned ! Ah , bright thy shores and bountiful thy fruits , Cuba ! and heaped with green thy river-banks ; But here the noontide Pestilence recruits ( Stern minister ! ) Death 's ever-gathering ranks . And so , e'en while thy gales are breathing balm , And thy rich growth our soil reluctant mocks , O , give me back the cedar for the palm ! The cedar on its brown hills , ribbed with rocks ! ' T is Freedom 's emblem ; and on Freedom 's shore It stands  --  though rough without , all fragrance at the core ! Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : THE MISSING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) God speed the noble President ! A gallant boat is she , As ever entered harbor , Or crossed a stormy sea . Like some majestic castle She towers upon the stream ; The good ships moored beside her Like pigmy shallops seem . How will her mighty bulwarks The leaping surges brave ! How will her iron sinews Make way ' gainst wind and wave ! Farewell , thou stately vessel ! Ye voyagers , farewell ! Securely on that deck shall ye The tempest 's shock repel . The stately vessel left us , In all her bold array ;  --  A glorious sight , O landsmen , As she glided down our bay ! Her flags were waving joyfully , And from her ribs of oak , " Farewell ! " to all the city Her guns in thunder spoke . Flee , on thy vapory pinions ! Back , back to England flee ; Where patient watchers by the strand Have waited long for thee ; Where kindred hearts are beating To welcome home thy crew , And tearful eyes gaze constantly Across the waters blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , months have rolled away , But where , where is the President ? And why is this delay ? Return , pale mourners , to your homes ! Ye gaze , and gaze in vain ; O , never shall that pennoned mast Salute your eyes again ! And now your hopes , like morning stars , Have one by one gone out ; And stern Despair subdues at length The agony of doubt ; But still Affection lifts the torch By night along the shore , And lingers by the surf-beat rocks , To marvel , to deplore . In dreams , I see the fated ship Torn by the northern blast ; About her tempest-riven track The white fog gathers fast ; When , lo ! above the swathing mist , Their heads the icebergs lift , In lucent grandeur to the clouds  --  Vast continents adrift ! One mingled shriek of awe goes up , At that stupendous sight : Now , helmsman , for a hundred lives , O , guide the helm aright ! Vain prayer ! she strikes ! and , thundering down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel sinks  --  The cold sea covers all ! Anon , unresting Fancy holds A direr scene to view ,  --  The burning ship , the fragile raft , The pale and dying crew . Ah me ! was such their maddening fate Upon the billowy brine ? Give up , remorseless Ocean , A relic and a sign ! No answer cometh from the deep , To tell the tale we dread ; No messenger of weal or woe Returneth from the dead ; But Faith looks up through tears , and sees , From earthly haven driven , Those lost ones meet in fairer realms , Where storms reach not  --  in Heaven . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : ROCKALL. from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) Footnote : 1Kb Pale ocean rock ! that , like a phantom shape , Or some mysterious spirit 's tenement , Risest amid this weltering waste of waves , Lonely and desolate , thy spreading base Is planted in the sea 's unmeasured depths , Where rolls the huge leviathan o'er sands Glistening with shipwrecked treasures . The strong wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunbeams interwoven , and the hues Which mingle in the rainbow . From thy top The sea-birds rise , and sweep with sidelong flight Downward upon their prey ; or , with poised wings , Skim to the horizon o'er the glittering deep . Our bark , careening to the welcome breeze , With white sails filled and streamers all afloat , Shakes from her dipping prow the foam , while we Gaze on thy outline mingling in the void , And draw our breath like men who see , amazed , Some mighty pageant passing . What had been Our fate last night , if , when the aspiring waves Were toppling o'er our mainmast , and the stars Were shrouded in black vapors , we had struck Full on thy sea-bound pinnacles , Rockall ! But now another prospect greets our sight , And hope elate is rising with our hearts : Intensely blue , the sky 's resplendent arch Bends over all serenely ; not a cloud Mars its pure radiance ; not a shadow dims The flashing billows . The refreshing air It is a luxury to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drink in The life , the joy , the beauty of the scene . Repeller of the wild and thundering surge ! For ages has the baffled tempest howled By thee with all its fury , and piled up The massive waters like a falling tower To dash thee down ; but there thou risest yet , As calm amid the roar of storms , the shock Of waves uptorn , and hurled against thy front , As when , on summer eves , the crimsoned main , In lingering undulations , girds thee round ! O , might I stand as steadfast and as free ' Mid the fierce strife and tumult of the world , The crush of all the elements of woe ,  --  Unshaken by their terrors , looking forth With placid eye on life 's uncertain sea , Whether its waves were darkly swelling high Or dancing in the sunshine ,  --  then might frown The clouds of fate around me ! Firm in faith , Pointing serenely to that better world , Where there is peace , would I abide the storm , Unmindful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epes , 1813-1880 : THE HURRICANE 'S AMBUSCADE. from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) Look upon those clouds that lie Pillowed on the light blue sky , So translucent and serene , That they hardly dim its sheen : Look upon the glittering deep , Which the fiery sunbeams steep , Scattering on its purple floor Amethysts and golden ore ! Yet the Spirit of the storm Masks his elemental form Under this celestial smile , Nature putteth on the while ; And the day shall not be ended , Ere , with all his hosts attended , We shall see the Hurricane Ride upon this billowy plain . Heralds of his coming swift , O'er us blackest clouds shall drift ; And each foaming wave below Seem a pall half-merged in snow ; Then the loosened gale shall break , Scooping mountains for his wake , And , with island-shaking roar , Drive whole argosies ashore . But we 'll put our ship in trim , And await this tempest grim , Trusting not those tints of rose , Lured not by this smooth repose : Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail , Foundered , wrecked , or tempest-driven , Still we shall have nobly striven . Ah ! thou voyager , afloat On life 's sea , in painted boat , Crystal skies above thee bend , On thee prosperous airs attend ; But , when fortune seems securest , Then of stealthy change be surest ; And , with spirit bold and steady , For the sudden storm be ready . From the earth those vapors mount , And its moisture is their fount ; But above them , ever clear , Shines the starry hemisphere : This world 's sorrows , this world 's sighs , Weave the clouds o'er life that rise ; But , eternally above , Gleams the perfect light of love . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : A LIFE ON THE OCEAN WAVE . SET TO MUSIC BY HENRY RUSSELL . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) A life on the ocean wave , A home on the rolling deep ; Where the scattered waters rave , And the winds their revels keep ! Like an eagle caged , I pine On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flashing brine , The spray and the tempest 's roar ! Once more on the deck I stand , Of my own swift-gliding craft : Set sail ! farewell to the land ! The gale follows fair abaft . We shoot through the sparkling foam Like an ocean-bird set free ;  --  Like the ocean-bird , our home We 'll find far out on the sea . The land is no longer in view , The clouds have begun to frown ; But with a stout vessel and crew , We 'll say , Let the storm come down ! And the song of our hearts shall be , While the winds and the waters rave , A home on the rolling sea ! A life on the ocean wave ! Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : MIDSUMMER IN THE CITY . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) O RUS , QUANDO TE ASPICIAM ? I. O , ye keen breezes from the salt Atlantic , Which to the beach , where memory loves to wander , On your strong pinions waft reviving coolness , Bend your course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered to the sunshine , Did we not sport together in my boyhood , Screaming for joy amid the flashing breakers , O rude companions ? III . Then to the meadows beautiful and fragrant , Where the coy Spring beholds her earliest verdure Brighten with smiles that rugged , sea-side hamlet , How would we hasten ! IV . There under elm-trees affluent in foliage , High o'er whose summit hovered the sea-eagle , Through the hot , glaring noontide have we rested , After our gambols . V. Vainly the sailor called you from your slumber : Like a glazed pavement shone the level ocean ; While , with their snow-white canvass idly drooping , Stood the tall vessels . VI . And , when at length , exulting ye awakened , Rushed to the beach , and ploughed the liquid acres , How have I chased you through the shivered billows , In my frail shallop ! VII . Playmates , old playmates , hear my invocation ! In the close town I waste this golden summer , Where piercing cries and sounds of wheels in motion Ceaselessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon my forehead ? When shall I hear you in the elm-trees ' branches ? When shall we wrestle in the briny surges , Friends of my boyhood ? Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : MUSIC ON THE WATERS . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) Hark ! while our ship is swinging Above the ocean caves , The twilight gale is bringing Soft music o'er the waves . Ah ! from what isle of pleasure Floats the harmonious sound ? To that entrancing measure , A fairy troop might bound . Hush ! now it faints , it lingers ; Now with a peal sublime , Struck by the wind-god 's fingers , It drowns the billowy chime . The stars more brightly glisten ; The waves beneath the moon Fall down , and seem to listen , Enchanted , to the tune . Now mounting , now subsiding , It swells , it sinks , it dies ; Now on the swift breeze gliding , Over the deep it flies . So sweet and so endearing The strain , that , ere ' t is done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : THE NIGHT-STORM AT SEA . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) ' T is a dreary thing to be Tossing on the wide , wide sea , When the sun has set in clouds , And the wind sighs through the shrouds With a voice and with a tone Like a living creature 's moan . Look , how wildly swells the surge Round the black horizon 's verge ! See the giant billows rise , From the ocean to the skies , While the sea-bird wheels his flight O'er their streaming crests of white ! List ! the wind is wakening fast ; All the sky is overcast ; Lurid vapors , hurrying , trail In the pathway of the gale , As it strikes us with a shock That might rend the deep-set rock . Falls the strained and shivered mast ! Spars are scattered by the blast ; And the sails are split asunder , As a cloud is rent by thunder ; And the struggling vessel shakes , As the wild sea o'er her breaks . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark abyss ? Lo ! the full moon rears her form ' Mid the cloud-rifts of the storm , And , athwart the troubled air , Shines , like hope upon despair ! Every leaping billow gleams With the lustre of her beams , And lifts high its fiery plume Through the midnight 's parting gloom , While its scattered flakes of gold O'er the sinking deck are rolled . Father , low on bended knee , Humbled , weak , we turn to thee ; Spare us , ' mid the fearful fight Of the raging winds to-night ; Guide us o'er the threat'ning wave ; Save us ;  --  thou alone canst save ! Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : A SUMMER NOON AT SEA . from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) A holy stillness , beautiful and deep , Reigns in the air and broods upon the ocean ; The worn-out winds are quieted to sleep , And not a wave is lifted into motion . The fleecy clouds hang on the soft blue sky , Into fantastic shapes of brilliance moulded , Pillowed on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tresses interfolded . The sea-bird skims along the glassy tide , With sidelong flight and wing of glittering whiteness , Or floats upon the sea , outstretching wide A sheet of gold in the meridian brightness . Our vessel lies , unstirred by wave or blast , As she were moored to her dark shadow seeming , Her pennon twined around the tapering mast , And her loose sails like marble drapery gleaming . How , at an hour like this , the unruffled mind Partakes the quiet that is shed around us ! As if the Power that chained the impatient wind With the same fetter of repose had bound us ! Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : " FORGET ME NOT . " from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) " Forget me not ? " Ah , words of useless warning To one whose heart is henceforth memory 's shrine ! Sooner the skylark might forget the morning , Than I forget a look , a tone of thine . Sooner the sunflower might forget to waken When the first radiance lights the eastern hill , Than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they kindle , no expanding thrill . Oft , when at night the deck I 'm pacing lonely , Or when I pause to watch some fulgent star , Will Contemplation be retracing only Thy form , and fly to greet thee though afar . When storms unleashed , with fearful clangor sweeping , Drive our strained bark along the hollowed sea , When to the clouds the foam-topped waves are leaping , Even then I 'll not forget , beloved one , thee ! Thy image , in my sorrow-shaded hours , Will , like a sunburst on the waters , shine ; ' Twill be as grateful as the breath of flowers From some green island wafted o'er the brine . And O , sweet lady , when , from home departed , I count the leagues between us with a sigh ,  --  When , at the thought , perchance a tear has started , May I not dream in heart thou'rt sometimes nigh ? Ay , thou wilt , sometimes , when the wine-cup passes , And friends are gathering round in festal glee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let silent Memory pledge one health to me . Farewell ! My fatherland is disappearing Faster and faster from my baffled sight ; The winds rise wildly , and thick clouds are rearing Their ebon flags , that hasten on the night . Farewell ! The pilot leaves us ; seaward gliding , Our brave ship dashes through the foamy swell ; But Hope , forever faithful and abiding , Hears distant welcomes in this last farewell ! MISCELLANEOUS POEMS . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : GONELLO . End note : 1Kb from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) ' T was in fair Florence , in the olden time , A wight , Gonello named , was born and bred ; A famous jester , an unequalled mime , Sworn foe to dulness of the heart and head . Sunny his spirits as his own fair clime ; Mirth was his raiment , and on mirth he fed : In truth , he was a most diverting fellow ; No cross-grained sop , but  --  in short , Gonello . But Dulness holds it treason to be witty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gonello was condemned to leave the city ,  --  A hard return for such a harmless prank . Neither his jokes nor tears could gain him pity , And all his friends were busy or looked blank , When he drew near to ask them for assistance , Telling him , by their shrugs , to keep his distance . He turned away in loneliness of heart , Bestowing many a bitter gibe on those Who , because Folly feared some random dart While Wit was foraging , had grown his foes . " Dear Florence , " quoth he , " must I then depart ? O Fun and Fortune , spare me further blows ! " Was it not Vandal cruelty to pester With banishment so capital a jester ? Gonello shook the dust from off his shoes , And the ungrateful city jokeless left . One friend , please Fortune , he would never lose  --  A merry heart  --  that still remained uncleft . What should he do ? what fit employment choose ,  --  Of home , of patron , and of means bereft ? At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ferrara 's court . Thither he went to seek the situation , And urged his claims with such a comic face , That he was made , by formal installation , Prime fool and licensed jester to his grace ; And , having settled down in this vocation , He put on motley as became his place ; And thenceforth passed his precious time in joking , Punning and quizzing , revelling and smoking . His jests , unlike some jests that we might name , Had nothing in them of a mouldy savor ; But fresh , and apt , and tipped with point they came , To put grim Melancholy out of favor ; To drive Imposture to his den of shame , To scourge Pretence , and make true Merit braver : So that you granted , after you had laughed , Though Wit had feathered , Truth had barbed the shaft . The marquis held him in esteem so great , That , spite of motley wear , the jester soon Became a dabster in affairs of state , Though frowned upon by many a pompous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  A politician , honest man , buffoon ! But he was frank  --  rare trait in an adviser ; And , though a fool , no senator was wiser . And so , on rapid wing , his days flew by . What though a league of dunces might oppose ? From modest Worth he never drew the sigh , And never added to Affliction 's woes . But , ah ! securest joy , mishap is nigh ; The storm condenses while the noontide glows : The marquis failed in health  --  grew more unwell ; And , thereupon , a strange event befell . His grace 's illness was a quartan ague , Which the physicians tried in vain to cure . I hope , dear reader , it may never plague you : Doubtless ' t is quite unpleasant to endure . Should this digression seem a little vague , you Will see how hard it is a rhyme to lure , And pardon me the fault ; or , what is better , Remould the stanza , and make me your debtor . One remedy there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient 's wrath ? ' T was simply this ,  --  to take him unaware And throw him overboard , by way of bath ;  --  A liberty he might not tamely bear , But sweep the rash adventurer from his path . Since the physicians would not then apply it , Gonello secretly resolved to try it . No great regard had he for outward rank ; And as the marquis strolled with him one day , In idle mood , along the river 's bank , He pushed him over headlong from the quay ; Then , seeing him drawn out ere thrice he sank , Turned a droll somerset , and ran away ; Knowing , unless he vanished with velocity , His priceless ears might pay for the atrocity . The marquis was pulled out , all wet and dripping , Enraged at having been so vilely treated ; Albeit , indeed , the unexpected dipping Had , strange to say , his malady unseated . But still he swore , the knave should catch a whipping . In this he quickly found himself defeated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning which , his highness swore and stamped . All with responsive choler were inflamed  --  At least they said so  --  at the daring deed ; And , the next day , an edict was proclaimed , In which ' t was by authority decreed , Gonello was a traitor , who had aimed Even at his liege 's life ;  --  and so , " take heed , All ye whom it concerns , he dies , if found , Ever again , upon Ferrara ground . " Gonello read the merciless decree , Then critically conned it o'er and o'er , And pondered every syllable , to see If no equivocal intent it bore . Some subtle quirk , he thought , some jesting plea , Might help his fame and favor to restore . Yes ! he has wrested an equivocation , After hard study , from the proclamation . " ' T is only on Ferrara ground , " he said , " The penalty here threatened can befall ; On ground of friendly Padua if I tread , Do I infringe the edict ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , He went to give his grace a morning call , And crossed in motley state Ferrara 's bound , Perched on a wagon , labelled " Paduan Ground . " By this device he hoped to have evaded The clutches of the prowling men of law ; But , ah ! he did not view the thing as they did , Who stood not for entreaty or for flaw , But pulled him down , unpitied and unaided , And thrust him in a prison 's greedy maw ,  --  Assuring him that , spite of needful haste , The " affair " should be conducted in good taste . " The affair ? Ha ! what affair ? " Gonello cried ; " Can it then be I 'm under mortal ban ? Is this the way ' gainst lapses to provide ,  --  To cut the head off of the erring man ? To make the law a ruthless homicide ? Is this the wisest , most remedial plan ? If I escape this sentence of impiety , I 'll found an anti-blood-spilling society . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our own quick sense of wrong , we feel for others ; ' T is then Experience , the laggard , teaches A truth the unfeeling world too often smothers ,  --  And yet a truth which conscience ever preaches ,  --  The good of all is lodged in one poor brother 's . O ! when mankind shall feel this truth aright , No Fourier need scheme , no Taylor fight . But where 's Gonello ? To his dungeon-cell A priest has come to give him absolution . " Good father , " quoth the jester , " all is well ;  --  The spirit carries its own retribution ;  --  Yes , its own bias is its heaven or hell . But hark ! the signal for my execution ! The knell of fun ! Lead on ! Though I 'm a sinner , By this fair light , I hope to be the winner ! " There stands the scaffold  --  there the fatal block ! What crowds have gathered to the scene of blood ! Gonello bows his head , and waits the shock That shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to mock The horror of the gasping multitude ; When , lo ! the grinning minister of slaughter Dashes upon the block a pail of water ! An uproar of applauses rends the air ;  --  " Long live the marquis , and Gonello long ! ' T was a sham sentence ! O , requital fair ! And Mercy has but worn the mask of wrong ! " Thus , while rebounding joy succeeds despair , Exclaim , ' mid wild hurrahs , the hustling throng ; And Laughter treads on Grief 's receding heel , Stunning the fugitive with peal on peal . But soft ! the jester  --  why does he remain , On the uncrimsoned platform , mute and still ? Has agonizing terror stunned his brain , Or sudden gladness sent too fierce a thrill ? Faints he from rapture or excess of pain ? His heart beats not  --  his brow is pale and chill  --  Light from his eyes , heat from his limbs has fled ;  --  Jesu Maria ! he is dead  --  is dead ! Ay , the wrought spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceit that death was near , Felt the sharp steel in harmless water smite , Heard the air part as no one else could hear . Its own volition was its power of flight Above this gross , material atmosphere . A phantom axe was wielded to forestall The stroke it deemed the headsman would let fall . And so the farce became a tragedy . The moral of it you may briefly read ;  --  Carried too far , jokes practical may be Edge tools to make the meddlers ' fingers bleed . But , poor Gonello ! spendthrift child of glee ! Wit 's bounteous almoner ! ' t was hard indeed , That thou , the prime dispenser of good jokes , Should fall at last the victim of a hoax ! And yet the marquis , who had but designed Rough trick for trick , deserves our pity more ; For , from that hour of grief , his peace of mind Incurably was wounded at the core . Mirth bade his heart farewell  --  he pined and pined , As though Life held no further joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jest , And himself played his last one and his best .

In melodious numbers , that shall live With the music of the rolling spheres , Let the minstrel 's inspiration give His eulogium to the future years !

Ay , Telemachus , with swelling frame , Saw the inhuman sport renewed once more : Few were gathered there could tell his name , And a cross was all the badge he wore ; Yet , with brow elate and godlike mien , Stepped he forth upon the circling sand ; And , while all were wondering at the scene , Checked the encounter with a daring hand . " Romans ! " cried he , " let this reeking sod Never more with human blood be stained ! Let no image of the living God In unhallowed combat be profaned !

Hears he , as entranced he looks above , Strains celestial , which the menace drown ? Sees he angels , with their eyes of love , Beck'ning to him with a martyr 's crown ? Fiercer swelled the people 's angry shout ; Launched against him flew the stones like rain ; Death and terror circled him about ; But he stood and perished  --  not in vain ! Not in vain the youthful martyr fell : Then and there he crushed a bloody creed ; And his high example shall impel Future heroes to as brave a deed .

Then spoke the victor : " Now from me No mercy shall you wring , Unless , base rebel , on your knee , You cry , ' God save the king !

The work of death was done ; On the unburied slain , Through mist , red looked the sun ; The trumpet 's blare , the shout , The quick artillery 's roar , The carnage and the rout Shook the wide field no more . Surrounded by the dead , Wherever strayed his eyes , His gory steed his bed , The soldier strove to rise . Vain was the effort  --  vain ! The death-wound in his side , The ebbing blood , the pain , Life 's rallying power defied . " And must I , then , " he said , " With all my dreams of fame , Of hosts to conquest led , Perish without a name ? O , for my mother 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my true heart 's choice , For whom in death I sigh !

Love is the conqueror  --  all To woman 's love must yield ! Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : ADELAIDE 'S TRIUMPH End note : 1Kb from Songs of the sea ( 1849 ) First Part . " Adelaide , come stand beside me , Stand beside my pillowed head ;  --  From my eyes the light is fading , From my cheek the hue is fled : Let me hold thy hand so dainty , Let me touch thy silky hair ; Ringlets gray and fingers wasted With them poorly may compare . " Come , and let compassion summon Thoughts of ruth to move thy heart ,  --  Gentle thoughts , that , full of pity , Take the contrite sinner 's part ; Reverential recollections Of His words who came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of His mercy that forgave . " Where a stately stream is gliding , Near a slope of wooded ground , Rises Lord De Warrene 's mansion , Fairest of the country round : Eighteen summers have I counted , Since its widowed master brought To this roof a female infant ,  --  Here a foster-mother sought . " ' Too much care thou canst not show her , ' Said he , with a heavy sigh ; ' For to give the dear one being Did my noble lady die . ' ' Proud am I to tend thy daughter , ' Answered I with zealous tone ; But I started , on comparing That sweet infant with my own . " Child of health and matchless beauty , Born to gladden , seemed the one ; While my own poor bud lay drooping , Ere its morning was begun . Lord De Warrene left his daughter ; But an evil thought had sway In my soul , before he claimed her , Two brief summers from that day . " Do not clasp my hand so tightly ; Gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forster-mother only  --  Yes ! thou art De Warrene 's child ! In the scroll beneath my pillow , Proofs that none will question find ;  --  All I can of reparation , Dying , would I leave behind . " Wonder at the strange disclosure , Anguish at the sight of death , In the maiden 's heart contending , Seemed to battle for her breath : But a step was heard approaching , And a distant door unlatched ; Shaking off those stiffening fingers , Eagerly the scroll she snatched . When the last sad rites were ended , In that room she stood alone ; Bare the rafters , coarse the ceiling , And the floor of naked stone . And a smile of bitter meaning O'er her clouded features passed , As that treasured scroll she opened , And a look around her cast . Then she read , and finished reading , And her passion deeper grew ; To her brow the ruby mounted , From her eyes the lightning flew . " What ! " she murmured , " was I cheated Of my birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Of a stately home 's delights ? " Was I made to herd unduly With the poor and lowly-bred ; Made to join in rustic labors  --  Rise before the dawn from bed ? Was I clothed in homely raiment , Fed on plain and frugal fare , I , the Lord De Warrene 's daughter , I , the Lord De Warrene 's heir ? " Has , the while , a mere usurper  --  A discarded peasant child  --  Filled the station I was born to , And my father 's heart beguiled ? Has she been the mansion 's lady , Robed in silks with jewels rare , While the whole of my adorning Was a wild rose for my hair ? " But the hour of retribution , Long deferred , at length has come ; I will face this changeling lady , And a word shall strike her dumb : I will say to knights and servants , ' Let the low impostor be ! And your true-born , lawful lady Clad in these poor garments , see ! ' " Then to Lord De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lay the proof before him ,  --  Proof of her maternal shame ! Proudly will I wait his answer , At his feet in reverence kneel ; Then my triumph , my requital , She shall surely see and feel ! " Thus , in menaces impatient , Forth the maiden 's anger broke ; Eagerly she threw her mantle O'er her shoulders , as she spoke ; Then , accoutred for a journey , Hastened from that mean abode ; And threw back the whitewashed wicket , Opening on the dusty road . But not many steps she 'd taken , When she paused and looked behind ; There the rose-bush she had planted , There the honey-suckle twined . Do they mutely seem to chide her , That she turns in friendly quest , Gathers flowers and buds , and gives them To her lily-shaming breast ? None could now dispute her beauty , As affection lit the gloom In those eyes , whose tender beaming Fell upon her garden 's bloom . Shape , and mien , and chiselled feature , Drooping lash , and affluent hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart was something fair . But she paused a moment only ; And , when she upraised her head , Not the bough relieved from pressure Springs more buoyant than her tread . Why on yonder wooded mountain Hath she fixed her straining eyes ? Close behind that purple summit Lord De Warrene 's mansion lies . Second Part . In a parlor wide and lofty , Where the summer breezes came , Sat the lady of the mansion ,  --  Constance was the lady 's name . Covered were the walls with velvet ,  --  Blue the tint , but heavenly light ; Nailed with frequent stars , all golden , Mimicking the stars of night . And a mirror reached , broad gleaming , From the ceiling to the floor ; Set between two Gothic windows , Fronting an emblazoned door ; And a carpet , rich and downy , Toil of many a Turkish loom , Leaf and bud and flower inwoven , Lent its lustre to the room . Light the maiden 's silken labor ; Yet she quickly threw it by , And her weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender was her stature ,  --  Blue her eyes and pale her cheek , And the language of her features , Like Madonna 's , pure and meek ! As she leaned , in idle dreaming , Where the sunset breeze blew cool , Came a mingled sound of voices From the marble vestibule ; And a lackey , in attendance , Uttered words as if to chide ; While a youthful female stranger In a queenly tone replied . With her words the door was opened ; And , in humble garb arrayed , In the presence of the lady Stood a fair and panting maid : Of a long , unaided journey Shoes and raiment bore the trace ; And exertion 's humid crimson Like a wet rose made her face . With fatigue her limbs were failing , Passion had her brain o'erwrought ; And she leaned against the wainscot To recall the power of thought . " Tell me , " said the Lady Constance , " Whom , sweet maiden , would'st thou seek ? Tell me why thy breast is heaving ; Why this crimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to answer , For thou'rt weak and trembling still ; Thou shalt come and rest beside me , And instruct me at thy will . " Then , her flexile waist encircling , Constance led her to a chair , And with kerchief fine and fragrant , Wiped her cheek and forehead fair . Adelaide , in silent wonder , Every look and motion scanned ; Noted well the lady 's features , And her thin , transparent hand . She had dreamed of glances haughty , Listened for a scornful word ; But she saw an angel smiling , And an angel 's accents heard . " I 'll not chide her , " thought the maiden ; " Soft and mild shall be my tone ; For I should at least repay her With a kindness like her own . " Then , the lady 's hand uplifting , Thrice she strove to tell her tale ; Thrice her heart , the purpose stifling , On the brink made utterance fail . But she rose and looked around her , Over all that rich saloon ; Round on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festoon . And the maiden stepped elated O'er the carpet 's gay design , As the thought swelled in her bosom , " All these glittering gauds are mine ! " With that glance and that reflection Came her half-retreating mood ; And , with footstep light and hasty , She returned where Constance stood . But as words for vent were struggling , In her better nature 's spite , Suddenly a beauteous vision Rose before her wandering sight . ' T was the figure of a matron , Who with mild and saint-like grace , And all traits of mortal beauty , Seemed to gaze into her face . ' T was so lifelike that she started ; But the Lady Constance said , " ' T is a painting of my mother , Of my mother , who is dead . " " Of thy mother ? " sighed the maiden , Gazing on the picture still . " Ay , thou strange one , " answered Constance ; " Why do tears thy eyelids fill ? " " Ask not ! " Adelaide besought her ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forehead , And let tears her passion tell . " Hark ! " exclaimed the Lady Constance ,  --  " Hark ! I hear my father 's tread ! " And she glided from the parlor , While her pallid cheek grew red . Then uplooked the kneeling maiden , On that pictured face once more : " O , my mother dear , " she murmured , " Hear me , guide me , I implore ! " Well I know I may not meet thee In thy happy home above , Till each proud and selfish feeling Is cast out by perfect love ; And I fear the thoughts are evil Which within my bosom fight , For thy smile hath waked my spirit , And ' t is groping for the right . " Slender is my store of knowledge , With the poor and simple bred ; But I know we live more fully When this clog of flesh is dead ; And that God is just and gracious , Every day I feel the more : O , my mother , bid him help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Rising then , she brushed the tear-drop From her cheek 's vermilion bloom , As , with Constance , Lord De Warrene Entered hand in hand the room . Noble not in title only , But in heart and form he seemed , And the gentleness of manhood From his open features beamed . To a dim recess withdrawing , Adelaide observed him well ; Heard the fond paternal welcome From his ready lips that fell ; Marked the love-lit glance responsive In the lady 's pleading eyes : Were the twain not child and father , Theirs were even holier ties . And a struggle , brief but bitter , Shook the maiden 's inmost soul ; And from her fast-heaving bosom She half drew the fatal scroll . But the memory of her mother Came to save her on the verge ; And she hid the tell-tale parchment With her humble scarf of serge . Of a clear and steadfast purpose Now her kindling visage tells ; And the majesty of Conscience Every recreant pleading quells . Smile , ye ever watchful angels !  --  She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give not Makes her confident and calm . In his flaming bush , the martyr May a lofty courage show ; With a pure , intrepid ardor , Freedom 's chief to battle go ; But , my maiden , in the combat Of thy motives , good and bad , Thou hast shown as true a mettle , Thou as great a triumph had ! Third Part . And was this the end of trial ? Never more did pride assail ? Did her spirit , unrepining , Never waver , never quail ? Ah ! no lack of human leaven Was there in the maiden 's mould ; She could feel the charms of station , She could prize the power of gold . Goodness is no stable treasure You within the heart may lock ; Like the air , it groweth purer From the wind , the thunder-shock . All its life in action lieth ; Without evil thoughts to try , Without buffets , without sorrows , Ere maturing it would die . Handmaid to the Lady Constance Now had Adelaide become . She was slighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; And at length a noble gallant  --  How could such a gallant fail ?  --  Knelt , and , with a graceful candor , Breathed a strangely-pleasing tale . " I was sent to woo thy mistress , " Said he , with a gentle smile ; " And I might have loved her duly , Had I not seen thee the while . If , through lowly birth and station , Thus thy modest graces shine , How would'st thou adorn my household , Could I make thee wholly mine ! " Much I may not boast of riches ,  --  Mine a younger son 's estate ; And I brave a father 's anger , Asking thee to share my fate . But a loving heart I bring thee , And , wilt thou its love repay , Hands to toil for thee I offer , And a mind to win my way . " O , but then her courage tottered , And hot tears her eyelids wet , As new-springing Love with Duty In a doubtful conflict met ! How one little word could level All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained unspoken , And his proffer she denied . " Fare thee well ! " he said , and parted , Fame or fortune to pursue ; And the light that with him vanished , Often , often did she rue . Yet , upon her hours of grieving , Peace would like a dove descend , When her own true heart she questioned , And found Conscience was her friend . But a change was now impending In the maiden 's outward lot ; For her chastened soul no longer Showed the one corroding spot Bleached beneath the winds of trial , Washed by sorrow 's clearing rain , On its heavenly-shining raiment Lay no trace of earthly stain . So when use had made her happy In her self-forgetful sphere ,  --  When no sigh for earthly grandeur Wakened the regretful tear ,  --  Smitten by a mortal illness Suddenly her mistress lay ; And the maiden watched beside her , Ever fondly , night and day . But it pleased our heavenly Father , In his mercy , to dismiss Constance to a brighter region , To a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Smiling with her latest breath , " We shall meet again , my sister : A sweet summoner is Death ! " When the bell had finished tolling , And the sod had spread its green Over all of form and feature Mortal eye had ever seen ,  --  Where her flowers and birds seemed waiting In that consecrated room , Knelt the gray-haired Lord De Warrene , Knelt in solitary gloom . " O , my gentle child , " he murmured , " Can I see thy face no more ? Little did my heart conjecture , Thou so soon wouldst go before ! All my age might hope of comfort In thy fragile life was bound : Where shall now Affection wander , Where a love like thine be found ? " Trembling in each limb and fibre , Faltering as she slowly stept , Adelaide approached her father , Sank beside him as he wept ; And ere he could know her present , Or could hear her timorous tread , She had placed the scroll before him , And all eagerly he read . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; On the maiden gazed , and drew her Nearer , nearer to the light . " Child ! " he gasped , " thou bring'st a title Such as scrolls could not contain ; In that smile thy mother liveth , In that face thy rights are plain ! " And with tears of tender transport , He beheld her and embraced ; Twined his fingers in her ringlets , Each familiar charm retraced . But when came the slow conception Of her trial 's full extent , O'er and o'er again he clasped her , And with love was reverence blent . " O , how blest beyond deserving , Am I in this joy ! " he said ; " I , who questioned Heaven 's disposal , I , who deemed all comfort fled ! How hath God 's own hand repaid me The bereavement I deplore ! If he took an angel from me , ' T was a seraph to restore ! " Could another grace be added To the triumph of the maid , I might tell thee what befell her As the Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in honor and command , Came , with royal state to back them , And were suppliants for her hand ; How no hope , though e'er so distant , Could the boldest of them gain ; When , at length , a youth unnoted Sued , and did not sue in vain ! And , while belted earl and baron Smothered as they might their gall , How the rumor was repeated , He had loved her first of all . But my tale is fitly ended . We may safely trust her now . Wealth and station can not alter That serenely radiant brow . Sin may tempt and sorrow wound her , Still she 'll conquer in the strife ; And the self-denying maiden Be transcended in the wife .

By all the gods forsaken and accursed ! ' T was from Euripides  --  that feeble passage :  --  I but compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make Ajax utter Against the sons of Atreus . Tasteless blockhead ! Since thou'rt so charmed with Polymestor 's ravings , Thou shalt partake his doom . Ho ! guards ! The quarries ! There let the varlet study to distinguish Between Euripides and Dionysius . First Parasite is dragged away . SECOND PARASITE . In sooth , my liege , thy sentence was too lenient ; But ' t is thy failing  --  clemency . DIONYSIUS . Be silent ! Who asked thy comments , babbler , on my failings ? Was ever king so hedged by fleering fools ? Enter Phormio and Philoxenus . Aha ! my young Athenian ! Give you welcome ! Philoxenus , we must be better friends . Be seated , gentlemen . The feast is ready  --  Ambrosial meats  --  an intellectual feast . PHILOXENUS , ( aside . ) Would that I were an intellectual ostrich ! PHORMIO . My liege , the prisoner whom we just encountered Besought our intercession  --  DIONYSIUS . Let him pass ! Boeotia never bred a bigger ass . PHORMIO . He but entreats the priceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , We do not doubt , my liege , he 'll die content . DIONYSIUS . Bring back the culprit : tell him he is pardoned . PHORMIO , ( aside to Philoxenus . ) The invention was well-timed . PHILOXENUS , ( aside to Phormio . ) Remorseless Phormio ! Would'st thou reserve him for a crueler doom ? FIRST PARASITE , ( entering and kneeling to the King . ) My gracious master ! DIONYSIUS . Rise ! Thy wish is granted . Philoxenus , you 've never heard our " Ajax , " If I remember ? PHILOXENUS . You forget , my liege : I was a listener at the royal theatre On its first presentation . DIONYSIUS . There ' t was murdered , Unconscionably murdered by the players . The rascals ! I improved their elocution Before they quitted Syracuse . PHILOXENUS . And how ? DIONYSIUS . Cut out the tongue of every one of them . Didst ever have a tragedy performed ? Be happy , in thy inexperience , then ! More woful than the woe of Niobe Was it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strangled , torn and swallowed , By those word-butchers ! Maledictions on them ! Great Nemesis ! I let them off too lightly . FIRST PARASITE . Indeed , my liege , ' t would only have been justice To have tried the new-made engine on their limbs ;  --  That would have served them after their own fashion . DIONYSIUS . Well thought of ! But , Philoxenus , now tell me , What thought you of the play ? PHORMIO , ( aside to Philoxenus . ) For Xanthe 's sake , Be prudent now . DIONYSIUS . Which passage pleased thee best ? PHILOXENUS . The closing one , my liege . DIONYSIUS . Ay , that was fair ; But which didst think most moving ? PHILOXENUS . ' T was all moving . ( Aside . ) And yet I sat it through ! DIONYSIUS . Indeed , I 'm glad It pleased thee . PHILOXENUS . Said I that ? PHORMIO , ( aside . ) Restrain thy tongue . DIONYSIUS . How ! Pleased it not ? Speak out , Philoxenus ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender-skinned , conceited scribblers , Who , prurient for praise , recoil and smart Under the touch of blame . PHILOXENUS . That 's wise  --  that 's royal ! For , let this be admitted : the true poet Carries the consciousness of his high gift Like an impenetrable shield before him . He knows his oracles are from the gods , And , like the gods , immutable , immortal , Albeit the tardy age receive them not . What though the laugh of bigotry and hate , The taunt of scurrile infamy and falsehood , The sneer of worldly-wise expediency , Fall on his ears ? The echo is not heard In the serene seclusion of his soul ! ' T is the false prophet whom the critics reach : Never a true one by their shafts was wounded . DIONYSIUS . My thoughts , adroitly uttered ! Tell me now ,  --  Now that I know to value thy opinion ,  --  Wast thou not charmed with " Ajax " ? PHILOXENUS . Frankly , no . DIONYSIUS . Dost jest ? PHILOXENUS . The gods forbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIONYSIUS . Insolent ! Thy life  --  PHORMIO , ( to Philoxenus . ) Rash one ! Thou'rt lost ! FIRST PARASITE . Ho ! Democles and guards ! Seize on this churlish traitor . PHILOXENUS . Why , thou viper ! Art thou already warm enough to sting ? DIONYSIUS . No poet ! I no poet ! Democles ! Conduct this carping rebel to the quarries . PHILOXENUS . The quarries ! Are they always good , my liege , In such distempers ? DIONYSIUS . What distempers , sirrah ? PHILOXENUS . A sort of indigestion of the mind  --  A state in which the judgment can not stomach What 's put upon it . DIONYSIUS . Drag him from my sight ! PHILOXENUS . And wilt thou then be any more a poet ? DIONYSIUS . Away ! No words ! Now , Phormio , thou shalt hear The rest of " Ajax . " PHILOXENUS , ( to the Guards . ) Quick , quick to the quarries ! Exit with Guards . PHORMIO . My liege , he 's mad ! Forgive him ; spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closes . SCENE III . A Dungeon . Enter Philoxenus . Two Executioners , unperceived of him , follow . PHILOXENUS . Could all poor poets thus confute their critics , Dulness might drone , unpricked , among her poppies . Good sooth ! here 's room enough to criticize ,  --  And matter too ,  --  with very patient listeners . The ceiling is a thought too nigh the floor ; The architecture of a style too heavy ; A mouldy moisture hangs upon the air , If air it may be called by courtesy . A caviller might find even other faults ; But , when I think on all that I 've escaped , This dungeon smiles a welcome . Who approach ? Ah , worthy sirs ! I knew not you were present . FIRST EXECUTIONER . A merry knave ! Eh , comrade ? SECOND EXECUTIONER . ' T is a marvel To see a man smile here . Art in thy senses ? PHILOXENUS . Ay , sir , and they in me . Canst say as much ? Pardon me  --  am I right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ye not the executioners ? FIRST EXECUTIONER . The same , sir , at your service . SECOND EXECUTIONER . We shall be Better acquainted soon . PHILOXENUS . Ha ! that 's a comfort . How long have ye pursued your cheerful calling ? SECOND EXECUTIONER . More than ten years . FIRST EXECUTIONER . And I  --  let me consider ! When had we the great plague in Syracuse ? I came in with the plague . PHILOXENUS . A worthy colleague ! Well , ye must be no bunglers at your trade By this time , gentle sirs . I 'll warrant me , In bringing down an axe upon the block , Tying a noose , or nailing to the rack , Ye 've ne'er had rivals ;  --  ye can do it deftly ? FIRST EXECUTIONER . Ah ! thou may'st say it . I defy the man Can do those jobs more neatly . SECOND EXECUTIONER . Hold thy tongue ! Bah ! Thou'rt a scandal to the craft  --  a botcher ! FIRST EXECUTIONER . Dost hear the jealous rogue ? Go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXECUTIONER . When had I to strike twice At a man 's neck ? O ! thou'rt a matchless workman ! FIRST EXECUTIONER . Fellow ! I scorn thy malice . There was cause Why I should miss that aim : the light was dim . SECOND EXECUTIONER . Thy eyes , more like . FIRST EXECUTIONER . Fellow , I say thou liest ! PHILOXENUS . Nay , gentlemen , this generous strife must end . Ye both are artists  --  ' t is a pride to know you ;  --  Artists , I say  --  the first in your vocation , Though your vocation may not be the first ! Ye do abhor all tyros  --  all pretenders , Devoid of skill and genius . Yesterday , The king 's chief barber fell beneath your axe , For rashly boasting that the royal weasand Was at his mercy daily . FIRST EXECUTIONER . Marry , I Took care of him . A very pretty job ! A handsome throat he had  --  made a good mark . PHILOXENUS . Sir , spoken like an artist ! Hear me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SECOND EXECUTIONER . We could have sworn thou wast no honest man . FIRST EXECUTIONER . Did I not tell you ' t was a desperate knave ? PHILOXENUS . Well , listen to my case : your lord , the king , Though neither born nor bred to my vocation ,  --  Without that natural gift no toil can lend , Or that acquaintance study may supply ,  --  Attempts the poet 's function , and then asks My frank opinion of his verses . I Tell him I like them not : for which offence , Behold me here ! Now put it to yourselves : What had the king essayed your handicraft , And , emulous to wield the axe like you , Hacked off my head ,  --  then asked , " Was't not well done ? "  --  Would ye 've said , Ay ? FIRST EXECUTIONER . Not were he twice a king ! SECOND EXECUTIONER . No ! Each man to his trade , is still my maxim . FIRST EXECUTIONER . ' T is a shrewd knave . Well , well ; enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I like thy humor ;  --  view me as thy friend . ' Twill be thy privilege to choose the arm That is to  --  PHILOXENUS . Yes , I fully comprehend . SECOND EXECUTIONER , ( aside to Philoxenus . ) Give me the chance , and I 'll outdo myself . Thou shalt be featly dealt with ;  --  thou shalt see A marvellous nice stroke  --  no butchery , But smooth , clean , faultless headsmanship . PHILOXENUS . Good sir , How shall I show my gratitude ? Thy claims Shall be considered . FIRST EXECUTIONER , ( aside to Philoxenus . ) If your head Is to come off , consider me your man . Marry , ' twill do your heart good when you see How dexterously I 'll do it . You 'll confess That I 'm the better artist . PHILOXENUS . You o'erwhelm me . Exeunt Executioners . Well , by the gods , I hold in reverence more A skilful headsman than a charlatan ! O , ' t is the curse of every liberal art , There still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what mere daubers do we see , Who , born to guide the plough , mislead the pencil ! In music , what deluded sciolists Evoke strange discords and tormented sounds From chords which , smitten by responsive fingers , Give up the very soul of harmony ! And how art thou , divinest Poesy , Shamed and molested by the wretched herd , Who , unordained , profane thy sacred temples , And claim to utter oracles of thine , Mistaking the foul tumors of their brains For a god 's impregnation ! Scribbling fools , Innocent cheats , and facile poetasters ! O , would they quit the pen and grasp the spade , Apollo should not curse , but Flora bless ! Enter Xanthe . My child ! thy footstep was so feathery light , Methought , a moment , ' t was thy mother 's spirit , With sainted beauty , come to light my dungeon . XANTHE . Whatever doom may be for thee reserved , Behold me here to share it ! PHILOXENUS . Tremble not . I can not think the king will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To prematurely quench life 's sinking taper , Know , that it was not with a serious purpose , I 've interposed objections to the choice Of thy surrendered heart . XANTHE . Ah , do not turn My thoughts from thy great peril on myself ! Another time , those words had made me start With a too vivid joy ; but now , alas ! They bring no consolation ;  --  I should hate My own ungrateful spirit if they did . Enter Executioners . SECOND EXECUTIONER . ' T is the king 's order ;  --  we must e'en obey it . FIRST EXECUTIONER . Poor fellow ! Well , come , master ! XANTHE . Who are these ? PHILOXENUS . Command thyself  --  the executioners ! FIRST EXECUTIONER . We both are sorry for thee , master poet ; But the king 's will is final . PHILOXENUS . Do ye bear His written mandate ? SECOND EXECUTIONER . Ay , sir ; more 's the pity ! XANTHE . Away ! ye grim and lying murderers ! Ye shall hew off these limbs before ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SECOND EXECUTIONER . If you doubt it , Read for yourself . Marry , ' t is plain as daylight . PHILOXENUS , ( reading aside . ) " And let Philoxenus appear to-night At the king 's banquet . " ( Laughs . ) XANTHE . Ah , that frantic laughter ! ' T is even more terrible than tears . PHILOXENUS . A summons To attend the king ! These gentlemen , my child , Are wags in their small way . Unmannered caitiffs ! Why did ye palter with us ? FIRST EXECUTIONER . Be not angry . We gladly would have served you , master poet ; But then his majesty , you know , is wilful . PHILOXENUS . Well , I can pardon you the disappointment With all my heart . And now , good sirs , farewell ! Nay , we must tear ourselves from your embraces . Exit with Xanthe . FIRST EXECUTIONER . ' T is always thus our choicest customers Find a reprieve . SECOND EXECUTIONER . Bear up , bear up , old fellow ! Fear not the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The King 's Banquetting-Room.  --  Enter Phormio and Alastor . PHORMIO . Art thou assured the king has pardoned him ? ALASTOR . Ay , he is bidden to the evening banquet ; And , sir , as thou'rt his friend , I do implore thee Counsel him nevermore to criticize The monarch 's verses . PHORMIO . I shall venture much To shield him from imprudence . ALASTOR . Fare thee well . Exit . PHORMIO . And yet I fear , in spite of chains and dungeons , His thoughts will spurn disguise . The gods themselves Could not extort the praise his heart denied ;  --  Will he then stoop to flatter Dionysius ? Enter Philoxenus . PHILOXENUS . What ! do I see thee , Phormio , and alive ? PHORMIO . Beware ! thou'st found it somewhat hazardous To sport with tigers counterfeiting tameness ;  --  A scratch , a look may rouse the bloody instinct That marks thee for its prey  --  and so , be prudent . PHILOXENUS . I seek not this encounter . May the gods Desert me when I fawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PHORMIO . Not less Is my aversion to it ; but , alas ! We all , in a degree , are hypocrites ,  --  Always deceiving others or ourselves . Some thoughts concealed we not from our best friends , They 'd be our friends no longer ;  --  looked we closely To our own derelictions ,  --  did we not , With flattering fantasies and dear delusions , Juggle our ready hearts ,  --  we 'd soon abhor The life we cling to . PHILOXENUS . Phormio , thou hast studied Among the Sophists , and canst aptly wield The two-edged weapons of that specious school . The king approaches . PHORMIO . Now let caution rule thee In look and word . PHILOXENUS . I 'll not forget myself . Enter Dionysius , Alastor , Xanthe , Parasites , &c.; DIONYSIUS . Philoxenus , sit here at our right hand , And pledge us in this cup . PHILOXENUS . Most thankfully . DIONYSIUS . What news , Sir Poet , bring'st thou from the quarries ? PHILOXENUS . Incredible , my liege ! The headsmen languish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bitter . PHILOXENUS . The sunshine of the court shall sweeten me . DIONYSIUS . What if we had consigned thee to the block For thy unmeasured rudeness ? PHILOXENUS . There had been One man the less in Syracuse , who dared To speak the truth to all men at all times . DIONYSIUS . A prodigy at court , I do confess ! But , come : they tell me thou'st a taste proficient In poetry and art ; and here 's a passage  --  ' T is very brief  --  which above all I prize , In my great poem . Read it . PHILOXENUS , ( aside . ) Cruel fate ! PHORMIO , ( aside to Philoxenus . ) Now , if thou canst applaud not , pray be silent . Philoxenus reads in dumb show from a scroll which Dionysius hands him . Beautiful ! Is it not , Philoxenus ? ( Aside , ) Say , Yes : that little word may make thy fortune . DIONYSIUS . Do those lines please thee ? Speak , Philoxenus ! Now for thy frank opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What , ho ! guards ! The Guards come forward . PHILOXENUS , ( to the Guards . ) I pray you , lead me Back to the quarries . PHORMIO . Now thou'rt lost , indeed . FIRST PARASITE . Seize the disloyal churl ! He must not live After such insolence . SECOND PARASITE . Death to the knave ! Torture and death ! XANTHE . Ah , no , sirs ! he 's my father ! Urge not such desperate penalties . ALASTOR . The king , Kind sirs , is still a king ; he does not ask Any of your dictation . FIRST PARASITE . By the gods , I can not quietly stand by and hear My sovereign liege insulted , nor defend him . DIONYSIUS . Thy sovereign liege , fool ! can defend himself . Ye forward brawlers , leave the royal presence ! Leave Syracuse , forever ! Are ye gone ? Exeunt Parasites . And now , Philoxenus , we must devise Some punishment for thee , albeit I fear Thou'rt quite incorrigible . Since the quarries Have failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xanthe and Alastor , If tell-tale eyes speak truly , in your hearts Already are ye wedded : lo , I join Your hands in nuptial union ! There 's thy sentence , Philoxenus ! PHILOXENUS . Magnanimous avenger ! Great Dionysius ! With surprise and joy I 'm all confounded ! Why not always , thus , With clemency o'erwhelm the offender 's soul ? O , is not gratitude a sweeter draught Than vengeance ever tasted ? DIONYSIUS . Rise , my friends ! Athenian , rise ! We would not have thee think Mercy so rare a mood with Dionysius . Now , for the banquet !  --  But , a moment , stay ! Philoxenus , in truth , canst thou discern No merit in my " Ajax " ? Can I write Poetry , think you ? PHILOXENUS . No . But thou canst act it ; And that is nobler . DIONYSIUS . Then am I content . Curtain falls . Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : THE LAMPOON .
