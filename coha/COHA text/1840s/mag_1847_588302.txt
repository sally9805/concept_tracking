txt ONE of the most'dazzling and romantic scenes in the world 's history , is , doubtless , that in which the two richest and most populous empires of the American continents passed under the imperial sway of Spain , adding intense lustre to the glories o* the Spanish crown , at a moment when Charles V. was about voluntarily to resign it forever . The two continents of America exhibit evidences of the existence , at some remote period of time , of a powerful , populous , and civilized people , to whose name , numbers , condition and circumstance , neither history nor tradition have preserved the slightest clue . The solitary monuments of their industry occasionally astonish the traveller , as well amid the prairies of the northern as among the luxuriant fbrests of the southern continent ; but the profoundest research and most sagacious conjectures fail to throw light on the authors of the stupendous monuments that excite our surprise . The discoverers of the new world found here a number of nations , of greater or less degree of civilization , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two most powerful and civilized of them were fated to become the prey of fanaticism and avarice , enforced by the sword of Spanish adventurers . While the colonists of other European nations sought , in the wilds of the American continent , only a secure home , in which their industry might meet its reward and their religious scruples be unmolested , the Spanish colonists sought empire by conquest , and fate seems to have guided them where those conquests were alone feasible . The subjugation of the vast empire of the Aztecs by a handful of adventurers , impelled , perhaps , mostly by a desire to extend the influence of the cross , seemed to realize , in the greatness of the results and the apparent inadequacy of the means employed , the fabled exploits of the errant-knights of old . The thirst for adventure , which the success of Cortez rather enhanced than quenched , lived in the bosoms of Spanish soldiers , and finally resulted in the invasion and subjugation of the empire of the Incas , the only rival on the American continent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing could offer greater difficulties for authentic history , than the inroad of a few unlettered soldiers into a barbarian nation ; the fraud and violence which the conquered suffered from the invaders , and the strife of the conquerors with each other for spoil and power-spread over a series of years-make it exceedingly difficult for the judicious historian to select from the in ass of contradictory statements and highly-colored sketches ; emanating from fanaticism , folly , prejudice and pique , such facts as constitute an authentic narrative of events , themselves so marvellous as to tax our credulity to the utmost . Yet this has been performed by Mr. Prescott , under circumstances that enhance our admiration-as if a country , whose discovery and conquest had presented difficulties to be overcome greater than those which ever attended any similar enterprise-should require , even in the narration of the events , that the historian should encounter obstacles , from which the stoutest would have shrunk , unl , ess impelled by the same indomitable fire that carried his heroes to a success , made still // more glorious by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prescott relates iii his own unassuming yet touching manner " Before closing these remarks I may be permitted to add a few of a personal nature . In several foreign notices of my writings , the author has been said to be blind ; and more than once I have had the credit of having lost my sight in the composition of my first history . When I have met with such erroneous accounts , I have hastened to correct them . But the present occasion affords me the best means of doing so ; and I am the more desirous of this , as I fear some of my own remarks , in the prefaces to my former histories , have led to the mistake . " While at the University , I received an injury in one of my eyes , which deprived me of the sight ce it . The other soon after was attacked by inflammation , so severely , that for some time I lost the sight of that also ; and , though it was subsequently restored , the organ was so much disordered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since , I have been deprived of the use of it for all purposes of reading and writing for several years together . " It was during one of these periods that I received from Madrid the materials for the History of Ferdinand and Isabella , ' and in my disabled condition , with my transatlantic treasures lying around me , I was like one pining from hunger in the midst of abundance . In this state I resolved to make the ear , if possible , do the work of the eye . I procured the services of a secretary , who read to me the various authorities ; and in time I became so far familiar with the sounds of the different foreign languages ( to some of which , indeed , I had been previously accustomed by a residence abroad ) that I could comprehend his reading without much difficulty . As the reader proceeded , I dictated copious notes ; and when these had swelled to a considerable amount , they were read to me repeatedly , till I had mastered their contents sufficiently for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of reference to sustain the text . " Still another difficulty occurred in the mechanical labor of writing , which I found a severe trial to the eye . This was remedied by means of a writing-case , such as is used by the blind , which enabled me to commit my thoughts to paper without the aid of sight-serving me equally well in the dark as in the light . The characters thus formed made a near approach to hieroglyphics ; but my secretary became expert in the art of deciphering , and a fair copy-with a liberal allowance for unavoidable blunders-was transcribed for the use of the printer . I have described the process with more minuteness , as some curiosity has been repeatedly expressed in reference to my modus operandi under my privations , and the knowledge of it may be of some assistance to others in similar circumstances . " Though I was encouraged by the sensible progress of my work , it was necessarily slow . But in time the tendency to inflammation diminished , and the strength of the eye was confirmed more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could read for several hours of the day , though my labors in this way necessarily terminated with the daylight . Nor could I ever dispense with the services of a secretary , or with the writing-case ; for , contrary to the usual experience , 1 have found writing a severer trial to the eye than reading  --  a remark , however , which does not apply to the reading of a manuscript ; and to enable myself , therefore , to revise my compositions more carefully , I caused a copy of the History of Ferdinand and Isabella ' to be printed for my own inspection before it was sent to the press for publication . Such as I have described was the improved state of my health during the preparation of the Conquest of Mexico ; ' and , satisfied with being raised so nearly to a level with the rest of my species , I scarcely envied the superior good fortune of those who could prolong their studies into the evening , and the later hours of the night . " But a change has again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my eye has become gradually dimmed , while the sensibility of the nerve has been so far increased that , for several weeks of the last year , I have not opened a volume ; and through the whole time , I have not had the use of it , on an average , for more than an hour a day . Nor can I cheer myself with the delusive expectation that , impaired as the organ has become-from having been tasked probably beyond its strength , it can ever renew its youth , or be of much service to me hereafter in my literary researche3 . Whether I shall have the heart to enter , // as I had proposed , on a new and more extensive field of historical labor with these impediments , I can not say . Perhaps long hahit , and a natural desire to follow up the career which I have so long pursued , may make this in a manner necessary , as my past experience has already proved that it is practicable . " From this statement-too long* I fear , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the matter , will understand the real extent of my embarrassments in my historical pursuits . That they have not been very light will be readily admitted , when it is considered that I have had but a limited use of my eye , in its best state , and that much of the time I have been debarred from the use of it altogether . Yet the difficulties I have had to contend with are very far inferior to those which fall to the lot of a blind man . I know of no historian , now alive , who c* n claim the glory of havina overcome such obstacles but the author of La Conquete de l'An*leterre par las Normands , ' who , to use his own a and beautiful language , has made himself the friend of darkness , ' and who , to a profound philosophy , that requires no light but that from within , unites a capacity for extensive and various research that might well demand the severest apl ) licatiOfl of the student . " The materials for the history , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Royal Academy of History , at Madrid , and were collected simultaneously with those of the " Conquest of Mexico . " Manuscripts and materials have also been collected from other quarters , and altogether worked up , in the manner indicated in our author 's Preface , into one of the most splendid works of modern historians . Mr. Prescott commences with an interesting account of the extent of the Peruvian Empire ; the topography of time country the character of the people , and their condition , social , religi omis and political . We are presented with a glowing picture of a vast empire of industrious and frugal people , governed by a race of Incas , in a manner at once paternal and absolutely despotic. rhe people enjoyed plenty and ease , whiie their industry had accumulated vast national wealth . Of a warlike and sagacious character , their emperors , succeeding each other regularly and uninterruptedly during a period of four centuries , had successively extended the bounds of their empire over neighboring nations , until it absorbed all the l'acific slope of the Andes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south latitude ; yet this warlike and powerful chief , at once the supreme ruler of the nation and the object of its religious worship , while at the head of an immense army , amidst the impregnable fastnesses of his native mountains , at the zenith of his power , is suddenly seized by a Spaniard at the head of some 200 marauders , dropped as it were from the clouds , and executed ; his army dispersed ; his empire subverted ; and his people given over to the dominion of strangers forever . From amidst the variety of traditions and accounts embodied in the unreliable manner of the Spanish ecclesiastics , Mr. Prescott has sought the thread of the origin and descent of the Inca race . Tradition carries their advent back 400 years before the conquest , and some writers have given them a reign of 559 years ; but inasmuch as that all accounts agree in the reign of thirteen Inca princes before this conquest , Mr. Prescott is inclined to suppose that two and a half centuries would be nearer the truth . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social organization of Fourier more than that of most nations . The lands were held on the plan of equal division , in a manner that must excite the admiration of a National Reformer . All the lands were divided into three services . 1st . For the sun , was set apart a sufficient quantity to support the gorgeous worship of that luminary , which formed the religion of the country . 2d . A sufficient quantity* was assigned to support the Inca , his royal state , numerous kindred and household , and the wants of governinent. // All the remainder of the lands was distributed per capita among the people , who were subject to a new division every year . Every Peruvian was comp3lled to marry at a certain age ; a lot of kud was then assigned to him and his wife , and the district in which he lived furnished him a house . As his family progressed through births , an additional quantity of land was assigned him ; or if death diminished his family , his domain was curtailed in proportion . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able-bodied people . The lands of the sun were the first attended to ; this was in the nature of a church tax . Next , those of the old , the rich , the widow , the orphan , or the soldier on duty ; these were " poor rates and war taxes . " Next , every man worked his own land , and lastly those of the inca . By these means all the people were furnished with food . As under such a system there could be none destitute , so could there he none rich . The chief manufacture was the spinning and weaving of wool and cotton . All the sheep were appropriated exclusively to the sun and to the Inca , but were reared by the people . At the proper season they were all sheared , and the wool depositedin the public magazines ; from thence it was distributed among the people in quantities sufficient to clothe each family ; when that was done , cloth was to be made for the Inca according to orders . The officers appointed to attend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that each family did its share . The mines were the property of the Inca , and worked for his account ; all gold and silver were reserved for his use-money being as well unknown as unwanted . The most stupendous public works , roads , bridges and buildings , were also constructed by these people . in a manner to excite the astonishment of the beholder of their remains in the present day . Large magazines of food and clothes , consisting of the surplus proceeds of the general industry , were accumulated in all sections of the country . A solid and well-constructed stone causeway extended throughout the empire , and furnished the means of rapid communication from the most remote quarters , by means of runners , with the central government at Cusco . The mineral resources of Peru were immense , and have , since their development , had great influence upon commercial affairs throughout the world . This empire and these people , bound together by one language , one religion , and a singularly searching and inquisitive government of the most despotic form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteenth century , but were singularly ignorant of all beyond the limit of their own rule , and were totally Unkno*vn to nations that had lived and thrived within a short distance of them . Their industry had drawn large quantities of gold and silver from the mines , and accumulated , to them , more useful wealth in the public magazines . At this period the Inca Huayna Copac came to the throne . He was a warlike and capable prince , and under him the state of Quito , which already rivalled Peru in wealth and refinement , was brought under the sceptre of the Incas . In his latter days , this prince got rumors of singular strangers , endowed with strange powers , having appeared in the north , and in their superior civilization he apprehended the worst to his power . This prince had two favorite sons by different mothers , Huascar and Atahuallpa ; to the former he bequeathed Peru , and to the latter his conquest , Quito , when he died , about the year 1525 , and for the*rst time the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon quarreled , and Atahuallpa invaded Peru , defeated Huascar , imprisoned him , and slaughtered his kindred with circumstances of great atrocity , and remained master of the empire . It is remarkable that this populous country , with its warlike chief , great wealth and advanced state of society , should have been as ignorant of the // existence of a similar empire on the florthern continent , as were the Mexicans uninformed of their southern neighbors . At the time of the conquest of Mexico , central America and the islands swarmed with Spanish military adventurers , whose chief attraction was the gold with which it was supposed the new world abounded ; yet none of these had crossed the land to the Pacific . In 1511 , it is related while Balboa , the discoverer of the Southern Ocean , was weighing some gold collected from the natives , a young chief struck the scale with his fist and exclaimed , " If this is what you prize so much that you are willing to leave your homes , and risk even life itself for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink out of golden vessels , and gold is as cheap as iron is with you . " This was supposed to be the first distinct notice which the Spaniards had of Peru ; and shortly after Balboa penetrated across the isthmus and discovered the Pacifi* Here further rumors were obtained in relation to the great southern empire , and the colony of Panama was founded . This colony became the focus for adventurers , arid many expeditions were fitted out for northern discoveries , and omie ineffectually took a southern direction . Repeated disappointment had considerably blunted the credulity of adventurers , and confidence began to be less easily excited in enterprises , where expense , danger , and great hardships were certain , and success very problematical . Three men were found , however , whose indomitable spirit , great courage and experienced life , peculiarly fitted them for conquest , and they became convinced of the existence of a great southern country where gold abounded . Of these , Francisco Pizarro was the chief . He was a native of Spain ; had been from his youth up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various expeditions in the new world , and was , in 1522 , a comparatively destitute and illiterate adventurer in Panama , 51 years of age . The second was Diego de Almagro , a Spanish soldier of fortune , somewhat older than Pizarro ; and the third , Hernando de Luque , a clergyman . These three individuals united in the singular business of discovering and conquering empires . The two soldiers contributed what they had to fit out an expedition , but the priest was the capitalist , furnishing most of the funds . Almagro was , as it were , the commissary to fit out the vessels , and Pizarro the commander of the expedition . A small force of about 100 men were recruited among the desperate adventurers at Panama , and in November , 1524 , Pizarro sailed . Almagro was to follow in another vessel as soon as possible . This expedition encountered incredible hardships , and met with no success . Pizarro , after being joined by Almagro , was compelled to remain in a dangerous spot , and send the latter back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Almagro could obtain nothing further from the Governor than his sanction to the enterprise . But the associates then entered into a solemn contract , by which de Luque was to advance , in gold , 20,000 pesos , equal perhaps to $200,000 in the present day ; and the two captains were to prosecute the undertaking with due diligence , and they pledged themselves to reimburse de Luque if they failed in their contract . On these considerations ther whole proceeds of the adventure , lands , treasures , rents , vassals and emoluments of all kinds , were to be divided in equal thirds , one for each partner* This contract was signed by responsible persons on behalf of Pizarro and Almagro , neither of whom . could read or write . A new armament was then fitted out and met with but little better success . After the most incredible . hardships , and the collection of some specimens of gold from the natives , it , was decided that Almagro should again return to Panama , leaving Pizarr* with his force to await his return on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wished to return , which he refused ; and they sent secretly a letter , complaining that they were detained against their will , to // perish in the wilderness . This fell itito the hands of the Governor , who was so much incensed at the results , that so far from giving the further aid asked , he sent an officer with two vessels to order home Pizarro and his men . This officer found the adventurers in the la:t stage of destitution and misery . " Half naked , and pining with famine , there were few in that little band who did not feel the spirit of enterprise quenched within them . " Pizarro , however , received advices from his associates , that if he remained firm they could send him aid . It was then that the greatness of his soul burst forth . " Drawing his sword , he traced a line with it on the sand from east b west . Then turning towards the south , friends and comrades , ' he said , On that side are toil , hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; on this side , ease and pleasure . There lies Peru with its riches ; here Panama and its poverty . Choose each man , what best becomes a brave Castilian . Fur my part I go to the south . ' " Twelve men promptly crossed with him to abide his fortunes , the rest returned . But these thirteen were the conquerors of Peru . They remained , enduring privations for seven mouths , until the Pilot Ruiz arrived with a small vessel , but without recruits . In this vessel the voyage was prosecuted and the discovery of Peru completed . Pizarro then returned to Panama , where he was greeted by his confederates with joy ; but their means were exhausted , and the Governor refused aid . In this extremity Luque proposed that Pizarro should go to Spain , and lay the matter before the imperial government . This resulted like most such applications , in the liberal grant of title , and the right to do that which , had they possessed the means , would have been done without the government ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was styled , with the government , conferred the chief posts and commands on Pizarro , to the exclusion of his confederate Almagro ; and this led to dissensions between them , on the return of Pizarro , who en . deavored to assure Almagro that the Emperor forced them upon himself ; but the opinion is that Pizarro defrauded his companions . The difficulties were , however , healed for a time . The " capitulation " bound Pizarro to raise 5259 men , one hundred from the colonies , and sail for Panama in six months ; the government to furnish some supplies of artillery and military stores . Having signed the instruments , Pizarro visited his native town , and began to enlist men . Among the first who joined him were his four brothers , Francisco Martin , Juan , Gonzalo and Hernando , who were all very poor and very proud . Great difficulty was encountered in raising the means ; and it is said that the aid of Hernando Cortes alone perfected the contract . Ultimately Pizarro sailed with part of the armament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by his brother Hernando , with the remainder . On their arrival in Panama , the old contract was confirmed by the three confederates . After their mutual jealousies were healed , the expedition was forwarded . After raising all the recruits possible in the colonies , the force amounted to 180 men and 27 horses , in three vessels . Although well armed and equipped , one can not but smile at such a force to conquer a distant empire . The third expedition started January , 1531 , and soon came to anchor in the Bay of St. Mathews , in latitude one degree north , where they landed , and sent the vessels along the coast . The advancing Spaniards soon came to a thick settled hamlet , and stormed it at once ; the flying people leaving large quantiti* 's of gold and'precious stones in the hands of the invaders . A considerable quantity of large emeralds fell into the hands of the soldiers , who were porsuaded by one of the missionaries , Father Pedrosa , that real emeralds // could not be broken ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hammers . As they , therefore , were looked upon as of little value , the good Father was enabled to carry a large number back to Panama on his own account . The largest portion of this plunder Pizarro sent back , in order to tempt recruits by the sight of the gold . The troops then advanced with various success along the coast , and received some supplies from a vessel which arrived under the command of de Soto , who afterwards made a famous exploration of the Mississippi . Pizarro then founded the colony of San Miguel de Piura . During his stay he learned important intelligence in regard to the political condition of Peru . He ascertained the result of the conflict between the brothers ; that the victor , Atahuallpa , was encamped with his army at a distance of twelve days march , and he was somewhat startled at the accounts of the power and splendor of the victorious monarch . His force with its reinforcement amounted to 250 men ; of these , fifty were required for the new settlement , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrest his sceptre from his grasp . Yet he decided to march at once against the Inca . History scarcely presents a parallel to the boldness of this undertaking . To land in the midst of a populous country with a handful of men , and march into the interior to meet a powerful prince at the head of his army , trusting to fortune for the result , was a most desperate stake ; and yet its very audacity was probably the only means of its success . After years of toil and hardship , he staked his all upon the cast , and won . The Inca , it would seem , was curious himself to see the wonderful strangers , of whose movements his messengers kept him accurately informed , and he allured them into the heart of the country , that he might be amused with them and crush them at his leisure . They therefore encountered no opposition as they advanced , but were met by the messengers of the Inca with friendly greeting . On the fifth day 's march , Pizarro mustered 110 foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , however , that he detected signs of dissatisfaction in a few , and he determined to root it out before it spread . He therefore mustered them , and informed them that a crisis was approaching that required all their courage , and that no man should think of going forward without firmness of purpose ; that if any wished to go back they should share the lands and vassals in San Miguel , which he wished to see in a stronger state of defence , &amp;c . Nine men only accepted this remarkable offer and went back . The bold commander , who had thus weeded his corps , advanced with greater confidence . After great hardships and various vicissitudes , the little corps finally confronted the Inca . As the adventurers emerged on the eastern slope of the Andes , their eyes saw for miles in extent the white tents of the opposing troops , and the stoutest bosoms heaved more quickly at the sight . The Christian cavalcade was doubtless a matter of astonishment to the Indians . Pizarro , forming his corps into three divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caxamalca , amidst a concourse of warriors and astonished natives gazing at the strange soldiers . Here Hernando Pizarro and de Soto , as ambassadors from their coromander , had an interview with the Inca , who promised to visit Pizarro on the following day . This was the crisis of the enterprise . " Taking , then , a respectful leave of the Inca , the cavaliers rode back to Caxamalca , with many moody speculations on what they had seen-on the stale and opulence of the Indian monarch-on the strength of his military array-their excellent appointments , and the apparent discipline , in their ranks ; all arguing a much higher degree of civilization , and consequently of power , than anything they had witnessed in the lower regions of the country . As they contrasted all this with // their own diminutive force-too far advanced , as they now were , for succor to reach them-they felt that they had done rashly in throwing themselves into the midst of so frmidable an empire , and were filled with gloomy forebodings of the result . Their comrades in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not lessened as night came on ; and they beheld the watch fires of the Peruvians lighting up the sides of the mountains , and glittering in the darkness as thick , ' says one who saw them , as the stars in heaven . ' " Yet there was one bosom in that little host which was not touched with the feeling either of fear or dejection . That was Pizarro 's ; who secretly rejoiced that he had now brought matters to the issue for which he had so long panted . " After encouraging his troops , this determined man summoned his officers fl council , and laid his plan before them , which was to seize the inca on his visit , and make him prisoner in the face of his army ! It became apparent that there was no alternative . To fight , to fly , or to remain long inactive , were alike fatal ; and the plan was determined on . The Plaza , occupied by the Spaniards , " Was defended on its three sides by low ranges of buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening into the square . In these halls he stationed his cavalry in two divisions-one under his brother Hernando , and the other under De Soto . The infantry he placed in another of the buildings , reserving 20 men to act with himself as occasion migkt require . All received orders to wait , at their posts* the arrival of the Inca . After his entrance into the great square , they were still to remain under cover , till the signal was given by the discharge of a gun , when they were to cry their war cries , to rush out in a body from their covert , and putting the Peruvians to the sword , bear off the per son of the Inca . * * * " It was not long before sunset , when the van of the royal procession entered the gates of the city . First came some hundreds of the menials , employed to clear the path from every obstacle , and singing songs of triumph as they came , which , in our ears , ' says one of the conquerors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed other bodies of different ranks , and dressed in different liveries . Some wore a showy staff , checkered white and red like the squares of a chessboard ; others were clad in pure white , bearing banners or maces of silver orcopper ; and the guards , together with those in immediate attendance on the prince , were distinguished by a rich azure livery and a profusion ef gay ornaments , while the large pendants attached to the ears distinguished the Peruvian noble . " Elevated high above his vassals came the Inca Atahuallpa , borne on a sedan or open litter , on which was a sort of throne made of massive gold of inestimable value . The palanquin was lined with the richly-colored plumes of tropical birds , and studded with shining plates of gold and silver . The monarch 's attire was richer than on the preceding evening . Round his neck was suspended a collar of emeralds of uncommon size and brilliancy . His short hair was decorated with golden ornaments , and the imperial borla encircled his temples . The bearing of the Inca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked down on the multitudes below with an air of composure , like one accustomed to command . " As the leading files of the procession entered the great square , larger-says an old chronicler-than any square in Spain , they opened to the right and left for the royal retinue to pass . Every thing was conducted with admirable order . The monarch was permitted to traverse the Plaza in silence , and not a Spaniard was to be seen . When some five or six thousand of his people had entered the place , Atahuallpa halted , and turning round with an inquiring look , demanded , Where are the strangers ? ' " At this moment a Dominican friar , Father Valverde , afterwards Bishop of Cusco , coming forward with a Bible in one hand and a crucifix in the other , began to explain the principles of the Christian faith to the Inca . Atahuallpa listened patiently to the discourse , until he began to compre // bend that the drift of it was to persuade him to resign his sceptre and change his religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said he , " I am greater than any prince upon earth . Your emperor may be a great prince I do not doubt it , when I see that he has sent his subjects so far across the water ! and I am willing to hold him as a brother . As for the Pope , of whom you speak , he must be crazy to talk of giving away countries that do not belong to him . For my faith , I will not change it . Your own God , as you say , was put to death by the very men he created . But mine , ' he continued , pointing to his deity , then , alas ! sinking in glory behind the mountains , my God still lives in the heavens , and looks down on his children . ' " He then demanded of Valverde by what authority he said these things . The friar pointed to the book which he held as his authority . Atahuallpa taking it , turned over the pages a moment ; then , as the insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw it down with vehenkience. and exclaimed , Tell your comrades that they shall give me an account of their doings in my I and . I will not go from here till they have made me full satisfaction for all the wrongs they have committed . ' " The friar , openly scandalized by the indignity offered to the sacred volume , stayed only to pick it up , and hastening to Pizarro , informed him of what had been done , exclaiming , at the same time , Do you not see , that while we stand here wasting our breath in talking with this dog , full of pride as he is , the fields are filling with Indians ? . Set on at once-I absolve you . ' Pizarro saw that the hour had come . He waved a white scarf in the air , the appointed signal . The fatal gun was fired from the fortress . Then , springing into the square , the Spanish captain and his followers shouted the old war-cry of ' St. Jngo , and at them . ' It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as , rushing from the avenues of the great halls in which they were concealed , they poured into the Plaza , horse and foot , each in his own dark column , and threw themselves into the midst of the Indian crowd . " The results of this terrible onslaught , after half an hour 's hard fighting , was the slaughter of from 52,000 to 10,000 Indians , and the capture of the Inca , without the loss of a Spaniard . Thus fell the Indian empire ; for it seems to have been a consequence of the singular form of government , that the loss of the Inca totally disorganised the government as well as the army , which dispersed at once , and the conquest was in effect completed . The subsequent events , whereby the power of the Spaniards became consolidated in the country , are fraught with interest and instruction . Almost every man concerned in the scene of violence and rapine was overtaken by a just and terrible retribution , more particularly those concerned in the murder of the unfortunate Inca . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , gold and silver to the extent of $15,000,000 or $520,000,000 , about the sum recently exacted by England of the Chinese , he perished miserably by the Gerrote , a victim to the policy of his conqueror . The arrival of Almagro with large reinforcements in the camp of Pizarro , soon after the immolation of the Inca , gave the means for prosecuting the plunder of the cities . After attempting , by the installation of Manco Capac as Inca , to control the people and subject them to his will , Pizarro returned to the coast and founded the city of Lima , where he was assassinated in 1541 , nine years after the seizure of the Inca . Thenceforth the story is mostly of strife among the Spanish chiefs . A civil war between Almagro and Hernando Pizarro ended in the defeat and execution of the former , who had fallen prisoner to his old enemy ; and the return of the latter to Spain , where he was thrown into prison , and remained there twenty years , and when released lived several years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in the government of Cusco by Gonzalo Pizarro , who , expelling the incapable viceroy , Nunez , established himself in the government . Gonzalo was , however , infe // nor to his brothers in firmness of purpose and extensiveness of views , being mainly indebted to his lieutenant Carbajal for his success . Carbajal was one of the most remarkable characters drawn out by the peculiar operations of the Spaniards in that age of the world . Although a monster or ' cruelty , he wins our admiration at his undaunted courage , his great sagacity , knowledge of men , and constancy of purpose . In his early life he entered the army , and served forty years in the Italian wars , where he witnessed the capture of Francis I. at Pavia . With booty obtained at the sack of Rome , he sought the new world , and for services under Pizarro was rewarded with a grant of land in Cusco . When the Viceroy Nunez was sent out to enforce those odious ordinances , which called forth the resistance of the colonists , headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joined Gonzalo , and his determined valor , steadiness of purpose , and sagacious advice , were mainly instrumental in placing Pizarro at the head of the government . He was noted for his inexorable severity towards those who , in the continual change of parties among the Spaniards , fell in his hands , as renegades to their party . These were promptly executed . When Pizarro , on the death of the Viceroy Nunez , became master of Peru , Carbajal advised him to cast off his allegiance to Spain , marry Coya , the female representative of the Incas , and proclaim himself king . For enterprise of such a nature , Gonzalo was , however , not capable . Yet it was the only sound policy under the circumstances , standing as they did in the attitude of rebellion to the cro*vn ; but he could not divine the future with the undaunted gaze of the veteran Carbajal The Spanish government soon sent out a most able man , Pedro de Ia Gasca as viceroy , an ecclesiastic of great mind but humble deportment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the good sense of his proclamation , and having in the " king 's name a tower of strength , " he soon won over the adherents of Pizarro , who had been prepared to resist force but not argument and clemency . As soon as Carbajal read the proclamations of de Gasca and witnessed their effect , his sagacious mind rightly estimated their true position , and he counselled Pizarro to accept the terms offered him . As , however , that chief was incapable of carrying out the advices of Cabajal on a previous occasion , so was he incapable of understanding his present position , and he proceeded to arm . Meanwhile , the adherents of Pizarro , affected by the proclamation of de Gasca , deserted in scores . His gallant army , which had been organised at great expense , " melted away like the mist , " and he became bewildered by misfortune . " Carbajal , who made a jest of every thing , even the misfortunes that pinched him sharpest , when told of the desertion of his comrades , amused himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind blows the hairs off my head , mother , Two at a time it blows them away. *** Gonzalo retired into Chili , and having organized a force , he , through the exertions of Carbajal , defeated the royal forces in a great battle , at Huarino , and entered Cusco in triumph . Gasca being joined by Valdivia , one of the best captains of Peru , advanced against Pizarro , and Carbajal advised aretreat ; but Pizarro persisted in maintaining his ground , while he rejected until too late the proposal of Carbajal , to defend the bridge by which Gasca was approaching . As Gasca advanced , Pizarro had cause to distrust the fidelity of his followers ; and as the armies confronted each other , his chief officers and men began to desert in squadrons , and the army speedily disbanded without fighting . // " Pizarro , amidst the general wreck , found himself left with only a few cavaliers who disdained to fly . Stunned by the unexpected reverse of fortune , the unhappy chief could hardly comprehend his situation . What remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who still adhered to him . Fall on the enemy , since nothing else is left , ' answered the iron-hearted soldier , and die like Romans . ' Better to die like Christians , ' replied his commander ; and slowly turning his horse , he rode off in the direction of the royal army . " In this general wreck of their fortunes , Francisco de Carbajal fared no better than his chief . As he saw the soldiers deserting their posts , and going over to the enemy one after another , he coolly hummed the words of his favorite old balladThe wind blows the hairs off my head , mother ! ' " When he found himself alone , the stout old warrior attenpted to escape ; his aged horse broke down under him , and he was seized by some of his own followers , who hoped to make better terms for themselves by surrendering him ; and they hurried him off to the quarters of Gasca . The convoy was soon swelled by a number of common file from the royal army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner ; and not content with heaping reproaches and imprecations on his head , they now threatened to proceed to acts of violence , which Carbajal , far from deprecating , seemed rather to court , as the speediest way of ridding himself of life . When he approached the President 's head-quarters , Centeno , who was near , rebuked the disorderly rabble , and compelled them to give way . Carbajal on seeing this , with a respectful air demanded to whom he was indebted for this courteous protection . To which his ancient comrade replied , " Do you not know me-Diego Centeno ! " " I crave your pardon , " said the veteran sarcastically , alluding to his long flight in the Charcas and his recent defeat at Huarino ; " it is so long since I have seen anything but your back that I had forgotten your face . " Pizarro was condemned to be beheaded , and Carbajal to be drawn and quartered . " No mercy was shown him who had shown none to others . " Carbajal , when he heard his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Many visited him to upbraid him , and he indulged his caustic humor freely at their expense . One person , whose life Carbajal had formerly spared , was profuse in his professions to serve him . Carbajal cut him short , exclaiming , " and what service can you do me ? can you set me free ? if you can not do that , you can do nothing . If I spared your life , as you say , it was probably because I did not think it worth while to take it . " Some pious persons wished him to see a priest and unburthen his conscience . " But of what use would that be ? " asked Carbajal , " I have nothing that lies heavy on my conscience , unless it be , indeed , the debt of half a real to a shopkeeper in Seville , which 1 forgot to pay before leaving the country ! " Hardened as was the old soldier , he was clearly not of a nature sufficiently stern to make a banker of the present day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn by mules . When thrust into it , he exclaimed , " cradles for infants and a cradle for the old man too , it seems .

" Pizarro was shortly after beheaded , at 42 years of age , being the youngest of the Pizarros ; aiYd his death closed the fate of the remarkable family that had conquered the country , and given one of its richest jewels to the crown of Spain . Gasca , after settling the country , leaving it prosperous and tranquil , returns to Spain , and , resigning his command , retired to his episcopal functions . Thus far the history of that interesting country is brought down by the graphic pen of Mr. Prescott . The story is told in a manner more agreeable // than is usually encountered in the historic page ; and the reader is impressed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these means detailed , the Spaniards became possessed of a country of great wealth and vast importance . But , like all the rich possessions that have fallen to their lot , it was miserably misused . Its wealth was squandered ; its people oppressed ; its vast public works allowed to go to decay , and its great natural advantages utterly nejected . Peru , after three centuries of Christian rule of the Spaniards , is in a far worse condition than at the end of three centuries of the Pag n rule of the Incas . Although no accurate or approximate statement of the numbers of the people at the time of the conquest has been given , yet such data as have been handed down show that the population has been frightfully diminished . Probably the whole population , at present 1,500,000 , is not one-tenth of the number under the last of the Incas . The chief causes of the depopulation have been the massacres by the Spaniards , suicides of the natives to escape the horrible oppression to which they have been exposed , the deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the natives beyond their strength , smallpox , scarlet fever , &amp;c . The mita has been supposed to have swept off four times as many as all the other causes together . ts abolition , of late years , has already produced recuperative effects on the population . For two hundred years the Indians submitted with exemplary patience to the horrible tyranny of their oppressors . In 1780 a more oppressive exaction of taxes roused a general opposition , which , headed by Tupac Amaru , threatened seriously the Spanish power , and might have succeeded , but for the treachery of an Indian , who betrayed the chief into the power of the Spaniards , and without a leader the Indians dispersed . This war resulted , however , in the abolition of a most oppressive tax . When the Spanish war of Independence took place , the natives fought oc*asionally on the side of the patriots , but had no clear idea of the objects of the war . Its effects were to supply them arms and teach them their use , and also the manufacture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The time is now fast approaching when the miserable Spanish race will be scourged from the country they have so long cursed with their presence , and the descendants of the ancient Incas will , after a lapse of three centuries , resume the sway of their fathers . It has only been the diminution of the numbers of the Indians that has thus far saved the Spaniards ; and , therefore , in some sense , their very tyranny has been the means of prolonging it . According to a late traveller , Dr. Von Tschudi , and other authorities , nothing can be more deplorable , in a physical or moral sense , than the present condition of the Spanish population of Peru . The population of Lima , in 1842 , is given at 53,000 , divided into five classes:lst . White Creoles , 20,000 ; 2d . Indians , 5,300 ; 3d . Mixed races , Negroes , &amp;c. , 24,000 ; 4th . Slaves , 4,700 ; 5th . Ecclesiastics , 900 . Dr. Tschudi gives nineteen different heads of the mixed races , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look upon the Indians as " brutes . " The white creoles are an effeminate , idle race , and exist there , apparently , but on the sufferance of the Indians . Events are now tran5* ) iring in Mexico which will terminate Spanish dominion there forever ; and we may hope that Peruvian disenthralinent will follow Mexican emancipation in at least as short a period as its subjugation followed the conquests of Cortez , three hundred years since.
