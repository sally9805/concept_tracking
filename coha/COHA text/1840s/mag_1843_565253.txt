txt Ir was the intention of the divine founder of our faith , that Christianity should have a universal adaptation to the wants and circumstances of mankind ; and that it should actually be diffused throughout all nations , and he perpetuated to the latest periods of the world . To give it such an adaptation , He embodied in its system of doctrine and of duty , those great essential truths and principles which apply to man as man , whenever and wherever he is found . Hence , the reverse of Judaism , which was national and local , Christianity does really commend itself to the moral feelings and convictions of univer sal humanity ; and thus , in its own nature , tends to the subversion of all other schemes , to the overthrow of infidelity itself , and to the establishment of its own authority in the hearts of the whole human race . But this moral fitness , and consequent diffusive tendency of the religion of the gospel , by no means supersedes the necessity of instrumental agencies in order to secure its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its claims , where it has been received , upon the consciences of men . And admirable is the wisdom with which the author of Christianity has made perpetual provision for this neces // sity in the institution of the church , with her ordinances and ministry . He has thus , in a moral sense , established a standing army , with ample resources and the requisite discipline and officers , commissioned to overturn the empire of sin and error on the earth , and charged to prosecute the enterprise , until a complete victory has been achieved . The ministry , under the divinely constituted system of human instrumentality , holds , it is obvious , a prominent and most important place . It is a part of the economy so essential , that very much in proportion as it performs its functions well or ill , will the working of the whole be successful or embarrassed . Whatever has a bearing on the right discharge of ministerial duty , must be regarded as of the first importance by all who desire the prosperity of true religion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , the more rapid may we expect will be the coming of the divine kingdom . In suggesting some thoughts in relation to the position and duties of the Christina ministry at the present time , we shall have special reference to our own country ; in which , in its peculiar duties , it is independent of the civil power , and must always owe its influence to the fidelity with which it fulfills its divine commission . *Te shall confine ourselves to what is peculiar in the position which the Christian ministry occupies at the present time . Of those particulars in which it holds essentially the same attitude from age to age , we shall have no occasion to take notice . The ministry , while it is a permanent and divinely instituted order in the church of God , and in this respect can know no change , is also , as to its position , related to the times in which it is called to exercise its functions . The circumstances of one age demand in it a cast of character and a mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; since the condition and the movements of the human mind in one generation are often widely different , perhaps the very opposite , from what they were in the generation which preceded . And no one can go forth as a herald of the cross , with enlightened views of what he has to do , until he has Tightly understood how the general duties of his office require to be modified in view of the existing aspects and tendencies of society . Let us first look at the present position of the ministry as affected by the condition of the popular intellect . That our times are marked with strong peculiarities in this respect , is an obvious fact . We need not make the empty boast that ours is the golden age , or flatter ourselves that wisdom was born with us . We claim only what we concede to every former period , when we assert that ours has an intellectual condition which is distinctively its own . Whether , upon the whole , we are wiser or less wise than the generations which have lived before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other ages have witnessed the triumph of human genius , in arts , letters , and philosophy . The page of history exhibits no lack of ill ustrious names . The libraries in which the treasures of wisdom which enrwhed other periods of the world are garnered up , afford abundant and convincing proof that thinking men have lived before us . Yet that there is at the present day a universality of education , a general diffusion of the means of intellectual gratification and improvement , and an activity of the common mind , such as the world has never seen before , is universally conceded . It is not now the few who are well informed and the many who are ignorant , but exactly the reverse . It is not certain selected parts of knowledge merely , which are now deemed of interest to the people . // Almost all really important branches , on the contrary , are made extensively accessible to every class . Intelligence is continually poured from the fountain-heads into a thousand channels , which wind their way throughout society , affording liberal supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe their superiority to others , not to any secrets which are kept within their order ; not to any stores which are accessible only to them ; but simply to their more thorough and vigorous self-discipline , more patient study , and more extensive and diligent research . From this state of things two consequences result , which intimately concern the Christian minister as officially a public teacher . The first is , that the popular taste is rendered in a high degree fastidious . The task of presenting truth in such a manner as to command attention and awaken interest , becomes extremely difficult . The hungry man will regale himself on plain substantial food ; but he who has a rich variety of delicacies at his command , and who has also fixed the habit of luxurious living , must tempt his appetite with savory dishes . Even so the hungry mind will feast on solid truth , and with the keener sense because of its simplicity . But the mind that has before it a thousand intellectual dainties , and that has lost its healthfulness of tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for simpler and more wholesome banquets , and can enjoy only what is highly spiced with wit , anecdote , or fancy . Human invention , it would seem , has done its utmost , not only to supply the means of intellectual gratification , but also to ad.apt them to the wants , and even to the caprices of all classes . It has wrought history into gorgeous fictions , and thrown the attractive drapery of fiction around history . It has imparted the life and grace of poetry to the com* mon and prosaic , and heightened the effect of the poetical by the richest grouping and coloring of the imagination . It has gathered materials from nature and from art ; from science and from philosophy ; from the deep inworkings of the human soul , and from the high endeavors and noble deeds of goodness ; and even from the waywardness of evil passion , and the desperate misdoings of villainy itself . And hence there are few whose minds are not continually supplied with something which can stimulate the mental appetite however languid , and please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but natural , that those who are thus pampered should be destitute of relish for plain and sober themes , where passionate expressions and startling paradox would be wholly out of place . The other of the two consequences mentioned as resulting from the present intellectual state of the popular mind , is a conceited , self-sufficient spirit . If in all past time the diffusion of the means of knowledge had been general , it might not now have been attended with this incidental evil . But it is something new , and the fact that the great mass of society find themselves in possession of advantages which have not hitherto been generally enjoyed ; that they know something on various subjects which in other days were confined exclusively to the learned ; and that the way is open for them to make still more extensive acquisitions if they will , begets feelings of superiority and self-esteem ; for men are generally far more ready to value themselves on what they know than to be humbled at the thought of their remaining ignorance . It is not in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-exalting temper betrays itself . There is something sophornorical in the general spirit of society . Men are pleased with their own intelhigence and sagacity , and in no way // distinguished for the old fashioned virtue of meekness and docility of mind . Some are so jealous of their mental independence , that in their desire to evince it , they often show that they want the virtue altogether . Some are so much afraid of pinning their faith upon authority , and taking opinions upon trust , that they dare not rely on the word of God himself , nor yield belief to evidence which is perfectly conclusive . The imaginations of some are haunted with the fear of priestly domination , and they persuade themselves that ministers consent to stand in the place of the servant of servants , to he hard worked and poorly paid , to he brought to anearly grave by incessant anxieties and cares , and to leave their families without provision to the charities of the world , and look for reward only in heaven , just for the pleasure of managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who think better of the hearts of the clergy than of their heads , are sure that they would be a very useful sort of persons , if they would only listen to the good advice which they , in their wisdom , kindly offer to impart . It is true that , notwithstanding the prevalence of this over nice and self-sufficient temper , there are examples , and many such , of sound and healthful intellect , and of candor and humility , those attributes of real greatness . But the Christian minister must count on finding the general state of the popular mind , such as has been described . And how shall he operate on such materials ? How can he so adapt himself to those for whom he is sent to labor , as to make his influence reach them ? The task is difficult ; yet unless he can accomplish it , his care and toil are lost . If he can not gain a hearing , inspire confidence , and command respect for himself and for his message , it is nothing that his doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dili gent . The ends of his ministry are not attained . It is vain to complain of the existing state of things . It is worse than vain to disregard it , and to proceed as though it were the reverse of what it is . It will not do to say , as some lazy preachers have done , that hearers oug/i.t not to heed so much the style of the discourse , and the manner of the speaker . The simple fact is , that if the experiment were made , of preaching the noble sermons of President Edwards , of Howe , or even of Barrow himself , to the best New England congregation , such is the popular taste , that the house would probably soon exhibit an array of empty pews . Nor will a discourse of Massillon or Saurin , or the most finished and tasteful modern sermon that can be found , fare greatly better , if delivered in tame , monotonous , and unimpassioned tones . However it may have been in other days , there must at present , be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render preaching really efficient . Shall then the preacher aim to suit the whims of a capricious taste ? Shall he trim , to please the captious , and take lessons of the self-complacent ? Shall he labor to transform the simple dignity of truth into the dazzling brilliancy of Bulwer , the quaint and startling affectations of Carlyle , or the gorgeousness of Chateaubriand and Lamartine ? Shall he give eclat to his address , by employing the flourish and trick of the declaimer ? These things he can not attempt to do , unless false to his high commission ; and the attempt were certainly a fail ure. there is a better method of accomplishing what he desires . It is possible , notwithstanding the peculiar state of the general mind , to preach the gospel with success . But he who would be a successful preacher , must bring into the pulpit vigorous and well trained faculties . He must have a versatility which can adapt // itself to all emergencies . He must have the resources which belong only to the diligent , habitual , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastery of truth , and powers of argument and illustration , which will enable him to exhibit even what is difficult , in full and bold relief . Lie must have a facility of language , which gives appropriateness and ease to all he says . He must have an iaward fire , which is the glow of a really impassioned soul ; and such capacity of voice and of expression , as shall enable him to do justice to his own thoughts and feelings . In short , he must make it felt , that he performs the duties of his office with the ability of a master . This will place him , in a certain sense , above the reach of criticism . Intelligence will regard him with respect ; conceit before him will keep silence . And that he may bring such qualifications to his work , the preacher will find it absolutely necessary to subject himself to a vigorous and habitual self-discipline . Without this , he can not be more than partially successful ; he may altogether fail . If he concludes that , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ministerial office , he has no more to do but exercise his gift , whatever it may be , he mistakes his course entirely . If he would meet the demands which will be made upon him , he must be found each week making some specific effort to be more thoroughly furnished and endowed . He must regard every public service , as special occasions are wont to he regarded , as demanding his very best endeavors . The days are past , in which one might devote the week to farming , and preach Matthew Henry or Thomas Scott upon the Sabbath . He who attempts to do it , or something like it now , may be expected soon to want a parish , and to have a long pursuit . But we must pass to another point . Society has a temperament as well as an intellect . Let us look then , in the next place , at the position of the Christian ministry as affected by the present state of the social temperament . By the temperament of society , we mean its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this susceptibility is now intense beyond a precedent . There may have been times , in the past history of the world , when the mass of society felt as keenly and as readily , on some two or three great subjects ; but there certainly have been none , when on every subject they were so exquisitely sensitive . The controversies and agitations of past ages , have been chiefly confined to the higher classes . When the lower have been moved at all , it has been passively , by the will of those above them . Kings and cabinets have settled national polities . Doctors have disagreed about points of philosophy , of ethics , or of science . And councils and conclaves have settled ecclesiastical disputes , and cut the Gordian knots of vexed polemics . But now , the slightest agitation in relation to any of these matters , reaches with its vibrations the remotest ramifications of the social system . The irritability is in every part extreme . The public heart palpitates and flutters , and its pulsations are intermittent and irregular . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of a man who starts at the opening of a door , or the shaking of a window . A simpleton , if he pleases , by some odd and unlooked for movement , may throw it into hysterics or convulsions . Or to change the style of illustration , its aspect is like the ever-changing surface of the ocean in a gusty day ; here a spot is smooth , and there the fitful flaw stirs the dark ripple in its path ; and there the riotous whirlwind rolls up the white foam and spray . // Nor are there wanting influences , to work incessantly upon all the sensibilities of the public mind . The freedom and activity of thought which generally prevail , are from time to time bringing almost all the great principles of truth into discussion . Old opinions , and venerated customs , are earnestly assailed , and as earnestly defended . Novelties in fancy or in fact , are broached in infinite series . Abuses are exposed , where they exist ; and not unfrequently , perhaps , where they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , however , in most instances , fail in the experiment . Little men are striving to be great men , and great men striving to be greater ; the strife , of course , producing crimination and recrimination , and the stirring up of passion , in the collision of sympathizing partisans . The press , too often perverting its freedom into licentiousness , is assailing private character , appealing to popular prejudice , making the worse appear the better reason , and scattering firebrands , arrows , and death , abroad on every side . And thus there is always something to prevent the general agitation from subsiding into repose . Of course the Christian minister must take his stand in the midst of this commotion . He is himself to act upon the sensibilities of the public mind , and their condition must materially affect him . The necessary prominence of his station , at once enables him to see what is going on around him , and exposes him to feel even more than others , the violence of each blast of popular excitement . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their side . One presses him in this directon , and another urges him towards that . This man is ready to denounce him , if he adopt this sentiment or measure , and that if he shall choose the opposite . He is too radical for some , and too con Vol . I. 44 servative for others ; and perhaps is guilty of the unpardonable sin of having some opinions of his own . All popular agitators , indeed , with their disciples , are earnest champions of the liberty of thought and speech ; but by this , each means the liberty to think and speak as he does ; and if any chance to understand the matter differently , they are soon made sensible of their mistake . Of course it often happens that the Christian minister is made an offender , for a word . Much is imagined , where nothing at all was meant . When he discourses in singleness of mind on one subject , he is fancied to be obliquely hinting at another . When he offers to some one a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he finds that the morbid sensitiveness of the receiver , has converted them into nettles , wherewith he has been stung . And so he is made to feel the necessity of being wise as a serpent , though with the best disposition , he finds it impossible to be harmless as a dove . What then is the duty of the ministry , in relation to this peculiar state of the public temperament ? We can not , of course , prescribe particular rules , which will distinctly define his duty on all occasions . But certain attainments may be specified , which are essential to a proper acquittal of himself ; and which if he should possess , he can not greatly err . These are , in brief , a truly Christian spirit , the guidance of the Holy Spirit , and a manly independence . The Christian minister is a man , and to him as well as others , pertain human imperfections and infirmities . He will , therefore , often keenly feel the irritating influences , in the midst of which he moves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fretted , by what he sees of the mischiefs of popular excitement , and the asperities of party feeling . When he finds himself // assailed by the advocates of this measure or of that ; when he is charged with culpable indifference , because he is not fired with furious zeal ; when his best motives are misjudged , and his best deeds misrepresented ; and , finally , when he is compelled to see those for whose welfare he is anxious , driven on by impulse , from one absurdity to another , with the conviction that no influence of his , nothing but a bitter personal experience , can bring them to their senses ; then must he possess , in large measure , the meek , patient , forbearing , gentle spirit of his Master , or he will become querulous in temper , hasty in his words , and rash in his course of action . But if he has the spirit of Christthe pure , peaceful , heavenly spirit , which gives such divinity to the sermon on the mount , he may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect in the deep blue of the heavens , however fiercely the tempests howl and rage , because it is far above their reach . Nor will any human wisdom be found sufficient , in the perpetual changes of popular feeling , and the ebb and flow of popular excitement , to determine , in all cases , what is the path of duty . The most prudent and conscientious minister , may often find himself at fault . He may find himself unexpectedly thrown into new and strange positions ; where , after looking carefully around him , he fears to move , lest by a mistaken step , he should do an injury to the cause , which he has it in his heart to serve . He that would go safely , then , must draw continually from the eternal fountain ; must seek and find that indwelling and illumination of the Spirit of God , which can guide the soul into perfect truth . And that he may find , as well as seek , he must ask in honesty and singleness of mind . He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias from prejudice or self-will . He must ask with a humble , open , waiting soul , ready to be led in this direction or in that ; and not form his purpose first , and then ask counsel from above . If he thus applies to the source of light , he will have a light to guide him ; and it will not be the flitting meteor blaze of unintelligent impulse , or of casual suggestion , by which fanatics are misled ; but a serene and steady radiance , let in upon the mind from heaven , which illumines the understanding and the conscience , and by which the course of duty is clearly and intelligently discerned . And not less obvious is the necessity that the Christian minister , in the midst of so many conflicting elements , should have that manly selfreliance , which , while it is perfectly compatible with true humility produces energy of purpose , and promptness of decision . An age of special instability and agitation , demands that its posts of influence be *filled by men of special firmness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winds of contention roar , and the waves of tumult are heaved up ; who will have the courage calmly to follow their convictions , at all hazards , and to smile at clamor and reproach , in the faithful performance of their duty . One such man-one who can stand and bear in silence , or if he deem that course expedient , is able to Ride on the whirlwind , and direct the storm , ' is worth a host of timid , weak , and ever-hesitating spirits , whose position can never be defined , for the simple reason that they never stand still long enough to make it possible ! He will make his influence felt , and it will be conservative in the highest and best sense . He will be , in no unimportant measure , a regulator , a moral balance-wheel , to the disordered and unsteady movements of society . While he who attempts to meet the views and wishes of all sorts of people , instead of // placing before him duty as his first great ob ect , may bestow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will certainly learn the truth of the ancient stanza , which , whether a gem of Sternhold , or some kindred worthy , deserves to be remembered : " Whoso wonid all men please , And not himself offend ; Most enter on his work straiglitway , Bot heaven knows when he 'll end ! " We have thus far spoken with reference to the condition and spirit of the general mind . Let us now turn to the present state of educated mind , with special regard to theological education and opinion . Let us see how the peculiarities which mark our day , in this respect , affect the position and duties of the ministry . There has been for the last half century , among minds of the highest order , a constant and unwonted striving to press beyond the conventional boundaries of human knowledge . A variety of causes have led to this result . One of the first great benefits of the revival of learning , was the subversion of the ancient systems of philosophy . The learned thus set free from leading-strings , were inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a right direction to this spirit , and the most astonishing discoveries followed in nearly all the great departments of natural science . The master minds of the seventeenth century , as if put in possession of a magic key , laid open mysteries , which few , if any , had ever dreamed it possible to penetrate . Success gave impulse to inquiry . The disclosure of so many new and interesting truths , imparted fresh activity to mind . The learned pressed their way into the field of metaphysics , eager to accomplish there what had been achieved by the students of external nature . The two opposing systems of Locke and Leibnitz , the one denying , and the other affirming the doctrine of innate ideas , were discussed , and variously modified , and divided between them the assent of most philosophical inquirers . In the latter part of the eighteenth century , came Kant , with the transcendental doctrines , arid was followed in Germany by Fichte , Schelling , Hegel , and others , who sought to improve the system of Kant , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commencement of the present century , there has been a constant conflict of opposing systems . Speculative philosophy has engaged the most powerful minds , and called forth the most earnest controversy . Analysis has been pushed to the very utmost , and conjecture has employed its highest ingenuity . Until a recent date , Germany has been the chief battle-field . The doctrines of Locke , as modified by his Scotch disciples , have had the ascendency in England and among ourselves ; although in both countries , there has been no want of original inquiry in ethical and mental science . But the labors of German scholars in various other departments , and especially in those connected with theology , have been too valuable to remain unknown or unappropriated by the learned in other lands . And since , in our own country , theological education has attained to a good measure of cornpleteness , by means of well organized theological institutions , the floodgates of German thought have been opened upon us , and we are fast becoming familiar not only with their elaborate criticism and exegesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their general literature , with their plausible but soulless rationalism , and with the immeasurable depths of their transcendental , mystical , and pantheistic speculations . From this and some concurring causes , there has been , of late , a very general breaking up of established modes of thought , and a questioning of commonly received opin // ions on the philosophy of mind , of morals , and of Christian doctrine . In many respects , this process , doubtless , has been salutary . It has helped to place the defense of important principles and truths on surer grounds , and to cause them to be more accurately stated , and cautiously applied . And without doubt , it has done something to urge on scholars to greater earnestness of study . But some ill-balanced minds , bewildered amidst the deep and awful shadows of the transcendental labyrinth , have been led off into the most absurd and foolish vagaries . They have become wiser than the writers of the holy Scriptures . As Prometheus stole fire from the sun of nature , they fancy themselves to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in their superfluity of wisdom , they have put the Deity out of his own universe , and attempted an apotheosis of themselves . Infidelity , in their hands , has all the sacrilegious daring , without the coarseness and vulgarity with which it appears in the writings of the school of Paine . It speaks with eloquence and taste . It hypocritically assumes the Christian name , and even arrogates to itself the authority of the Christian pulpit . It affects an obscure and ambiguous diction , by means of which it employs the words of truth to convey the most dangerous falsehoods . It interests the imagination by its air of mystery , and by a kind of Gothic impressiveness of style . It is , in short , Satan transformed , as far as possible , into an angel of light . Now it is plain that this unsettled , scrutinizing , and speculative disposition , and this new phasis of infidelity among the minds of the higher order , may exert an influence most disastrous to the moral and religious interests of society . The Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests with sleepless vigilance , have ur gent duties in relation to the matter . They may not look on quietly , and see errors most deadly in their character , sent forth from the high places of instruction , to exert their mischievous influence in the subversion of the faith of common minds . They must meet this , as they have met other forms of infidelity , and of false and dangerous doctrine . It must be shown to all who are concerned to know , that infidelity arraying itself in gorgeous robes , and pretending to a vast superiority in respect to elevation of views and inward illumination , and affecting entire contempt of such as are willing to be taught of God , is the same shallow , arrogant , sophistical , and disingenuous enemy of truth and goodness , that it has been , in its old and familiar forn*s . Some have supposed that it might be expedient to arrest the incoming tide of German literature ; or at least to exorcise the evil spirit with which no small portion of it is possessed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions . But to arrest it , is beyond our power , were this desirable . The times are gone , in which thought might be restricted by set bounds . And as to a lustration of our schools , were it a practicable measure , it could hardly be deemed a safe or wise one . If the Christian ministry , as a body , are to meet the exigency of their position ; if they are to stand firm amidst the incessant conflict of opinion , and to be qualified to grapple with the new and peculiar forms of error which appear , they have need to examine thoroughly not merely the foundations of the truth , but also the false philosophy , the unsound criticism , and the disingenuous reasonings , by which the truth has been perverted . They are under the same necessity of knowing what Gesenius , Ernesti , Michaclis , or Eichorn teach , which is subversive of sound doctrine , as they have been before , of understanding the // views of Hume , Bolingbroke , or Paine . And the student of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious teachers , and with a knowledge beforehand of the points on which his authors are heretical , can not endure the trial to which his faith is subjected , in the study of the works of German scholars , can be but poorly fitted for the many greater trials by which his constancy is certain to be tested . Wisdom requires , that since we have it in our power , we should furnish ourselves with armor from the arsenal of the enemy ; and if in our search , we find that he has poisoned arrows in his quiver , we shall be able to lift up the voice of warning for the benefit of those who are in danger . And while they thus equip themselves for the work of exposing false opinions , the ministry have need to be more skillful and diligent than ever , in the communication of religious truth . Truth is the antidote of error , and rarely fails to be effec*tual , when faithfully administered . The times demand the most thorough and harmonious enforcement of the great doctrines of the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent improvements in theological education , there is a great deficiency of judicious doctrinal instruction in the pulpits of our country , especially of New England . We have carefully examined the history of what are by some regarded as the palmier days of New England 's orthodoxy ; and we are confident that there are now to be found in her evangelical pulpits , a greater number of sound , discriminating , faithful preachers , in proportion to the whole , than could ever have been reckoned at any former period . We can not but think , therefore , that they who are continually asking " wherefore the former days were better than these , inquire not wisely concerning this. ** Their language of complaint has a tendency to impair the confidence of the churches in those who are set over them , and greatly to weaken the hands of the strong men who are standing for the truth . But while we think it a duty to say this , we also say , our aim must rise still higher ; that there is need of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition of gospel doctrine from the pulpit . The clergy , and especially the younger clergy , are called upon to possess themselves more fully of first principles ; and so skillfully to illustrate and apply them , that their hearers may be firmly rooted and grounded in the faith . Then the ministry will be able to preserve those who are committed to their trust , even from the most fascinating and imposing forms of error ; so far , at least , as this result can be secured by human care and agency . There is one more view remaining , in which the position and duties of the ministry deserve to be considered . Those who are called to fill the sacred office at the present time , have some peculiar responsibilities imposed upon them , by the moral circumstances of the church . We will not here speak of these circumstances in detail . It will be sufficient to observe in general , that in some of her sections , the church is afflicted with unhappy controversies and divisions , at the same time that she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not refer to the differences which exist , and always have existed , between the evangelical and nonevangelical portions of the nominal church ; but to those which generate strife and alienation between such as recognize each other as true disciples of the true Redeemer . Questions more or less important , are in warm debate . Party spirit is enkindled , and party weapons not always the most honorable , are employed . Good men , in their opposition to what they sincerely deem each other 's errors , // give too convincing proof that they at least have not attained perfection . And many such like things appear , which dim the glory of the church , and impair her moral vigor . Yet , notwithstanding this , with some right views of her high calling , she is actually engaged against the power of a nominal and corrupt Christianity , and of all the forms of pagan superstition , in a mighty struggle for the universal triumph of the cross . On either side , there is a rallying of forces for the strife . One can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gathering of the nations to the battle of the great day of God Almighty , the event of which will be the millennial triumph of the saints . Popery , recoverinti in a measure her weakened energies , has gained some new advantages , and seems likely to gain yet others for a time . She is employing all her arts , taking advantage of every opportunity , and it is probable that her recovery to pure Christianity , will be a work of greater difficulty , than the conversion of the heathen world itself . The ministers of Christ , are the divinely constituted leaders of the church . Her circumstances , therefore , being such , they plainly have two great duties to perform . It is incumbent on them , first , by the exercise of a truly liberal and catholic spirit ; of a magnanimous forbearance ; in a word , of the divine temper of the gospel , to soften asperities , and give at least a spiritual unity to the Christian host . And then , with the prudence , skill , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conflict , to bring all its forces into action , and to keep them manfully engaged . To meet these obligations , is not an easy task . It can only be accomplished by a deep bathing of the soul in heaven 's own element of love , and by the all-inspiring power of living faith . The Christian mm ister who means to approve himself to God , will keep himself aloof , as far as practicable , from needless and unholy strife . While he stands firmly for essential truth , he will kindly accord to others the freedom of thought , which he feels it his own right to exercise . He will be urged to support this leader , or to lend his influence to that . But he will choose rather to call no man master . He will ask for truth , upon his knees , and listen to the voice of God 's own oracle , that never can mislead . And in the seasons of his calm and holy musings , when his heart yearns in silence after truth , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her angel pinions , and withdrawing the veil with which she conceals her face from the vulgar gaze , will permit him to feast* his soul with the contemplation of her celestial beauty . 0 then he will be as though a breath of heaven had been breathed upon his soul . He will loathe the clamor of contentious words , and the din of discord , begotten by selfishness , or pride , or vain ambition . And though it cost him incessant watchfulness and care , he will preserve his equanimity , and shed around him the sweet influences of peace . In the discharge of official duties , as one divinely commissioned to go before the church in her spiritual conflicts , the faithful minister will find it needful to devote his highest powers and richest acquisitions , and to stir up in his bosom a zeal that can not tire . As he looks abroad upon a dying world , he will feel that no enterprises are so noble ns those that look to its redemption from its bondage . He will be willing to stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the humblest labor , if this great work may thus be carried forward . His own private wishes or concerns , will seem of small account , in comparison with the great and glorious interests of God 's kingdom among // men If the strong holds of Satan are to be carried by assault , he will be anxious to he found foremost in the breach ; if to be reduced by the tediousness of siege , to be the last who will be ready to despond . Such are the ministers imperatively demanded by the present attitude of the Christian church , in relation to the world ; men who are guileless , pure , and lamb-like in their spirit , but who in action , are lion-hearted and invincible . To those who are already in the ministerial office , and to those who expect ere long to enter it , the views which we have taken of some of the more prominent circumstances which , at the present moment , are materially affecting the position and duties of the ministry , are views of serious interest . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing notice . They are unworthy of the sacred office , who , while they bear , or expect to bear , its high responsibilities , are not anxious to obtain definite and comprehensive views both of its general and ordinary , and of its specific and extraordinary duties . They are guilty of presumption , who offer themselves as leaders of the sacramental host , in the conflict between truth and error , holiness and sin , without a thorough knowledge of the battle-ground ; of the strength , position , and probable movements of the enemy ; and of the proper methods of directing the weapons of attack , or of maintaining the position of defense . Yes ! the Christian minister who would labor in the blessed office to which God bath called him , with eminent success , must at once study well his relative responsibilities , and live for the one great purpose , of meeting them in a becoming manner . He must learn wisely to adapt himself in his course of official labor , to the existing condition of the world and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual , and prudential qualifications . The work is great ; and human power and wisdom , alas ! how insufficient ! Yet there is no occasion to despair . The Lord himself is with his servants . Let them but be faithful to themselves , and to their trust , and he will guide them where they doubt ; he will sustain them when their hearts are fainting ; he will refresh them in their severest labors , with his presence and his smiles . If any are ready to deem the toil required too great , let such remember that the day of rest is near . In a few days , even such as are yet in the freshness of their youth , will have put off the robes of mortal toil , and have gone to their repose . The labors , cares , and strifes of earth , will have been exchanged for the sweet serenity of heaven , and the eternal fellowship of the redeemed . Sacrifices and exertions will be richly overpaid , and never more remembered . They will then forever rejoice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regret only that they were not more intensely devoted to the work of turning many to righteousness.
