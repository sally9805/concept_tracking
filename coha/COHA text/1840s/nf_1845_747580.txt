txt The purposes , whatever they may be , for which a deliberative assembly of any kind is constituted , can only be effected by ascertaining the sense or will of the assembly , in reference to the several subjects submitted to it , and by embodying that sense or will in an intelligible , authentic , and authoritative form . To do this , it is necessary , in the first place , that the assembly should be properly constituted and organized ; and , secondly , that it should conduct its proceedings according to certain rules , and agreeably to certain forms , which experience has shown to be the best adapted to the purpose . 2 . Some deliberative assemblies , especially those which consist of permanently established bodies , such as municipal and other /z/ 10 Parliamentary Practice . corporations , are usually constituted and organized , at least in part , in virtue of certain legal provisions ; while others of an occasional or temporary character , such as conventions and political meetings , constitute and organize themselves on their assembling together for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual and convenient mode of organizing a deliberative assembly is the following : The members being assembled together , in the place , and at the time , appointed for their meeting , one of them , addressing himself to the others , requests them to come to order ; the members thereupon seating themselves , and giving their attention to him , he suggests the propriety and necessity of their being organized before proceeding to business , and requests the members to nominate some person to act as chairman of the meeting ; a name or names being thereupon mentioned , he declares that such a person ( whose name was first heard by him ) is nominated for chairman , and puts a question that the person so named be requested to take the chair . If this question should be decided in the negative , another nomination is then to be called for , and a question put upon the name Organization , 11 mentioned ( being that of some other person ) as before ; and so on until a choice is effected . When a chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same manner to complete the organization of the assembly , by the choice of a secretary and such other officers , if an ' , as may be deemed necessary . 4 . An organization thus effected may be , and frequently ' is , sufficient for all the purposes of the meeting ; but if , for any reason , it is desired to have a greater number of officers , or to have them selected with more deliberation , it is the practice to organize temporarily , in the manner above mentioned , and then to refer the subject of a permanent organization , and the selection of persons to be nominated for the several offices , to a committee ; upon whose report the meeting proceeds to organize itself conformably thereto , or in such other manner as it thinks proper . 5 . The presiding officer is usually denominated the president and the recording officer the secretat'y ; though sometimes these officers are designated respectivel ' as the chairman and clerk . It is not unusual , besides a president , to have one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence 12 Parliamentary Practice , of the president from the assembly , or when he withdraws from the chair to take part in the proceedings as a member , but who at other times , though occupying seats with the president , act merely as members . It is frequently the case , also , that several persons are appointed secretaries , in which case the first named is considered as the principal ofiScer . All the officers are ordinarily members of the assembly ' , and , as such , entitled to participate in the proceedings ; except that the presiding officer does not usually engage in the debate , and votes only when the assembly is equally divided . 6 . In all deliberative assemblies , the members of which are chosen or appointed to represent others , it is necessary , before proceeding to business , to ascertain who are duly elected and returned as members ; in order not only that no person may be admitted to participate in the proceedings who is not regularly authorized to do so , but also that a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly and its officers . In legislative bodies , the clerk is seldom or never a member , and iu some the presiding oilloer is not a member ; as , for example , in the Senate of the United States , the Senate of New York , and in some other State Senates . Returns and Elections . 13 7 . The proper time for this investigation is after the temporarj ' and before the permanent organization , or when the assembly is permanently organized , in the first instance , before it proceeds to the transaction of any other business ; and the mpst convenient mode of conducting it is by the appointment of a committee to receive and report upon the credentials of the members . The same committee may also be charged with the investigation of rival claims , where any such are presented . 8 . When a question arises , involving the right of a member to his seat , such member is entitled to be heard on the question , and he is then to withdraw from the assembly until it is decided ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remains in his place during the discussion , he ought neither to take any further part in it , nor to vote when the question is proposed ; it being a fundamental rule of all deliberative assemblies , that those members whose rights as such are not yet set aside constitute a judicial tribunal to decide upon the cases of those whose rights of membership are called in question . Care should always be taken , therefore , in the selection of the officers , and in the appointment of committees , to name 14 Parliamentary Practice . only those persons whose rights as members are not objected to . 9 . The place where an assembly is held being in its possession , and rightfully appropriated to its use , no person is entitled to be present therein but hy the consent of the assemblj- ; and consequently if anj- person refuse to withdraw when ordered to do so , or conduct himself in a disorderly or improper manner , the assembly may unquestionably employ sufficient force to remove such person from the meeting . 10 . Every deliberative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constituted , does thereby necessarilj ' adopt and become subject to those rules and forms of proceeding , without which it would be impossible for it to accomplish the purposes of its creation . It is perfectly competent , however , for every such body  --  and where the business is of considerable interest and importance , or likel ' to require some time for its accomplishment , it is not unusual  --  to adopt also certain special rules for the regulation of its proceedings . Where this is the case , these latter supersede the ordinarj ' parliamentary rules in reference to all points to which they relate , or add to Rules of Proceeding , 15 them in those particulars in reference to which there is no parliamentary rule ; leaving what maj ' be called the common parliamentarj law in full force in all other respects . 10 a . The author clearly does not intend here to be understood as asserting that there is a code of rules known as parliamentary law , which is in force with the binding effect of municipal law , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , is subjected as a matter of course unless it is superseded by the express action of the assembly . I think the author has clearly expressed in other parts of the Manual , and intends to be understood as holding , that every deliberative assemblj ' , excepting in so far as it is controlled by the organic law by which it exists or by the public law , is entirely the master of its own rules of procedure . It submits itself by voluntary assent , if at all , to the ordinaiy rules of parliamentary practice ; and , whenever by mistake or by voluntary assent those rules are departed fVom , such mistake or departure does by no means vitiate the fair expression of the will of the assembly which has been reached .  --  Ed. 11 . The rules of parliamentary proceedings 16 Parliamentary Practice . in this country are derived from , and essentially the same with , those of the British Parliament ; though , in order to adapt these rules to the circumstances and wants of our legislative assemblies , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied , and in others , again , extended beyond their original intention . To these rules , each legislative assembly is accustomed to add a code of its own , by which , in conjunction with the former , its proceedings are regulated . The rules thus adopted by the several legislative assemblies having been renewed in successive legislatures ,  --  with such extensions , modifications , and additions as have been from time to time thought necessary ,  --  the result is , that a system of parliamentary rules has been established in each State , different in some particulars from those of every other State , but yet founded in and embracing all the essential rules of the common parliamentary law . 12 . The rules of proceeding in each State being , of course , best known to the citizens of that State , it has sometimes happened in deliberative assemblies , that the proceedings have been conducted not merely according to Making of Propositions . 17 the general parliamentary law , but also in conformity with the peculiar system of the State in which the assembh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , however , is erroneous ; as no occasional assembly can ever be subject to any other rules than those which are of general application , or which it specially adopts for its own government ; and the rules adopted and practised upon b ' ' a legislative assembly do not thereby acquire the character of general laws . 13 . The judgment , opinion , sense , or will of a deliberative assembly , is expressed , according to the nature of the subject , either bj a resolution , order , or vote . When it commands , it is by an order ; but facts , principles , its own opinions or purposes , are most properl ' expressed in the form of a resolution ; the term vote msiy be applied to the result of every question decided by the assembly . In whatever form , however , a question is proposed , or by whatever name it maj " be called , the mode of proceeding is the same . 14 . The judgment or will of any number of persons considered as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or agreement of the greater number of them ; 18 Parliamentary Practice . and the only mode by which this can be ascertained , in reference to an ' particular subject , is for some one of them to begin by submitting to the others a proposition expressed in such a form of words , that , if assented to b ' the requisite number , it will purport to express the judgment or will of the assembly . This proposition will then form a basis for the furtlier proceedings of the assembly ; to be assented to , rejected , or modified , according as it expresses or not , or maj ' be made to express , the sense of a majority of the members . The different proceedings which take place from the first submission of a proposition , through all the changes it may undergo , until the final decision of the assembly upon it , constitute the subject of the rules of debate and proceeding in deliberative assemblies . 15 . If the proceedings of a deliberative assembly were confined to the making of propositions by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the votes of the assembly , there would be very little occasion for rules in such a body . But this is not the case . The functions of the members are not limited to giving an affirmative or negative Mahing of Propositions . 19 to such questions as are proposed to them . When a proposition is made , if it be not agreed to or rejected at once , the assembly may be unwilling to consider and act upon it at all ; or it may wish to postpone the consideration of the subject to a future time ; or it may be willing to adopt the proposition with certain modifications ; or lastl , approving the subject-matter , but finding it presented in so crude , imperfect , or objectionable a form , that it can not in that state be considered at all , the assembly may desire to have the proposition further examined and digested before being presented . In order to enable the assembly to take whichever of the courses above indicated it msi , y think proper , and then to dispose of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of question have been invented , which are perfectly adapted for the puipose , and are in common use in all deliberative assemblies . 20 Parliamentary/ Practice . /z/ 16 . Before entering upon the subject of the forms and rules of proceeding in the transaction of business , it will be convenient to consider certain matters of a preliminarj nature , which are more or less essential to the regularity , despatch , and efficiency of the proceedings . Section I. Quorum . 17 . In all councils , and other collective bodies of the same kind , it is necessary that a certain number , called a quorum , of the members , should meet and be present , in order to the transaction of business . This regulation has been deemed essential , to secure fairness of proceeding , and to prevent matters from being concluded in a hasty manner , or agreed to by so small a number of the members as not to command a due and proper respect . 18 . The number necessary to constitute a quorum of any assembly maj be fixed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case with most of our legislative assemblies ; or by usage , as in the English House of Commons ; or it may be fixed by the assembly itself : but if no rule is established on the subject , in any of these ways , a majority of the members composing the assembly is the requisite number . 19 . No business can regularly be entered upon until a quorum is present ; nor can any business be regularlj- proceeded with when it appears that the members present are reduced below that number : consequently the presiding officer ought not to take the chair until the proper number is ascertained to be present ; and if at any time , in the course of the proceedings , notice is taken that a quorum is not present , and , upon the members being counted by the presiding officer , such appears to be the fact , the assembly must be immediately adjourned . Sect . II . Rules and Orders . 20 . Every deliberative assembly , as has already been observed , is , by the fact alone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without which it could not accomplish the purposes of its creation . It may also pro- 22 Parliamentary Practice , vide rules for itself , either in the form of a general code established beforehand , or by the adoption from time to time , during its sitting , of such special rules as it ma ' find necessar ' . 21 . When a code of rules is adopted beforehand , it is usual also to provide therein as to the mode in which the may be amended , repealed , or dispensed with . Where there is no provision , it will be competent for the assembly to act at any time , and in the usual manner , upon questions of amendment or repeal ; but in reference to dispensing with a rule or suspending it , in a particular case , if there is no express provision on the subject , it seems that it can only be done by general consent . The terms " general consent , ' * as used in parliamentary practice , denote the unanimous opinion of the assembly when their opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote . Whenever , therefore , it is said that the general consent of the assembly is necessar ' to the adoption of any measure , it is to be understood , that , if the question is proposed informall ' , no objection must be made to it , or that , if proposed in a formal manner , the vote in its favor must be unanimous . Principle of Decision . 23 22 . When any of the rules adopted b* the assembly or in force , relative to its manner of proceeding , is disregarded or infringed , every member has the right to take notice thereof , and to require that the presiding officer , or an ' other whose duty it is , shall carry such rule into execution ; and in that case the rule must be enforced at once , without debate or delay . It is then too late to alter , repeal , or suspend the rule : so long as any one member insists upon its execution , it must be enforced . Sect . III . Time of Meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish its business at one sitting will find it convenient to come to some order or resolution beforehand , as to the time of re-assembling after an adjournment ; it being generally embarrassing to fix upon the hour for this purpose at the time when the sitting is about to close , and in connection with the motion to adjourn . Sect . IV . Principle op Decision . 24 . The principle upon which the decisions of all aggregate bodies , such as councils , corporations , and deliberative assemblies , are made , 24 Parliamentary Practice . is that of the majority of votes , or suffrages ; and this rule holds not only in reference to questions and subjects which admit only of an affirmative on one side and a negative on the other , but also in reference to elections in which more than two persons may receive the suffrages. 25 . But this rule may be controlled by a special rule in reference to some particular subject or question ; by which any less number than a majority may be admitted , or any greater number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus it is frequently provided , in legislative assemblies , that one- third or one-fourth only of the members shall be sufficient to require the taking of a question by yeas and najs ; and , on the other hand , that no alteration shall take place in any of the rules and orders , without the consent of at least two-thirds , or even a larger number . Of the Officers . 25 /z/ 26 . The usual and necessary officers of a deliberative assembly are those already mentioned , namely , a presiding and a recording officer ; both of whom are elected or appointed by the assembly itself , and removable at its pleasure . These officers are always to be elected by absolute majorities , even in those States in which elections are usually effected by a plurality ; for the reason , that , being removable at the pleasure of the assembly , if any number short of a majority were to elect , a person elected b ' any such less number would not be able to retain his office for a moment ; inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question made for that purpose , by the votes of those who had voted for other persons on the election ; and it is essential to the due and satisfactory performance of the functions of these officers , that they should possess the confidence of the assembly , which the ' can not be said to do unless they have the suffrages of at least a majority . 26 i Parliamentary Practice . 26 a . This rule of electing the presiding officer by a major vote has in some cases been changed by express legislation , especially in the matter of the election of moderators of town meetings , in regard to which , in some of the States , by express law such officers are elected by a pluralit-.  --  Ed . Section I. The Presiding Officer . 27 . The principal duties of this officer are the following :  --  To open the sitting at the time to which the assembly is adjourned , by taking the chair , and calling the members to order ; To announce the business before the assembly , in the order in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and submit , in the proper manner , all motions and propositions presented by the members ; To put to vote all questions which are regularl ' moved , or necessarily arise in the course of the proceedings , and to announce the result ; To restrain Ihe members , when engaged in debate , within the rules of order ; To enforce on ' all occasions the observance of order and decorum among the members ; Presiding Officer . 27 To receive all messages and other communications , and announce them to the assembly ; To authenticate , b ' his signature , when necessary , ail the acts , orders , and proceedings of the assembly ; To inform the assembly , when necessary or when referred to for the purpose , in a point of order or practice ; To name the members ( when directed to do BO in a particular case , or when it is made a part of his general dut ' b ' a rule ) who are to serve on committees ; and , in general , To represent and stand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things obeying implicitly its commands . 28 . If the assembly ' is organized by the choice of a president and vice-presidents , it is the duty of one of the latter to take the chair in case of the absence of the president from the assembly , or of his withdrawing from the chair for the purpose of participating in the proceedings . 29 . Where but one presiding officer is appointed in the first instance , his place can only be supplied , in case of his absence , by the appointment of a president or chairman pro tempore ; and in the choice of this officer , 28 Parliamentary Practice . who ought to be elected before any other business is done , it is the duty of the secretary to conduct the proceedings . 30 .. The presiding officer may read sitting , but should rise to state a motion , or put a question to the assembly . Sect . II . The RECORDiNa Officer . 31 . The principal duties of this officer consist in taking notes of all the proceedings , and in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done and past* ' in the assembty ; but he is not , in general , required to tjike* minutes of " particular men 's speeches , " of to make entries of things merel ' proposed or moved without coming to a vote . He is to enter what is done and past , but not what is said or moved . This is the rule inlegislative assemblies . In others , though the spirit of the rule ought to be observed , it is generally expected of the secretary , that his record shall be both a journal , and in some sort a report , of the proceedings . 32 . It is also the duty of the secretary to read all papers , &c.,; which may be ordered to be read ; to call the roll of the assembl3% and take note of those who are absent , when a Secretary or Clerk . 29 call is ordered ; to call the roll , and note the answers of the members , when a question is taken b ' yeas and nays ; to notify committees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to authenticate by his signature ( sometimes alone and sometimes in conjunction with the president ) all the acts , orders , and proceedings of the assembly ' . 33 . The clerk is also charged with the custody of all the papers and documents of every description , belonging to the assembly , as well as the journal of its proceedings , and iiB to let none of them be taken from the table by any member or other person , without the leave or order of the assembly . 34 . When but a single secretary or clerk is appointed , his place can only be supplied , during- his absence , by the appointment of some one to act pro tempore . When several persons are appointed , this inconvenience is not likelj ' to occur . 35 . The clerk should stand while reading , or calling the assembly . 30 Parliamentary Practice . /z/ 36 . The rights and duties of the members of a deliberative assembly , as regards one another , are founded in and derived from the principle of their absolute equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , has the same right with every other , to submit his propositions to the assembly , to explain and recommend them in discussion , and to have them patiently examined and deliberately decided upon b- the assembly ' ; and , on the other hand , it is the dut of every one so to conduct himself , both in debate and in his general deportment in the assembly , as not to obstruct any other member in the enjoyment of his equal rights . The rights and duties of the members require to be explained only in reference to words spoken in debate ( whether spoken of a member or otherwise ) and to general deportment . The first will be most conveniently noticed /z/ Deportment of Members . 31 in the chapter on debate ; the other will be considered in this place . 37 . The observance of decorum by the members of a deliberative assembly is not onl ' due to themselves and to one another as gentlemen assembled together to deliberate on matters of common importance and interest , but is also essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . The rules on this subject , though generall laid down with reference to decorum in debate , are equally applicable whether the assembly be at the time engaged in debate , or not ; and therefore it may be stated generally , that no member is to disturb another or the assembly ' itself by hissing , coughing , or spitting ; by speaking or whispering to other members ; by standing up to the interruption of others ; by passing between the presiding officer and a member speaking ; going across the assembly-room , or walking up and down in it ; taking books or papers from the table , or writing there . 38 . All these breaches of decorum are doubtless aggravated by being committed while the assembly is engaged in debate , though equally contrary to the rules of propriety under 32 Parliamentary Practice . any other circumstances . Assaults b ' one member upon another , threats , challenges , affrays , &c.,; are also high breaches of decorum . 39 . It is also a breach of decorum for a member to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove from one place to another with his hat on , or to put his hat on in coming in or removing or until he has taken his seat ; and in many assemblies , especially those which consist of a small number of members , it is not the custom to have the head covered at all . 40i In all instances of irregular and disorderly deportment , it is competent for every member , and is the special duty of the presiding officer , to complain to the assembly , or to take nctice of the offence , and call the attention of the assembly to it . When a complaint of this kind is made by the presiding officer , he is said to name the member offending ; that is , he declares to the assembly that such a member , calling him by name , is guilty of certain irregular or improper conduct . The member who is thus charged with an offence against the assembly is entitled to be heard in his place in exculpation , and is then to withdraw . Being withdrawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence committed , and the assembly proceeds to consider of the degree and amount of punishment to be inflicted . The assembly may allow the member complained of to remain , when he offers to withdraw ; or , on the other hand , it may require him to withdraw , if he do not offer to do so of his own accord . The proceedings are similar when the complaint is made b ' a member , except that the offence is stated by such member , instead of being stated by the presiding officer . 41 . No member ought to be present in the assembly when any matter or business concerning himself is debating ; nor , if present b " the indulgence of the assembly ought he to vote on any such question . Whether the matter in question concern his private interest , or relate to his conduct as a member ,  --  as for a breach of order , or for matter arising in debate ,  --  as soon as it is fairly before the assembly , the member is to be heard in exculpation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , notwithstanding , a member should remain in the assembly , and vote , his vote may and ought to be disallowed ; it being contrary not only to the laws of decencj ' , but 34 Parliamentary Practice . to the fVindamental principle of the social compact , that a man should sit and act as a judge in his own case . 42 . The only punishments which can be inflicted upon its members , by a deliberative assembly of the kind now under consideration , consist of reprimanding , exclusion from the assembly , a prohibition to speak or vote for a specified time , and expulsion ; to which are to be added such other forms of punishment , as by apology , begging pardon , &c.,; as the assembly may see fit to impose , and to require the offender to submit to on pain of expulsion . Introduction of Business . 85 /z/ 43 . The proceedings of a deliberative assembly , in reference to any particular subject , are ordinarily set in motion , in the first instance , by some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , or himself submitting a proposition to the assembty. 44 . Communications made to the assembly are of two kinds ; namely , those which are merel " for its information in matters of fact , and those which contain a request for some action on the part of the assembly , either of a general nature or for the benefit of an individual . The latter only , as they alone constitute a foundation for future proceedings , require to be noticed . 46 . Propositions made by members are drawn up and introduced , by motion , in the form which they are intended by the mover to bear , as ordera , resolutions , or votes , if they should be adopted by the assembly . These propositions , of whatever nature they may be , 86 Parliamentary Practice . are usually denominated motions until they are adopted ; they then take the name which properly belongs to them . 46 . When a member has occasion to make an ' communication whatever to the assembly ,  --  whether to present a petition or other paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , or merely to make a verbal statement ,  --  as well as when one desires to address the assembly in debate , he must in the first place , as the expression is , " obtain the floor ' * for the purpose he has in view . In order to do this , he must rise in his place , and , standing uncovered , address himself to the presiding officer by his title ; the latter , on hearing himself thus addressed , calls to the member b ' his name ; and the member may then , but not before , proceed with his business . 47 . If two or more members rise and address themselves to the presiding officer at the same time , or nearly so , he should give the floor to the member whose voice he first heard . If his 1 In the House of Beprentatlves of Massachusetts , where each member 's seat is regularly assigned to him and numbered , it has been found useful , in deciding upon the claims of several competitors for the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member who addresses the speaker from the area , the passage-ways , or the seat of any other member . Obtaining the Floor . 37 decision should not be satisfactory , any member may call it in question , saying that , in his opinion , such a member ( not the one named ) was first up ; and have the sense of the assembly taken thereon , as to which of the members should be heard . In this case , the question should be first taken upon the name of the member announced by the presiding officer ; and , if this question should be decided in the negative , then upon the name of the member for whom the floor was claimed in opposition to him . 48 . The mode of proceeding upon such communications from persons not members , as are above alluded to , may be explained by that adopted on the presentation of a petition which may be considered as the representative of the whole class to which it belongs . 49 . A petition , in order to be received , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hand , either by name or mark , except in case of inability from sickness , or because the petitioner is attending in person ; and should be presented or offered , not by the petitioner himself , but by some member to whom it is intrusted for that purpose . 88 Parliamentary Practice . 50 . The member who present43 a petition should previously have informed himself of its contents , so as to be able to state the substance of it on offering it to the assembly , and also to be prepared to say , if any question should be made , that in his judgment it is couched in proper language , and contains nothing intentionally disrespectful to the assembly . 51 . Being thus prepared , the member rises in his place , with the petition in his hand , and informs the assembly that he has a certain petition , stating the substance of it , which he thereupon presents or offers to the assembly , and at the same time moves ( which , however , may be done by any other member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the question is put , whether the assembly will receive the petition or not . This is the regular course of proceeding ; but in practice there is seldom any question made on receiving a petition ; the presiding officer usually taking it for granted that there is no objection to the reception , unless it be stated . If , however , any objection is made to a petition before it has been otherwise disposed of , the presiding officer ought to retrace his steps , and JPresentinff a Petition . 39 require a motion of reception to be regularly made and seconded . When a petition has been received , the next step in the proceedings is the reading of it by the clerk , for the information of the assembly , which though in the usual course of business , and not likely to be objected to after the petition has been received , is nevertheless the subject of a motion and question , to be regularly submitted to the assembly , and voted upon ; and , until a petition has been read , no order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lying on the table . 52 . If the question of reception is determined in the affirmative , the petition is brought up to the table by the member presenting it , and is there read as of course by the clerk . It is then regularly before the assembly , to be dealt with as it thinks proper ; the usual course being either to proceed to consider the subject of it immediatel or to assign some future time for its consideration , or to order it to lie on the table for the examination and consideration of the members individually . 53 . Whenever a member introduces a proposition of his own , for the consideration of the 40 Parliamentary Practice . assembly , be puts it into the form be desires it should have , and then moves that it be adopted as the resolution , order , or vote of the assembly . If this proposition so far meets the ap probation of other members that one of them rises in his place , and seconds it , it may then be put to the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes the judgment of the assembly . 54 . A motion must be submitted in writing : otherwise the presiding officer will be justified in refusing to receive it ; he may do so , however , if he pleases , and is willing to take the tiwible himself to reduce it to writing . This rule extends only to principal motions , which when adopted become the act , and express the sense , of the assembly ; but not to subsidiary or incidental motions , which merely enable the assembly to dispose of the former in the manner it desires , and which are always in the same form . In the case of a motion to amend , which is a subsidiary motion , the rule admits of an exception , so far as regards the insertion of additional words , which , as well as the principal motion , must be in writing . 1 Such as , to adjourn , lie on the table , for the previous quet* tion , for postpouemeiit , conuuitment , &o.; Making a Motion . 41 55 . A motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some one member , at least , expressing his approval by rising , and saying that he seconds the motion ; and , if a motion be not seconded , no notice whatever is to be taken of it by the presiding officer , though in practice very many motions , particularly those which occur in the ordinary routine of business , are admittedithout being seconded . This rule applies as well to subsidiary as principal motions . The seconding of a motion seems to be required , on the ground that the time of the assembly ought not to be taken up by a question which , for any thing that appears , has no one in its favor but the mover . There are some apparent exceptions to this rule , which will be stated hereafter , in those cases in which one member alone has the right of instituting or giving direction to a particular proceeding ; and an actual exception is sometimes made by a special rule , requiring certain motions to be seconded by more than one member . An exception to the general rule requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed with , or to execute , or to enforce , an oi-der of the assembly ; as , for ex- 42 Parliamentary Practice . ample , when it is moved to proceed with an order of the day , or when a member suggests or calls for the enforcement of some order relating to the observance of decorum , or the regularity of proceeding . Thus , in the House of Commons , a single member may require the enforcement of the standing order for the exclusion of strangers ; and so , when the second or other reading%f a bill is made the order for a particular day , a motion on that day to read the bill according to the order need not be seconded . 56 . When a motion has been made and seconded , it is then to be stated by the presiding officer to the assembly , and thus becomes a question for its decision ; and , until so stated , it is not in order for any other motion to be made , or for any member to speak to it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , a motion is in the possession of the assembly , and can not be withdrawn by the mover , but by special leave of the assembly , which must be obtained by a motion made and seconded as in other cases . * The principle stated must not be understood to preclude all proceeding with or allusion to a motion until it has been stated from Motion Made and Stated . 43 the chair . On the contrary , after a motion has been made , or made and seconded , but not yet proposed as a question , it is competent for the mover to withdraw or modify it , either of himself , or on the suggestion of some other member or of the presiding officer , and without any motion or vote for the purpose . The rule only requires , that , until a motion is regularly seconded and stated , it should not be spoken to as a question for the decision of the assembly , or be made the subject of any motion or proceeding as such . Whilst , therefore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purposes alluded to , with reference to motions not yet stated , he should be careful to check and prevent all observations which may tend to excite debate ; it being a general rule , that no debate can be allowed to take place on any subject , unless there is a question pending at the time . 57 . When a motion is regularly before the assembly , it is the duty of the presiding officer to state it if it be not in writing , or to cause it to be read if it be , as often as any member desires to have it stated or read for bis information . 44 Parliamentary Practice . 58 . When a motion or proposition is regularly before the assembly , no other motion can be received , unless it be one which is previous , I in its nature , to the question under consideration , and consequently entitled to take its place for the time being , and be first decided . Of Motions in Greneral. 45 /z/ 59- When a proposition is made to a deliberative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a form as to be put to the question , and the assembly may be in such a state as to be willing to come to a decision upon it at once ; and , when this is the case , nothing more can be necessarj than to take the votes of the members , and ascertain the result . But a different state of things may , and commonly does , exist ; the assembly may prefer some other course of proceeding to an immediate decision of the question in the form in which it is presented ; and , as it is proper that every parliamentary body should have the means of fitly disposing of every proposition which ma ' be made to it , certain forms of question have from time to time been invented , and are now in general use , for that purpose . These forms of question may properly be called subsidiary , in order to distinguish them from the principal motion or question to which they relate . 46 Parliamentary Practice , 60 . The different states of mind in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the corresponding forms of proceeding , or subsidiary motions to which they give rise , in order to ascertain the sense of the assembly , are the following :  --  Firsts The assembly may look upon the proposition as useless or inexpedient , and may therefore desire to suppress it either for a time or altogether . The subsidiary motions for this purpose are the previous question and indefinite postponement . Second The assembly may be willing to entertain and consider of a proposition , but not at the time when it was made ; . either because more information is wanted by the members individually , or because they desire further time for reflection and examination , or because the assembly is then occupied with some other matter which has more pressing claims upon its present attention . The usual motions , under such circumstances , are postponement to some future day or time , and to lie on the table . Thirds The subject-matter of a proposition may be regarded with favor , but the form in which it is introduced may be so defective Subndiary Motions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveniently be given to it in the assembly itself may be necessary to put it into a satisfactory form . In this case it is most proper to refer the proposition to a committee . Fourth The proposition may be acceptable , and the form in which it is presented so far satisfactory that the assembly may be willing to consider and act upon it , with such alterations and amendments as may be thought aroper . The motion adapted to this case is amend . 61 . It is not to be supposed that the subsidiary motions above specified are the only ones that have at any time been adopted or used , or that it is not competent to a deliberative assembly to frame new motions at pleasure ; but these are the forms in most common use , and are entirely sufficient for all practical purposes .

" PrevioiLS Question . 49 /z/ 62 . When a proposition is moved which it is supposed may be regarded by the assembly as useless or inexpedient , and which it may therefore be desirous to get rid of , such proposition may be suppressed for a time by means of the previous question , or altogether by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 63 . The original and proper parliamentary use of the previous question being , as above stated , the suppression of a main question , it seems proper to consider it as one of the subsidiary motions for that purpose , although in this country it has been perverted to a wholl ' different use , namely , the suppression of debate . This consideration in connection with the difficulty of the subject , and the importance of a correct understanding of it , znakos it proper to devote more room to the 60 Parliamentary Practice . previous question than needs to be given to most of the other subsidiary motions . It will first be considered according to its original use and intention ; and afterwards , a used in this country . 64 . There are several motions which give rise to questions previous in their nature to other questions to which they relate ; but the term previmis has been applied exclusively to a motion denominated the previous quest ion which has for its object the suppression of a principal motion or question . This motion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two centuries ago , for the purpose of suppressing subjects of a delicate nature relating to high personages , or the discussion of which might call forth observations of an injurious tendenc ' . When first made use of , the form of the motion was , Sliall the main question he put ? and the effect of a decision of it in the negative was to suppress the main question for the whole session . The form of it was afterwards changed to that which it has at present , namel- , Sliall the main question be now put ? and the effect of a negative decision of it now is to suppress the main question for the residue of the day only . Previous Question . 61 The operation of this motion , in suppressing the question to which it is applied , results from the principle that no further consideration or discussion can regularly be had of a subject which it has been decided shall not be put to the question ; and therefore when , on the motion of the previous question , it has been decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that question is disposed of for the day , and can not be renewed until the next or some succeeding day . This is the purpose for which the previous question was originally invented , and for which it is still used in the British Parliament . 65 . But the previous question may be decided in the affirmative , as well as the negative ; that is , that the main question shall now be put : in which case , that question is to be put immediately , without anj further debate , and in the form in which it then exists . This operation of the previous question , when decided affirmatively , has led to the use of it for the purpose of suppressing debate on a principal question , and coming to a vote upon it immediately ; and this is ordinarily the only object of the previous question , as made use of in the legislative assemblies of the United 52 Parliamentary Practice , States. * The operation of a negative decision is different in different assemblies : in some  --  - as , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it operates to dispose of the principal or main question by suppressing or removing it from before the house for the daj ; but in others  --  as in the House of Representatives of Massachusetts , and in the House of Assembly of New York ( in the former by usage onl ' , and in the latter by a rule )  --  the effect of a negative decision of the previous question is to leave the main question under debate for the residue of the sitting , unless sooner disposed of by taking the question , or in some other manner . 66 . In England the previous question is used onl ' for suppressing a main question ; the object of the mover is to obtain a decision of it in the negative ; and the effect of such a decision , though in strictness only to suppress the question for the day , is , practically I Mr. Jefferson ( Manual , xxxiv. ) considers this extension of the previous question as an abuse . He is of opinion , that " its uses would be as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should not be favored , but restricted within as narrow limits as possible . " Notwithstanding this suestion , however , the use of the previous question , as above stated , has become so tirnily established , Uiat it can not now be disturbeil or unsettled . Indefinite Postponement . 63 and by parliamentary usage , to dispose of the subject altogether . In this country the previous question is used chiefly for suppressing debate on a main question ; the object of the mover is to obtain a decision of it in the affirmative ; and the effect of a decision the other way , though in some assemblies operating technical to suppress the main question for the day only , is , in general , merely to suspend the taking of the question for that day ; either leaving the debate to go on during the residue of the day , or the subject to be renewed on the next or some other day . The operation of an affirmative decision is the same in both countries ; namely , the putting of the main question immediatelj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or consideration . Sect . II . Indefinite Postponement . 67 . In order to suppress a question altogether , without coming to a direct vote upon it , in such a manner that it can not be renewed , the proper motion is for indefinite postponement ; that is , a postponement or adjournment of the question , without fixing any day for resuming it . The effect of this motion , if decided 54 Parliamevtary Practice . in the affirmative , is to quash the proposition entirely ; a an indefinite adjournment is equivalent to a dissolution , or the continuance of a suit without day is a discontinuance of it . A negative decision has no effect whatever . Of Motions to Postpone . 65 /z/ 68 . If the assembly is willing to entertain and consider a question , but not at the time when it is moved , the proper course is eitlier to postpone the subject to another day , or to order it to lie on the table . 69 . When the members individually want more information than they possess at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection and examination , the proper motion is , to postpone the subject to such future day as will answer the views of the assembly . 70 . This motion is sometimes used improperly , to get rid of a proposition altogether , as would be done by an indefinite postponement . This is effected by fixing upon a day which , according to the common course of things , will not arrive until after the assembly has been brought , to a close . But a motion worded in this manner is precisely equivalent to a motion for indefinite postponement , and should be so considered and treated . 66 Parliamentary Practice . 71 . If the assembly has something else before it , which claims its present attention , and is therefore desirous to postpone a particular proposition until that subject is disposed of , such postponement may be effected by means of a motion that the matter in question lie on the table . If this motion prevails , the subject so disposed of may be taken up at any time afterwards , and considered , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion or proposition , report , resolution , or other matter , has been ordered to lie on the table , it is not in strictness allowable to make any further order , with reference to the same subject , on the same day . The order may , however , be limited to a specific time ; as , for example , until some other topic or subject is disposed of . The proper motion for proceeding with a matter that has been ordered to lie on the table is , that the assembly do now proceed to consider tliat matter or subject . The motion sometimes made is , that the subject be taken up , or taken up for consideration . 72 . This motion is also sometimes made use of for the final disposition of a subject ; and it always has that effect , when no motion is afterwards made to take it up . Of Motions to Commit . 67 /z/ 73 . The third case for the use of a subsidiary motion , as already stated , occurs when the subject-matter of a proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is introduced is so defective , that a more careful and deliberate consideration is necessary than can conveniently be given to it in the assembly itself , in order to put it into a satisfactory form . The course of proceeding then is , to refer the subject to a committee , which is called a commitment ; or , if the subject has already been in the hands of a committee , a recommitment. 74 . If there is a standing committee of the assembly , whose functions embrace the subject in question , the motion should be to refer it to that committee ; if there is no such committee , then the motion should be to refer to a select committee . If it is a matter of doubt , whether a particular standing committee is appropriate or not , and propositions are made for a reference to that committee , and also for /z/ 78 . The last case , for the introduction of subsidiary motions , is when the assembly is satisfied with the subject-matter of a proposition , but not with the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires to make some addition to it . The course of proceeding then is to bring the proposition into the proper form , and make its details satisfactory , by means of amendments , or of certain proceedings of a similar character , and having the same general purpose in view . The latter will be first considered . Section I. Division op a Question . 79 . When a proposition or motion is complicated , that is , composed of two or more parts which are so far independent of each other as to be susceptible of division into several questions , and it is supposed that the assembly ma ' approve of some but not of all these parts , it is a compendious mode of Division of a Question . 61 amendment to divide the motion into separate questions , to be separately voted upon and decided by the assembly . This division may take place by the order of the assembly , or a motion regularly made and seconded for the purpose . 80 . When a motion is thus divided , it becomes a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an independent proposition , in the order in which they stand ; and when they have all been gone through with , and decided , the result will be the same as if motions to amend by striking out the several parts had been made , and put to the question . When a motion for a division is made , the mover ought to specify in his motion the manner in which he proposes to make the division ; and this motion , like ever3 ' other of the nature of an amendment , is itself susceptible of amendment . 81 . It is sometimes asserted , that it is the right of every individual member to have a complicated question ( provided it is susceptible of division ) divided into its several parts , and a question put separately on each , on his mere demand , and without any motion or any vote of the assembly ' for that purpose . But 62 Parliamentary Practice . this is a mistake : thepe is no such rule of parliamentary proceeding ; a complicated question can only be separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by moving to a division of it in the manner above stated . 82 . It is not unusual , however , for a deliberative assembly to have a rule providing for the division of a complicated question ( provided it is susceptible of division ) into its several parts , upon the demand of a member . When this is the case , it is for the presiding ofl3cer ( subject , of course , to the revision of the assembly ) to decide , when the division of a motion is demanded , first , whether the proposition is susceptible of division ; and , secondly , into how many and what parts it may be divided . 83 . A proposition , in order to be divisible , must comprehend points so distinct and entire , that , if one or more of them be taken away , the others may stand entire and by themselves ; but a qualifying paragraph , as , for example , an exception or a proviso , if separated from the general assertion or statement to which it belongs , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 63 Sect . II . Filling Blanks . 84 . It often happens that a proposition is introduced with blanks purposely left by the mover to be filled by the assembly , either with times and numbers , or with provisions analogous to those of the proposition itself . In the latter case , blanks are filled in the same way that other amendments by the insertion of words are made . In the former , propositions to fill blanks are not considered as amendments to the question , but as original motions , to be made and decided before the principal question . 85 . When a blank is left to be filled with a time or number , motions may be made for that purpose , and the question taken on each b itself , and before another is made ; or several motions may be made and pending before any of them are put to the question . This last mode of proceeding , which is the most usual as well as convenient , requires that the several propositions should be arranged , and the question taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the most certainty enable the assembly to come to an agreement . 64 . Parliamentary Practice . 86 . In determining upon the order to be adopted , the object is not to begin at that extreme which , and more , being within every man 's wish , no one can vote against it , and yet , if it should be carried in the affirmative , every question for more would be precluded ; but at that extreme which will be likely to unite the fewest , and then to advance or recede until a number or time is reached , which will unite a majorit3 - 87 . Hence , when several different propositions are made for filling blanks with a time or number , the rule is , that if the larger comprehends the lesser as in a question to what da ' a postponement shall take place , the number of which a committee shall consist , the amount of a fine to be imposed , * the term of an imprisonment , the term of irredeemabilily of a loan , or the terminus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin a maximo and be first taken upon the greatest or farthest , and so on to the least or nearest , until the assembly comes to a vote ; but if the lesser includes the greater as in questions on the limitation of the rate of interest , on the amount of a tax , on what day the session of a legislative assembly shall be closed by adjourn- Addition , Separation . 65 laent , on what day the next session shall commence , or the terminus a quo in smy other case , the question must begin a minima and be first taken on the least or nearest , and so on to the greatest or most remote , until the assembly comes to a vote . Sect . III . Addition , Separation , Transposition. 88 . When the matters contained in two separate propositions might be better put into one , the mode of proceeding is , to reject one of them , and then to incorporate the substance of it with the other by wa ' of amendment . A better mode , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being adopted , is to refer both propositions to a committee , with instructions to incorporate them together in one . /z/ 1 The above is the rule as laid down by Mr. JefFerson 33 ) , and holds where it is not superseded by a special rule , which is generally the case in our legislative assemblies ; as , for example , in the Senate of the United States , the rule is , that in filling blanlcs the largest sum and longest time shall be first put . In the House of Commons , in England , the rule established by usage is , that the smallest sum and the longest time shall be first put . 66 Parliamentary Practice . 89 . So , on the other hand , if the matter of one proposition would be more properly distributed into two , any part of it ma ' be struck out by way of amendment , and put into the form of a new and distinct proposition . But in this , as in the former case , a better mode would generally be to refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , if a paragraph or section requires to be transposed , a question must be put on striking it out where it stands , and another for inserting it in the place desired . 91 . The numbers prefixed to the several sections , paragraphs , or resolutions , which constitute a proposition , are merely marginal indications , and no part of the text of the proposition itself ; and , if necessar ' , they may be altered or regulated by the clerk , without any vote or order of the assembly . Sect . IV . Modification or Amendment by THE Mover. 92 . The mover of a proposition is sometimes allowed to modify it after it has been stated as a question by the presiding officer ; but as this is equivalent to a withdrawal of Amendments . 67 the motion in order to substitute another in its place , and since , as has already been seen , a motion regularly made , seconded , and proposed , can not be withdrawn without leave , it is clear that the practice alluded to rests only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mover of a proposition must obtain the permission of the assembly , by a motion and question for the purpose , in order to enable him to modify his proposition . 93 . So , too , when an amendment has been regularl ' moved and seconded , it is sometimes ' the practice for the mover of the proposition to which it relates to signify his consent to it , and for the amendment to be thereupon made , without any question being taken upon it by the assembl3 As this proceeding , however , is essentially the same with that described in the preceding paragraph , it of course rests upon the same foundation , and is subject to the same rule . Before a motion has been stated , the mover , as already remarked 56 ) , may modify or withdraw it at his pleasure : after it has been stated , he can only withdraw ormodifj it by general consent ; he may , lioWi  --  jr , like any other member , move to amend . The accept- l 68 Parliamentary Practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested b ' some other member , stands upon the same ground . Sect . V. General Rules relating to Amendments . 94 . All amendments of which a proposition is susceptible , so far as form is concerned , ma ' be effected in one of three ways : namely , either by inserting or adding certain words ; or by striking out certain words ; or b ' striking out certain words , and inserting or adding others . These several forms of amendment are subject to certain general rules , which , being equally applicable to them all , require to be stated beforehand . 95 . First Rule , When a proposition consists of several sections , paragraphs , or resolutions , the natural order of considering and amending it is to begin at the beginning , and to proceed through it in course by paragraphs ; and , when a latter part has been amended , it is not in order to recur back , and make any alteration or amendment of a former part . 96 . Second Rule , Everv amendment which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 69 inserting , or striking out and inserting , is itself susceptible of amendment ; but there can be no amendment of an amendment to an amendment : this would be such a piling of questions one upon another , as would lead to great embarrassment ; and , as the line must be drawn somewhere , it has been fixed by usage after the amendment to the amendment . The object which is proposed to be effected bj such a proceeding must be sought b ' rejecting the amendment to the amendment , in the form in which it is proposed , and then moving it again in the form in which it is wished to be amended , in which it is only an amendment to an amendment ; and , in order to accomplish this , he who desires to amend an amendment should give notice , that , if rejected in the form in which it is presented , he shall move it again in the form in which he desires to have it adopted . 97 . Thus , if a proposition consist of A B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D , it may be moved to amend the amendment b inserting E F ; but it can not be moved to amend this amendment , as , for example , by inserting G. The only mode by which this can be reached is to reject the amendment in the form in which it is presented , namely , to in- 70 Parliamentary Practice . sert E F , and to move it in the form in which it is desired to be amended , namely , to insert /z/ 98 . Third Rule , Whatever is agreed to by the assembly , on a vote , either adopting or rejecting a proposed amendment , can not be afterwards altered or amended . 99 . Thus , if a proposition consist of A B , and it is moved to insert C , if the amendment prevail , C can not be afterwards amended , because it has been agreed to in that form ; and so , if it is moved to strike out B , and the amendment is rejected , B can not afterwards be amended , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote agreeing to it as it stands . 100 . Fourth Rule . Whatever is disagreed to by the assembly , on a vote , can not be afterwards moved again . This rule is the converse of the preceding , and may be illustrated in the same manner . 101 . Thus , if it is moved to amend A B by inserting C , and the amendment is rejected , C can not be moved again ; or if it is moved to amend A B by striking out B , and the amendment prevails , B can not be restored : because in the first case C , and in the other B , have been disagreed to by a vote . Amendments , 71 102 . Fifth Rule . The inconsistency or incompatibility of a proposed amendment with one which has aU-eady been adopted is a fit ground for its rejection by the assembly , but not for the suppression of it by the presiding officer , as against order ; for , if questions of this nature were allowed to be brought within the jurisdiction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might usurp a negative on important modifications , and suppress or embarrass instead of subserving the will of the assembl3 Sect . VI . Amendments by Striking out . 103 . If an amendment is proposed by striking out a particular paragraph or certain words , and the amendment is rejected , it can not be again moved to strike out the same words or a part of them ; but it ma- be moved to strike out the same words with others , or to strike out a part of the same words with others , provided the coherence to be struck out be so substantial as to make these , in fact , different propositions from the former . 104 . Thus , if a proposition consist of A B C D , and it is moved to strike out B C- 72 Parliamentary Practice . if this amendment is rejected , it can not be moved again ; but it may be moved to strike out A B , or A B C , or B C D , or C D. 105 . If an amendment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards moved to insert the same words struck out , or a part of them ; but it may be moved to insert the same words with others , or a part of the same words with others , provided the coherence to be inserted make these propositions substantiall ' different from the first . 106 . Thus , if the proposition A B C D is amended by striking out B C , it can not be moved to insert B O again ; but it may be moved to insert B C with other words , or B with others , or C with others . 107 . When it is proposed to amend by striking out a particular paragraph , it may be moved to amend this amendment in three different was 's ; namel ' , either by striking out a part only of the paragraph , or by inserting or adding words , or by striking out and inserting . 108 . Thus , if it is moved to amend the proposition A B C D b ' striking out B C , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only or C onl ' , or by inserting E , or by striking out B or C and inserting E. Amendments . 73 109 . In the case of a proposed amendment by striking out , the effect of voting upon it , whether it be decided in the affirmative or negative , according to the third and fourth rules above mentioned , renders it necessary for those who desire to retain the paragraph to amend it , if any amendment is necessar , before the vote is taken on striking out , as , if struck out , it can not be restored , and , if retained , it can not be amended . 110 . As an amendment must necessarily be put to the question before the principal motion , so the question must be put on an amendment to an amendment before it is put on the amendment ; but , as this is the extreme limit to which motions may be put upon one another , there can be no precedence of one over another among amendments to amendments ; and consequently they can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all events , must be put to the question in the order in which they are moved . HI . When a motion for striking out words is put to the question , the parliamentarj- form always is , whether the words shall stand as part of the principal motion , and not whether the ' shall he struck out . The reason for this 74 Parliamentary Practice . form of stating the question probably is , that the question may be taken in the same manner on a part as on the whole of the principal motion ; which would not be the case if the question was stated on striking out , inasmuch as the question on the principal motion , when it comes to be stated , will be on agreeing to it , and not on striking out or rejecting it . Besides , as an equal division of the assembly ' would produce a different decision of the question , according to the manner of stating it , it might happen , if the question on the amendment was stated on striking out , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same vote. 112 . On a motion to amend by striking out certain words , the manner of stating the question is , first to read the passage proposed to be amended , as it stands ; then the words proposed to be struck out ; and , lastly , the whole passage as it will stand if the amendment is adopted . The common , if not the only , mode of stating the question in the legislative assemblies of Uiis country , is on striking out . Amendments . 75 Sect . VII . Amendments by Inserting . 113 . If an amendment is proposed by inserting or adding a paragraph or words , and the amendment is rejected , it can not be moved again to insert the same words or a part of them ; but it may be moved to insert the same words with others , or a part of the same words with others , provided the coherence really make them different propositions . 114 . Thus , if it is moved to amend the proposition A B by inserting C D , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be again moved ; but it may be moved to insert C or D E , or C D E. 115 . If it is proposed to amend by inserting a paragraph , and the amendment prevails , it can not be afterwards moved to strike out the same words or a part of them ; but it may be moved to strike out the same words with others , or a part of the same words with others , provided the coherence be such as to make these propositions really different from the first . 1 This is the common case of striking out a paragraph , and having amended it by inserting words . 76 Parliamentary Practice . 116 . Thus , if in the example above supposed the amendment prevails , and C D is inserted , it can not be afterwards moved to strike out C D ; but it maj ' be moved to strike out A C , or A C D , or D B , or C D B. . 117 . When it is proposed to amend b ' inserting a paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; namel ' , either by- striking out a part of the paragraph , or by inserting something into it , or by striking out and inserting . US . Thus , if it is proposed to amend A B b ' inserting C D , this amendment may be amended either by striking out C or D , or inserting E , or by striking out C or D and inserting E. 119 . When it is proposed to amend by inserting a paragraph , those who are in favor of the amendment should amend it , if necessary , before the question is taken ; because , if it is rejected , it can not be moved again , and , if received , it can not be amended . 120j There is no precedence of one over another in amendments to amendments by inserting , an- more than in amendments to amendments by striking out . 121 . On a motion to amend by inserting Amendments . *l*l a paragraph , the manner of stating the question is , first to read the passage to be amended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inserted ; and , lastly , the whole passage as it will stand if the amendment prevails . Sect . VIII . Amendment by Striking out AND Inserting . ! . The third form of amending a proposition , namely , by striking out certain words and inserting others in their place , is , in fact , a combination of the other two forms , and may accordingly be divided into those two forms , either by a vote of the assembly , or on the demand of a member , under a special rule to that effect . When the parliamentary form of putting the question , on a motion to strike or leave out words , is adopted , the question is first stated that the words proposed to be struck out stand as part of the motion . If this question passes in the negative , a question is then * Mr. Jefferson xxxv. ) says , ** The question , if desired , is then to be divided , " &o.; ; bat , as he makes no exception of a miotion to strike out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does not here state it as an exception , he undoubtedly supposes the division in this case to le made in the regular and usual manner . 78 Parliamentary Practice . to be stated on inserting the words proposed , which may be amended like any other motion to insert or add words . If the question on the standing of the words passes in the affirmative , the residue of the motion to strike out and insert fails without a question . According to the parliamentary form , therefore , a motion to strike out and insert is necessarily divided . The remark of Mr. Jefferson , quoted in the note to 122 , that " the question , if desired , is then to be divided , **  --  &c.,; may be explained by supposing , that when a motion was made to strike out and insert , which was not objected to , the question was proposed in the terms of the motion ; but that , if objected to , it was then to be put , of course , in the parliamentary form . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson had been a member , the parliamentary form of stating the question was in use . 123 . If the motion is divided , the question is first to be taken on striking out , and , if that is decided in the affirmative , then on inserting ; but if the former is decided in the negative , the latter falls , of course . On a division , the proceedings are the same in reference to each branch of the question , beginning with the Amendments . 79 striking-out , as if each branch had been moved by itself . 124 . If the motion to strike out and insert is put to the question undivided , and is decided in the negative , the same motion can not be made again : but it may be moved to strike out the same words , and , 1 , insert nothing ; 2 , insert other words ; 3 , insert the same words with others ; 4 , insert a part of the same words with others ; 5 , strike out the same words with others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the same words with others , and insert the same ; 7 , strike out other words , and insert the same ; and , 8 , insert the same words , without striking out any thing . 125 . K the motion to strike out and insert is decided in the affirmative , it can not be then moved to insert the words struck out or a part of them , or to strike out the words inserted or a part of them : but it may be moved , 1 , to insert the same words with others ; 2 , to insert a part of the same words with others ; 3 , to strike out the same words with others ; or , 4 , to strike out a part of the same words with others . 126 . When it is proposed to amend by striking out and inserting , this amendment may be 80 Parliamentary Practice . amended in three different ways in the paragraph proposed to be struck out , and also in the paragraph proposed to be inserted ; namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find inserting . And those who are in favor of either paragraph must amend it before the question is taken , for the reasons already stated : namely , that , if decided in the affirmative , the part struck out can not be restored , nor can the part inserted be amended ; and , if decided in the negative , the part proposed to be struck out can not be amended , nor can the paragraph proposed to be inserted be moved again . 127 . On a motion to amend by striking out certain words and inserting others , the manner of stating the question is , first to read the whole passage to be amended , as it stands ; then the words proposed to be struck out ; next , those to be inserted ; and , lastly , the whole passage as it will stand when amended . 127 a . The foregoing rules in regard to amendments are undoubtedly made as clear and plain as the nature of the subject admits of . It is not be expected , however , that any persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliamentary Amendments . 81 procedure would acquire sufficient familiarity with them to be able to apply them readily in practicev The principle on which the ' rest is that the same proposition changed only in form should not be brought twice before the assembly ' . It is essential to any tolerably rapid transaction of business , that no proposition should by a simple change of form be brought twice before the assembly . If it desires further to consider the matter , it can alwa3 's do so by a vote to reconsider , which JL suppose it may do so long as the assembly remains in session , although it might be necessar ' to suspend a general rule for that purpose . It is believed that the application of this principle will carry a presiding officer satisfactorily over most of the difficulties of the subject .  --  Ed . Sect . IX . Amekdments changing the Nature of a Question . 128 . The term amendment " is in strictness applicable only to those changes of a proposition , by which it is improved ; that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , or made to express more clearly 82 Parliamentary Practice , and definitel ' the sense which it is intended to express . Hence it seems proper , that those only should undertake to amend a proposition , who are friendly to it ; but this is by no means the rule : when a proposition is regularly moved and seconded , it is in the possession of the assembly , and can not be withdrawn but by its leave ; it has then become the basis of the future proceedings of the assembly , and may be put into any shape , and turned to any purpose , that the assembly may think proper . 129 . It is consequently allowable to amend a proposition in such a manner as entirely to alter its nature , and to make it bear a sense different from what it was originally intended to bear ; so that the friends of it , as it . was first introduced , may themselves be forced to vote against it in its amended form . 130 . This mode of proceeding is sometimes adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its original friends to unite with those who are opposed to it , in voting for its . rejection . Thus in the British House of Commons , Jan. 29 , 1765 , a resolution being moved , " That a general warrant for apprehending the authors , printers , or publishers of a libel , together with their papers . . Amendments . 83 is not warranted by law , and is an high violation of the liberty of the subject , "  --  it was moved to amend this motion by prefixing the following paragraph : namely , " That , in the particular case of libels , it is proper and necessary to fix , by a vote of this house only , what ought to be deemed the law in respect of general warrants ; and , for that purpose , at the time when the determination of the legalit ' of such warrants in the instance of a most seditious and treasonable libel , is actually depending before the courts of law , for this house to declare "  --  tfiat a general warrant for apprehending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their papers is not warranted by law and is an high violation of the liberty of the subject . The amendment was adopted , after a long debate ; and then the resolution as amended was immediately rejected without a division. 1 This mode of defeating a measare , however , is not always Buocessfal . In 1780 , Mr. Dunniiig having made a motion , in the House of Commons , * ' That , in the opinion of this house , the influence of the crown has increased , is increasing , and ought to he diminished/* Dundas , lord-advocate of Scotland , in order to defeat the motion , proposed to amend by inserting after the words , " in the opinion qfthis house ** the words , Uis now necensary to declare that " &c.; But this amendment , instead of intimidating the filends of the original motion , was at ouce adopted by them ; and the resolution passed as amended . 84 Parliamentary Practice . 131 . But sometimes the nature of a proposition is changed by means of amendments , with a view to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was origin all- intended to bear . The following is a striking example of this mode of proceeding . In the House of Commons , April 10 , 1744 , a resolution was moved , declanng " That the issuing and paying to the Duke of Aremberg the sum of forty thousand pounds sterling to put the Austrian troops in motion , in the 3'ear 1742 , was a dangerous misapplication of public mone ' , and destructive of the rights of parliament . " The object of this resolution was to censure the conduct of the ministers ; and the friends of the ministry , being in a majority , might have voted directly upon the motion , and rejected it . But they preferred to turn it into a resolution approving of the conduct of ministers on the occasion referred to ; and it was accordingly moved to amend , by leaving out the words " a dangerous misapplication , " &c.,; to the end of the motion , and inserting instead thereof the words , " necessarj ' for putting the said troops in motion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The amendment being adopted , it was resolved Amendments . 85 ( reversing the original proposition ) , " That the issuing and paying to the Duke of Aremberg the sum of forty thousand pounds to put the Austrian troops in motion , in the year 1742 , was necessary for putting the said troops in motion , and of great consequence to the common cause . " 132 . It is a mode of defeating a proposition , somewhat similar to that above mentioned , to carry out or extend the principle of it , by means of amendments , so as to show the inconvenience , absurdity , or danger of its adoption , with such evident clearness that it becomes impossible for the assembly ' to agree to it . Thus , a motion having been made in the House of Commons , " for copies of all the letters written by the lords of the admiralt- to a certain officer in the navy , " it was moved to amend the motion by adding these words : " which letters may contain orders , or be relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This amendment being adopted , the motion as amended was unanimousl ' rejected . 133 . It will be seen , from the foregoing examples , that , as the mover of a proposition is under no restriction as to embracing incongruous matters under the same motion , so , on the 86 Parliamentary Practice . other hand , the assembly may ingraft upon a motion , by way of amendment , matter which is not only incongruous with , but entirely ' opposed to , the motion as originall ' ' introduced ; and in legislative assemblies it is not unusual to amend a bill by striking out all after the enacting clause , and inserting an entirely new bill ; or , to amend a resolution by striking out all after the words , " Resolved that , " and inserting a proposition of a wholly different tenor . In some legislative assemblies , the House of Representatives of Massachusetts for example , it is provided by a special rule , that no motion or proposition , relative to a different subject from the one under consideration , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of this nature is in force , the assembly , by proceeding to consider a given subject , places itself in the situation of a committee to whom that subject is referred . Order and Sticcession of Questions . 87 /z/ 134 . It is a general rule , that when a proposition is regularly before a deliberative assembly , for its consideration , no other proposition or motion can regularl ' ' be made or arise so as to take the place of the former , and be first acted upon , unless it be either , firsts a privileged question ; secondly a subsidiary question ; or , thirdly an incidental question or motion . * 135 . AU these motions take the place of the principal motion , or main question as it is usually called , and are to be first put to the question ; and among themselves , also , there are some which , in like manner , take the place of all the others . Some of these questions merely supersede the principal question , until the ' have been decided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that question as before . Others of 88 Parliamentary Practice . them also supersede the principal question until they are decided ; and , when decided one way , dispose of the principal question , but , if decided the other way , leave it as before . Section I. Privileged Questions . 136 . There are certain motions or questions which , on account of the superior importance attributed to them , either in consequence of a vote of the assembly , or in themselves considered , or of the necessity of the proceedings to which they lead , are entitled to take the place of any other subject or proposition which may then be under consideration , and to be first acted upon and decided by the assembly . These are called privileged questions , because they are entitled to precedence over other questions , thoifgh the ' are of different degrees among themselves . Questions of this nature are of three kinds : namely , firsts motions to adjourn ; secondly motions or questions relating to the rights and privileges of the assembly ' , or of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day . Adjournment . 89 Adjournment . 137 . A motion to adjourn takes the place of all other questions whatsoever ; for otherwise the assembly might be kept sitting against its will , and for an indefinite time ; but , in order to entitle this motion to precedence , it must be simply to " adjourn , " without the addition of any particular day or time . And as the object of this motion , when made in the midst of some other proceeding and with a view to supiersede a question already proposed , is simply to break up the sitting , it does not admit of any amendment by the addition of a particular day , or in any other manner ; though , if a motion to adjourn is made when no other business is before the assembly , it may be amended like other questions . 1 It is commonly said that a motion to adjourn is always in order , but this is not precisely true . The question of adjournment can , indeed , be moved repeatedly on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediate question being proposed , after one motion to adjourn is disposed of , and before the next motion is made for adjourning ; as , for example , an amendment to a pending question , or for the reading of some paper . The reason of this is , that , until some other proceeding has intervened , the question already decided is the same as that newly moved . 90 Parliamentary Practice . The reason why a motion to adjourn moved for the purpose of superseding or suppressing a pending question , is not susceptible of amendment , is , that if amended , it would at once become inadmissible , in point of order , on the ground of its being introductory to a second question , having no privilege to take the place of a question already pending , and entitled to be first disposed of . 138 . A motion to adjourn is merely , that this assembly do now adjourn ; " and , if it is carried in the affirmative , the assembly is adjourned to the next sitting day ; unless it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will adjourn to a particular day ; in which case , it is adjourned to that day . 139 . An adjournment without day , that is , without any time being fixed for re-assembling , would , in the case of any other than a legislative assembly , be equivalent to a dissolution. 140 . When a question is interrupted by an adjournment before any vote or question has 1 It is quite common , when the business of a deliberative assembly has been brought to a close , to culjoum the assembly without day , A better form is to dissolve it ; as an adjournment without day , if we regard the etymology of the word cujounif is a contradiction in terms . Adjournment . 91 been taken upon it , it is thereby removed from before the assembly , and will not stand before it , as a matter of course , at its next meeting , but must be brought forward in the usual way . 140 a . When the motion to adjourn involves the merits of the main question , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule it is otherwise provided . ( Gushing , Law and Practice of Leg . Ass. , art . 1625 . ) Adjournment ordinarily means a postponement of the business of the assembly to some definite time , either indicated specially in the motion , or provided for by some general rule ; but , when the assembly is adjourned without any such provision , it is of course dissolved , and would not sit again until called together anew , according to the provisions of its organic law . There is sometimes a little confusion of ideas arising from the use of the term session which may mean a single sitting , or the aggregate of all the sittings from the commencement until the dissolution of the assembly . As the adjournment from sitting to sitting is merel a continuation of the same session , it is sometimes stated that , independently of any special rule , on such an adjournment the business would be taken up at the 92 Parliamentary Practice . next meeting where k was left ; and of course this ma ' be provided by special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly ' , the business before it would necessaril ' fall to the ground , unless , by virtue of some special rule or organic law of the assembly , such a result should be avoided .  --  Ed . Questions of Privilege . 141 . The questions next in relative importance , and which supersede all others for the time being , except that of adjournment , are those which concern the rights and privileges of the assembly or of its individual members ; as , for example , when the proceedings of the assembly are disturbed or interrupted , whether by strangers or members , or where a quarrel arises between two members ; and , in these cases , the matter of privilege supersedes the question pending at the time , together with all subsidiary and incidental ones , and must be first disposed of . When settled , the question interrupted by it is to be resumed at the point where it was suspended . Orders of the Day . 93 Orders op the Day . 142 . When the consideration of a subject has been assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly , the matter so assigned is called the order of the da for that day . If , in the course of business , as commonly happens in legislative assemblies , there are several subjects assigned for the same da , they are called the orders of the day . 143 . A question which is thus made the subject of an order for its consideration on a particular day is thereby made a privileged question for that day ; the order being a repeal , as to this special case , of the general rule as to business . If , therefore , an ' other proposition ( with the exception of the two preceding ) is moved , or arises , on the dy assigned for the consideration of a particular subject , a motion for the order of the day will supersede the question first made , together with all subsidiary and incidental questions connected with it , and must be first put and decided ; for , if the debate or consideration of that subject were allowed to proceed , it might continue through the da @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliamentary Practice . 144 . But this motion , to entitle it to precedence , must be for the orders generall- , if there is more than one , and not for an ' particular one ; and if decided in the affirmative , that is , that the assembly will now proceed to the orders of the day , they must then be read and gone through with in the order in which they stand ; priority of order being considered to give priority of right . 145 . If the consideration of a subject is assigned for a particular hour on the day named , a motion to proceed to it is not a privileged motion , until that hour has arrived ; but , if no hour is fixed , the order is for the entire day and every part of it . 146 . Where there are several orders of the day , and one of them is fixed for a particular hour , if the orders are taken up before that hour , they are to be proceeded with as they stand , until that hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next in order ; but , if the orders are taken up at that time or afterwards , that particular subject must be considered as the first in order . 147 . If the motion for the orders of the day is decided in the affirmative , the original question is removed from before the assembly , in Incidental Questions . 95 the same manner as if it had been interrupted by an adjournment , and does not stand before the assembly , as a matter of course , at its next meeting , but must be renewed in the usual way . 148 . If the motion is decided in the negative , the vote of the assembly is a discharge of the orders , so far as they interfere with the consideration of the subject then before it , and entitles that subject to be first disposed of . 149 . Orders of the day , unless proceeded in and disposed of on the day assigned , fall , of course , and must be renewed for some other da ' . It may be provided , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assemblies of Massachusetts , that the orders for a particular day shall hold for every succeeding day , until disposed of . Sect . II . Incidental Questions . 150 . Incidental questions are such as arise out of other questions , and are consequently to be decided before the questions which give rise to them . Of this nature are , firsts questions of order ; second motions for the reading 96 Parliamentary Practice . of papers , &c.; ; thirds leave to withdraw a motion ; fourth suspension of a rule ; and , fiflh amendment of an amendment . Questions op Order . 151 . It is the duty of the presiding officer of a deliberative assembly to enforce the rules and orders of the body over which he presides , i-n all its proceedings ; and this without question , debate , or delay , in all cases in which the breach of order , or the departure from rule , is manifest . It is also the right of every member , taking notice of the breach of a rule , to insist upon the enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though no question can be made as to the enforcement of the rules , when there is a breach or manifest departure from them , so long as any member insists upon their enforcement , yet questions may and do frequently arise as to the fact of their being a breach of order , or a violation of the rules , in a particular proceeding ; and these questions must be decided before a case can arise for the enforcement of the rules . Questions of this kind are denominated questions of order . QucBtions of Order . 97 153 . When any question of this nature arises in the course of any other proceeding , it necessarily supersedes the further consideration of the subject out of which it arises , until that question is disposed of ; then the original motion or proceeding revives , and resumes its former position , unless it has been itself disposed of by the question of order . 154 . When a question of order is raised , as it may be by any one member , it is not stated from the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is decided , in the firt instance , by the presiding officer , without any previous debate or discussion by the assembly . If the decision of the presiding officer is not satisfactory , an one member may object to it , and have the question decided by the assembly . This is called appealing from the decision of the chair . The question is then stated by the presiding officer , on the appeal ; namely , ShaU the decision of the chair stand as the decision of the assembly f and it is thereupon debated and decided by the assembly in the same manner as any other question ; except that the presiding officer is allowed to take a part in the debate , which , on ordinary occasions , he is prohibited from doing . 98 Parliamentary Practice . In the British Parliament , the presiding officers do not appear to consider it their duty to decide points of order , unless appealed to by the house for that purpose ; which , in the Commons , is usually effected by a general cry of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare , that an opinion given in answer to such a call is not submitted to b the house . If not satisfactory , the point of order may be separated from the main question b- a motion and question for the purpose , on which the presiding officer 's decision may be overruled ; or , without any distinct question being made , the house may proceed to pass upon the point of order , as involved in the main question , and , in deciding the latter , may go contrary to the opinion of the presiding officer , upon the matter of order . In the legislative assemblies of this country , it is generally , if not universally , provided by a special rule , that every question of order shall , in the first instance , be decided hy the presiding officer , subject to an appeal to the assembly ' itself . Such also appears to be the usage of deliberative assemblies not legislative in their character . And it is on these grounds of rule and usage , that the doctrine laid down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement that questions of order are to be decided , in the first instance , hy the presiding oflScer , without any previous debate or discussion by the assembly , must not be understood to mean that the presiding officer is precluded from allowing members to express their opinions upon the point of order , before himself deciding it ; but merely , that the matter is not then to be debated and discussed , as a question to be decided by the assembly . The presiding officer , before expressing his own opinion , may , if he pleases , take the opinions of other members . It is manifest , however , that , when he is ready to ive his own opinion , he may proceed at once , and can not be precluded from doing so by any other member claiming a right to be first heard . Reading Papers . 155 . It is , for obvious reasons , a general rule , that , where papers are laid before a deliberative assembly for its action , every member has a right to have them once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote on them ; and consequently , when the reading of any paper relative to a question before the 100 Parliamentary Practice . assembly is called for under this rule , no question need be made as to the reading : the paper is read by the clerk , under the direction of the presiding officer , as a matter of course . 156 . But , with the exception of papers coming under this rule it is not the right of any member to read himself , or to have read , any paper , book , or document whatever , without the leave of the assembly , upon a motion made and a question put for the purpose . The delay and interruption which would otherwise ensue from reading every paper that might be called for show the absolute necessity of restricting the rule within the narrowest possible limits , consistently with permitting every member to have as much information as possible on the subjects in reference to which he is about to vote . 157 . When , therefore , a member desires that any paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed or written ( except as above mentioned ) , should be read for his own information , or that of the assembly ; or desires to read any such paper , book , or document , in his place , in the course of a debate or otherwise , or even to read his own speech Reading Papers . 101 which he has prepared beforehand , and committed to writing ,  --  in all these cases , if any objection is made , he must obtain leave of the assembly for the reading , by a motion and vote for the purpose . 158 . When the reading of a paper is evidently for information , and not for delay , it is the usual practice for the presiding officer to allow of it , unless objection is made , in which case leave must be asked ; and this is seldom refused , where there is no intentional or gross abuse of the time and patience of the assembly . 159 . It is not now the practice , as it once was , in legislative assemblies , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are referred to committees immediately on their presentation ; though the right of every member to insist upon one reading is still admitted . It would be impossible , with the amount of business done by legislative bodies at the present day , to devote much of their time to the reading of papers . 160 . When , in the course of a debate or other proceeding , the reading of a paper is called for , and a question is made upon it , this question is incidental to the former , and must be first decided . 102 Parliamentary Practice , Withdrawal of a Motion . 161 . A motion , when regularl ' made , , seconded , and proposed from the chair , is then in i the possession of the assembh , and can not be withdrawn by the mover , or directly disposed of in any manner but by a vote : hence , if the mover of a question wishes to modify it , or to - substitute a different one in its place , he must obtain the leave of the assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if objection is made , by a motion and question in the usual mode of proceeding . A motion , when made , seconded , and stated , can not be withdrawn without the general con- I sent , or , if put formally to the question , the unanimous vote , of the assembly . 162 . If this motion is decided in the affirm- ative , the motion to which it relates is thereby removed from before the assembly , as if it had never been moved ; if in the negative , the business proceeds as before . i Suspension of a Rule . 163 . When any contemplated motion or proceeding is rendered impracticable , by rea- Amendment of Amendments , 103 son of the existence of some special rule by which it is prohibited , it lias become an established practice in this countrj , to suspend or dispense with the rule , for the purpose of admitting the proceeding or motion which is desired . This can only be done by a motion and question ; and , where this course is taken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under consideration , a motion to suspend the rule supersedes the original question for the time being , and is first to be decided . 164 . It is usual , in the code of rules adopted by deliberative assemblies , and especially legislative bodies , to provide that a certain number exceeding a majority , as two-thirds or three-fourths , shall be competent to the suspension of a rule in a particular case ; where this is not provided , there seems to be no other mode of suspending or dispensing with a rule than by general consent . Amendment of Amendments . 165 . In treating of amendments , it has alread3 ' been seen , that it is allowable to amend a proposed amendment , and that the 104 Parliamentary Practice . question on such sub-amendment must necessarily be put and decided before putting the question on the amendment . The former is incidental to the latter , and supersedes it for the time being . Sect . III . Subsidiary Questions . 166 . Subsidiary or secondary questions or motions , as has already been stated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made use of to enable the assembly to dispose of it in the most appropriate manner . These motions have the effect to supersede , and in some cases , when decided one way , to dispose of , the principal question . They are also of different degrees among themselves ; and , according to their several natures , supersede and sometimes dispose of one another . 167 . The subsidiary motions in common use are the following ; namely , lie on the table , the previous question , postponement either indefinite or to a day ceitain , commitment , and amendment . 168b It is a general rule , with certain exceptions which will be immediately mentioned , that subsidiary motions can not be applied to Subsidiary Qttestions. 105 one another : as , for example , suppose a motion to postpone , commit , or amend a principal question , it can not be moved to suppress the motion to postpone , &c.,; by putting a previous question on it ; or , suppose the previous question is moved , or a commitment or amendment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postpone the previous question or the motion for commitment or amendment . The reasons for this rule are : 1 . It would be absurd to separate the appendage from its principal ; 2 . It would be a piling of questions one on another , which , to avoid embaiTassment , is not allowed ; and , 3 . The same result may be reached more simply by voting against the motion which it is attempted to dispose of by another secondary motion . 169 . The exceptions to the rule above stated are , that motions to postpone ( either to a day certain or indefinitely ) , to commit , or to amend a principal question , may be amended for the reason that " the useful character of amendment gives it a privilege of attaching itself to a secondary and privileged motion ; " that is , a subsidiary motion to carry out and improve another may be applied to that other , but a subsidiary motion to dispose of or suppress 106 . Parliamentary Practice , another is not admissible . Hence the subsidiary motions above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , can not be amended , the nature of it not admitting of any change . Parliamentary usage has fixed its form to be , " Shall the main question be now put ? " that is , at this instant ; and , as the present instant is but one , it can not admit of any modification ; and to change it to the next day or any other moment ' is without example or utility . For the same reasons , also , that the fqrm of it is fixed by parliamentary usage , and is already as simple as it can be , a motion to lie on the table can not be amended . Lie on the Table . - 171 . This motion is usually resorted to when the assembly has something else before it , which claims its present attention , and therefore desires to lay aside a proposition for a short but indefinite time , reserving to itself the power to take it up when convenient . This motion takes precedence of and supersedes all the other subsidiar motions . 172 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together with all the other mo- Previous Question . 107 tions , subsidiary and incidental , connected with it , is removed from before the assembl- , until it is again taken up ; which it may be by motion and vote , at any time when the assembly pleases. 173 . If decided in the negative , the business proceeds in the same manner as if the motion had never been made . Previous Question . 174 . This motion has already been described ( 63 ) , and the nature and effect of it fully stated . It stands in an equal degree with all the other subsidiary motions , except the motion to lie on the table ; and consequently , if first moved , is not subject to be superseded by a motion to postpone , commit , or amend . 175 . If the previous question is moved before the others above mentioned , and put to the question , it has the effect to prevent those motions from being made at all ; for if decided affirmatively , to wit , that the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be contrary to the decision of the assembly , and therefore against order , to postpone , commit , or amend ; and if decided negatively , to 108 Parliamentary Practice . wit , that the main question shall not now be put , this takes the main question out of the possession of the assembly for the day , so that there is then nothing before it to postpone , commit , or amend . Postponement . 176 . The motion to postpone is either indefinite or to a day certain , and , in both these forms , may be amended ,  --  in the former , by making it to a day certain ; in the latter , by substituting one day for another . But , in the latter case , propositions to substitute different days for that originally named bear more resemblance to propositions for filling blanks than the ' do to amendments , and should be considered and treated accordingly . 177 . If , therefore , a motion is made for an indefinite postponement , it may be moved to amend the motion hy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day is desired , it may be moved as an amendment to the amendment ; 1 In the House of Representatives of Massachusetts , as the effect of a negative decision of the previous question is not to remove the principal question from before the house , that question is still open to postponement , commitment , or amendment , notwithstanding such negative decision . Commitment , 109 or it may be moved as an independent motion , when the amendment has been rejected . 178 . If a motion is made for a postponement to a day certain , it may be amended by the substitution of a different day ; but in this ease a more simple and effectual mode of proceeding is to consider the day as a blank to be filled in the usual manner , beginning with the longest time . 179 . This motion stands in the same degree witli motions for the previous question , to commit , and to amend ; and , if first made , is not susceptible of being superseded by them . 180 . If a motion for postponement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied is removed from before the assembly with all its appendages and incidents , and consequently there is no ground for either of the other subsidiary motions ; if decided negatively , that the proposition shall not be postponed , that question may then be suppressed by the previous question , or committed , or amended . Commitment . 181 . A motion to commit , or recommit ( which is the term used when the proposition 110 Parliamentary Practice . has already been once committed ) , may be amended by the substitution of one kind of committee for another , or by enlarging or diminishing the number of the members of the committee as originally . proposed , or by instructions to the committee . 182 . This motion stands in the same degree with the previous question , and postponement , and , if first made , is not superseded b " them ; but it takes precedence of a motion to amend . 183 . If decided affirmativel ' , the proposition is removed from before the assembly , and consequently there is no ground for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to wit , that the principal question shall not be committed , that question may then be suppressed b ' the previous question , or postponed , or amended .

It stands in the same degree onlj- with the previous question and indefinite postponement ; and neither , if first moved , is superseded by the other . Amendment . Ill 185 . But this motion is liable to be superseded b ' a motion to postpone to a da- certain ; so that , amendment and postponement competing , the latter is to be first put . The reason is , that a question for amendment is not suppressed b ' postponing or adjourning the principal question , but remains before the assembly whenever the main question is resumed ; for otherwise it might happen that the occasion for other urgent business might go by and be lost by length of debate on the amendment , if the assembly had no power to postpone the whole subject . 186 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motion to commit ; so that the latter , though subsequently moved , is to be first put , because , " in truth , it facilitates and befriends the motion to amend . " 187 . The effect of both a negative and an affirmative decision of amendments has already been considered ( 94 to 127 ) . 112 Parliamentary Practice . /z/ 18 &; When several subjects are before the assembly , that is , on their table for consideration ( for there can be but a single subject under consideration at the same time ) , and no priority has been given to any one over another , the presiding oflScer is not precisely bound to any order as to what matters shall be first taken up ; but is left to his own discretion , unless the assembly on a question decide to take up a particular subject . 189 . A settled order of business , however , where the proceedings of an assembly are likely to last a considerable time , and the matters before it are somewhat numerous , is useful if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restrain individual members from calling up favorite measures , or matters under their special charge , out of their just time . It is also desirable for directing the discretion of the assembly , when a motion is made to take up a particular matter , to the prejudice of others which are of right Order of Proceeding , 113 entitled to be first attended to in the general order of business . 190 . The order of business may be established in virtue of some general rule , or by special orders relating to each particular subject , and must , of course , necessarily ' depend upon the nature and amount of the matters before the assembly . 191 . The natural order in considering and amending any paper which consists of several distinct propositions is , to begin at the beginning , and proceed through it by paragraphs ; and this order of proceeding , if strictl- adhered to , as it should always be in numerous assemblies , would prevent any amendment in a former part from being admissible after a latter part had been amended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to be observed in smaller bodies , in which it may often be advantageous to allow of going from one part of a paper to another , for the purpose of amendments . 192 . To this natural order of beginning at the beginning , there is one exception according to parliamentar ' usage , where a resolution or series of resolutions , or other paper , has a preamble or title ; in which case , the preamble 114 Parliamentary Practice . or title is postponed until the residae of the paper is gone through with . 193 . In considering a proposition consisting of several paragraphs , the course is , for the whole paper to be read entirelj ' through , in the first place , by the clerk ; then a second time , b ' the presiding officer , b ' paragraphs ; pausing at the end of each , and putting questions for amending , if amendments are proposed ; and , when the whole paper has been gone through with in this manner , the presiding oflScer puts the final question on agreeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unamended. 194 . When a paper which has been referred to a committee , and reported back to the assembly , is taken up for consideration , the amendments only are first read , in course , by the clerk . The presiding officer then reads the first , and puts it to the question , and so on until the whole are adopted or rejected , before SLuy other amendment is admitted , with the exception of an amendment to an amendment . When the amendments reported by the committee have been thus disposed of , the presiding officer pauses , and gives time for amendments to be proposed in the assembly Order of Proceeding , 115 to the body of the paper ( which he also does , if the paper has been reported without amendments , putting no questions but on amendments proposed ) ; and , when through the whole , he puts the question on agreeing to or adopting the paper , as the resolution , order , &c.,; of the assembly . 195 . The final question is sometimes stated merely on the acceptance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeing with the committee in the resolution , order , or whatever else the conclusion of the report may be , as amended or without amendment ; and the resolution or order is then to be entered in the journal as the resolution , &c.,; of the assembly and not as the report of the committee accepted . 196 . When the paper referred to a committee is reported back , as amended , in a new draft ( which may be and often is done , where the amendments are numerous and comparatively unimportant ) , the new draft is to be considered as an amendment , and is to be first amended , if necessar and then put to the question as an amendment reported b ' the committee ; or , the course may be first to accept the new draft as a substitute for the original paper , and then to treat it as such . 116 Parliamentary Practice . 197 . It often happens , that , besides a principal question , there are several others connected with it , pending at the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , suppose , firsts a principal motion ; second a motion to amend ; thirds a motion to commit ; fourth the preceding motions being pending , a question of order arises in the deb'iite , which gives occasion , /iJ/i , to a question of privilege ; and this leads , sixths to a subsidiary motion , as , to lie on the table . The regular course of proceeding requires the motion to lie on the table , to be first put ; if this is negatived , the question of privilege is then settled ; after that comes the question of order ; then the question of commitment ; if that is negatived , the question of amendment is taken ; and , lastlj ' , the main question . This example will sufficiently illustrate the manner in which questions may grow out of one another , and in what order thej are to be decided. 198 . When a motion is made and seconded , it is the duty of the presiding officer to propose * The order of motions , for the disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , iu legislative assemblies . See note to pai-agraph 61 . Order of Proceeding , 117 it to the assembly : until this is done , it is not a question before the assembly , to be acted upon or considered in any manner ; and consequently it is not then in order for any member to rise either to debate it , or to make any motion in relation to it whatever . 199 . It is therefore a most unparliamentary and abusive proceeding to allow a principal motion , and a subsidiary one relating to it , to be proposed and stated together , and to be put to the question in their order ; as is done when a member moves a principal question , a resolution , for example , and , at the same time , the previous question , or that the resolution lie on the table . In such a case , the presiding officer should take no notice whatever of the subsidiary motion , but should propose the principal one by itself in the usual manner , before allowing any other to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their rights in debate , &c.,; in relation to the subject moved . 200 . When a member has obtained the floor , he can not be cut off from addressing the assembly on the one question before it ; nor , when speaking , can he be interrupted in his speech by any other member rising , and moving an 118 Parliamentary Practice . adjournment , or for the orders of the day , or by making any other privileged motion of the same kind : it being a general rule , that a member in possession of the floor , or proceeding with his speech , can not be taken down or interrupted but by a call to order ; and the question of order being decided , he is still to be heard through . A call for an adjournment , or for the orders of the day , or for the question , by gentlemen in their seats , is not a motion ; as no motion can be made without rising , and addressing the chair , and being called to by the presiding officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , which , though the member who has risen may respect them as an expression of the impatience of the assembly at further debate , do not prevent him from going on if he pleases . The rule stated in this paragraph , that a member speaking can not rightfully be interrupted in his ' speech , but by a call to order , does not make it the duty of the presiding officer to refuse to hear a member who rises and addresses the chair whilst another is speaking ; for , if this were the case , the presiding officer could very rarely know whether Order of Proceeding . 119 there might not be occasion for the interruption , and would thus be in danger of keeping the assembly in ignorance of matters which it might be of the highest concern for them to know . When , therefore , a member rises whilst another is speaking , and addresses the chair , he should inform the presiding officer that he rises to a point of order , or to the orders of the assembly , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of the presiding officer to direct the member speaking to suspend his remarks , or to resume his seat , and the member rising , to proceed with the statement of his point or other matter of order or of privilege . If the latter , on proceeding , discloses matter which shows that the interruption was proper , the subject so introduced must first be disposed of ; and then the member who was interrupted is to be directed to proceed with his speech . If it appears that there was no sufficient ground for the interruption , the member rising is to be directed to resume his seat ; and the member interrupted , to proceed with his speech . Every member , therefore , possessing the right to interrupt another in his speech , on a proper occasion , any wanton abuse of this right , for 120 Parliamentary Practice . the purpose of personal annoyance , is liable to censure and punishment ; it being itself a breach of order , unnecessarily and wantonly to call or interi'upt another member to order . In reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is allowed , it is to be observed , that thy are not restricted , as the language of 200 might seem to imply , to breaches of order in debate , on the part of the member speaking . Any matter of privilege affecting the assembly itself , or any of its members , of which the assembly ought to have instant information , furnishes such an occasion ; as , for example , where access to the place of sitting of the assembly is obstructed , or the person of a member is attacked ; or where something connected with the proceeding of the assembW requires instant attention , as where it becomes necessary to have lights ; or where something occurs relative to the member himself who is speaking , as where he is annoyed and disturbed by noise and disorder , or where , in consequence of his strength failing him , it becomes necessary that he should finish his speech sitting . Order m Debate . 121 /z/ 201 . Debate in a deliberative assembly must be distinguished from forensic debate , or that which takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in theory at least , more the expression of individual opinions among the members of the same body ; the latter more a contest for victory between the disputants , before a distinct and independent body : the former not admitting of replies ; the latter regarding reply as the right of one of the parties. 20Z It is a general rule , in all deliberative assemblies , that the presiding officer shall not participate in the debate or other proceedings , in any other capacity than as such officer . He is only allowed , therefore , to state matters of fact within his knowledge ; to inform the assembly on points of order or the course of proceeding , when called upon for An exception to this rule is sometimes made in favor of the mover of a question , who is allowed , at the close of the debate , to reply to the arguments brought ainst his motion ; but this is a matter of favor and indulgence , and not of right 122 Parliamentary Practice . that purpose , or when he finds it necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on questions of order , to address the assembly in debate . Section I. As to the Manner of Speaking . 203 . When a member desires to address the assembly on any subject before it ( as well as to make a motion ) , he is to rise and stand up in his place , uncovered , and to address himself not to the assembly or any particular member , but to the presiding officer , who , on hearing him , calls to him by his name , that the assembly may take notice who it is that speaks , and give their attention accordingly . If any question arises , as to who shall be entitled to the floor where several members rise at or nearly at the same time , it is decided in the manner alreadj described ( 46 ) , as to obtaining the floor to make a motion . 204 . It is customary , indeed , for the presiding officer , after a motion has been made , seconded , and proposed , to give the floor to the mover , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member , instead of proposing his motion at first , proceeds wit his speech ; but in such a case he is liable to be taken down to order , unless he states that he intends to conclude with a motion , and informs the assembly what that motion is ; and then he may be allowed to pitceed . Order in Debate . 123 to speak ; or , on resuming a debate after an adjournment , to give the floor , if he desires it , to the mover of the adjournment , in preference to other members ; or , where two or more members claim the floor , to prefer him who is opposed to the measure in question : but , in all these cases , the determination of the presiding oflScer may be overruled by the assembly . 205 . It is sometimes thought , that when a member in the course of debate breaks off his speech , and gives up the floor to another for a particular purpose , he is entitled to it again as of right , when that purpose is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when a member gives up the floor for one purpose , he does so for all ; and it is not possible for the presiding oflScer to take notice of and enforce agreements of this nature between members . 206 . No person , in speaking , is to mention a member then present by his name ; but to describe him by his seat in the assembly , or as the member who spoke last , or last but one , or on the other side of the question , or by some other equivalent expression . The purpose of this rule is to guard as much as possible against the excitement of all personal 124 Parliamentary Practice . feeling , either of favor or of hostilit ' , by se2 : ) arating , as it were , the official from the personal character of each member , and having regard to the former only in the debate . 207 . If the presiding officer rises up to speak , any other member who maj ' have risen for the same purpose ought to sit down , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this rule does not authorize the presiding officer to interrupt a member whilst speaking , or to cut off one to whom he has given the floor : he must wait like other members , until such member has done speaking . The rule stated in this paragraph does not , of course , preclude the presiding officer from interrupting a member whilst speaking , whenever a proper occasion occurs for such an interruption. ; as , for example , when the member himself is guilty of a breach of order . 208 . A member , whilst speaking , must remain standing in his place , uncovered ; and , when he has finished his speech , he ought to resume his seat ; but if unable to stand without pain or inconvenience , in consequence of age , sickness , or other infirmity , he may be indulged to speak sitting . Matter in Speaking . 125 Sect . II . As to the Matter in Speaking . 209 . Every question that can be made in a deliberative assembly is susceptible of being debated according to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expressing his opinion upon it . Hence it is a general rule , and the principal one relating to this matter , that , in debate , those who speak are to confine themselves to the question , and not to speak impertinently or beside the subject . So long as a member has the floor , and keeps within the rule , he may speak for as long a time as he pleases ; though , if an uninteresting speaker trespasses too much upon the time and patience of the assembly , the members seldom fail to show their dissatisfaction in some way or other , which induces him to bring his remarks to a close . In the legislative assemblies of this country , it is usual to provide by a special rule , that certain questions shall be decided without debate . Among these ; the most common is the motion to adjourn . In the absence , how- 1 In legislative bodies , it is usual to provide that certain questions , as , for example , to adjourn , to lie on the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business , shall be decidea without debate . 126 Parliamentary Practice . ever , of a special rule restricting the right of debate in reference to some particular subject , every question , with the exception perhaps of those which require unanimity , that may be moved , may be debated . In both houses of parliament , important debates have frequently taken place on motions , as , for example , to adjourn , which in the legislative assemblies of this country would not generally be considered debatable . 210 . It is also a rule , that no person , in speaking , is to use indecent language against the proceedings of the assembly , or to reflect upon any of its prior determinations , unless he means to conclude his remarks with a motion to rescind such determination ; but while a proposition under consideration is still pending , and not adopted , though it may have been reported by a committee , reflections on it are no reflections on the assembly . The rule applies equally ' to the proceedings of committees ; which are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another rule in speaking is , that no member is at liberty to digress from the matter of the question , to fall upon the person of another , and to speak reviling , nipping , or /z/ Matter in Speaking . 127 unmannerly words of or to him . The nature or consequences of a measure msy be reprobated in strong terms ; but to arraign the motives of those who advocate it , is a personalit ' and against order . 212 . It is very often an extremely difficult and delicate matter to decide whether the remarks of a member are pertinent or relevant to the question ; but it will in general be safe for the presiding officer to consider them so , unless they very clearly reflect in an improper manner either upon the person or motives of a member , or upon the proceedings of the assembly , or the member speaking digresses from , or manifestly mistakes the question . 213 . It often happens , in the consideration of a subject , that , whilst the general question remains the same , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , for example , the general question is on the adoption of a series of resolutions , the particular question may , at one moment , be on an amendment ; at another , on postponement ; and , again , on the previous question . In all these cases , the particular question supersedes , for the time , the main question ; and those who speak to it must confine their remarks 128 Parliamentary Practice . accordingly . The enforcement of order in this respect requires the closest attention on the part of the presiding officer . It sometimes happens , that a question under debate becomes enlarged rather than naiTowed , by the introduction of the subsidiary motion ; as , for example , when an amendment is moved , which involves in itself the merits of the original proposition , in which case the debate may embrace both . 214 . When a member is interrupted b ' the presiding officer , or called to order b ' a member , for irrelevancy or departing from the question , a question msiy be made as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the manner he was speaking when he was interrupted ; but if no question is made , or if one is made and decided in the negative , he is still to be allowed to proceed in order , that is , abandoning the objectionable course of remark . Sect . III . As to Times of Speaking . The general rule in all deliberative assemblies , unless it is otherwise specially provided , is , that no member shall speak more TimeB of Speaking , 129 than once to the same question ; although the debate on that question may be adjourned and continued through several dajs , and although a member who desires to speak a second time has , in the course of the debate , changed his opinion . 216 . This rule refers to the same question , technically considered ; for if a resolution is moved and debated , and then referred to a committee , those who speak on the introduction of the motion may speak again on the question presented bj ' the report of the committee , though it is substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have spoken on the principal or main question may speak again on all the subsidiary or incidental questions arising in the course of the debate . The rule stalled in this and the preceding paragraphs refers solely to the question technically considered , and is whoUy irrespective of the subject matter . No member can speak more than once to the same question ; but he may speak to the same subject as often as it The mover and seconder , if they do not speak to the question at the time when the motion is made and seconded , have the same right with other members to address the assembly . 130 Parliamentary Practice , is presented in the form of a different question . 217 . The rule as to speaking but once on a question , if strictly enforced , will prevent a member from speaking a second time without the general consent of the assembly , so long as there is any other member who himself desires to speak ; but , when all who desire to speak have spoken , a member may speak a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 218 . A member may also be permitted to speak a second time in the same debate , in order to clear a matter of fact , or merel- to explain himself in some material part of his speech ; or to the orders of the assembly , if they be transgressed ( although no question may be made ) , but carefuU ' keeping within that line , and not falling into the matter itself . The expression in this paragraph , ' ' to clear a matter of fact , " denotes merely a statement , by a member who has already spokeii , of facts which he considers it important for the assembly to be possessed of before coming to a vote upon the question pending . 219 . It is sometimes supposed , that , because a member has a right to explain himself , he therefore has a right to interrupt another Stopping Debate . 131 member whilst speaking , in order to make the explanation ; but this is a mistake : he should wait until the member speaking has finished ; and if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explanation , he relinquishes it altogether . Sect . IV . As to Stopping Debate . 220 . The only mode in use in this country , until recently , for the purpose of putting an end to an unprofitable or tiresome debate , was by moving the previous question ; the efleet of which motion , as already explained , if decided in the affirmative , is to require the main or principal question to be immediately taken . When this question is moved , therefore , it necessarily suspends all further consideration of the main question , and precludes all further debate or amendment of it ; though , ag has been seen , it stands in the same degree with postponement , amendment , and commitment , and , unless in virtue of a special rule , can not be moved while either of those motions is pending . 221 . The other mode of putting an end to debate , which has recently been introduced 132 Parliamentary Practice . into use , is for the assemblj- to adopt beforehand a special order in reference to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all debate upon it shall cease , and all motions or questions pending in relation to it shall be decided . 222 . Another rule , which has lately been introduced for the purpose of shortening rather than stopping debate is , that no member shall be permitted to speak more than a certain specified time on any question ; so that , when the time allotted has expired , the presiding officer announces the fact , and the member speaking resumes his seat . Sect . V. As to Decorum in Debate . 223 . Every member having the right to be heard , every other member is bound to conduct himself in such a manner that this right may be effectual . Hence it is a rule of order , as well as of decency , that no member is to disturb another in his speech b hissing , coughing , spitting ; by speaking or whispering ; by passing between the presiding oflScer and the member speaking ; by going across the assembly-room , or walking up and down Decorum in Debate . 133 in it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or disconcert a member who is speaking . 224 . But if a member speaking finds that he is not regarded with that respectful attention which his equal right demands ,  --  that it is not the inclination of the assembty to hear him , and that by conversation or any other noise thej ' endeavor to drown his voice ,  --  it is his most prudent course to submit himself to the pleasure of the assembly and to sit down ; for it scarcely ever happens , that the members of an assembly are guilt- of this piece of ill manners without soiiie excuse or provocation , or that they are so wholly inattentive to one who saj 's any thing worth their hearing . 225 . It is the duty of the presiding officer , in such a case , to endeavor to reduce the assembly to order and decorum ; but if his repeated calls to order , and his appeals to the good sense and decency of the members , prove ineffectual , it then becomes his duty to call by name any member who obstinately persists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw ; who is- then to be heard , if he desires it , in exculpation , and to withdraw : then the presiding officer 134 Parliamentary Practice . states the offence committed , and the assembly considers of the kind and degree of punishment to be inflicted . 226 . If , on repeated trials , the presiding officer finds that the assembly will not support him in the exercise of his authority , he will then be justified , but not till then , in permitting without censure every kind of disorder . Sect . VI . As to Disorderly Words . If a member , in speaking , makes use of language which is personally offensive to another , or insulting to the assembly , and the member offended , or any other , thinks proper to complain of it to the assembly , the course of proceeding is as follows . The offence of disorderly words may be committed , not only b ' language used in the course of debate , but also by words used in making a motion or report . 228 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , by another or several members rising , and calling to order ; and the member who objects or complains of the words is then called upon by the presiding officer to state the words Disorderly Words . 136 which he complains of , repeating them exactly as he conceives them to have been spoken , in order that they may be reduced to writing by the clerk ; or the member complaining , without being so called upon , may proceed at once to state the words either verbally or in writing , and desire that the clerk may take them down at the table . The presiding officer may then direct the clerk to take them down ; but if he sees the objection to be a trivial one , and thinks there is no foundation for their being thought disorderly , he will prudently delay giving any such directions , in order not unnecessarily to interrupt the proceedings ; though if the members generally seem to be in favor of having the words taken down , by calling out to that effect , or by a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should certainly order the clerk to take them down in the form and manner in which they are stated b ' the member who objects . 229 . The words objected to being thus written down , and forming a part of the minutes in the clerk 's book , they are next to be read to the member who was speaking , who may deny that those are the words which he spoke ; in which case the assembly must decide by 136 Parliamentary Practice . a question , whether the ' - are the words or not . If he does not deny that he spoke those words , or when the assembly has itself determined what the words are , then the member may either justify them , or explain the sense in which he used them , so as to remove the objection of their being disorderly ; or he may make an apology for them . 230 . If the justification or explanation or apology of the member is thought sufficient by the assembly ' , no further proceeding is necessary ; the member may resume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumed , unless some further motion is made , to be satisfied : but if an ' two members ( one to make and the other to second the motion ) think it necessary to state a question , so as to take the sense of the assembly upon the words , and whether the member in using them has been guilty of an ' offence towards the assembly , the member must withdraw before that question is stated ; and then the sense of the assembly must be taken , and such further proceedings had in relation to punishing the member , as may be thought necessary and proper . 1 The words , as written down , may be amended so as to conform to what the assembly thinks to be the truth . Disorderly Words . 137 The above is the course of proceeding established by the writers of greatest authority and ought invariably to be pursued . it might , however , be improved , by the member who objects to words writing them down at once , and thereupon moving that they be made a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be relieved from the responsibility of determining , in the fii*st instance , upon the character of the words . 23Z If offensive words are not taken notice of at the time they are spoken , * but the member is allowed to finish his speech , and then any other person speaks , or any other matter of business intervenes , before notice is taken of the words which gave offence , the words are not to be written down , or the member using them censured . This rule is established for the common security of all the members , and to prevent the mistakes which must necessarily happen if words complained of are not immediately reduced to writing . /z/ 233 . When any proposition is made to a deliberative assembly , it is called a motion ; when it is stated or propounded to the assembly for their acceptance or rejection , it is denominated a question ; and , when adopted , it becomes the order resolution or votey of the assembly . 234 . All the proceedings which have thus far been considered have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form to be put to the question ; that is , to be adopted as the sense , will , or Judgment of the assembly , or to be rejected , according as such proposition ma ' be found to unite in its favor , or to fail of uniting , a majority of the members . 235 . When any proposition , whether principal , subsidiary , or incidental , or of whatever nature it may be , is made , seconded , and stated , if no alteration is proposed , or if it admits of none , or if it is amended , and the debate upon it , if any , appears to be brought to a close , the presiding officer then inquires Of the Question , 139 whether the assembly is ready for the question ; and , if no person rises , the question is then stated , and the votes of the assembly taken upon it . Strictly speaking , no question can arise in a deliberative assembly , without a motion being first made and seconded ; though sometimes , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted that a proper and usual motion is made ( when in fact it is not ) , and proposes a question accordingly . 236 . The question is not always stated to the assembly in the precise form in which it arises or is introduced : thus , for example , when a member presents a petition , or the chairman of a committee offers a report , the question which arises , if no motion is made , is . Shall the petition or the report he received ? and so , when the previous question is moved , it is stated in this form . Shall the main question he now put ? the question being stated , in all cases , in the form in which it will appear on the journal , if it passes in the affirmative . 237 . In matters of trifling importance , or which are generally of course , such as receiving petitions and reports , withdrawing motions , reading papers , &c.,; the presiding 140 Parliamentary Practice . officer most commonly supposes or takes for granted the consent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not go through the fonnality of taking the question by a vote . But if , after a vote has been taken in this informal way and declared , any member rises to object , the presiding officer should consider every thing that has passed as nothing , and at once go back and pursue the regular course of proceeding . Thus , if a petition is received , without a question , and the clerk is proceeding to read it in the usual order of business , if any one rises to object , it will be the safest and most proper course for the presiding officer to require a motion for receiving it to be regularly made and seconded . 238 . The question being stated by the presiding officer , he first puts it in the affirmative : namely . As many as are of opinion that repeating the words of the question say Aye ; and immediately all the members who are of that opinion answer 6 . The presiding officer then puts the question negativel ' : As many as are of a different opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that opinion answer JVb . The presiding officer Of the Question . 141 judges by his ear which side has " the more voices/ ' and decides accordingly that the ayes Jiave ity or the noes have it as the case may be . If the presiding officer is doubtful as to the majority of voices , he may put the question a second time ; and if he is still unable to decide , or if , having decided according to his judgment , any member rises and declares that he believes the ayes or the noes ( whichever it may be ) have it , contrary to the declaration of the presiding officer , then the presiding officer directs the assembly to divide , in order that the members on the one side and the other msiy be counted . 239 . If , however , any new motion should be made after the presiding officer 's declaration , or if a member who was not in the assembly-room when the question was taken should come in , it will then be too late to contradict the presiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The above is the parliamentarj ' form of taking a question , and is in general use in this country ; but in some of our legislative assemblies , and especially in those of the The most common expression is , ** I doubt the vote ; * ' or , ' ** That vote is doubted . " 142 Parliamentary Practice . New England States , the suffrages are given by the members holding up their right hands , first those in the affirmative , and then those in the negative , of the question . If the presiding officer can not determine , by the show of hands , which side has the majority ' , he may call upon the members to vote again ; and if he is still in doubt , or if his declaration is questioned , a division takes place . When the question is taken in this manner , the presiding officer directs the meinbers , first on the affirmative side and then on the negative , to manifest their opinion by holding up the right hand . 24L When a division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members to range themselves on different sides of the assembly-room , and either counts them himself , or they are counted by tellers appointed by him for the purpose , or by monitors permanently appointed for that and other purposes ; or the members rise in their seats , first on the affirmative and then on the negative , and ( standing uncovered ) are counted in the same manner . When the members are counted by the presiding officer , he announces the numbers , and declares the result . When Of the Question* 143 they are counted b ' tellers or monitors , the tellers must first agree among themselves , and then the one who has told for the majority reports the numbers to the presiding oflScer , who thereupon declares the result . 242 . The best mode of dividing an assembly that is at all numerous is for the presiding oflScer to appoint tellers for each division or section of the assemblj-room , and then to require the members , first those in the aflSrmative and then those in the negative , to rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each side , the tellers of the several divisions make their returns , and the presiding oflScer declares the result . 243 . If the members are equally divided , it then becomes the duty of the presiding ofiScer to give the casting-vote ; in doing which he may , if he pleases , give his reasons . 243 a . Of course it is to be understood that a deliberative assembly would have the same power to regulate the speaker 's vote as to make any other rule . This , however , must always be subject to the organic law by which the assembly is constituted .  --  Ed. 244 . It is a general rule , that every member who is in the assembly-room at the time 144 Parliamentary Practice . when the question is stated has not only the right , but is bound , to vote ; and , on the other hand , that no member can vote who was not in the room at that time . 245 . The only other form of taking the question which requires to be described is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the names of the members voting on the one side and on the other are ascertained , and entered in the journal of the assembly This mode , which is peculiar to the legislative bodies of the United States , is called taking the question by yeas and na3 's . In order to take a question in this manner , it is stated on both sides at once : namely , As many as are of opinion that &c.,; mZZ , when their names are called answer Yes ; and . As mxiny cw are of a different opinion will , wJien their names are called , answer No , The roll of the assembly is then called over hy the clerk ; and each member , as his name is called , rises in his place , and answers yes or no , and the clerk notes the answer as the roll is called . When the roll has been gone through , the clerk reads over first the names of those who have answered in the affirmative , and then the names of those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order that if he has made any mistake in noting the answer , or if any member has made a mistake in his answer , the mistake of either may be corrected . Tlie names having been thus read over , and the mistakes , if any , corrected , the clerk counts the numbers on each side , and reports them to the presiding officer , who declares the result to the assembly . 246 . The following is the mode practised in the House of Representatives of Massachusetts ( which is one of the most numerous of all the legislative bodies in this country ) , of taking a question by yeas and nsiys . The names of the members being printed on a sheet , the clerk calls them in their order ; and , as each one answers , the clerk ( responding to the member at the same time ) places a figure in pencil , expressing the number of the answer , at the left or right of the name , according as the answer is yes or no ; so that the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answers on that side , and the two last numbers or figures represent the respective numbers of the affirmatives and negatives on the division . Thus , at the left hand of the name of the member who first answers Ye  --  , 146 Parliamentary Practice , the clerk places a figure 1 ; at the right hand of the first member who answers JVo , he also places a figure 1 ; the second member that answers yes is marked 2 ; and so on to the end of the list ; the side of the name on which the figure is placed denoting whether the answer is yes or no and the figure denoting the number of the answer on that side . The aflfirmatives and negatives are then read separately , if necessary , though this is usually omitted ; and the clerk is then prepared , by means of the last figure on each side , to give the numbers to the speaker , to be announced to the house . The names and answers are afterwards recorded on the journal . 247 . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is first put on one side and then on the other , it is no full question until the negative as well as the aflSrmative has been put . Consequentl ' , until the negative has been put , it is in order for any member , in the same manner as if the division had not commenced , to rise and speak , make motions for amendment or otherwise , and thus renew the debate ; and this whether such member was in the assembl3 ' - room , or not , when the question was put and partly taken . In such Of the Question , 147 a case , the question must be put over again on the affirmative , as well as the negative side ; for the reason , that members who were not in the a8sembl3 ' - room when the question was first put may have since come in , and also that some of those who voted may have since changed their minds . When a question is taken by yeas and nays , and the negative as well as the affirmative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side begins and proceeds at the same time , the question can not be opened and the debate renewed ' after the voting has commenced . 248 . If any question arises in a point of order , as , for example , as to the right or the duty of a member to vote during a division , the presiding officer must decide it peremptorily , subject to the revision and correction of the assembly after the division is over . In a case of this kind , there can be no debate , though the presiding officer may if he pleases receive the assistance of members with their advice , which they are to give sitting , in order to avoid even the appearance of a debate ; but this can onl ' be with the leave of the presiding officer , as otherwise the division might be prolonged to an inconvenient length ; nor 148 Parliamentary Practice . can any question be taken , for otherwise there might be division upon division without end . 249 . When , from counting the assembly on a division , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no decision ; but the matter in question continues in the same state in which it was before the division ; and when afterwards resumed , whether on the same or on some future day , it must be taken up at that precise point . Meconsideration. ' 149 /z/ 250 . It is a principle of parliamentary law , upon which many of the rules and proceedings previously stated are founded , that when a question has been once put to a deliberative assembly , and decided whether in the affirmative or negative , that decision is the judgment of the assembly , and can not be again brought into question . 251 . This principle holds equally , although the question proposed is not the identical question which has already been decided , but only its equivalent ; as , for example , where the negative of one question amounts to the affirmative of the other , and leaves no other alternative , these questions are the equivalents of one another , and a decision of the one necessarilj ' concludes the other . 252 . A common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of an amendment proposed by striking out words ; in which it is the invariable practice to consider the negative of striking out as 150 ' Parliamentary Practice , equivalent to the affirmative of agreeing ; so tliat to put a question on agreeing , after a question on striking out is negatived , would be , in effect , to put the same question twice over . 253 . The principle above stated does not apply so as to prevent putting the same question in the different stages of an proceeding , as , for example , in legislative bodies , the different stages of a bill : so , in considering reports of committees , questions already taken and decided before the subject was referred may be again proposed ; and in like manner orders of the assembly and instructions or references to committees , may be discharged or rescinded. 254 . The inconvenience of this rule , which is still maintained in all its strictness in the British Parliament ( though divers expedients are there resorted to , to counteract or evade it ) , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrj- , of the motion for reconsideration ; which , while it recognizes and upholds the rule in all its ancient strictness , yet allows a deliberative assembly ' , for sufficient reasons , to relieve itself from the embarrassment and inconven- Reconaideration. 161 fence which would occasionally result from a strict enforcement of the rule in a particular case . 255 . It has now come to be a common practice in all our deliberative assemblies , and may consequentl ' be considered as a principle of the common parliamentary law of this country , to reconsider a vote already passed , whether affirmatively or negatively . 256 . For this purpose , a motion is made and seconded , in the usual manner , that such a vote be reconsidered ; and , if this motion prevails , the matter stands before the assembly in precisel ' the same state and condition , and the same questions are to be put in relation to it , as if the vote reconsidered had never been passed . Thus , if an amendment by inserting words is moved and rejected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assembly may reconsider the vote by which it was rejected ; and then the question will recur on the amendment , precisely as if the former vote had never been passed . 257 . It is usual in legislative bodies , to regulate hy a special rule the time , manner , and by whom , a motion to reconsider may be made ; thus , for example , that it shall be made 152 Parliamentary Practice . /z/ onlj ' on the same or a succeeding da3 ' , by a member who voted with the majority , or at a time when there are as manj members present as there were when the vote was passed ; but , where there is no special rule on the subject , a motion to reconsider must be considered in the same light as any other motion , and as subject to no other rules . Proceedings analogous in principle to the motion for reconsideration appear occasionally , though very rarely , to have been admitted in the British Parliament ; but it is believed the motion to reconsider , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The motion is , in form , that such a vote be reconsidered ; in substance , that the subject of that vote be again considered , upon the original motion , as if that motion had never been considered and passed upon . On the motion to reconsider , the whole subject is as much open for debate as if it had not been discussed at all ; and , if the motion prevail , the subject is again open for debate on the original motion , in the same manner as if that motion had never been put to the question . Committees . 153 /z/ Section I. Their Nature and Functions . It is usual in all deliberative assemblies , to take the preliminary ( sometimes also the intermediate ) measures , and to prepare matters to be acted upon in the assembly , by means of committees composed either of members specially selected for the particular occasion , or appointed beforehand for all matters of the same nature . 259 . Committees of the first kind are usually called select the others standing  --  though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to distinguish them from another form of committee , constituted either for a particular occasion or for all cases of a certain kind , which is composed of all the members of the assembly and therefore denominated a committee of the whole . 260 . The advantages of proceeding in this mode are manifold . It enables a deliberative assembly to do many things which , from its 154 Parliamentary Practice . numbers , it would otherwise be unable to do ; to accomplish a much greater quantit ' of business , by dividing it among the members , than could possibly be accomplished if the whole body were obliged to devote itself to each particular subject ; and to act in the preliminary and preparatory steps , with a greater degree of freedom than is compatible with the forms of proceeding usually observed in full assembly . 261 . Committees are appointed to consider a particular subject either at large or under special instructions ; to obtain information in reference to a matter before the assembly , either by personal inquiry and inspection , or by the examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper form , for the adoption of the assembly , all resolutions , votes , orders , and other papers , with which they may be charged . Committees are commonly said to be the " eyes and ears * ' of the assembly ; it is equally true , that for certain purposes they are also its " head and hands . " 262 . The powers and functions of committees depend chiefly upon the general authority and particular instructions given them by the assembly at the time of their appointment ; but they may also be , and ver often are , fur- Appointment of Committees . 155 ther instructed whilst they are in the exercise of their functions ; and sometimes it even happens , that these additional instructions wholly change the nature of a committee , by charging it with inquiries quite ditferent from those for which it was originally established . Sect . II . Their Appointment . 263 . In the manner of appointing committees , there is no difference between standing and other select committees , as to the mode of selecting the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , as there is no selection of members , they are appointed simply by the order of the assembly . 264 . In the appointment of select committees , the first thing to be done is to fix upon the number . This is usually effected in the same manner that blanks are filled ; namel " , by members proposing , without the formality of a motion , such numbers as the please , which are then separatelj ' put to the question , begining with the largest , and going regularly through to the smallest , until the assembly comes to a vote . 265 . The number being settled , there are three modes of selecting the members ; to wit , 156 Parliamentary Practice . by the appointment of the presiding officer by ballot , and by nomination and vote of the assembly : the first sometimes in virtue of a standing rule , sometimes in pursuance of a vote of the assembly ' in a particular case ; the second always in pursuance of a vote ; the last in the usual course where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose sittings are of considerable length , as legislative bodies , it is usual to provide by a standing rule , that , unless otherwise ordered in a particular case , all committees shall be named by the presiding officer . Where this is the case , whenever a committee is ordered and the number settled , the presiding officer at once names the meml5ers to compose it . Sometimes also the rule fixes the number of which , unless otherwise ordered , committees shall consist . This mode of appointing a committee is frequently resorted to where there is no rule on the subject . 267 . When a committee is ordered to be appointed by ballot , the members are chosen by the assembly , either singl ' or all together , as may be ordered , in the same manner that other elections are made ; and in such elections , as in other cases of the election of the Appointment of Committees . 157 officers of the assembly , a majority of all the votes given in is necessary to a choice . 268 . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the names of the members proposed are put to the question singly , and approved or rejected by the assembly by a vote taken in the usual manner . If the nomination is directed to be made by the presiding officer , he may propose the names in the same manner , or all at once ; the former mode being the most direct and simple , the latter enabling the assembly to vote more understandingly upon the several names proposed . When the nomination is directed to be made at large , the presiding officer calls upon the assembly to nominate ; and , names being mentioned accordingly , he puts to vote the first name he hears . 269 . It is also a compendious mode of appointing a committee , to revive one which has already discharged itself by a report ; or by charging a committee appointed for one purpose , with some additional duty of the same or a different character . 270 . In regard to the appointment of committees , so far as the selection of the members is concerned , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a bill is to be referred , that none who speak directly against the body of it are to be of the committee , for the reason that he who would totally destroy will not amend ; but that , for the opposite reason , those who only take exceptions to some particulars in the bill are to be of the committee . This rule supposes the purpose of the commitment to be , not the consideration of the general merits of the bill , but the amendment of it in its particular provisions so as to make it acceptable to the assembly . 271 . This rule , of course , is onl ' for the guidance of the presiding officer and the members in the exercise of their discretion ; as the assembly ma ' refuse to excuse from serving , or may itself appoint , on a committee , persons who are opposed to the subject referred . It is customar however , in all deliberative assemblies , to constitute a committee of such persons ( the mover and seconder of a measure being of course appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are favorably inclined to the measure proposed . 272 . When a committee has been appointed in reference to a particular subject , it is the duty of the secretary of the assembly to make Organization of Committees . 159 out a list of the members , together with a certified cop* of the authority or iustructions under which they are to act , and to give the papers to the member first named on the list of the committee , if convenient ; but , otherwise , to any other member of the committee . Sect . III . Their Organization , and Manner of Proceeding . 273 . The person first named on a committee acts as its chairman , or presiding officer , so far as relates to the preliminary steps to be taken , and is usuall- permitted to do so through the whole proceedings ; but this is a matter of courtes " , every committee having a right to elect its own chairman , who presides over it , and makes the report of its proceedings to the assembly ' . 274 . A committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time and place of its meeting , and can not regularly sit at an ' other time or place ; and it may be ordered to sit immediately ' , whilst the assembly is sitting , and make its report forthwith . 275 . When no directions are given , a committee ma ' select its own time and place of 160 Parliamentary Practice . meeting ; but , without a special order to that effect , it is not at liberty to sit whilst the assembly . sits ; and , if a committee is sitting when the assembly comes to order after an adjournment , it is the duty of the chairman to rise instantly , on being certified of it , and , with the other members , to attend the service of the assembly . 276 . In regard to its forms of proceeding , a committee is essentially a miniature assembly : it can only act when regularly assembled together as a committee , and not by separate consultation and consent of the members , nothing being the agreement or report of a committee but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in committee is as binding as a vote of the assembly ; a majority of the members is necessary to constitute a quorum for business , unless a larger or smaller number has been fixed by the assembly itself ; and a committee has full power over whatever ma ' be committed to it , except that it is not at liberty to change the title or subject . The statement contained in this paragraph , that a majority of the members of a committee is sufficient to constitute a quorum for pro- Proceedings of Committees . 161 ceeding with business , unless the number should be otherwise fixed by the assembly itself ; was made upon the supposition that in this country the rule had been so settled by usage . It should also have been stated at the same time , as the parliamentary rule , that the presence of every member is essential , and that of a majority is not sufiScient , to constitute a committee . In all places , therefore , where there is any doubt as to the existence of the usage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be fixed by the assembly itself , either by a general rule , or by the order for the appointment of the committee . 277 . A committee which is under no directions as to the time and place of meeting may meet when and where it pleases , and adjourn itself from da ' to day or otherwise , until it has gone through with the business committed to it ; but if it is ordered to meet at a particular time , and it fails of doing so for any cause , the committee is closed , and can not act without being newlj* directed to sit . 278 . Disorderly words spoken in a committee must be written down in the same manner as in the assembly ; but the committee , as such , can do nothing more than report them 162 Parliamentary Practice . to the assembly for its animadversion ; neither can a committee punish disorderl conduct of any other kind , but must report it to the assembly . 279 . When any paper is before a committee , whether select or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee , or have been referred to them ; and in either case , when the paper comes to be considered , the course is for it to be first read entirely through by the clerk of the committee , if there is one , otherwise by the chairman ; and then to be read through again by paragraphs , by the chairman , pausing at the end of each paragraph , and putting questions for amending , either by striking out or inserting , if proposed . This is the natural order of proceeding in considering and amending any paper , and is to be strictly adhered to in the assembly ; but the same strictness does not seem necessary in a committee . 280 . If the paper before a committee is one which has originated with the committee , questions are put on amendments proposed , but not on agreeing to the several paragraphs of which it is composed , separately , as they are gone through with ; this being reserved Proceedings of Committees , 163 for the close , when a question is to be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended or unamended. 281 . It the paper be one which has been referred to the committee , they proceed as in the other case to put questions of amendment , if proposed , but no final question on the whole ; because all parts of the paper , having been passed upon if not adopted b ' the assembly ' as the basis of its action , stand of eoui-se , unless altered or struck out b ' a vote of the assembly ' . And even if the committee are opposed to the whole paper , and are of opinion that it can not be made good b ' amendments , they have no authority ' to reject it : they must report it back to the assembly , without amendments ( specially stating their objections , if they think proper ) , and there make their opposition as individual members . ' 282 . In the case of a paper originating with a committee , they may erase or interline it as much as they please ; though , when finally agreed to , it ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erasure or interlineation . This rule is not applicable , of course , to those cases in which the subject , as weU as the form or detaUi of a paper , is referred to the committee . 16i Parliamentary Practice , . But , in the case of a paper referred to a committee , they are not at libert ' to erase , interline , blot , disfigure , or tear it in any manner ; but they must in a separate paper set down the amendments they have agreed to report , stating the words which are to be inserted or omitted , and the places where the amendments are to be made , by references to the paragraph or section , line , and word . 284 . If the amendments agreed to are very numerous and minute , the committee may report them altogether , in the form of a new and amended draft . 285 . When a committee has gone through the paper , or agreed upon a report on the subject , which has been referred to them , it is then moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee rise , and that the chaiiman or some other member make their report to the assembly . Sect . IV . Their Report . 286 . When the report of a committee is to be made , the chairman , or member appointed to make the report , standing in his place , informs the assembly that the committee to Proceedings of Committees . 165 whom was referred such a subject or paper have , accorduig to order , had the same under consideration , and have directed him to make a report thereon , or to report the same with sundry amendments , or without amendment , as the case ma- be , which he is ready to do when the assembly shall please ; and he or any other member may then move that the report be now received . On this motion being made , the question is put whether the assembly will receive the report at that time ; and a vote passes accordingly , either to receive it then , or fixing upon some future time for its reception . In this and the succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no notice is taken of what is commonly known in this country as a minority report ; in reference to which , it being now a proceeding of frequent occurrence , though not strictly parliamentary , some explanation seems necessary and proper . The report of a committee being the conclusion which is agreed to by a majority of the members , the dissenting or not-agreeing members , according to strict parliamentary practice , would have no other mode of bringing their views before the assembly ' , than as 166 Parliamentary Practice . individual members . Inasmucli , however , as such members may be supposed to have given the subject equal consideration with the other members of the committee , and ma ' therefore be in possession of views and opinions equall ' worth ' of the attention of the assembly , the practice has become general in the legislative assemblies of this country , to allow members in the minority to present their views and conclusions in the parliamentary ' form of a report , which is accordingly known b ' the somewhat incongruous appellation of a minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unite in such a report , or each one of them may express his views in a separate document . A minority ' report is not recognized as a report of the committee , or acted upon as such : it is received by courtesy , and allowed to accompany the report , as representing the opinions of the minorit ' ; and , in order to its being adopted hy the assembly , it must be moved as an amendment to the report , when that comes to be considered . 287 . At the time when , by the order of the assembly , the report is to be received , the chairman reads it in his place , and then Proceedings of Committees , 167 delivers it , together with all the papers connected with it , to the clerk at the table ; where it is again read , and then lies on the table until the time assigned , or until it suits the convenience of the assembly to take it up for consideration . 28 &; If the report of the committee is of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coherence in the paper , whatever it may be , and opens the alterations , and the reasons of the committee for the amendments , until he has gone through the whole ; and , when the report is read at the clerk 's table , the amendments only are read without the coherence . 289 . In practice , however , the formalit ' of a motion and vote on the reception of a report is usually dispensed with ; though if any objection is made , or if the presiding officer sees an- informality in the report , he should decline receiving it without a motion and vote ; and a report , if of an ' considerable length , is seldom read , either by the chairman in his place or by the clerk at the table , until it is taken up for consideration . In legislative assemblies , the printing of reports generally renders the reading of them unnecessary . 168 Parliamentary Practice . 290 . The report of a committee being made and received , the committee is dissolved , and can act no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be revived by a vote , and the same matter recommitted to them . If a report , when offered to the assembly , is not received , the committee is not thereby ' discharged , but may be ordered to sit again , and a time and place appointed accordingly . 291 . When a subject or paper has been once committed , and a report made upon it , it may be recommitted either to the same or a different committee ; and , if a report is recommitted before it has been agreed to by the assembly ' , what has heretofore passed in the committee is of no validity , the whole question being again before the committee as if nothmg had passed there in relation to it . 292 . The report of a committee ma ' be made in three different forms : namely , jrs , it ma contain merely a statement of facts , reasoning , or opinion , in relation to the subject of it , without an specific conclusion ; or , second a statement of facts , reasoning , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some other specific proposition ; or , thirds it ma ' consist merely of such Proceedings of Committees . 169 resolutions or propositions , without any introductory part . 293 . The first question on a report is , in strictness , on receiving it ; though in practice this question is seldom or never made ; the consent of the assembly , especially in respect to the report of a committee of the whole , being generally presumed , unless objection is made . When a report is received , whether by general consent or upon a question and vote , the committee is dischaied ; and the report becomes the basis of the future proceedings of the assembly , on the subject to which it relates . 294 . At the time assigned for the consideration of a report , it may be treated and disposed of precisel ' like an " other proposition ( 59 to 77 ) ; and may be amended in the same manner ( 78 to 133 ) j both in the preliminary statement , reasoning , or opinion , if it contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it concludes : so if it consist merely of a statement , &c.; , without resolutions or of resolutions , &c.,; without any introductory part . 295 . The final question on a report , whatever form it may have , is usually stated on 170 Parliamentary Practice . its acceptance ; and , when accepted , the whole report is adopted by the assembly , and becomes the statement , reasoning , opinion , resolution , or other act , as the case may be , of the assembly ; the doings of a committee when agreed to , adopted , or accepted , becoming the acts of the assembly , in the same manner as if done originally hy the assembly itself , without the intervention of a committee . 296 . It would be better , however , and in stricter accordance with parliamentary rules , to state the final question on a report , according to the form of it . If the report contain merely a statement of facts , reasoning , or opinion , the question should be on acceptance ; if it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  the introductory part being consequently merged in the conclusion ,  --  the question should be on agreeing to the resolutions , or on adopting the order or other proposition , or on passing or coming to the vote recommended b ' the committee ; and the same should be the form of the question when the report consists merely of resolutions , &c.,; without any introductory part . Committee of the Whole . 171 Sec5t . V. Committee of the Whole . 297 . When a subject has been ordered to be referred to a committee of the whole , the form of going from the assembly ' into committee is , for the presiding officer , at the time appointed for the committee to sit , on motion made and seconded for the purpose , to put the question that the assembly do now resolve itself into a committee of the whole , to take under consideration such a matter , naming it . K this question is determined in the affirmative , the result is declared by the presiding officer , who , naming some member to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , and takes a seat elsewhere like any other member ; and the person appointed chairman seats himself , not in the chair of the assembly ' , but at the clerk 's table . 298 . The chairman named by the presiding officer is generally acquiesced in b ' the committee ; though , like all other committees , a committee of the whole have a right to elect a chairman for themselves ; some member , by general consent , putting the question . The naming of the chairman of a committee of 172 Parliamentary Practice . the whole , by the presiding officer , which is supposed to be the usual practice in the legislative assemblies of this country , ordinarily takes place in virtue of a special rule . Where this is the case , the member so named becomes the chairman of the committee . But , where there is no such rule , some member is called upon ' by one or more of the members of the committee to take the chair ; and if no objection is made , or no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes the chairman . If objection is made , or any other member is called to the chair , the chairman must be regularl chosen . But , in order to do this , the presiding officer should resume the chair , and the choice be made by the assembly , acting as such , and not in committee . The statement in 298 , that , where a chairman is to be appointed by vote , the question is to be put by some member in the committee , though laid down by Mr. Jefferson on the authority of an old writer on parliamentary proceedings , is not sanctioned by Hatsell , or borne out by the modern practice in the British Parliament , in both houses of which the practice as above stated prevails . 299 . The same number of members is neces- Committee of the Whole , 173 sary to constitute a quorum of a committee of the whole , as of the assembly ; and , if the members present fall below a quorum at an3 ' time in the course of the proceedings , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer thereupon resumes the chair ; and the chairman informs the assembly ( he can make no other report ) of the cause of the dissolution of the committee . 300 . When the assembly is in committee of the whole , it is the duty of the presiding officer to remain in the assemblv-room , in order to be at hand to resume the chair in case the committee should be broken up by some disorder or for want of a quorum , or should rise , either to report progress , or to make their final report upon the matter committed to them . 301 . The clerk of the assembly does not act as clerk of the committee ( this is the duty of the assistant clerk in legislative bodies ) , or record in his journal any of the proceedings or votes of the committee , but only their report as made to the assembly . 302 . The proceedings in a committee of the whole , though in general similar to those in the assembly itself and in other committees , 174 Parliamentary Practice , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the following :  --  303 . First , The previous question can not be moved in a committee of the whole . The only means of avoiding an improper discussion is , to move that the committee rise ; and , if it is apprehended that the same discussion will be attempted on returning again into committee , the assembly can discharge the committee , and proceed itself with the business , keeping down anj ' improper discussion by means of the previous question. 304 . Second , A committee of the whole can not adjourn , like other committees , to some other time or place , for the purpose of going on with and completing the consideration of the subject referred to them ; but , if their business is unfinished at the usual time for the assembly to adjourn , or for any other reason the ' wish to proceed no further at a particular time , the form of proceeding is , for some member to move that the committee rise , report progress , and ask leave to sit again ; and , if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop debate , that can only be effecte  --  l in the same manner , unless there is a special rule as to the time of speaking , or to taking a subject out of committee . Committee of the Whole . 175 rises , the presiding oflScer resumes the chair of the assembly , and the chairman of the committee informs him that the committee of the whole have , according to order , had under their consideration such a matter , and have made some progress therein , but , not having had time to go through with the same , have directed him to ask leave for the committee to sit again . The presiding officer thereupon puts a question on giving the committee leave to sit again , and also on the time when the assembly will again resolve itself into a committee . If leave to sit again is not granted , the committee is of course dissolved . 305 . Third . In a committee of the whole , every member may speak as often as he pleases , provided he can obtain the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can speak more than once . 306 . Fourth . A committee of the whole , can not refer any matter to another committee ; but other committees may and do frequently exercise their functioi ) s , and expedite their business , by means of sub-committees of their own members . 1 If It is a second time , the expression is , " some further progress/ ' &c.; 176 Parliamentary Practice . 307 . Fifth . In a committee of the whole , the presiding officer of the assembly ' has a right to take a part in the debate and proceedings in the same manner as any other member . 30 &; Sixth . A committee of the whole , like a select committee , has no authority to punish a breach of order , whether of a member or stranger ; but can only rise and report the matter to the assembly , who may proceed to punish the offender . Disorderlj- words must be written down in committee , in the same manner as in the assembly , and reported to the assembly for their animadversion. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between proceedings in the assembly and in committees of the whole ; in most other respects they are precisely similar . It is sometimes said , that , in a committee of the whole , it is not necessary that a motion should be seconded : there is no foundation , however , either in reason or parlimentary usage , for this opinion . 310 . When a committee of the whole have gone through with the matter referred to them , a member moves that the committee rise , and that the chairman ( or some other member ) Committee of the . Whole . 177 report their proceedings to the assembly ; which being resolved , the chairman rises and goes to his place , the presiding officer resumes the chair of the assembly , and the chairman informs him that the committee have gone through with the business referred to them , and that he is ready to make their report when the assembly shall think proper to receive it . The time for receiving the report is then agreed upon ; and , at the time appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that of any other committee ( 286 ) . 311 . It sometimes happens , that the formality of a motion and question as to the time of receiving a report is dispensed with . If the assembly are ready to receive it at the time , they cry out , " Now , now , " whereupon the chairman proceeds ; if not then ready , some other time is mentioned , as " to-morrow " or " Monday , " and that time is fixed by general consent . But , when it is not the general sense of the assembly to receive the report at the time , it is better to agree upon and fix the time by a motion and question . 178 Parliamentary Practice , /z/ 312 . In bringing this treatise to a close , it will not be deemed out of place , to make a suggestion or two for the benefit of those persons who may be called upon to act as presiding officers for the . first time .. 313 . One of the most essential parts of the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ajttention to the proceedings of the assembly , and especially to what is said by ever member who speaks . Without the first , confusion will be almost certain to occur ; * r wasting the time , perhaps disturbing the harmony , of the assembly . The latter is not merely a decent manifestation of respect for those who have elevated him to an honorable station ; but it tends greatly to encourage timid or diffident members , and to secure them a patient and attentive hearipg ; . and t often enibles the presiding . oflSccr , by a timely , interference , to check offensive language in season to prevent scenes of tumult and disorder such as have sometimes disgraced our legislative halls . Concluding Remarks . 179 314 . It should be constantly kept in mind by a presiding officer , that , in a deliberative assembly , there can regularly be but one thing done or doing at the same time . This caution he will find particularly useful to him whenever a quarrel arises between two members in consequence of words spoken in debate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require that the regular course of proceeding shall be strity pursued ; and will take care to restrain members from interfering in an ' other manner . In general , the solemnity ' and deliberation with which this mode is attended will do much to allay heat and excitement , and to restore harmony and order to the assembly . 315 . A presiding officer will often find himself embarrassed by the difficulty , as well as the delicacy , of deciding points of order , or giving directions as to the manner of proceeding . In such cases , it will be useful for him to recollect that  --  . The great purpose op all rules and FORMS is to subserve THE WILL OF THE /z/
