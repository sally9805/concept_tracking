txt and important problem . And , perhaps , this problem , in the good providence of God , against the anxieties , fears , and protests of good men , is to be wrought out in France , just as God in his good providence led the older New England Commonwealths to complete religious liberty  --  to the entire separation of the church and state  --  to the entire abolition of the compulsory support of religion-against the anxieties , fears , protests , and prayers of a majority of the Christians in those commonxvealths-a result which all now acknowledge to be good . Let us wait in hope , if not in faith . We ought also to mention one other reason of anxiety which presents itself  --  the financial embarrassments of the government . These , it ought to be remembered , have been produced , in the greater part , by the selfish extravagance of the overthrown dynasty . And as to the other part , it is nothing more than must temporarily result from that interruption of commercial confidence and productive industry which accompanies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only temporary . It is already passing away . And when quiet and confidence are again restored , the enterprise and energy of a free people , and the economy and beneficence of a free government , will , doubtless , give to France greater financial prosperity than she has ever enjoyed . On this point , we shall do well to consider the financial embarrassments of the period during , and for years subsequent to , our own revolution , and the prosperity which has ensued . On the whole our hopes greatly surpass our fears , respecting the French revolution of 1848 , and constrain us to rejoice in it as an event of great promise for France . That church and state will be separated , and that a form of government , truly republican , will be established , and prosperously administered , we expect , though not with the greatest confidence . But , that the result will be a decided progress in civil and religious liberty and prosperity , we have no doubt whatever . We have called this revolution an event of great promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for all nations . Its influencewho can measure it ? It goes on its way swift and resistless as the electric power . And its waywhere will it end ? Verily its line will go out through all the earth , and its words to the end of the world . THE ETHICS OF THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE . THERE is one grand topic in the science of duty to which neither Paley nor Wayland has assigned a chapter , and of which the " Christian Directory " of Baxter , the " Ductor Dubitantium " of Jeremy Taylor , and all the tomes of the more ancient casuists , take no notice . In no system of Ethics with which we are acquainted , in no collection or compilation of casuistry which has come to our knowledge , is there any formal attempt to trace out and apply the principles by which a citizen in a republic should be guided in the exercise of his right of suffrage . How shall I give my vote n a popular election ? - is a great question for conscientious men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up not only once in four years at the election of a // President , but every two years at the election of Representatives in Congress , and every year once and again at the state and municipal elections . The question has been a practical question , of frequent recurrence , in Great Britain , ever since England had any rudiments of free institutions . It is now likely to become a question of the same kind of practical importance , in almost every country of Christendom . And yet , with the exception of here and there an occasional sermon by some New England preacher , who gets much censure for meddling with a theme so far beyond his province , we are not aware that any serious attempt has ever been made to define and exhibit the principles by which a free citizen should he guided in the performance of his high duty as a constituent member of the State . It is not with the expectation of supplying so great a deficiency , that we have ventured to introduce the subject thus distinctly to public attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fe*v thoughts and inquiries which occur to us , and which may invite others to a more ample and exact discussion . In due time , we doubt not , the Ethics of the Right of St4frage will be a distinct chapter in all systems of Ethical Science  --  a chapter without which no system can be recognized as complete in a free country . If our humble effort may contribute any thing to such a result , that is all we hope for . I. We begin then by asking , Are the ethics of the right of suffrage defined and settled by any universal rule of the Christian religion laid down in the Scriptures ? Is there any express rule in the Bible which will always show us how to vote in an election ? We should hardly have thought of this question , if we had not sometimes heard and seen Scripture quoted to show conclusively which of two or three tickets must needs be preferred by all voters who recognize the authority of the Bible . The text which above all others has been used in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave to Moses , Ex. xviii , 21 , - " Thou shalt provide out of all the people , able men , such as fear God , men of truth , hating covetousness , and place such over them to be rulers of thousands , and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens . " Doubtless this was good advice to Moses . That it may reasonally he regarded as advice divinely prompted , we will freely admit , That it contains principles which every conscientious man will spontaneously regard when called to give his vote or influence in a popular election , we will not for a moment question . But that it gives us a formula by which the individual voter must invariably be governed in the exercise of his right of suffrage , to the exclusion of all other considerations-that all doubts and difficulties that may arise in attempting to decide between different candidates of different parties and systems of policy , may be solved by the application of this formula-is what can not be made to appear . Such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some thousands - or , as is the case with us every four years , some millions-of electors , are to determine by their votes , not only what men shall hold the reins of power , but what shall be the course and policy of the government , a thing which neither Jethro nor Moses had ever heard of , and to which no passage in the Old Pestament or in the New makes any allusion . The case in reference to which the advice of Jethro was offered , was essentially different from the case of an individual elector in a republic . Moses had in his own hands the entire and exclusive power of appointment to office . Of course the question of his duty in relation to every appointment , // was a question involving only a single element . In selecting a man for any particular office , he needed only to be satisfied as to the man 's qualifications . Is he able ? - is he firm in his allegiance to the national religion ? - is he a man of integrity ? - is he a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his duty by mercenary considerations ? - has he these qualifications above any other man that can be thought of for such an office ? - these were the only points which Moses had any occasion to consider in the exercise of his appointing power . But had he been merely one of twenty , or even one of a triumvirate , invested with the appointing power , then in every case of conferring an office , the question of his duty would have involved another element , and would have had some resemblance to the question respecting the duty of a voter in a popular election . We remember another text which has been quoted and argued from , as showing how men must needs vote , who are governed by Christian principles . Paul , writing to the Christians at Phihippi , and having expressed a confident hope that his life would be spared and that he would be again permitted to visit them , says , as represented by King James 's trans. lators , Phil . i , 27 , " Only let your conversation be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , " &amp;c . The word translated " Let your conversation be , " is *rw ) *trei*ruOr ,  --  which sounds somewhat like our English , or Anglo-American word , politics ; and so , by an improved version , the text is made to read , " Only let your politics be as it becometh the gospel of Christ , " - that is , in the performance of all your civil and political duties , and especially in determining what party to vote with , act as Christians . Without raising any question touching the correctness of this improved translation , it is enough to say that the precept , after all , does not tell us what kind of politics - whether democratic , whig , or liberty.party-is such as becometh the gospel of Christ . As to the ethics of the right of suffrage , we are left to judge for ourselves by other light than that which this text affords us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prescribes no definite rule which can relieve us of the necessity of inquiring after the principles of duty in this matter , it is plain that the elector in exercising his right of suffrage , instead of depending on some divinely prescribed formula , must use his best discretion , just as every man must needs do in a thousand other questions which are referred to the decision of an enlightened moral sense . And we may suppose him to ask in the next place , " Am I bound to throw my ballot always for that man whom I judge to be the best man , without regard to any other consideration than that of his fitness for the office ? " An affirmative answer to this question implies that the individual voter ought to act in all instances just as if he had an unlimited control over the election of the men who are to be entrusted with the functions of government . But does his duty require him-does it even permit him to act thus ? Is not the fact that his right in the matter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffrage , a fact that materially affects his duty ? Is he not bound to take some notice of the known views and intentions of other electors ? Is he not bound to consider beforehand what effect his vote is likely to have upon the result ? May he not consult with others beforehand as to whom he and they can agree to vote for ? Ought he not to do so ? If he has one opinion as to the fittest man for the office , and others have a different opinion , may it not sometimes // be his duty to yield his opinion to theirs , and so to give his ballot for a man whom he does not regard as quite the best man . If he knows in advance that the best man  --  or the man whom he regards as such -- can not be persuaded to accept the office , must he still vote for him ? if he knows in advance that his best man can not be elected , must he still refuse to vote for any other man , he the certain consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or the other of two candidates will be elected , must he , under the conscientious necessity of voting at all hazards for the best man , give a vote which has , no other tendency than to secure the election not only of a much inferior man , but , as the case may be , of the very worst man ? Let the voter , instead of yielding blindly to an unauthorized formula , throw himself upon the guidance of his moral sense enlightened by the analysis of the case in which he is to act , and he will see that he is under responsibilities for which that formula makes no provision . III . But our inquirer is not yet satisfied . He has other questions to propound* " Admitting that I am not required to give my ballot always for the one whom I regard as absolutely the best man , must I not at least vote always for one whom I regard as a good man ? Is it right for me in any case to give my ballot for a man who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this question takes a great many forms . One will ask , " Is it not palpably wrong to vote in any circumstances for a duellist , or for a Sabbath-breaker , or for one who speaks profanely ? " Another asks , " Can I vote for a slaveholder without being a partaker in his sin ? " Another asks* " Can I , in any case vote for a Roman Catholic ? "  - -  or , " Can I vote for a Unitarian ? " - or , " Can I vote for a man who does not acknowledge the supreme authority of the Bible ? " Now in regard to questions of this class , nothing is plainer than that the considerations which they suggest are considerations deserving the most serious attention of every man who would exercise his right of suffrage according to the will of God . In many cases -- in perhaps the majority of cases as they actually occur , no question involved in the election is paramount to the question of the personal character of the men who are to be entrusted with the various powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose , just at hand ; and you are inquiring how you shall exercise your right of suffrage . One or the other of two leading parties is sure to get the control of the state for the ensuing year . With one of these parties you have a general agreement of opinion , so far as questions purely political are concerned . Its success in the pending election will have the eiThct of advancing those views of a protective tariff , or those views of the best mode of keeping the public ccounts , or those views of the banking system , which you regard as right . But that party has proposed as its candidate for the highest office in the state , a showy , windy demagogue , a man in whose personal integrity you have no confidence , a roan whose influence in society is a corrupting influence , a man known as a despiser of the Sabbath and an enemy of religious institutions , a man whom , if he were your next door neighbor , you would not think of making the executor of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , the other party -- erroneous as you esteem it in respect to the questions of public policy which are at issue -- proposes as its candidate for the same office a man of the very highest and purest personal character . In such a case as this , the question of your duty is easily answered . What are the merely commercial or financial interests* // supposed to be involved in the election , when compared with the moral interest which the state has in the character of her own chief magistrate ? In the view of every man who has any just moral sensibilities , the benefit which will result to the state from having in her highest place of honor a man who will honor the place instead of one who will dishonor it , exceeds by far any benefit which can be expected to arise from the success of your views on the political questions which divide the parties . Your moral sense , if you will but listen to it , tells you what to do . So in regard to all offices which the people confer directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tokens of the people 's favor . Principles of political economy -- all the ordinary questions which are the ostensible division between political parties are of little consequence to the common welfare , in comparison with the influence which comes from the personal character of the men of whom it may be said , Behold the men whom the people delight to honor ! Yet it is not safe to say , without any qualification , that the conscientious elector may never vote for a candidate whose personal character is exceptionable . Nor is it safe to assert absolutely that there can be no case in which the elector may be bound in conscience to vote for that one of two candidates whose personal character is more exceptionable than the personal character of his competitor . There may be cases , in which the personal character of the man voted for is of far less moment than the questions of public policy , which are to be determined by the election . The duty of voting for men of unexceptionable private character , or even the duty of voting for the better man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , is not , like the duty of veracity , a simple and invariable obligation . No law of God revealed in the Scriptures-no law of God revealed in the instinctive moral sense , gives us any such formula to be followed at all hazards . If we had such a formula , duly authenticated as from God , all consideration of consequences would be preposterous ; the consequences would be God 's , and to him alone would it belong to care for them . But having no such formula , we are bound to judge for ourselves what is right , in each of the innumerable complex cases that arise for our decision . It may happen that the question really at issue in a national election , is not simply whether this man who has never been concerned in a duel , or that man who has fought in duels , shall be president , but the far more momentous question hetween peace and war , or the equally momentous question between the extension of the area of freedom and the extension of the area of slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable gentleman who never penned and never received a challenge-nay every vote not actually given for his exceptionable competitor , is in effect a vote for a system of measures which will involve the country in a most needless war and which will consign millions of men to the horrors of a life-long bondage . In some state elections , the question may be not simply whether some devout communicant in the Protestant Episcopal Church , or some Presbyterian elder , shall be elected governor in preference to a man who makes no religious profession or pretension , but whether that state shall commit itself fur the abolition of slavery within its own jurisdiction . That religious man may have pledged himself against the fanaticism of attempting to abolish an institution which is sanctified in his eyes by its having had a place among the arrangements of Abraham 's household ; while that irreligious man with all his faults has become the leader in a bold and therefore // hopeful effort to relieve his natal soil from a system which smites it as with a manifest curse from God . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so vote that your ballot shall tell against him ,  --  - in other words if you do not vote for that man of no religious name or pretension -- you vote in effect for the continuance of slavery . Is it not plain , that in such a case , you ought to vote for the candidate whose personal character you disapprove , and against the candidate whose personal character is unexceptionable . We see then that the question to be decided by the votes of the people at an election , may sometimes have a moral significance by virtue of which it shall transcend all questions touching the personal qualifications of the several candidates before the people , as far as those questions of personal character transcend the ordinary questions of party politics . As the financial question between a high tariff of duties , and another tariff not so high , or that between one mode of keeping the public money and another , sinks into in : significance by the side of the moral question , whether such a man as Aaron Burr or such a man as John Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand any ordinary question as to the personal qualities of one man in comparison with the personal qualities of another man , may sink into insignificance by the side of some great question of national morality and national destiny . There is another thought in relation to questions of this class . Your suffrage is claimed for one candidate on the ground that he is an exemplary citizen  --  a Protestant Christian  --  a member of an evangelical church ; but you have no sufficient evidence that his political abilities are such as are indispensable to a right management of the public affairs at the particular crisis which seems to be impending . The only other candidate that can be reasonably thought of , is fully competent , you have no doubt of his ability but he is a Roman Catholic , or he is a Unitarian , or he has been concerned in a duel , or there is some stain of immorality upon his character , though his career in public life gives you no reason to distrust his honesty as a man of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sure to fall into inexperienced and incapable hands . And yet the times are such that none but an experienced and able statesman can be trusted . A weak or incompetent man at the head of the republic in such times , might work great mischief with the best intentions . Look at the case then as it stands , and let your own moral sense tell you what you ought to do . It is well to have a pious physician ; but you must have confidence in his knowledge and skill , or your conscience will not permit you to employ him in the hour of peril instead of that other physician of undoubted ability whose religious opinions are unsound . It is well to sail with a pious captain in command of the ship . But you are on a voyage , and it so happens that the ship*s company are under the necessity of choosing some one to take command . Some of them are for choosing one whom you know to be a good man , and who is very useful among the sailors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no confidence in his ability to command and navigate the vessel . Others are for choosing one who is no Christian at all and very little of a gentleman , but who is nevertheless a most experienced seaman , and of whose ability to control the crew and to bring the vessel into port yo*i have no doubt . What kind of a conscience is that which would lead you in those circumstances to vote for the incompetent man because of his being a devout // man ? Do you tell us that you will trust in God who ruleth the raging of the sea , and maketh the storm a calm ? Do you tell us , from the Scripture , " Lie will give his angels charge over thee to keep thee ? " Remember it is written again , " Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God . " IV . It may be thought that we are tending to conclusions quite coincident with the ordinary maxims of party politics . One and another may be ready to ask us , " Am I not right then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party - no matter whom the party may nominate ? " This is no doubt the first principle of what is called party discipline . The welfare of the country being the professed end , the success of the party is assumed to be the exclusive means ; and in order that the party may be successful , every member of it must vote unfailingly for the " regular nomination , " made out in conformity with what are called " the usages of the party . " The nomination being once made , and " the ticket " having once been adopted as the symbol of the party , it must be voted for with an implicit submission to the authority from which it proceeds ; he who holds back or hesitates-above all he who stands out in oppositioncommits an offense never to be forgotten . Thus it is that thousands of intelligent men have no rule or principle in regard to the exercise of their elective franchise , but simply to follow the dictation of their party . So far are we then from counseling you to follow your party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they may , that we would caution you against assuming that the success of your party is essential to the welfare of the country . It would even be safer to assume that the parties as they now exist are , one and all , essentially mischievous . Think what these parties are in their organization and working . Who are " the party ? " Who are they that make the nominations which you are bound to vote for ? How is it in your own town or village ? Are not the nominations for your local elections ordinarily made , if not always , by some little clique of leaders and runners , who call themselves the party ? how is it that the nominations of the party are made for state and national elections ? Whom do the conventions actually represent ? By whom are the delegates appointed ? Look at the conventions which have just been held ; and say what was there in the getting up , in the composition , or in the proceedings of either convention , which ought to give any authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , with one of those conventions than with the other ; but what obligation is there on your conscience to follow the dictation of either . It is worthy of serious consideration whether the complete disintegration of existing parties is not the very thing which the country needs , and which the country is now ripe for . What questions are at issue between the two great parties whose nominations for the presidency have just been presented to the country ? There have been in other days great questions on which the parties were in opposition to each other . Four years ago , the immediate annexation of Texas , and the consequent war with Mexico , were depending , and were known to be depending on the result of the election . At the same time there were other issues between the parties  --  and particularly the question of protective duties . Eight years ago , there was not only the question of protective duties , but the question of the distribution of the funds accruing from the sales of public lands , and the question of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties stood confronted on // the question of rechartering the Bank of the United States . But what question is there now between the convention which met in Baltimore and the convention which met in Philadelphia ? What does either propose to do , which will not be done if the other party is successful ? The annexation of Texas is a fact of history , and is no more to be disputed than the purchase of Louisiana . The war is at an end , the last formalities of ratification have been completed , and nobody proposes a renewal of hostilities . The existing tariff of duties will suffer no material change , whichever party may be in the ascendent , unless changes are found necessary for the increase of the revenue . No party will dare to encounter the strength of conviction with which the great doctrine of commercial freedom has wrought itself into the minds of the American people . There is no possibility , or thought , of creating a national bank ; to charge such an intention on the whigs of the Philadelphia convention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other convention with a design to dismantle the navy and to restore the gunboats and the embargo . Whichever party may be in power , it will not venture on the establishment of any new fiscal institution , unless impelled by some hopeless confusion in the finances of the general government . The proceeds of the land sales are virtually mortgaged for the payment of the public debt created by annexation and our conquests and purchases of territory ; and for the same reason all other questions about surplus revenue are pretty effectually disposed of , for at least two presidential terms to come . As for the improvement of the harbors and rivers of the West , and the opening of those great avenues of commerce which the West demands , neither party will do much before 1850 ; but after the census of that year , the West will have whatever it may choose to demand . What is it then for which these parties are contending ? Offices-offices-the spoils of victory-nothing in the world besides . The question who shall be president-involves not only the question who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be ambassadors and secretaries of legations , who shall be consuls and commissioners , *rho shall be clerks in the public ofhces and midshipmen in the navy , who shall be collectors and postmasters , who shall be tide-waiters and pennyposts . If the nominee of the Baltimore convention is elected , every appointment directly or indirectly in the gift of the general govern . meat is sure to be disposed of with a view to the interests of the party by which he has been elected ; every functionary from the Secretary of State down to the veriest menial in a custom-house , will have his appointment either as a reward of party services already rendered , or as a stimulus to effort in the next campaign . If the nominee of the Philadelphia convention is elected , the least that can be anticipated is that every incumbent who has made himself obnoxious by efforts in behalf of a defeated candidate for the presidency , will be removed from office , and that every vacancy , however created , will be filled from among those who have been active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here then we see a great prize to be contended for . Here is the cohesive power that can agglomerate parties and hold them together , even when no great national interest , and no question of public policy is involved in the result . Nor is this all . If the democratic candidate is elected , the democratic party acquires new strength for the stnte and municipal elections ; it will be able to elect senators and representatives in Congress ; it will be able to elect governors and other state // officers ; it will be able to elect mayors and common-councilmen ; and , by its control over the appointing power , constables , justices of the peace , watchmen. and scavengers shall all hold their places in consideration of services rendered and to be rendered to the party . So on the other hand , if by the efforts of the whig party in the state of New York , the votes of the electoral college in that state shall be given to the candidate of the whig convention , and if those votes shall help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buena Vista , " then it is reasonable to expect that the whig party in the state of New York will be strengthened in that triumph , and that the government of the state and perhaps of its great cities will be for a while in the hands of the whigs . The same might be said of Ohio or of Vermont or of any other state in which the whigs have any chance of being , in any circumstances , a majority . We see then what it is for which the parties are contending . Once they were divided upon questions of principle , or rather upon great questions of public policy ; and they contended for measures in which the welfare of the country was believed to be involved . Now they are contending only for offices- " the spoils of Victory . " Is not the complete disintegration of both these parties far more to be desired than the success of either ? Nor is such a result beyond the range of probability . The great democratic party which came into power with President Jackson in 1829 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present hour , has never known but one defeat in a national election , gives many signs of dissolution . Of the men who were its fathers and guides , and to whose farsighted sagacity it has owed its successes , how many have committed themselves against the nomination of the Baltimore convention . VOL . VI . If it succeeds in this election , it may renew its vigor ; it may excommunicate the Van Burens and Cambrelings , the Butlers and the Nileses , and denounce them as " old federalists , " and may be strong as ever after it has parted from them . If it fails in this election , it is dissolved as completely as the old democratic party was dissolved in 1824 ; and its elements must enter into new combinations . As for the whigs , nothing but defeat can hold them together . The candidate for whom they are expected to vote , is pledged to nothing definite , save that he will not be a party president . If , being elected , he redeems that pledge -- if he refuses to dismiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places to the whigs -- the party is of course dissolved ; and the wrath which came upon John Tyler will be forgotten in the curses , loud and deep , which disappointed office seekers will utter against him . If , being elected , he fails to redeem that pledge -- if all the offices of the federal government are divided , like the pillage of a captured city , among his hungry followers -- that treachery will disgust thousands of patriotic minds , forcing them into other alliances founded on healthier affinities , and will thus dissolve the party which it seeks to serve . Instead of saying then , according to what seems to be the grand principle of party politics , that every man should simply choose his party , and then vote invariably for the regular party nomination , we would rather say that sometimes it may be the duty of a citizen to cast his vote in just that way in which it will tend most effectually to the dissolution of existing parties . V. But we may be told that , after all , we have done little towards simplifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are as sensible as any of our readers can be . We can by no means undertake to give 57 // a formula which shall supersede the necessity of careful inquiry and d*-liberation on the part of him who would do all his duty as a member of the national sovereignty . And if any man must needs have the one principle which shall include all possible instances of duty , that way in which your vote will tell most effectually for the true wclfare of the country . Let the terms of our proposition be fairly understood . We do not bid you regard exclusively the interests of your section , your state , or your particular department of industry . You are to care for the welfare of your whole countrynot its gross material interests alone , its wealth , its power , its aggrandizement among the nations , but its true welfare . In the true welfare of a people are included not material elements alone , but all the intellectual and moral elements which belong to that people 's life and history Observe again , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which you think your vote will be most effectual for the welfare of your country- We do not make the right and wrong in so grave a matter depend upon your erring and unstable thought . In this , as in all other cases , you are under obligation to do not merely what you think to be right , but what is right . If you think wrong , and vote accordingly , you will certainly vote wrong . True , when we can not see what is right , and therefore miss the right though earnestly aiming at it , God judges us according to our means of knowledge . But when it is in our power to see the right if we will look with calm deliberation in the fear of God ; then if we err through carelessness or wilfulness or passion , God judges us not according to our actual knowledge , but according to our means of knowledge still . Undoubtedly the questions submitted to popular decision at an election are sometimes too obscure or too complicated for the citizen to grapple with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought and more than ordinary means of information . On financial questions , and questions of political economy generally , the citizen may be mistaken without blame ; just as every man may err without blame in the conduct of his private affairs . But more gel the questions on which the people are to judge , have a moral aspect , in view of which an enlightened and unsophisticated moral sense pronounces an instant judgment . The moral sense habitually exercised -- that promptness in the discernment of the right and wrong which results from the habit of doing right-is ordinarily the surest guide in the decision 6fl4uestions which concern the public welfare . It is always safe to assume that what offends the unsophisticated moral sense is wrong ; and that nothing inconsistent with the law of love can be incorporated into the policy of the government without bringing God 's displeasure upon the nation . In relation to all such questions , every citizen is competent to judge for himself , and is bound to judge right . Let him give ' his vote then in that way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his country . " But what is my vote worth ? Flow shall I cast it so that it shall tell upon the issue ? Where shall I throw my little influence so that it shall be felt as an influence for good ? " Let us look a moment at the elements concerned in the solution of this question . And for the sake of distinctness , we will suppose that the question relates to the specific exercise of the right of suffrage in the election of a president . While this case is in some respects more complicated in consequence of peculiarities in the form and process of elec // tion , ( the votes by which the choice is finally made being the votes of states as represented in their electoral colleges , and the votes of individual citizens being given not for the president directly but for the presidential electors , ) it may on that very account be so much the better for the purpose of illustration . You are inquiring then , in reference to the election of a president , how your vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true welfare of the country . We give for your guidance these suggestions ; and it is for you to say whether they do not commend themselves to your common sense and to your conscience . 1 . Is there any great question concerning the public welfare , which this election will decide ? Does the question of a war with Britain or with Mexico , or the question of the extension of the area of slavery , or the question of abolishing the infamous slave-trade in the District of Columbia , or the question of sweeping away all the old corruptions of the Post-Office Department ,  --  hang trembling in the scales of this election ? Is one of the two leading candidates pledged one way , and his party with him ; while the other candidate and his party are pledged the other way ? And is it a matter of doubt which of these two candidates will be successful ? Is it obvious that the defeat of one particular candidate , whose prospects of success are such as stimulate his friends to every effort , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickedness to which he is committed 2 . Supposing this to be the case , you come next to the question , whether your ballot and your personal influence in your legitimate sphere can make any difference in the result . Is the result doubtful so far as your own state is concerned ? - for you know , it is there only that your ballot can be counted . Are the opinions of your fellow-citizens in your own state so divided that it can not be known , till the votes are counted , which side is to preponderate ? Is there a possibility , on the one hand , that the six votes , or the twelve , or the thirty-six , which the electoral college of your state is to give in the final election , will be given for the candidate and the party that are pledged to put the country upon some new career of crime , or pledged against some great and salutary reformation ? And is there also a possibility , on the other hand , that your ballot and the ballots of those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with you , will be just what is wanted to turn the scales the other way , and to make out a plurality for a different ticket ? Suppose that , in such a case , you and your friends , instead of uniting to defeat the candidate that has pledged himself to a policy of wickedness and mischief , permit yourselves to he controled by party discipline ; and accordingly , bewildered with the idea that the cohesion of your party is the first thing to be regarded , you give your ballots for him ; and your ballots determine the vote of your state , and the vote of your state determines the election . Or suppose that instead of casting your ballots in such a way that they shall be of some avail in the counting , you throw them away upon some third ticket , with precisely the same result . There is one of these United States , whose electoral votes , four years ago , turned the scale for the immediate annexation of Texas and for all the crimes and mischiefs which that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college which gave those fatal votes was chosen not by a majority , but only by a plurality . Of that plurality there were thousands who gave their ballots , protesting against the impolicy and the iniquity of the measure to which their candidate was pledged , and which was // in fact the one great issue . Had they then broken their shackles as they have since done-had they then voted manfully against the nomination of their party , all the results would have been reversed . There would have been no immediate annexation-no Mexican warno squandering of a hundred and fifty millions of our treasure-no slaughtering of twenty thousand of our citizens-no extension of the area of slavery  --  and no " old Rough and Ready " to be hurraed into the presidency . Nay , had those other thousands in that same state , who , instead of meeting the question really at issue , yielded themselves up to be governed by a narrow formula - had those men who threw their votes away upon a ticket for which they knew there was no chance of success-voted for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the madness of immediate annexation , they would have saved their country . 3 . The two preceding questions are often to be answered in the negative . If it so happens that there is no great issue of peace or war , of freedom or slavery , of justice or iniquity , involved in the choice between two leading candidates ; - or if it so happens that there is no doubt which way your state will go , and no chance that your vote will have any effect on the issue ; - then the question of your duty may he determined by other considerations , which under the former hypothesis were in abeyance . Your vote in such a case may be regarded not as a power that is to affect the result , but as a testimony that is to bear upon the formation and utterance of public opinion . In such a case , questions like these demand a serious consideration . Can I give my vote , either alone or by agreement with others , in such a way as to testify against slavery ? Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a testimony against the pas sion for war and the mad admiration of military glory ? Is there any way in which my vote will tend to the disorganization and dispersion of those great factions which have turned politics into a meaner game than that of the cock-pit , and all the offices and honors of the Union and of the states into one great fund of corruption ? Is there any way in which my vote can tell against the demoralizing practice of conferring honors and emoluments upon unworthy men ? In the case now supposed , such considerations as these are the great considerations by which your action may reasonably and safely be determined . If other questions arise , of which we have taken no notice , let it be remembered that we have not attempted a complete analysis and discussion of the subject , but only to offer such thoughts of our own as may stimulate inquiry in other minds , and may lead in the end to a full and exact investigation in some other quarter . Far less do we attempt to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought ; we would rather waken our readers to the conviction that in such a matter as this they can not perform their duty at all without thinking and inquiring earnestly for themselves . Duty and thought are intimately connected with each other . A creature made for duty is a creature made for thought . The science of doing right in all the complicated relations in which men live and act , can never be reduced to a few self-applying formuke by which the necessity of deliberation , inquiry and analysis shall he done away . The practical and prudential understanding , perceiving fitnesses and tendencies , and the relation of means to ends , can not be safely trusted unless it is invigorated by a living and healthy moral sense ; and on the other hand , the moral sense , if it does not constantly summon to // its aid and hold under its control all the thinking powers ,  --  if it indolently and slavishly yields itself to the dominion of one narrow formula and another ,  --  becomes perverted , dull , diseased , and loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who " is light and with whom is no darkness at all .
