txt Prairie Showers-Bob While  --  the Grouse-Spring Morning on tire Prairie - Bob- o- Link-  **34;392;TOOLONG Wild TurkeyCattle on the Prairie-Hare-Deer- Whip-poor- Will . THE beautiful progeny of spring began now to gather around Prairie Lodge . Animate and inanimate nature teemed with the loveliest creations . The showers that had been so emphatically foretold on our arrival did not disappoint us . They fell almost daily for several weeks , and were generally accompanied by lightning and thunder , such as the dwellers in the east have no conception of . Nothing of the kind can be more magnificent unless it be the marshalling of the same storms on the vast plains farther west , where they are said to be even more terrific . They come more generally toward evening , and not unfrequently continue till near morning . Nothing can exceed the rapidity with which they gather after the first signal is given . A little cloud not larger than a man 's band rises on the horizon , and in fifteen minutes the earth is deluged , arid the pealing heavens seem on fire . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena : sometimes the whole arch is lighted by a continuous , flickering glare , rent occasionally by a more intense vein . The thunder roll is ceaseless , with such lightning . The deep peals that accompany the brighter flashes only strike with a more appalling tone . At other times the whole vault is filled with a darkness that seems ponderable , till a mighty flash rends the pall and searches the very soul . It is gone and the solid earth trembles under the mighty concussion . Again darkness , as if the eternal night had come , wraps the scene till the flame leaps forth with a more blinding glare than before , arid a crash follows that seems to shatter the foundation of the world . The third or fourth signal is followed by the storm , which breaks through the sable rack as if half the ocean had been lifted from its bed and was wandering in the upper air . In an inconceivably short space of time the plains around you are deluged , so that every succeediiig flash is reflected from innumerable little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow lake broken by islands of sedge and grass . I never appreciated the sublime power of the elements till I witnessed these storms . They are one of the most glorious features of the country . Their effect was heightened too by contrast with the scenes which followed them . The vast expanse of country over which they raged was in a few hours after as quiet and smiling as if the upper elements had dispensed only peace and sunshine from the first hour of creation . And beauty born of these awful warnings stole over every rolling height and into every green glade in our landscape . The swelling bud , the unfolding leaf and flower followed in the path of their majestic progress , making rich and beautiful what had before been desolate and wintry . The spirit that had all the * These sketches of passages of " Life in the Prairie Land " are taken from an unpublished manuscript by a very accomplished lady , Mrs. Thomas J. Farnham , whose husband 's name is already familiar to the public , from his published volumes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the most admirable women of our day . She at present occupies the responsible post of Directress of the New York State Female Prison at Sing Sing , in which capacity she has exhibited qualities and talents entitling her to public praise and public gratitude , in a far higher degree than it would be agreeable to her modesty to see stated on this page . The solution which she has there furnished to the question , whether the terrors of punishment and violence , or the mild measures of affictionateness and persuasion are the more efficacious for prison discipline ,  --  the one addressing only the brute in man , and the other appealing to his yet unextinguished better nature ,  --  will always entitle her to honorable mei*tion in the history of the science of prison discipline . The scene of these sketches is in the State of Illinois . The date , the year 1S36. // night perhaps raved with such fearful and angry power seemed , when the bright and peaceful morning came , to have borne a magician s wand after his wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plains it had threatened to devastate . The trees around our lodge now began to put on their summer garb , the hazel copses unfolded their young leaves . The prairies spread their green carpets and even went so far as to variegate the pattern with the violet and the scarlet painted cup . The strawberry came out in her bridal flowers and blushed herself into luscious miturity beneath the ardent sun . It was not conlined to beds and patches such as delight the eyes of the urchin roving through forbidden meadows in the east , but reddened whole acres around the Lodge . The pleasure of gathering it was surpassed only by its delicious flavor . When we came in heated , and just enough fatigued to make rest delightful , our blushing treasures were carefully cleansed of the leaves and grass , sprinkled with sugar and deluged with delicious cream fresh from the krimming pan . 0 what a feast ! and while we were enjoying it the soft breeze floated in laden with the odors of the young world , and the music of its varied populace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenanted by many little songsters , busily employed in these days of universal industry in announcing their return and preparing for the duties of the season . My favorite was the Quail , the merriest , happiest and most business-like bird of them all . He rejoices in the showers , and so do I. The harder the rain , the livelier his cheering when it is over . He makes the dripping wood ring with his shrill note . If you walk out while the drops hang upon the leaves , and the grass bends with the weight of its gems , you hear his merry greetings floating by as gaily as if a bevy of children had escaped to the woods and were playing hide and seek with an omnipresent Bob White , ' who would only answer when called with a whistle . You hear it in every tone , the imperative , the plaintive , the querulous , the dignified , the entreating , the congratulatory . Bob White ! " soliloquizes one philosophic looking fellow from the second story of a hazel clump . He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense key , " Bob White ! " Two or three rriore turns of the smooth little head and the sagacious little eye seem to raise his temper and he adds the epithet " Old ! " as if Bob White were rather sensitive on the score of his years . and would be drawn out to repel the injurious insinuation . " Old Bob White ! " he exclaims , and it is responded to from below . Presently out trips a neat , industrious , thrifty looking bird , who appears to be keeping house in some of the snug little apartments to which these clean paths lead and exclaims , " Old Bob White ! " He starts and looks smartly about for the individual who has perpetrated so unjust a slander . " Old Bob White ! " And , as if the enormity grew with the repetition , he hops upon another branch , adjusts his plumage , and as boldly as an eye can defy , he defies any libeller to prove his charge . The altercation is becoming sharp , when presently a softer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " His anger is dissipated in a moment . With a look of universal charity toward all Quail slanderers , he alights from his post of defiance , and trips away up the leafy aisle . He runs along in haste , looking expectant but determined . He evidently anticipates some appeal to his feelings as a husband and father ; but is resolved to yield to no indiscreet solicitation . He reaches a little nook near the edge of the thicket , where low her .. bage has crept in and woven a thick bed , soft and odorous . The branches are closely knotted above it , and two or three stems of the Geranium Maculatum droop gracefully over , looking with their meek pale eyes at the nestling little group which Mrs. Bob White is vainly endeavoring to keep in order during her husband 's sally in defence of his youth . When he arrives , he finds a dozen callow Bob Whites tumbling about with . the manifest intention of rebelling against parental authority . The mother entreats , the father remonstrates , but to no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction , and warmis his inexperienced children against the many dangers which wait on the life of a Quail , but more especially against traps . In due time order is again restored , and the exercise of the parental authority has so elevated Bob White 's estimation of himself , that he can now forgive all that previously excited his indignation . He feels that respectability established on such a basis is not easily overthrown ; and thus reconciled with himself and the world at large , he walks forth beneath the dripping boughs with // a complacency which mere epithets can not disturb . The Grouse is another member of the feathered tribe , peculiar to these beautiful regions . He is a large , mottled grey bird , with a heavy ruff of feathers runxiing over his head , which adds much to the watchfulness and timidity of his appearance . Their nests are built on the open prairie in some thick knot of grass . This bird has no proper song , and is in general a very silent inhabitant of these vast plains . XVhen hunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whirr , somewhat similar to , but not so distinct as that of the Pheasant , and fly very rapidly . If not disturbed they describe the half of an ellipse between the points of rising and alighting . The strokes of the wing are short and rapid , and the flight is very swift and direct . These fowls are rarely heard to utter any noise except at one chosen hour of the day . On a Spring morning before sunrise if you are in the vicinity where grove and prairie meet , the air resounds with a peculiar noise , between the wliistie of the Quail and the hoarse blowing of the Night Hawk , but louder than either . You inquire what it is , and are told it is the Prairie Cocks greeting the opening day . Spring morning on the prairies ! I wish I could find language that would convey to the mind of the reader an adequate idea of the deep joy which the soul drinks in from every feature of this wonderful scene ! If he could stand where I have often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , and the soft tremulous light was streaming aslant the dewy grass , while not a sound of life broke on the ear , save the wild note just mentioned , so much in harmony with the whole of visible nature , he would feel one of the charms which binds the hearts of the sons and daughters of this land . We are within the borders of a little grove . Before us stretches a prairie ; boundless on the south and east , and fringed on the north by a line of forest , the green top of which is just visible in a dark waving line between the tender line of the growing grass and the golden sky . South and east as far as the eye can stretch , the plain is unbroken save by one " lone tree ' * which from time immemorial has been the compass of the red man and his white brother. - The light creeps slowly up the sky ; for twilight is long oti these savannahs . The heavy dews which the cool night has deposited glisten on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally mingling , are borne by their own weight to the earth . The slight blade on which they hung recovers then its erect position , or falls into its natural curve with a qui.ck but gentle motion that imparts an appearance of life to that nearest you , even before the wind has laid his hand on the pulseless sea beyond . A vast ocean , teeming with life ; - redolent of sweet odors ! It yields no sound save the one which first arrested our attention , and this is uttered without ceasing . It is not the prolonged note of one , but the steady succession of innumerable voices . It comes up near you and travels on , ringing more and more faintly on the ear , till it is returned by another line of respondents , and comes swelling in full chorus , stronger and nearer , till the last seems to be uttered directly at your feet . But the light is gaining upon the grey dawn . Birds awaken in the wood behind us , and salute each other from the swinging branches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun has just crowded his rim above a bank of gorgeous clouds , and pours a flood of dazzling light across the grassy main . Each blade becomes a chain of gems , and as the light increases , and the breath of morning shakes them , they bend , and flash , and change their hues , till the whole space seerris sprinkled with diamonds , rubies , emeralds , ninethysts , and all precious stones . Nothing can be conceived more beautiful or joyous than such a scene at this hour . The contiguous wood conveys an idea of home , such as you 4*ave borne from the forest clad States of the East . it is a refuge from the vastness which oppresses the mind , because it can never wholly compass it . You rejoice , you exult in the friendly presence of the trees ; not because they afford you a grateful retreat from the ardent sun not because they adorn your rude dwelling ; not because they promote the growth of fruit and flowers ; not even because they congregate the dear little birds about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar alternative to which the mind recurs when it is weary of the majesty which lies beyond them . You hiave sat under them in childhood ; you have swept . the fra*ments from the little spaces among their roots and carpeted thient *vitn // moss , and festooned them with the wild flowers which nodded near . You have peopled these magic palaces with fairies , and felt a joy which words can never tell , in dreaming how happy the little beings might be where nothing is visible to their tiny eyes but exquisite beauty , and no sound falls on their small ears but the melodies of growing life . You have listened to the winds , sighing plaintively through the boughs , and felt your soul grow fit for companionship with all things whatsoever that are beautiful and lovely . And now your heart turns fondly to these tall tenants of the plain as to elder brothers , and for a m* ) ment you look coldly on the naked expanse beyond . But stop ! the sun is fairly up . The flashing gems have faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matin song ; the birds have hailed the opening day , and are gaily launching from the trees : the curtain which has hung against the Eastern sky is swept away , and the broad light pours in resistless . The wind comes coursing gently up from the far distance , bending the young herbage , and bearing to your senses sweet sounds and odors , nursed on the unsullied breast of Nature . The tenants of the farm-yard are now astir ; the cows are milked , and all the animals whose services the farmer does not call to aid his labors , are dismissed to ramble in the boundless pasture . The generous oxen are summoned to the yoke , and the labor of the day cominences . If I have lingered long over this revel of nature , a spring morning on the prairies , with the Grouse be all the blame ! Among the more accomplished feathered artists here are the Bob o'Link , a species of mocking bird , sometimes called the Brown Thrasher , the Robin , and the melancholy Whip-poor-Will . These inhabit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom found at any great distance from the woods . There are some small birds who love the free plain , but they can not boast of much genius as singers . It is beautiful to think , however , that as man creeps outward from the groves and builds his cabin , opens his garden and nurses a few shrubs and small trees around him , the little wood songsters construe it into an invitation to accompany him . Trees are of very rapid growth on the exhaustless soil of the prairies . A few years ' care will bring about your house a dense grove of the locust , the cotton wood , aspen , and several other species , so that one need not b2 long deprived of bird-music . There are several varieties of the Woodpecker ; but they will not visit a new home so soon . They look upon young and thrifty trees as humbugs , so far as they pretend to any present utility , and regard them rather as estates to be held for future generations than as available funds for the liresent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and ambitious . In the heavily woodad bottoms of large rivers , and their tributaries , is found tire Parroquet ; not so finished a speaker as the Parrot , but quite as ready . He is a lively chatterer among the stately trees in the summer months , and when winter comes he betakes himself to the dark deep forests of the South . Like the most . voluble consolers of our own species , he shrinks before the approach of stern trial . There are also several coarser tribes , which I never loved , and shall therefore only name for the gratification of the curious . The Crow caws here as everywhere else , but he has been rescued from the general detestation in which lie was formerly held by the magic pen of Bryant . No other could have done it . And yet , who can read the " Death of the Flowers , " and not entertain a higher respect for him , and feel more melody in his croakings than before ? The Hawk screams above the wood top , and over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But nothing could make him other than an object of abhorrence to me since he bore my favorite chicken away before my very eyes , many , many years ago . I could not love him even with such an introduction as made his croakin g cousin acceptable . next in kind , but more loathsome , is the Buzzard , an indolent , gluttonous bird , who wheels lazily over the great plains , till the decaying carcass of a wolf , deer , or other animal attracts him to the earth . He then descends , gorges himself with the foul carrion , and often rests beside it after eating , from sheer inability to rise . The Turkey , whom this infamous fellow so much resembles that he has succeeded in stealing his name as a prefix to his own , is a much pleasanter member of the feathered tribe . Great numbers of them abound in the woodlands , where the stately march of the old cock gallanting his // hen and herlivelybrood through the forest is one of its most delightful features . The landscape grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest garb about the first of June . The paiiited cup , moccasin flower and geranium come out ; and there is more repose in the vegetable world than there has been . Nature , like a notable dame , has cleaned house in proper season , got her furniture and ornarne*ts arranged , and now seated complacently in her easy chair , challenges the admiration of beholders . In the vicinity of farms , the landscape is enriched by herds of cattle feeding on the Prairies . If you walk or drive among them in the afternoon , they are panting like gourminds after a turtle dinner . Their very ribs are distended with the luxurious fare in which they have revelled all day , and their breath perfumes the air . As the sun declines they wander homeward , the cows bearing a treasure that almost flows without the pressure of the housewife 's hand . When the milk is strained aud set away , the cares of the day are over , and then we wander out among the hazel copses or through the grove , to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingers over these peerless lar*ds . The hazel copse is one of the most picturesque features of our landscape . *tgrows very abundantly , and in autumn yields an inexhaustable harvest of the most delicious nuts . It is found several miles from the woodland , and grows in clumps from three to six feet in height . At a little distance these shrubs have the appearance of green mounds thrown up on the smooth surface of the plain . Its shelter is much sought by the rabbit , the most tender and timid inhabitant of the Prairie . Where the hazel has a strong compact growth it uproots the grass and leaves the soil unoccupied except by an occasional flower or creeping vine , whose long tendrils make a beautiful festoonery for these little aisles . Through them the timid Hare skips and feeds during the day , and when twilight favors his faint heart , he may be seen leaping out into the more dangerous paths trodden by man and other beings whom his instinct teaches him to dread as foes . Let him hear your footsteps and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We stroll throegh these miniature groves treading carefully , and s* ) eaking in low whispers not to alarm the quick ear of their little VOL . XVIL-NO . LXXXVII. 15 tenants . By and by , we emerge from the winding road into the more open barrens . We wander onward talking of olden time and the time to come , when presently a sharp , shrill sound breaks upon the ear , followed by the bounding of light feet . Away flies the Deer . startled by our white dresses moving among the green foliage , and fearfi*l every moment of the crackiiig rifle . Poor innocent , we shall not harm you ! You might have cropped the twigs unmolested and been spared that pang of fear had you known that we love mercy and find no pleasure in depriving any created thing of the joys which are its natural inheritance . But while we have mused and talked , the magnificent drapery of the west has been folded away . The gorgeous piles of , gold and crimson have melted and left the sky faintly tinted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly over the earth ; the breeze steals gently through the foliage and shakes the large leaf of the sassafras with a soft hollow sound , which , with the quick , liquid rustling of the aspen , and the fuller notes of the forest trees , pours a delicious harmony into the ear of night . Half an hour later the light is gone out in the west . The NightHawk has ceased his airy , sounding swoops , and the Whip-poor-Will has come from his retreat , to tell again the melancholy tale he urged so mournfully last night . There he sits in the top of the tall oak before the door , and will not cease his plaint . What is it troubles thee , poor Will ? Hast thou been engaged in some naughty affair , duelling or wronging thy neighbor , or looking sweetly at the daughter of some sour old worshipper of Mammon , who scorns thy poverty and threatens thee with a flagellation , unless thou desist ? Or has some gay gallant misled thy dame , and is thy song a cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone and hour of utterance . Some sorrow surely is its burthen ; would it were the only note struck on that chord ? But our ears are grown familiar with it , Will ; and thine perhaps is lighter than that we turn away from every day though uttered more intelligibly . They say thy form is pIn mnp and joy dances in thine eve . They say thou art a merry little fellow all day , and hoppest from branch to branch , laughing under thy wing at the anticipation of the muelancholy pranks thou wilt play at night // qwq THEY are prompt to redress an injury by legal process when the law affords it ; when not , by personal strength . It is , however , due to them to say , that they are equally prompt to make reparation when it is demanded in an honorable manner . They have little love or Charity for the vices that stain artificial society . Duelling is rarely defendedlicentiousness is little known , and theft is scarcely conceived of among them . Respect for the sabbath and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few churches are sustained , and but little expenditure incurred for the support of religious institutions . The prevailing faiths or forms of worship are the Methodist and Campbellite . There are others of course , but these are far the most numerous. - Without attempting any invidious distinction between these beliefs , it will certainly be adhering to truth to say that the latter are generally the more intelligent people , the former the more honest . The pulpit oratory of both is quite peculiar . I heard many of their " Circuit riders , " and several of the setfled clergy of the Methodist church , and am bound to say , that before I had this experience I should have considered any true description ironical or libellous . Among them all there were but one or two that deserve to be designated by any other name than that of the most arrant ranters . Their efforts bore no comparison with those of the stump orators and disputants of debating clubs , lyceums , &amp;c. , which you may hear every week in the small towns settled by Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abundance of furious action , a bellowing utterance , and a tone which renders it extremely difficult for the possessor of a cultivated ear to preserve both gravity and patience through one of their interminable harangues . The primitive style of their meetings , and the motley and incongruous appearance of the people who assemble , makes them one of the most striking novelties to the curious observer of Western life and manners . The Circuit rider embraces in his field of labors , from thirty to one hundred miles of country . His meetings are called in school-houses and churches , when held in towns or thickly populated neighborhoods , and in the cabins of the settlers in more primitive regions . His audience are seated on boards , the ends of which rest upon chairs , or , where these are not to be had , on blocks of wood of convenient height . One chair is always reserved for the speaker , in which he sits until the congregation is assembled . He then rises , takes his position behind it , drops his flag handkerchief upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couplet , the better to aid the memory of the singers , most of whom are without books . Thus commence the exercises of the occasion . The singing is followed by a long heterogeneous prayer . After this the text is announced , and the sermonizer launches at once , without preface , into the utterance of some of the many things which he intends to communicate . I remember becoming wearied with one of these harangues which was more vapid than usual , and finding great relief in a study of the motley group around me . There were mothers present , with infants of all ages , from four weeks upwards . One of these , about four months old , was curiously clad . It wore a dress of coarse brown English merino , sleeves short , and ruffled at the elbow , with plain footing about a nail in width . I inferred that it had been originally white , not from any evidences then visible , but from the fact that I never saw it colored in the shops . On the head of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors , trimmed profusely with an orange and green ribbon of some antiquity . My next neighbor on the other hand was dividing her attention between the sarmont and an infant of some six weeks , dressed so grotesquely as to be irresistible . A light cloak of blue cotton material , partially covered a dress of green and black calico of the largest stamp ; the head was covered with a cap of the finest cambric linen , exquisitely wrought , and trimmed with a faded // black lutestring ribbon , about two inches and a half in width . The mother wore one of the ancient scoop bonnet.s , natural hose , a calico dress , and a cape of different color and figure . Directly in front sat a young lady , the belle of the settlement , and withal not a little of a coquette , as I afterwards learned . She was clad in a dress which had once been printed , but yielding to the pressing solicitations of the rubbing-boards , had parted with its colors , and was now passing for white . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dressed in a very coquettish style , with a bright red bandanna handkerchief drawn tight over the shoulders , and fastened with a pin , and a long pink ribbon , which flowed nearly to ber cowhide boots . Her hands were naked and empty ; a tasty calico apron being made to do duty in place of a pocket-handkerchief . Her head was covered with the soiled remnant of an ancient green calash , the bridle of which enabled her to play off many effective glances upon the stricken fellers in her vicinity . Such ludicrous varieties of dress were inexhaustible , and afforded a rich field of observation while the orator was floundering through hissubject ; which on this occasion was an argument on the immortality of the soul . lie had not approached this abstruse question without feeling its importance , and making due preparation . His mind had evidently been refreshed by the recent perusal of some elementary treatise on the science of astronomy , which has been supposed by other great minds to afford some evidence on this and kindred questions . How this evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the principal use made of his knowledge being to propound to his audience the questions found at the bottom of the page ; and after a due pause to answer them himself . Half an hour 's exercise of this kind , abounding in the grossest and most ridiculous blunders , convinced the gaping assemblage that Brother Awas not only " a powerful smart man but one of mighty larnin . " It was safe then to return to the original question which every one had forgotten , but which at the end of the lesson , he seemed fortunately to remember . After some well sounded sentences in his loudest key to prepare their minds for the tremendous question , he 3aid , drawing himself up with a dignity and complacency which no words can convey , " Now , my friends-What is the Soul ? " A most impressive pause followed this interesting interrogatory . Every mind , save those of the dashing coquette and her rival admirers , was bent on it ; the house was awfully silent for the mo " ment ; but the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brethren , soul and body is enomomous terms , " carried my gravity by storm and let down the rapt audience with such a sudden substitution of plain fact for sublime inquiry , that there was an instantaneous shuffling of feet , drawing up of bent forms and exchanging of smiles , which said , " That is it , but we could not have said it so well . " When this sermon was over , an elderly sister , who had exulted at every sentence , asked my opinion of it . To the reply that I thought Mr. A- possessed a fine voice , she rejoined- " Ah ! he 's a powerful smart man . We thought brother - naming his predecessor , was as good as anybody could be , but brother A- is a heap ahead of him . Where on arth he ever gets larnin to answer the questions he 's always askia I cant see ; I reckon he must read a power of books . " But notwithstanding the ignorance of these men and the often ludicrous character of their discourses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities among whom they minister . That most of them are honest men , there is no doubt . The arduous and slavish character of their duties compared with the exceeding small salaries which they receive are testimonies in favor of their integrity , which no candid mind can reject . Nor can the value of their ministration , indifferent as it is , be doubted . Among the people whom they teach , religion is a simpler and more genuine emotion than in other states of society , where its rites and appliances constitute so much that is the subject of thought , envy , prejudice and opposition . They have little of the vanity that poisons more refined Christianity . The stirring housewife sets her little cabin in order for the meeting , and her neighbors prepare to come in with far purer and more intense religious emotions , than the plumed and jewelled dame arrays herself to visit the splendid edifice thronged with the votaries of fashion and wealth . There is a sublimity and beauty in the // stern simplicity of these gatherings ,  - -  the rough cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose broad and silent kin*do:n is spred around  --  the honest sympathetic faces and hard hands that clasp each other with no feigned warmth , that commends their bond of union more strongly than magnificent piles and pealing bells and sounding organs . Theirs is the simplest action of the religions faculties . Tne solemn story of the Cross and the teachings of Him who snfi*ered on it , bring them together to worship , adore , and love Him . The motives to a false profession of religion are also fewer here than in a more complicated state ol society . The vices of this condition are not such as would be either concealed or aided by the cloak of hypocrisy . They become professedly religious because they are , or at least think themselves actually so ; not because it will enable them to cheat in trade with greater impunity , or rob their neighbors ' widows and orphans , on the strength of long prayers and a stereotype solemnity of faces . Religion is regarded by them a source of happiness merely , not of gain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple and imperfect then the ministration of their wandering clergy are , it must command the respect and complacent regard of every honest and reflecting mind . Its fruits are the budding and blossomiiig of Faith , Hope , and Love in the wilderness . Religions institutions and observances have greater beauty and force here , where man is restrained by few motives external to himself , than where he is under the numerous obligations anti restraints of a more artificial condition . These bold , daring people are brought into the church , from a freedom and responsibility to them selves alone , scarcely more circumscribed than those enjoyed by the savage ; and the strength and harmony of the Christian code are beautifully de* monstrated by the submission of such chLracter to their guidances . There is besides a fitness in the relative condition of the minister and his people , which renders him in every respect an object of the highest regard ; and secures to his teachings the most unbounded reverence . His ignorance is never discovered by them . His blunders , when he ventures beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting indignation , disgust , or mirth , only stamp him as a man of wonderful learning . There is no discrepancy between their expectations and his abilities ; and his position , therefore , becomes ridiculons only to better cultivated minds . These he does not profess to instruct . He is not sent for their benefit ; if they participate in what he has to dispense it is their own choice ; and the liberality with which he offlers it should certainly secure him against ridicule . As the Yankees increase in the settlement where he officiates , he willingly retires and leaves them a minister of their own choosing . It must not be understood that the description I have given has no exceptions . There are men odiciating as servants of Christ in these wild regions who possess an eloquence and strength that would render them eminent anywhere ; men whose oratory is clothed with the richest imagery , whose every figure is a flash from the glowing altar of nature , whose fervid emotion and lofty sentiment kindle and elevate the soul . THE PRAUtIE IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righee of the Moon . SUMMER had worn away with its wealth of golden grains and flowers . The luxuriant harvest had disappeared from the farms , in the adjacent country , the tall corn was in its sere and yellow leaf , the late fruits bezan to ripen , the prairies faded from their rich green , save where here and there a " life 1mm " showed the tender grass like an emerald island in the vast brown ocean . Autumn in the prairie land is scarcely excelled for the richness of its charms by any other season . Coupled with the perfection of the wide vegetable world is an idea of repose which fills the soul . An immense country , whose energies have been springing all the previous months with ceaseless toil , whose rank luxuriance evinces the employment of tremendous powers , now lies all around // you in the deep quiet which ushers in a truly iiatural death . The sun pours forth a rich , mellow light ; dim and soft as if like a tender nurse he watched over this sleep of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not consume , fly cheerfully but quietly about as if , their labor done , the season of rest had come to them also . The Quail whistles and dances among the brown hazel thickets ; the Grouse flies from field to field , dividing his depredations through the neighborhood , and bearing off , when unmolested , a full crop to the plains which he loves better than the abodes of man . The crow calls from the wood top , or wheels his long and lazy flights above the naked prairies , seeming really more amicable than at any other season . The air is filled with the smoke of distant fires ; some day they creep up into your own neighborhood , and when night comes , light the heavens and the earth as far as the eye can reach . These are magnificent spectac ! es . I have stood upon the roof of our large hotel in the evening and looked into a sea of fire which appeared to be unbroken for miles . These incidents occasionally interrupt the dreamy rest to which everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nextday is as quiet as before . Sporting parties are made up among the gentlemen , and fruit parties including ladies , to visit the nearest groves in search of haws , nuts , &amp;c. ; or if any orchard has been cultivated in the vicinity by some ansient settler this is resorted to , and small parcels of its rare fruit purchased and taken home . Our fruit parties usually resorted to a grove about a mile distant on the west , and returned after an hour or two of delightful rambling , with baskets laden with the delicious haw berry , a feast for many days . The paw-paw , persimmon , &amp;c. , did not flourish in our vicinity . They love the bottom lands of streams . The groves at this season are indescribably charming . There is not in the large foliage that gorgeous variety which we find in the eastern forest . The trees wear a more sober and uniform complexion ; but there are a thousand minuter beauties which touch the heart . A few flowers linger in the borders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recesses some sprightly ones are found indicating by their vigor and freshness that they belong to the season of frost . Among these is one which I dearly love . It grows upon a tall stalk , sparely set with leaves , and forms near the top a beautiful shaft , studded with myriads of small flowers of the most exquisite hue and loveliness . They are like so many bright eyes looking gaily out into the pleasant world around . This flower does not belong to the deep groves , but is found in the little glades or openings in the woodside . And there , when October winds play among the leaves , and the bright sunshine pours through a sea of mist and smoke , in little nooks and corners , by decaying logs and upturned roots , where it has not gained admittance during all the leafy reign of summer , this bright flower is seen nodding and dancing merrily in the breeze as if it rejoiced in the approaching gloom . The squirrel searches timidly about among the fallen leaves , making provision for the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him , half in sport half in earnest , seeking the tender twigs whereof to make her dinner . The ripened nuts dropping among the leaves often startle her from her contemplations and drive her to seek refuge in the nearest clump of grass or bushes . These wood-parties are delightful recreations . Armed with thick shoes and provided with a basket each , for trophies of all descriptions  --  or if the distance be too great to be traversed on foot , mounted as we could be best provided ( the reader will remember pony ) without our riding dresses that we may not be cumbered with them when we reach the wood-away we go , free as the winds . North , south , east or west , the way is equally open . The wild Indian , mounted on his hunting horse , has scarcely a larger liberty than we . We scour the plain , leap or plough the " slues , " and gain the grove . here our steeds are fastened to trees and boughs , and we scatter . 0 what a joyous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , though all do not seem to do so . Toward evening when the shadows begin to lengthen on the turf , and the winds to sweep more chillingly through the grove , we gather at the rendezvous ; bring forth the shawls and other cautionary articles , spring into our saddles , give free rein , and after a swift and exhilarating ride , stop at our own doors filled with happy recollections , and made better in spirit and body by a day in the woods . About three miles from our village is an orchard , which has been cultivated // these many years by the widow of the original proprietor . It is the only one in the vicinity and the old lady 's name is therefore well known . And though no two words could be more unlike in orthography and sound than her own name , and that of the fruit she sold , yet to me the former was always synonymous with apples . You could not hear or speak it without having your mouth water for the delicious fruit with which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our villagers and the settlers on adjacent farms . She lived quite neatly in a half framed house , which you had to circumvent in order to enter it , there being three doors in the rear but none on the road-ward side . ( I avoid saying front to be exact in the use of words . ) The grounds contiguous to the house had at certain , seasons of the year rare beauty and richness . A stream of some magnitude swept in a crescent form around the orchard-clad hill , on which it stood . Across the road this hill sloped downward to the stream in a smooth green lawn , dotted with trees . On either hand from the house and skirting the bank of the stream in front of it , was a dense grove of the peach , the apple and wild crab apple trees . About the first of June these were in full bloom , and no perfume of Araby could excel their sweetness , no floral display , their beauty . As you approached the spot after sunset , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening wind swept over them , the whole air was laden with their fragrance ; and when you gained the summit of the hill and looked down upon the nodding clusters of blossoms set , as it were , in the tender green of the forest trees towering above them , nothing could be conceived more beautiful . Many a pleasant twilight ride have we enjoyed , lingering through the paths of this blossoming wilderness , inhaling its delicious odors and gazing on its unequalled beauty . I remember one evening when the sounds of bells seemed coming up from the grove below our path to greet us . They advanced slowly ; and we almost stopped in admiration of the gorgeous sunset above and the wealth of the foliage lavished around . Presently the sounds became more distinct and a large Pennsylvania wagon with a top of snowy whiteness emerged from the green wood . It was an emigrant fami ly  --  a group of the happiest faces and the cleanest persons one often finds among them . This was a favorite camping ground ,  --  and we lingered watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then reluctantly turned our horses ' heads homewards . How I envied those people  --  to lie down there bathed in the calm pure air of a June night , the dropping petals strewing their place of rest , the clear brooklet murmuring to their sleep ; who could submit patiently to imprisonment within four walls , as dull there as if nature were not doing her best in grove , plain and sky to induce us to leave them But here lived the old lady of apple memory , and here amid all this beauty had she lived from time immemGrial among the Yankee settlers . Her spirit had partaken of the scene . She lived neatly in doors , and there was an air of comfort about the exterior of her home quite in harmony with the feeling awakened by the surrounding scenery . How indeed could she have violated so beautiful a sanctuary , by a life altogether coarse and unlovely . But she was not proof against the pernicious influences which the possession of absolute power works in the mind which exercises it . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large region round her , she had grown capricious in her tastes , and now cared little to accommodate those whom she did not like . If you were one of her favorites and called on her in the fruit season , either by way of compliment or as a purchaser , she always presented you a dish of the choicest productions of her orchard to eat in her house , and made her happiest selection for your purchase . We were fortunately of this class . She regarded it as an evidence of kind and friendly interest , to inquire after the prosperity of her place , and usually tendered some hints gratis , on the cultivation of the fruit trees . In one of these familiar lessons , she remarked that there was a way to make trees bear much earlier than most persons supposed they would . " Pray how is that , Mrs. S. ? " " Why when we was a settin out the last of our trees , them in the Orchard down thar , " pointing out of the door , " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he wanted em to bear early he must set em out when the moon was in parrighee . " " When is that , Mrs. S. ? " - said I , // making a violent effort to preserve my gravity , for her keen eyes were fixed on my face . " 0 , 1 reckon folks that 's college larnt as you be , need n't ax me when the moon s in parrigitee . I expect you can tell any time when you look at it . " " I am not college learned , " I replied , " you know ladies never are , and I prestime my husband has forgotten all about the parrighee of the moon long since. ** " Well you can find it any time by looking in a nalmanic ; that 's whar we found it . Some folks " added the old lady , " do n't allow there 's anything in the moon about fruit and so on , but I reckon they do n't know so much more than other folks as they think they do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're planted at sartin ' times o ' the moon , and there ca n't nobody make me think taint so , cause I 've tried it . Taint so much account about some things ; I reckon taters does as well planted one time as another , and so does beets and so on , but cabbages and onions and all them dought to be planted in the new o ' the moon , if you want em to be of any count . " 9 Such edifying conversation usually occupied the time spent at the old lady 's house . If you were particularly deferential and received instructions meekly , you were always rewarded by having your pockets or basket filled with the choicest apples for your own especial gratification . I know of no other way in which the good woman ever corrupted the morals of her visitors , but this was bad enough . Whose integrity could stand unshaken before a dish heaped with apples such as money could not buy ? Who would venture to correct the friendly old woman 's orthodpy at such a risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apple bins of the Eastern cellars as I had.
