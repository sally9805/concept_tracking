PAUL PERRIL , THE MERCHANT 'S SON :  --  OR THE  --  ADVENTURES OF A NEW-ENGLAND BOY LAUNCHED UPON LIFE . BY PROFESSOR J. H. INGRAHAM ; AUTHOR OF THE QUADROON , ' LAFITTE , ' MONTEZUMA , ' &c.,; &c.; PART SECOND . BOSTON : WILLIAMS &; BROTHERS , 22 CONGRESS STREET . Preliminaries Main text CHAPTER I. The Sally . After leaving the gate , San Piedro , I continued my walk along the inside of the wall until I came to the nezt gate which I found guarded in like manner with the first . In front of it was drawn up a squadron of cavalry as if about to issue forth into the country , and also a battalion of infantry . Several mounted officers were grouped near the gate in conversation , and seemed much excited . Suspecting some interesting movement was about to take place , I drew as near them as I could without peril to myself , and watched the proceedings . Upon the wall above the gate , I saw two officers standing with spy-glasses surveying the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sat upon his horse below surrounded by his staff . In their rear was the cavalry , about one hundred and fifty fierce looking fellows armed with carbines , pistols in holders , and huge carbines slung across their backs . Every man wore a mustache , which added to their ferocious aspect .  --  They were dressed in blue jackets and gray trowsers . Silent and expectant they sat immovable in their high pommeled saddles , each with his sword drawn and in his hand and resting across the saddle-bow.  --  Behind them the infantry , in scarlet coats and white trowsers with tall caps crested with horse hair , were drawn up in a line . The little wicket in the great gate was opened as I came up by the captain of the guard , and a colonel alighting , took a peep through into the green but treeless country . All at once the officers on the battlement above the gate shouted some word of alarm , and instantly the colonel was in his saddle , the wide leaved gates were thrown open , the draw-bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cavalry wheeled rapidly into column and advanced at a round trot through the gate and over the resounding bridge spanning the moat . The infantry wheeled and followed at a brisk march , but the cavalry without waiting for them pursued their way headed by their colonel , ( a gallant looking fellow to whom I had sold many a glass of soda ! ) towards a cluster of little hills strewn with ruins about a mile distant . I could follow their course with my eye , as the gates remained open in order that the general , who remained within the defences , might watch their progress . By stooping a little I could see underneath his horse what was going on quite as well as he did in his saddle . In five minutes after the cavalry quitted the drawbridge , they disappeared about three quarters of a mile distant in a sort of ravine . The infantry did not follow exactly in their course , but detoured more to the left , yet moving forward at a steady trot . Have they yet reached the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the gate-way . They are very near , senor , ' one of them answered . They will not fail to cut off the party . ' What party ? ' I asked of a Spaniard who stood near me , and whom I had often seen in the shop , for he had a great fancy for brandied soda-water . They have discovered a detachment of about a hundred Patriot cavalry hovering about the old convent Santa Maria , ' he answered ; and suspecting some mischief may grow out of it , they have sent out a detachment to disperse them . General Torres fears that they intend to mount a battery upon the walls of the convent , which would annoy the city not a little . He therefore takes this prompt step to drive them away . ' I thanked the Spanish gentleman for his information , kindly given as it was , with a slow and distinct enunciation so that I could understand each word ; for he seemed to appreciate the difficulty of a foreigner 's unaccustomed ear in getting hold of the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if distinctly pronounced would be comprehended . I always desired those who replied to me to speak slowly , which they always cheerfully did ; and I found them invariably happy to oblige me , and ready to take pains to make me understand every word they uttered . In this manner , and by talking Spanish with all and as often as possible , I rapidly acquired the language ; so that I opened conversations with confidence with the citizens . But to enable me to do this I studied three or four hours daily . My grammar and phrase book was almost always in my hand ; and in the shop when I was not drawing soda I was studying words and phrases . Every thing I said in English to my comrades , I mentally put the same into Spanish . In this way I learned rapidly , and became an interpreter oftentimes for my less ambitious friends . In about ten minutes after the detachment was hidden by the bare hillocks it re-appeared upon the ground in front of the convent . At the same instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruins , which they had doubtless been inspecting for the purpose of mounting cannon upon it ; for Llavelleja ( I afterwards learned ) was at their head . He dashed past the Brazilian horse discharging their carbines at them in a volley as they rode by , and scoured away for their camp four miles off . The Brazilians tumbled from their horses in great numbers , and were for a moment thrown into great confusion . The General cursed as he saw this , and seemed almost furious , while his officers and the captain of the guard swore like demons incarnate . The cavalry , however , soon rallied and spurred on after the Ranchero horse , filling the air with their cries and the ringing of pistols and carbines . The infantry pressed on to intercept the Patriot horse at a stone bridge which they would have to cross by a road which led nearer to the walls of the city than the convent was . The infantry reached it first and presented a boid front . The Patriots as they came up did not draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then drew their sabres and in an instant they cut their way through them , fairly riding them down . The next instant they were lost to the eye in a hollow beyond a low hill . The Brazilian cavalry came up in a few seconds afterwards , and without waiting to help the wounded infantry soldiers , dashed across the bridge in full pursuit . That pursuing detachment will hardly return again to the city , ' said the old Spaniard to me quietly as we stood watching the two clouds of dust which indicated the position of the two parties . The Patriots , when they get so many Brazilians outside of the walls will not willingly let them back again ! ' The Colonel will fall into an ambush , ' said the General , speaking with solicitude . He is rash to pursue so far . Fire a gun for his re-call . ' A cannon was discharged from the top of the wall . At the same moment we saw the two clouds of dust unite . The report of fire-arms reached us but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . The General became excited . He gave a few orders with rapidity . His aids galloped away with the speed of the wind . In ten minutes they returned at the head of a regiment of cavalry mounted in hot haste , half the men putting on their accoutrements and fastening them as they rode . As they came up to the gate , the General , who was a grey-headed warrior of sixty , placed himself at their head , and the whole body of horse began to pour through the gate like a river of helmets and banners . They numbered full five hundred men . The gate was wide open ! The country was all before me ! Why could I not manage to get out with the rest unperceived . In two hours I could reach the patriot camp . Such were my reflections as the long columns of horse was trotting past me . A man in the rear platoon whom I had seen once at Sauls , ( who said he was the only honest soldier he had known ) dropped his helmet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up and handed it to him . As I did so , I asked upon the instant impulse , if he would let me mount behind him ! Spring ! ' he answered as readily . I obeyed , placing my foot upon his , and the next moment was galloping over the draw-bridge in the rear platoon of the squadron ! My sensations I will not try to depict . My blood thrilled with excitement . I caught the enthusiasm of the time and scene , and only wished I was behind a Patriot instead of an Imperial soldier , or rather upon my own horse riding in their columns against the Brazilian troops . We moved forward at a rapid trot , sometimes at a gallop . The onward motion of a large body of cavalry , the jingling of spurs and chains , the clattering of sabre-sheaths , the tramp of two thousand hoofs , the flaunting of banners , the glitter of arms , armour , for many of the cavalry wore cuirasses and steel helmets , the warlike swell of bugles , and the loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most striking scenes of my life . The road along which we moved was an unfenced pathway , winding about low hillocks of offal which surrounded the walls like huge ant hills . Not a tree or shrub grew near it . We at length came to the bridge where the infantry had been overthrown . We passed them drawn up in column . The ground was strewn with the dead and wounded . The General lingered a moment to order them to march back to the city with their wounded after stopping and burying their dead . We then swept past them across the bridge and over the bodies and up-turned faces of men whom I had seen half an hour before leave the gate full of life and warlike ambition . The vultures already scented the blood from afar , and were gathering from all quarters of the horizon to the banquet . I could see them approaching at first seemingly no bigger than flies , then growing larger and larger to the eye till they hovered above the bridge with their huge flapping wings circling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we should pass to alight upon the carcases of the dead . My soul sickened at the sight of them , and nearly cooled the warlike fire of my blood . After crossing the bridge we galloped on at top speed for half a mile over a barren field covered with briars and strewn with skeletons of horses , cattle , dogs , and other glaring bones which once made up a human frame . After crossing this heath we entered a pass between two low ridges . I here looked back . The city with its high wall and towers , and dome , and battle-mounted roofs rose with imposing majesty from the heath-like suburbs which environed it . It looked like some gigantic citadel , and to my eyes seemed impregnable.  --  To the right the masts of the shipping in the harbor were visible , like a leafless forest ; and farther beyond towered the Mount with its castle above which waved numerous flags . The sides of the pass soon shut out this view , and I had time to reflect upon my novel situation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' thought I , astride a Brazilian horse , behind a Brazilian trooper riding for life and death to deliver a party of the Emperor 's troops from a Patriot force . In the first place I had no business to leave the city without my three companions . I have gone beyond my instructions ; for I have been especially instructed to take a survey of the walls but not to go beyond them . My absence , too , can not be explained to them , if I escape from this troop and go to the Patriot camp , as there is no communication with the city . It may also place them under suspicion , and prevent them from leaving the city when they wish . ' These and other reflections led me to resolve to go back with the troop and not attempt to quit it , as I was planning to do . Much as I wished to join the Patriots , I felt that I had no right to do so , under the circumstances , without my friends . It would be an ungenerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I therefore resolved to stick to the trooper 's saddle , and return with him if he went back alive ; but avail myself of the opportunity of getting all the knowledge I could . I also thought that when I returned that we might manage to slip out of the gate , one at the time , and so effect our purpose . My cogitations , which my trooper had not disturbed by any notice of me , were now interrupted by the report of carbines at the head of the column , and loud orders from the General to push forward . Now , ' thought I , ' here 's fighting , and I am in for a bullet or two , or a sabre-cut ! ' I however , stuck close to my man , feeling sure that a bullet would hit him before it would hit me , as he was tolerably portly and looked likely to keep all the lead that went into his body . I felt however , helpless , without any weapon  --  though I did not like using one against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out my pistol . It was a small affair , and not having much faith in it , I asked the soldier if he would let me have one of his . Ah , you there , mi amigo ! ' he said looking over his shoulder and laughing . Have you not had ride enough yet ? ' I mean to go with you to the end , but lend me a pistol , ' I said very seriously , for we were each instant approaching the uproar of a conflict . Take it , my man , ' he said ; but I 'll try and protect you . You had best not come I think . ' I am here , and must make the best of it , ' I answered , feeling that I would give every cent of my little stock of money , to be safely behind old Bedrick 's counter drawing soda-water . But I had little time for regrets . He handed me the heavy pistol and I half cocked it and set my teeth for desperate adventure . By leaning over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that we had emerged from the pass into a green , pleasant region of fields , woodland , gardens and villas , scenery that I had often viewed from the coof of our house . The whole vicinity of the city would have been of similar beauty but for the policy of its defenders , who laid waste and destroyed for a mile around it , whatever would afford ambush for a foe . At the extremity of an open field just before us , which skirted the road , I saw a party of Patriots retiring up the slope firing at our van as they retreated , and driving before them full a hundred cavalry prisoners . The ground before us were heaped with the slain  --  horses and men , and temporarily obstructed our advance . The brave Patriots , it seems , had halted in ambush , at this place , and fallen suddenly upon the two hundred and fifty pursuing Brazilian horse , had literally hewed them to pieces , taking one third prisoners . When we came up we found but about thirty remaining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought . The hundred Patriots did not seem to fear us , but trotted at an easy pace , loading , and turning and firing in their saddles as they went . Our General called a halt to remove the dead bodies of horse and rider that barricaded the narrow path , and then ordered half the cavalry to wheel from column to the left and fall upon the Patriot horse . CHAPTER II . The Counter-march . The Patriot cavalry were just retiring over the verge of the hill , when the order to wheel from column and charge them was given . To effect this manuvre , it was necessary for the rear of our column to take the lead , as we had to gallop round a garden to gain the field .  --  This placed me in the very front platoon with only my trooper 's broad back between me and the enemy . Our detachment consisted of about half the cavalry , the remainder led on by the General himself moving forward at a hard gallop to endeavor to intercept the Patriots at a shallow stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the hill . The Colonel who had commanded the party which had been cut to pieces , and whom I have said I had seen in the shop , now rode to the head of our column , and led it conjointly with his own commander . His helmet was cloven nearly through to the head , his cheek was partly cut away , and the calf of his leg badly cut by a sabre . He did not seem to mind his wounds . His fine eyes flashed as he spurred on and waved his sword . He hoped yet to retrieve the ill-fortune of the day and avenge his honor upon his foes ; for he had been overthrown by a force scarcely one third as large as that he had commanded . His eye fell upon me . He recognized me , and falling back near me , he regarded me an instant with surprise , and then said in tolerable English , What do you here , senor ? How is this , Pedro ? ' he sternly asked of the trooper in Portuguese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' answered the man stammering . He was by the gate  --  I dropped my helmet . He was so kind as to pick it up . He asked me if he might mount behind me . I had seen him at my friend Saul Americano 's and thinking he might like to see a skirmish , I bade him mount . ' You have done wrong . Ride out of the column and return at once to the city . He is too young , and is unarmed . ' Senor , ' I said in English , ' if you will let me remain now that I am here , I should be very glad . Pedro ought not to be disgraced on my account . ' Well , well , but you should be mounted better than that , ' he said smiling as well as he could for the wound in his cheek . As he spoke , he pointed to a horse which had belonged to some of the slain dragoons , and which was cantering along parallel with our column , as if desirous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he said , ride up and secure that horse for the young Americano ! ' Pedro glad to escape censure , galloped out of the ranks and coming along side of the animal seized him by the rein . Now into the saddle , ' he cried , and without hesitation I sprang into the deep , well secured seat , between the high back and higher pummel . The reins were upon his neck . I grasped them and gathered them up , and at the command of the Colonel galloped up by his side , and went dashing along with him at the head of the column . I could hardly realize my own identity as I thus found myself thundering along one of a body of three hundred horse pressing forward to engage in battle . It was useless to wish myself in the city or at my father 's quiet fire-side . I had run the risk with my eyes open , and there remained nothing for me but to make the best of it . Had I been on the right side in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was I had to spur whither fortune pushed me . You did wrong to come out with the troop , young man , ' said the Colonel after looking at me a moment or two in silence as I galloped by his rein , but you look as if you could look out for yourself . Keep close to me whatever happens ! ' I will try to , ' I answered . At the same moment we came in sight of the Quacho horsemen who were crossing a level field about a third of a mile distant . They did not seem to be in hurry , but bore themselves with that bold air of defiance and contempt of their enemies which always characterized them . They drove before them a number of mounted prisoners quite equal to their own . They were easily distinguished from them by the flowing skirts of their scarlet ponchas , their white , fringed , short trowsers , and broad somberos , as well as by their superior horsemanship . Forward ! ' shouted our commander , pointing at them with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and setting spurs dashed onward . Forward and charge , and give no quarter ! ' again shouted the officer as we drew near them . The Quacho horse instead of trying to escape , suddenly wheeled to the right and left and retiring swiftly behind their body of prisoners turned about and faced us , placing the prisoners directly between them ; selves and our advancing column . It was a masterly manuvre . The head of our detachment instinctly drew rein . The Quachos fired a volley over the heads of the prisoners at us , the shot whistling about our ears and knocking here and there a trooper from his saddle . The bold fellows then put spurs to their horses and winding a lively air upon their bugles , went off like the wind , mocking pursuit by our heavy cavalry . The next moment we came up with the prisoners , and to prevent running them down had to halt so suddenly as to throw us into confusion . Before we could form again , and get a passage open through the prisoners nothing could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they descended into a hollow of the country about half a mile distant . At the same moment , General Torres with the other division of Brazilian cavalry came up on the flank , having been unable to get ahead of the Rancheros on account of a ravine which he had to enfilade to its extremity . This delay saved the Patriots , and almost maddened the Brazilian officers . Torres rode up and consulted a few moments with the two colonels . I could not make out their words as they spoke rapidly in Portugues ; but I learned that Colonel De Silvia ( my friend ) was desirous of pursuing with the whole body , while Torres and the other Colonel remonstrated , fearing that they might fall in with Llavelleja 's main body , and thus be cut off from the city . I had seen Llavelleja himself , the hero of my imagination . I have said that he placed himself in command of the hundred horse which had been to reconnoitre the old convent , and there is no doubt their masterly escape was wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of him when he placed the prisoners between our fire . He rode at the head of his little party , which was diminished to about eighty men , mounted upon an iron-gray charger without the usual gay trappings with which his men covered their horses . He was dressed in a blue frock closely buttoned to his chin , and scarlet trowsers with Wellington boots reaching above his knees . Upon his head was a laced chapeau with a snow white plume covering it like a cloud . He was tall and finely made , and sat his horse like an Arabian chief , firmly , gracefully , and without thought . He did not hold the reins which lay upon his horse 's mane , but guided him by the pressure of his knees and voice . He had holster 's to his saddle ; and in his hand was the sword which he waved as he gave his orders . His voice I heard plainly two or three times . It was deep , rich and manly , and struck me as calm as if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed in gazing upon him , that I was nearly over-run by the troopers behind me . How I wished that I could safely gallop across the space that separated us and place myself by his side I even calculated the chances , but my di-cretion got the better part of my thoughtless wish , and I stuck by the side of my Colonel . All this cogitations within my breast occurred while the Patriots were galloping round to the van of their prisoners to check our charge . The next moment , as I have said , they were pouring in the volley from their carbines , and scouring away towards their camp . As I was directly in the van of our column and open to their shot ( not having the friendly back of my dragoon Pedro as a shield ) I woundered then and wonder now that I escaped ; for a score of men examine back were killed in their saddles . I had to feel my face and examine my body very suspiciously all over with my eyes to see if I was bleeding any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hit by someone of the whistling balls . The shot were a quarter as large as billiard balls , being discharged from their carbines , which looked like iron trumpets set in short gun stocks . After a brief purley between the officers , the command was given for the column to counter-march at a rapid trot towards the city from which we were nearly a league ; a bold distance for Brazilian soldiers to adventure from the cover of their walls , with six thousand Ranchero riders within two or three miles . The prisoners whom we had rescued , or rather whom the Patriots had resigned to us , though mounted , were without arms . They were ordered to the front , and in this manner we retraced our way to the city gates . As we came up to the bridge we disturbed vast flocks of vultures that were already feeding upon the dead bodies . They waited stubbornly and impudently until we were within pistol shot , when they would either hop away to the road-side , dragging reeking entrails after them , or soar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hover as if reluctant to quit their prey , and fearful lest it should be snatched from them . Colonel De Silvia , to whose detachment the dead men had belonged when living , here stopped with a sufficiently large force detailed from the troop , to bury the torn and disfigured bodies . As I rode by them I saw that those bodies which were not otherwise torn had their eyes picked out . It was a horrible sight and one which will never be effaced from my memory . Colonel De Silva desired me to stay until the bodies were buried ; but the scene was so revolting that I was about to say that I had rather go back into the city , when it occured to me that I might have an opportunity of effecting my escape while they were engaged in inhuming the slain , and gallop to Llavellaja 's camp . It was a bold suggestion and altogether a mad one ; and one that could only have been hatched in the brain of an impulsive , thoughtless lad of eighteen , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought myself ; and I trust that the reader will put down all my follies that he may find here recorded to the indiscretion of youth ; ' a charitable veil that every generation finds it more or less in need of . So I remained with him , letting the main body gallop on towards the city , the walls of which as well as the roofs and towers I could see covered with anxious spectators of the sortie of General Torres and his cavalry . As I had nothing particular to do , while the soldier were excavating a natural cavity somewhat deeper to contain the bodies , I sat in my saddle aloof from the melancholy spectacle which my eyes refused to rest upon after the first look , and watched the vultures . They are large , dark brown birds , taller and longer in body than the wild turkey , and covered with very coarse feathers . They appear immensely strong and evinced their strength ; for when we first disturbed them on the bridge three of them having their talons and bills fastened into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold ; which they did at last only when the hoofs of the advancing horses threatened them . They have a small but fierce sharp eye , and are slow in their motions , especially when full to repletion after gorging . Then they will scarcely move from the way side . They looked to me more like beasts than birds  --  a sort of feathered wolf . Some of them , now sat upon the walls and ruins of an old mill near watching vigilantly the soldiers , while others more boldly at every opportunity would light upon a body and tear flesh from it . About a score of them circled about in the air , sometimes swooping so low that I more than once waved a sabre that I had picked up from the ground , which was strewn with the arms of the fallen , to keep them off ; for as I was light , and they were about to be robbed of the dead , I was not sure but they would carry me off out of my saddle bodily , by way of reprisal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the Portuguese soldiers laughed at my apprehensions . Having pistols , sabre and horse , the reader will see that I only needed helmet and cuirass to make a very respectable looking Brazilian trooper . These I could have had for the picking them up , as they lay around in any quantity , but although I had as it were , taken part in a charge against the Patriots with a body of Imperial cavalry , I had no idea , with my patriotic predilections and sympathies , to identify myself with them more fully . I felt already that as an American , I had sufficiently disgraced myself . Which I was watching the voracious vultures , who were also as intently watching the work of burying the dead , with a certain air of dogged silence as if they privately resolved to scratch them up after the soldiers should finish their work and retire , I was startled by a low howling on the left , as if a borde of wolves were advancing .  --  Looking in the direction , I beheld what was little better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They came on in a body each striving to outstrip his fellow , and the whole band howling with savage vehemence . They came up to within a hundred rods of the bridge and there stopped , snuffing the air , and yelping and yelling . Some of them then trotted forward , the rest followed at first with hesitation , for they did not much relish the presence of the soldiers , and the whole legion swept past me within a few yards and dashed towards the dead bodies on the bridge . CHAPTER III . The Barrack Yard . The hungry pack of vulture like dogs having swept past me , howling from every throat , dashed towards six or seven bodies which the soldiers were removing for burial in the deep hole they had excavated . The men stood their ground for a moment and then fled . The fierce brutes pounced upon the dead with ravenous cries that chilled my blood . The Colonel , who was upon his horse near by , shouted for the men to fire a volley upon them . The discharge did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen of their number were knocked over dead . One of them which I saw tumbled over and over by a ball which broke his fore shoulder after gaining his feet , went limping back again to the human carrion as fierce for his food as before .  --  Altogether it was a fearful and revolting scene and I never wish to witness such another one . After several vollies , which was followed up by a charge of thirty or forty mounted men , the dogs , ( if dogs they can be called ) were driven off at a distance , where they sat upon their haunches licking their bloody jaws and howling at intervals , with the most fearful cries of rage and desire , while the soldiers once more proceeded to bury the mangled remains . At length the rites of sepulture , rude and hurried as they were , were completed , the Colonel made the sign of the cross ove the mound and then gave orders for his men to mount and fall into column . I had been so much taken up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until this moment , my purpose of trying to effect my escape to the Patriot lines . As the cavalry were wheeling into marching order , I began to reflect upon my original intention . But a moment 's observation showed me the peril I should be in making the attempt . I had began to think that it was my duty to return to the city and share the fate of my friends . Even if I could effect my escape to the camp of the Buenos Ayrean General , it would be like treachery to my companions who , placing confidence in me , had appointed me to act as a spy and ascertain what were the best means of quitting the town . These considerations fixed my decision , and I resolved to return with the Colonel and his escort , and not think of joining the patriot camp until I could do so with my comrades . When I had come to this resolution , which ought from the first to have governed me  --  but when I was so near the camp and so well mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silva rode up and ordered me to fall in along side of him . He looked very grave and stern , and one or two expressions he let drop , showed me that he was reflecting with mortification upon his defeat . I rode by his rein in silence , the column winding on in the rear among the low hillocks that covered the desolate surface of the country near the walls . The dogs had hardly waited for the rear to move , ere they rushed howling towards the place where the bodies had laid . Our way did not lay by the road we had come , but we took a path to the left to enter the city by a gate further to the East . It led us near the Campo Santo , ' or Holy Field , ' a burial ground of large dimensions walled with stone and situated upon the side of a low elevation . It was the cemetery for the inhabitants of the city . A desolate place it was . Scsrcely a tree shaded its white-washed and crumbling tombs , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monuments , and dogs wandered about seeing prey in the shallow graves . The burning sun shone down hot upon the place , and the atmosphere was foetid with exhalations from the putrid sepulchres . But what was most revolting was the sight of human skeletons with the muscles still cleaving to them , laying about in the holy ground , ' and here a skull , and there an arm , with its fleshless fingers . To crown this desecration of the dead , in one corner of the burial place were cords ' of human bones , piled fike wood , eight and ten feet high , with pyramids of skulls heaped upon the top . It was altogether a Golgotha , ' a place of skulls . I asked Colonel De Silva what it meant . He answered me in English that every year the bodies were taken from the graves and thus disposed of , that the graves might be used for fresh tenants . The half-fleshed skeletons strewn about , he said , had doubtless been torn from their graves by the vultures and dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such scenes ; but I shuddered and prayed fervently to Heaven that it might never be my fate or that of any of my friends to die in this country and be committed to the Campo Santo for burial . Leaving this horrible place behind us , we trotted along a stony path bordered by thistles , which run parallel with the moat , and at length came round to the eastern gate , which the Colonel decided to re-enter the city by , as it was near his quarters . For a few hundred yards we had the moat close upon our right , the walls towering beyond them high in the air , and thronged with troops and citizens watching us.  --  The moat was filled with dark-green , stagnant water , covered with a slimy mould , and its edges lined with the most abominable filth . I thought that its condition was sufficient to deter an enemy from attempting to cross it even were it fordable . The draw-bridge which remained raised until we came within speaking distance of the gate , now was slowly lowered like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at the same time thrown open and we trotted across the bridge at a round pace and entered the city . As the last man of our column entered , the bridge was raised and the gate closed . The Colonel did not halt his troop , but riding at a hand-gallop dashed through an arched way in a high wall which led into the court of the cavalry barracks . Here they wheeled into line , and after a few brief words addressed to them by him were dismissed to their quarters .  --  Poor fellows ! glad enough they seemed to be discharged from further duty , for they had had a hard day 's work of it , and a defeat instead of a victory as the result . I threw myself from my horse with the rest , and the animal released galloped off to the stables . As I felt quite satisfied with my little military experience in the Brazilian cavalry I did not delay making the best of my way out of the barrack-yard . I deposited my helmet upon the ground and placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to future use for them , I walked towards the gate . The sentry seeing me thus accoutred and in citizen 's dress , no doubt thought I had been stealing the arms , and instead of letting me pass out presented his musket across the passage and ordered me to surrender the weapons . I understood him , little as I knew of Portuguese , and very firmly told him in Spanish for his Portuguese ' that he should not have them . You are a thief , ' said he , and I shall put you under arrest in the guard-house . ' As he spoke he laid his hand upon my shoulder . I drew back and cocked one of my pistols , and told him in as good Spanish as I could muster , with here and there an English word by way of greater emphasis , that I had fairly come by the arms in the sortie ,  --  though they happened to belong to a Brazilian dragoon instead af a Quacho  --  and that I would keep them . The fellow stepped back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought his musket to the charge , and I believe would have run me through if I had not coolly stood my ground and covered his breast with the muzzle of my pistol . In these respective attitudes we stood for full thirty seconds , I resolved not to surrender my weapons , and he hesitating whether to run the risk of bayonetting me , when my old friend the trooper , who had mounted me behind himself , came up , with others , on hearing the uproar . The first thing he did was to knock up the sentry 's musket and then to wrest my pistol from my hand . He demanded to know what was the difficulty and why the sentinel was about to kill his Americano amigo . ' The soldier told his story , when the stout trooper made a warm defence of me and my conduct . It was not altogether comprehensible to me ; but it produced quite a change in my favor . The soldiers about looked upon me with smiles , and the sentinel gave me his hand and shook mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step into the guard-house with half a score of them and drink a glass of muddy sweet wine with them , when I took my leave , in high favor with the be-mustached fellows , half of whom , I forgot to say , were three shades blacker than ebony . I now made the best of my way back to the shop from which I had been absent on this my first warlike expedition , no less than five hours . It was past one when I reached the shop . Rairfax was there alone . Upon seeing me , he exclaimed , between anger and gratification ,  --  Why , Peril , where in the deuce have you been all the forenoon ?  --  I began to think you had got into some scrape . ' Where is the old man ? ' I asked , with some perturbation , for I stood in a wholesome fear of the bald-headed deceiver , and apprehended a blow up . ' He came in after you had been gone three hours and asked where you were : I told him you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He swore a little and then , I believe , went round to the other shop . ' While Fairfax was speaking the old man entered . Soh , you are here ! Very well , sir ! You , I see , think my time your own . If you dare to leave the shop again without my leave I 'll have you thrown into the calaboose . One word of complaint from me and you 'd be arrested , no matter whether you were innocent or not . They do n't ask about such things here . I 'll have you up , sirrah ! ' Here the old man stopped , pale with rage , and for want of words expressive of his displeasure , shook his fist in my face . I was about to make some quick retort when I caught Fairfax looking warmly at me . So I repressed my resentment and smiling , walked behind the counter . He did not say any more then , as the old black cook we had hired came to say that dinner was ready up stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work , we four went all on the house top to enjoy the cool night air before going down into our sleeping rooms . They had asked me during the afternoon to tell them where I had been , for they all saw by my manner that I had something to tell , and I had put them off till evening . Now , beneath the starry skies , with a pleasant breeze from the water , and seated upon the battlements in one corner of the roof , I told them the events of the day . When I had done they expressed their regret that they had not been with me , so that we might have reached the Patriot camp together .  --  We then talked over several plans of getting out of the city , but each presented obstacles that seemed insurmountable . The idea of getting out of the gates it seemed useless to entertain . At length Radsworth suggested that we should be on the watch when another sortie would be made , offer ourselves as volunteers , and when we got fairly outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patriot camp . But I had had experience enough in my mad-cap foray to see the difficulty and danger attending such a measure , and opposed it . We seem likely to have such difficulty in getting out of the city , ' at length said Hewitt , I begin to think , on the whole , we had best stick by the old man . I had a talk with him to-day and he said he would by and by give us a fair compensation . ' I would n't trust him , ' answered Fairfax , warmly . Besides , I have no fancy to be a shop-boy . It will stick to us through life as it is , I dare say , and I am determined to quit it at once ! ' Do n't you mean to go into the shop again ? ' demanded Hewitt . No , ' answered Fairfax , firmly . My mind is made up . I have nearly a hundred dollars in silver . I will go and board at the Coffee House , and be on the look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time I have spent it , I will find some way of escape , or I will let the Portuguese tumble me into the callaboose ! ' If I had money , ' I answered promptly , I would go to the Coffee House with you . But you know , boys , how I am ! I must stick to the old man or be dependent on others . ' I will lend you , ' said Fairfax . I wo n't borrow , ' I answered , so long as the old man has a roof , bed and table which I have a claim to ! ' I have but a little more money than Perril , answered Hewitt , and I shall have to stick to the soda-pipe . ' I think it best to try it a little longer , and let Fairfax look out for us , we at the same time watching every chance for our escape , ' said Radsworth . After a little more discussion of our several positions , it was finally decided that Fairfax should go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to find a way of escape from the city for the whole party , while we were to remain with the old man , but not to relax our diligence in bringing round our ultimate purposes . We then retired for the night , leaving the howling of dogs and the calls of sentinels , making night hideous with their confused noises . CHAPTER IV . The Crisis . The next morning brought with it a crisis in our affairs as the reader will shortly see . As soon as the breakfast was over , the old man got up from the table , and rubbing his hands together began , as usual , to hurry us away to the shops . Come , boys , it is seven o'clock ! time to be at work ! Lazy legs never made full purses ! Stir yourselves and let 's see which shop will take the most money to-day ! ' I have decided , sir , ' said Fairfax firmly , not to go into your soda shop again ! ' and he compressed his lips with a resolute air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with surprise and anger ; what is that you say ? ' I will repeat it again if you desire , Mr. Bedrick . I say it is my firm determination never to go into your soda-shop again ! ' You young scoundrel , you ! ' cried the infuriated old man ; I 'll have the city guard here in five minutes ! I 'll '  --  I do n't fear the city guard nor you , sir ! You have more reason to fear it , old man , than we have . ' I ? I ? ' repeated the old gentleman almost bursting with rage , and , as I thought , looking at the same time conscious of guilt . What do you mean , sir ? How do you dare address my honored father so ? ' demanded the young gentlemen Ned , in spectacles , looking white as ashes and bullying up to Fairfax . Do n't interfere , sir , between Fairfax and Mr. Bedrick , ' said I laying my hand gently upon our tutor 's ' arm , and drawing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would very gladly knock me over ; but he saw something in my eye that doubtless restrained his rage within discreet bounds ; for he was a contemptible fellow , and I most cordially despised him , as also did the rest of us , not exceptlng even his own brother . A conspiracy , father ! Let us call the police . ' He ran to the door , when Radsworth placed himself before it and said quietly , If you know when you are well off , Ned , you will keep quiet and let Fairfax and your father have their talk out . ' The student ' drew back shaking with rage and fear , while Fairfax continued to the old man , I repeat sir , you have the most reason to fear the city guard ! Does not your conscience tell you so ? It is time we all understood one another . Hear me , Mr. Bedrick , for I am resolved to speak . I speak not only for myself but for my friends here , for we are one in interest as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yes , sir . Do not try to hide your crime against as . We know all , and knew all before we landed at Montevideo . You wrote down to the Lyceum when we were at school , saying that you were a merchant going out to Buenos Ayres to a large Commission House , and that you wished Professor Haley to recommend to you four respectable youths who would like to go out with you . Your letter bore the face of truth and fairness , and your references seemed honorable men . We four , deceived ourselves as well as our parents , embraced the offer and joined you at Boston . There the veil which covered your base designs upon us , was carefully kept drawn , and we embarked with you wholly unsuspicious of your character and ultimate object . You represented yourself as the owner of the cargo of the brig , and told us many other things to bolster up your deception . At length , when we began to suspect the trick , Captain Pright unveiled the whole  --  removed the mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told us that so far from owning the cargo , you had nothing on board but four soda fountains , a few boxes of syrup , and some other articles for opening soda-shops . He told us that you were a broken merchant dependent on your friends , who had paid your passage out , and given you the money to buy these articles , glad to get you out of the country on any terms , they had given you a character . ' They were not aware that you had imposed upon us by deceiving us with the belief that you were to open an extensive ' mercantile house , when you were to open only a paltry soda-shop . They supposed we went with you with our eyes open .  --  Sir , why did you practice this arrant roguery upon four young men of good families ! Why did you not employ youths from a different condition in life ? Doubtless , because you could find none willing to go with you to tend soda-shops in Buenos Ayres who could be trusted ; and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get respectable youths whom you could trust . Did you not look forward , sir , to the time when those youths arriving in Buenos Ayres should see the deception you had practiced upon them . Or did you suppose that , finding themselves twelve hundred miles from home , they would be willing to become your hewers of wood and drawers of water ! But , sir , you are mistaken . When we learned the full extent of the treachery toward us , from the Captain of the vessel , our indignation was with difficulty restrained . But we resolved to remain quiet until we reached Buenos Ayres and then throw ourselves upon the protection of the Consul . Instead of going there we were brought in here . To the last you kept up your deception , and suggested to us , that as we were unable to reach our port we might pass our time in selling soda . But I will not repeat all your falsehoods . We came on shore with you ! we assisted you ! we have continued to do so to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we pitied your indigence and would give you a start , and partly because we felt that you owed us a house so long as you had one . If we had possessed money we should not have remained with you a day . You have upon us no claim whatsoever .  --  We have assisted you in your shop because we could do no better . I have , however , resolved to remain no longer in an occupation for which neither my ambition , my family connexions nor my education has fitted me . I have enough to support me a few weeks , and I shall go to the Coffee-house and board . For the food , lodging and bed you have given me , I have re-paid you my labor in the shop . As for my friends here , they have less money than I have , and they are willing to stay with you , I believe , till they can do better ; though the fact that we have been soda-shop boys will always level us in the eyes of others of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My friends here , now , will speak for themselves . ' Thus ending his spirited speech , Fairfax walked aside to the window and amused himself with gazing into the street , and humming Yankee Doodle . The old man and his son had listened in silent consternation ; the face of the former livid and flushed by turns as a sense of guilt or anger filled his bosom . At length he spoke with a cowed look , more like a criminal in the presence of his judges , than the avaricious and petty tyrant , whom we had so long quietly suffered to rule over us . I confess that I have in some sort deceived you , young gentlemen ; but I wanted respectable young men : and I supposed that you could easily better your fortunes after you got out here , if you did n't like to stay with me . But I , in truth , hoped through the profit that I trusted to realize in three or four years with my shops , to accumulate a sufficient capital to enable me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my intention . But if you are resolved to leave me , ' he continued in a whining tone , I ca n't help it , though it would give me great satisfaction to have you continue with me . I acknowledge that I ca n't hold you ; but I trust you wo n't all of you desert me , just as I have begun to make some money . If you will remain with me I will agree not only to keep you , but pay each of you a quarter of a dollar a day besides ! ' The price of one glass of soda-sangaree , ' I answered smiling at my companions . I will give you then half a dollar , ' responded the old man . ' I shall be ruined if you leave me ! ' There are your two sons , ' I answered with irony . But I suppose they are quite above the business . ' William , ' you know , I have no control of , ' responded the old man almost crying ; and as for Edwin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides his time is taken up in studying the language ! ' We are quite as much entitled to act the gentleman as either o your sons , sir , ' answered Radsworth ; but as we can do no better at present , I for one am willing to remain with you till something offers more suitable ; but I must have a dollar a day , which will be but a trifle-out of the sum which we are earning for you . ' I am willing to remain on the same terms , ' answered Hewitt . I hesitated . I had not five dollars in the world , but I felt that I had rather take my chance with fortune than remain with him any longer ; for I not only detested the business , but had such a contempt for him that I could not bear to be in his presence . Even at this moment , though years have passed since then , my blood tingles as I recall him to mind . At length seeing that Radsworth and Hewitt were looking with solicitude for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will assist you in the shop at a dollar a day till I can do better , but I shall quit you the very first opportunity ! ' This is an imposition , father ! A dollar a day ! Three dollars a day ! ' cried Ned bristling up . Silence , sir , ' I said . You had best say but little and weigh well that little . We are doing this to favor your father not ourselves . If we chose , we could this moment enlist in the Imperial cavalry and have a horse , armor , clothing and good pay . ' It is hard  --  three dollars a day ! ' ejaculated the old man , but it ca n't be helped . I wish , ' he added in a pettish under tone , that every mother 's son of them was back in the States ! ' I laughed and rejoined , That we would all gladly go back , if he would pay our passage , in the first ship that offered . ' He made no reply , but began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swearing he would write home to the owners . We left him in this mood , and went down into the shop . Fairfax got a negro to take his trunk on his shoulder , and leaving us went to the English Coffee House , while I remained in the shop ; Hewitt and Radsworth going to the other one on the Calle San Pedro . As I was left alone , I was honored most of the day with the old gentleman 's company , who was as active in drawing the soda for the customers as a boy . He looked , however , very sour , and more than once reminded me that I must stir and be busy , for he would have his full dollar 's worth out of me . I only laughed at him ; for I felt perfectly independent of him , resolved that when I got tired of him , I would quit and trust to fortune . In this manner , we remained with him several days , the old man growing each day more civil and fawning ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew if we left him he could get no one to fill our stations , and that he would either have to hire Portuguese negroes , who would rob and perhaps murder him , or close his shops altogether . His avarice , therefore , made him obsequious ; and so , bating our constant sense of degradation in following so low an employment , our time passed more pleasantly than it had done . Every day we saw Fairfax , who , though dilligent in making every observation within his power , could yet discover no way of getting out of the city to join the Patriots . In the meanwhile , we made our Connectiout friend , Saul , a full confidant of all that had occurred , but did not let him know until a fortnight after our crisis ' with the old man what our ultimate intentions were . When at length , as one Sunday afternoon we were at his house , we told him that our ambition was to get outside and join the Patriots , he made every effort in his power to dissuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to get off , you 'll be shot as dead as four redherrin ' ! ' he said emphatically . But we do n't mean to be taken . ' I answered . You ca n't help it . The Portuguese ' ll discover you from the walls may be fire on ye ; or if you get safe into the country you 'll be shot down by the mounted robbers that 's scourin ' about as thick as hops ; or else the packs o ' tarnal hungry dogs ' ll fall on ye and tear ye to mince meal ! ' It 's much as yer lives is worth to try to get to the Patriots . Ten to one if yer get near ' em they 'll shoot you down takin ' you for enemies , afore you can say camarada ! ' Take my advice and stay here till somethin ' turns up ! ' What can we do ? ' we asked . Wall , that 's a thumper , true enough . I would n't ' vise you to stay with the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right off ; but a dollar a day 's somethin . ' I suppose you 'd think my trade was n't more genteel than his , or I 'd take you to help me ! ' Your trade is respectable , Saul , ' I answered . I do not despise it . I would rather a thousand times be an honest mechanic , than a pedlar of glasses of soda-grog . But it would take a good while before we could make ourselves useful to you . You are very kind . The only way left for us is to join the Patriots . We have no money to get home . Business here is dead , and we could get no employs as clerks . We may never be able to reach Buenos Ayres to do any thing there . The only course for us is , to try and join the Patriots , and there win fame , and may be , money . ' Wall , Yankee boys is al'ays devil-bent , ' answered Saul . But jest let me advise you to keep your own council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to get out of the town and join the enemy , he 'd report you to the Governor General , and I guess you 'd be shot for spies and traitors ! These Portuguese are mighty ready with their muskets . Keep all still , and if any thing turns up let me know ; and do n't forget that so long as Saul Freelove has a house over his head you are to hum in it ! ' We thanked the honest fellow for his interest in our behalf , and promised that we would act with caution . CHAPTER V. The Host . ' The season of Carnival now approached . It lasts twelve days , and is as all know who are conversant with Roman Catholic Holidays , a period of merry making where every extravagance is indulged and Comus reigns in joyous misrule . I should fill chapters to attempt a description of the scenes which were enacted in Montevideo during this season of folly and festivity . The presence of an army without the walls each day becoming more formidable from the increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a bar upon the mirth peculiar to the time . For some days prior the greatest preparations were going on to celebrate the occasion . The churches were trimmed with garlands of flowers , and every house was decorated with wreaths and bouquests . Smiles were upon every face , and the greatest good humor prevailed among all classes . Even the African slaves seemed to enter with spirit into the scenes , although the majority of them being heathens had little knowledge of Christian festivals ; but as they had full license to enjoy the days in their own way , this religious merry-making was quite as acceptable to them as to the most devout Catholics . The morning of the first day was ushered in by the firing of cannon and the clang of bands of music . The whole garrison paraded during the day in the public squares , and at night the palace was thrown open for a grand masked ball , to which all foreigners of any consideration were invited . We had not the honor of an invitation , as we were soda shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . As we refused to keep the shop open on that day , notwithstanding the urgent desire of our employer , we made it a holiday , and , dressed in our best , went into the streets . The scenes that everywhere met our eyes were novel and full of life and interest . The thoroughfares were crowded with persons of both sexes and all hues and costumes . At the head of the street we met a procession which , in the United States , would be termed a Callithumpian one . The leader was a motley-dressed fellow wearing a hideous mask , with a nose a yard long , across which was a pair of spectacles a foot in diameter . He wore a cap and bells , and his dress was painted all over with red and blue devils , with forked tails and pitchforks . He was mounted on a donkey fantastically accoutred and having at the end of his nose an elephant 's trunk . Ever and anon the fellow astride upon him would sound a ram 's horn with the most dissinant twang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two , as extravagantly accoutered as himself , each masked most furiously , and every one striving to make himself , as ludicrous as his mother wits would let him . There must have been full three hundred individuals , satyrs , devils , hobgoblins , angels , wizards , necromancers , saints and sinners in all ; and as they went along the streets they would crack jokes upon the spectators , and were in return pelted with harmless missiles . The balconies were lined with females , some of them old and ugly , but many of them extremely beautiful . The Montevidean ladies under twenty are , indeed , lovely . Their large black eyes , full of passion and love , their rich brunette complexions , their raven hair tastefully dressed with jewels and flowers , and set off by the folds of black lace veils worn with coquettish grace ; their rich scarlet lips and beautiful voluptuous figures , comprise points of feminine beauty in which they excel almost all females of other lands . Their voices , too , are so melodious and flute-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , too , so beautifully , and with such naivete , ' that the heart is taken by storm and surrenders at discretion . Such , at least , were the impressions then of Paul Perril , eighteen years old and a devout worshipper at the shrine of beauty . Enthusiastic as I was , my situation as shop-boy had withheld me hitherto from seeking the acquaintance of any of them , though there were two or three little black beauties I had seen who lived in the neighborhood , whom I resolved , when I should get quit of the shop , to endeavor to form a nearer acquaintance with than distant arrow glances could give ! As we entered the square we beheld a martial spectacle that fixed our attention . Eight thousand of the Imperial troops , cavalry and infantry , were passing in review before the Governor General and his staff , which were posted in a group in front of the palace . The splendor of the cavalry uniforms and that of a great portion of the foot soldiers , gave a gorgeous aspect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in motion at once , while at least five hundred instruments of music were filling the sky . Near us drew up a mounted general and several officers , who stood awhile looking on as the battallions passed them . The uniform of this body of officers literally blazed with gold . Of all magnificent military dresses I have since beheld , I have seen none to equal those of the Brazilian officers . Most of the wearers of them , however , were small , under-sized men , and some of them beardless boys . On horseback the Brazilian officer looks well , for his low stature does not contrast with the splendor of his apparel ; but on foot they look diminutive and often insignificant . They want , too , manly strength of profile , and are far from possessing the martial countenances that characterizes military men of other countries . It is true , there were among them some fine-looking , soldierly officers ; but these were their exceptions . Their courage is , also , questionable , or rather , their pusillanimity unquestionable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been schooled in the battle-fields of Napoleon , and who now sought fame and occupation in the service of Don Pedro . There were also in the army some Austrian officers , who had followed the fortunes of the Brazilian Empress , who was an Austian by birth ; and who sometimes led her own armies to battle , herself mounted astride and habited like an Amazon . Not long previous to our arrival at Montevideo , she had sallied from Rio Janeiro , the capitol , leaving Don Pedro at home in his palace , and marched to the interior , at the head of an army , to quell an insurrection , which she successfully put down . This does not say much for the warlike qualities of the Emperor , who , I believe is no Napoleon , though he chose an Empress of that heroic blood . After we left the square we turned to the right and suddenly encountered the Host , ' borne by a priest who tramped on at a rapid pace beneath a crimson canopy supported by four boys in white surplices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver vase or box , held upon a velvet cushion fringed with gold and decorated with flowers . It was preceded by a little boy ringing a bell and by four soldiers with muskets , and followed by several priests and boys in surplices bearing colored candles . As the procession advanced , every man , woman and child dropped upon their knees and crossed themselves .  --  Some went down in the mud , some upon the pavement , others upon the balconies , or roofs , or the doors , just where they happened to be . Every good Catholic in sight was bound to drop upon his knees .  --  Some of the cavaliers , in white trowsers , I saw , took the precaution o spread a handkerchief upon the ground to protect them . As we came near we found ourselves standing alone surrounded by a kneeling , crossing multitude . We stood still and stiff . The little bell tinkled louder and sharper , and the soldiers eyeing us , one of them cried out sternly in Portuguese , kneel heretics ! ' I slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would not bend knee to a piece of bread deified by idolatry . My two companions stood also firm until a soldier 's bayonet was advanced horizontally in the direction of their abdominal region , when they retreated into a fruit shop , the door of which stood , fortunately , open . I was about to follow when a soldier took me by the shoulder and pressed me down , as if he would make me kneel whether I would or no . This proceeding roused my indignation , and , hitting the fellow a blow between the eyes , I caused him to release his hold , when I turned to escape . The kneelers so crowded the way that I could not advance .  --  Above me was a verandah , upon which stood several ladies . Impulsively I seized one of the branching irons that supported it , drew myself lightly up and bounded upon the balcony among them , leaving my discomfited soldiers gazing up from the street and cursing me with oaths which I did neither understand nor care to . The fellows finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in again in the front , the little bell tinkled with an expression of angry vehemence , and canopy , hosts , priests and little boys in white shirts moved on again . The people rose by the dozens as it went past them , and in a few moments all was noise and talking and mad gaiety . Maskers once more paraded the streets and music resounded on all sides , mingled with peals of laughter . I looked about me . The house which I had scaled so unceremoniously was of large size and had an imposing air of aristocracy . The balcony was elaborately ornamented with grotesque figures cut into the iron balustrade , and vases of plants both shaded it and shed around a sweet fragrance . There were four tall windows , curtained with crimson and orange drapery that led from it into sumptuously furnished drawing rooms . Open windows on the other side of them showed me another verandah overlooking a court-yard in which played a fountain . These points were observed at a glance . I next observed the occupants of the balcony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest : the others females . Three of them possessed nothing very striking in their appearance , one being old , the others plain , and full thirty , save the elegance of their dress . But the fourth instantly enchained my eyes , and made my heart bound as if it would break its imprisonment . She was about sixteen , two years younger than I , that bewitching age of freshness of beauty and love . She was a brunette , with the most brilliant sloe-black eyes , that pierced like diamond-tipped arrows . She was as graceful as a fawn , with a figure superb , like those of all Spanish girls . Her hand was so small , that seen through the fold of a curtain , it would have been taken for a child 's of eight years . Her hair was dark as night and freely waving in glittering tresses about her shoulders . Her lips were like a crushed rose leaf , ' and around them played a smile , full of the most captivating snares . I stood bewildered . I feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without other consciousness than her presence . She smiled , and I became conscious of my rudeness . I remembered where I was and how I happened there . I was about to make an apology for my rudeness in my best book-Spanish , when the priest laid his hand firmly upon my arm , and looking as if he would annihilate me , cried in Portuguese ,  --  Are you a heretic ? ' I am an American ! ' I answered in Spanish . An Americano ! ' repeated the young Spanish girl who had set my heart playing cupid 's tatoo ; and her beautiful eyes beamed , and an expression of curiosity and pleasure animated her fine oriental face . You have deserved to be imprisoned , ' said the priest , in Spanish . I shall send for a guard and have you sent to prison , for disturbing the peace ! ' It was the soldiers , not I , ' I answered . I stood quiet and raised my hat ! ' Why did you not kneel ? ' he demanded sternly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God ! ' I answered . That was your God ! It was Christ in the Host , and is not Christ God ! ' I was not then much skilled in controversial theology , and scarcely knew the difference between consubstantiation and transubstantiation ; nevertheless I answered him that I could never believe that God ever dwelt in a wafer to be eaten . This reply caused the fierce priest to look still more terrible , and he was about to call for some one to go for the guard , when the young Spanish girl stepped forward and laid her little white hand on his arm . Padre mio , ' she said in Castilian , and in the most musical voice imaginable , which made one think of nightingales and bulbuls , the young gentleman is to be pitied , not harshly condemned . Let him depart in peace , and perhaps your leniency will convert him . Severity will not do it , be assured ! ' Then be it as you say , Senorita Isabel ! ' answered the priest , steping back . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' I thanked my beautiful intercessor as well as I could for the embarrassment her eyes gave me , which I feared to look into , and then was looking about to see how I should reach the street , when she said , with a smile , that I had best wait a few minutes until those people who had witnessed the late scene should have passed on ; when she graciously conducted me through the drawing room to a flight of spacious stone stairs leading down to the court-yard . CHAPTER VI . The Banjo-Dances . As I parted from the frank , beautiful Spanish girl , she smiled and said pleasantly and with an arch manner , Senor Americano , if you do n't care to bow to the Host , you should keep within doors when it passes . You have been very rash . You had better bend the knee than lose a life ! ' Had you , fair Senorita , been the bearer of the sacred wafer I would willingly have bent the knee , but to you , not to the wafer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me slightly frowning , yet looking pleased at the bold compliment . Adios , senor , ' she said hastily , turning from me and re-entering the drawing-room . Vaga usted con Dios ! ' I responded , and left the patio fully persuaded I had left my heart behind . But young men between eighteen and twenty-one , have a good many hearts . At least , they are often deluded , as it were , by echoes , and it takes them a good while to find out where really the true heart is . Upon gaining the street I was unable to find my friends , and so walked on alone , though not without casting many a look back to the balcony . She was upon it , and I thought looking after me ; but I was not certain of it , and the idea clearly shows how far I had gone in that foolish vanity , which is peculiar to the beardless lover . I lingered a moment at the corner to see if she did not waive her fan , or give me some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at myself , and pursued my way resolved to think no more of her ; for what had I , a soda-shop boy , to do with falling in love with a Spanish beauty belonging to one of the first families in the city . At the corner was a pulperia , or grocery , and I bethought me after passing it a few steps , to return and inquire of the proprietor who dwelt in the large casa which I had left . The man was seated in his door , rolling a broad leaf of tobacco into the shape of a cigar . He was smoking a palpillito , and singing a Portuguese battle song . Upon his head was a red woollen cap . His dark features stood out beneath it in bold relief . Who lives in that house with the verandah , senor ? ' I asked in Spanish , for I had found by experience that the Portuguese well understood this language while I could make out pretty well their Portuguese . That , senor , is the house of Don de Noris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigar half made , and looking towards the house . Is it a Spanish family ? ' I asked . Si , senor . Don Diego is one of the old Spanish citizens . He is a rich muchissimo rico . He would have been glad to go up to Buenos Ayres , but the Governor General keeps him here ; for he knows that he would give his money to help the patriots ? ' Then he is held as a sort of prisoner ? ' I asked . Yes , but he has liberty to go where he will so that he goes not beyond the walls ; which he would find it hard to do , ' added the Portuguese with a smile . I see ladies upon the balcony . Are they his daughters ? ' I modestly inquired . Don Diego is not married , ' answered the man . He has two sisters and a neice that form his household . ' The neice is what age ? ' About seventeen , and a great beauty she is , too , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look at them . I dare say she has a lover among the patriots ! ' This idea caused my heart to feel a sudden pang , and a sensation of an unpleasant kind passed over me . I felt no more desire to ask further questions , and thanking my talkative informant , I left him to finish rolling up his tobacco leaf , and wondering if she really had a lover in the patriot camp . I at length came to the conclusion that she had , and I resolved that if we ever met , I should hold him as an enemy .  --  But at this crisis , the reflection of my situation in Montevideo as a bartender , made me smile and feel angry at the same moment , and dissipated at once all my ambitious love dreams . A horrible discord of musical sounds , now suddenly burst upon my ear , accompanied by a sort of Indian pow-wow-ing . Looking down a narrow street , up which the uproar came , I saw an open space between the foot of the lane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling it , were throngs of Africans , who seemed to be in the height of enjoyment . As I had seen nearly every other feature of the carnival , I thought I would be a looker-on here . So traversing the short street that terminated in the square I entered it . It was a space of about an acre and a half of hard , well-tramped earth . At least two thousand negroes were gathered there . They were dressed in the most fantastic style and in every color of the rainbow . After a general survey to see what was going on , I at length saw that they were divided into some score or more of groups , each surrounding a party of dancers . I passed from one to the other . One of the circles contained about a dozen negroes of both sexes dancing with the most extraordinary outlay of muscular exertion and physical activity to the music of banjos ( skins drawn tightly over a hollow log and thumped with a mallet , ) congo castinets , and other instruments , as rude in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its banjo and castanets , and these being assisted by a continual pow-wow of voices , the uproar of noises diabolical may easily be conceived . I never before heard such infernal sounds . The dancers , some of them , were nearly naked , exhibiting barbarously tattooed bodies . One fellow bad the sun , moon , and any quantity of stars tattooed upon his breast and back . Some of the women 's faces looked as if a hot gridiron had been placed upon them . They were all , too , such hideous Guinea-nigger looking heathens ! I noticed that the dances , features and costumes of nearly every group were dissimilar , and upon inquiry was told by a complacent Spaniard who was looking on and smoking , that the negroes were from as many tribes in Africa , as I saw groups assembled there . He informed me that the poor slaves retained here in their land of bondage , in a great degree , their distinction of tribes , and that on holidays they met together to perform their dances , which perhaps , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I looked on with greater interest , and once more made the round of the place , comparing the looks of one tribe , with those of another . With this view , I was enabled without difficulty , to observe a wide difference between the tribes . The Congo negroes were short , flat footed with long heels and ape-like arms , and as bandy-legged as baboons . They were hideously ugly , with noses flattened to the face and enormous lips . The Mangoes were tall , well-formed , black as a polished boot , had prominent features , and looked like men of fierce dispositions , while the females were rather good looking , with fine eyes and teeth . The Mandangoes were generally lazy , with sleepy eyes , square heads , and a brick brown color of the skin . They also had beards , which the other two tribes had not . I noticed in particular the negroes from the Gold coast .  --  They looked not unlike the Creek Indians , only blacker ; but their hair was long and but slightly crisped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men having beak-like noses and high , bald foreheads .  --  One of them had quite a martial air . He stood looking on with an aspect of stern indifference . I set him down for a chief , both on account of his appearance and a sort of deference which the rest paid him . He was full six feet in height , finely formed , and leaned upon a long staff . Upon his head was bound a scarlet handkerchief , and he wore an open shirt of blue and red calico , over white trowsers rolled up to the knees . He was a black Apollo in symmetry and noble physical developments . Some of the old women which were seated on the ground beating hollow sticks together , looked like old she devils , wrinkled , grey , haggard , and their naked paps hanging down like ponches a foot long .  --  They kept up a see-sawing with their bodies , and uttering all the time a monotonous ye-yah-yeaw that was doleful enough for music to dance by . The dances were generally mere tramps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One party seemed to me to do nothing but pad round in a ring at a sort of lock step , yelling a shrill note at every foot fall , while the sweat ran down their naked bodies like rain . And such an odor . It would have taken a river of Cologne to have purified the atmosphere . I breathed by a sort of internal process so as not to inhale the surcharged atmosphere . It is a curious fact that some of the negro tribes do not exhale that peculiar pungent odor which seems to be the native atmosphere of the individual African .  --  I saw subsequently some negroes of tribes near Timbucto that emitted none of this from their skins . These are selected as domestic slaves , for the olfactories of the inhabitants of the country are quite as sensitive as ours . Some of the negroes , however , of one tribe in particular , the name of which I fortunately forget , for if I had kept it in my memory it would have carried an odor with it , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it . But if I say more upon this dark subject , I fear that the reader will have to fumigate my paper before he can proceed farther . Leaving then this scene of African revels , where no sweet south breathes upon a bank of violets , ' I pursued my way along the inside of the walls , which rose massive and strong on my right . From the top , the sentries were looking down into the square and watching the dances . I passed the gate out of which I had sallied with the cavalry , and then entering the street of San Pedro proceeded towards the centre of the town . I came soon upon a lively portion of the street , which contained some of the best houses , and met maskers with music going before them who made themselves merry at the expense of the passers-by , I saw many beautiful ladies upon the verandah , which were gay with awnings and decorated with flowers and streamers of silk . As I turned into the street where our shop ' was situated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while loud peals of laughter proceeded from them . As I came near , I beheld three or four officers belonging to the frigate Doris , then laying in the outer roads , scaling a balcony filled with ladies . I forgot to say , and I will do it here , that one of the great causes of sport on the carnival days is colored eggs . The yolks are removed , the shells dyed blue , green , yellow , red or parti-colored , and filled with rose water the ends sealed up , and boys and girls go about selling them by scores . They are bought by every body , though in many families where there are roguish girls , they are prepared at home ; and the sport is , for the ladies to pelt the gentlemen with them from the balconies as they pass along the streets . If any gentleman thus bombarded , can succeed in scaling a balcony in face of the brisk fire from half a dozen handsome ladies , who are supplied with amunition from baskets held by slaves , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop was the residence of an old Spanish merchant , Don Pedro Lamas , who had three pretty daughters who were much visited by the English and American navy officers . They were of the ages of seventeen , nineteen and twenty-one . I knew them by sight , indeed , had formed a sort of eye , smile and bow acquaintance with them when they were on their balcony or promenading the roof , and we upon ours . Once they had despatched a slave for soda , which I laughingly sent ; but as they did not send a second time , I rightly judged that not a globule of effervescence was in the glass when it reached them . Their curiosity was satisfied . But to the cause of the excitement which I now witnessed in the street . CHAPTER IX . The Siege . As I approached the animated scene near the shop , I had an opportunity of witnessing the whole adventure of the officers before mentioned . It seems that as they were lounging up the street together that they were suddenly assailed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose-water . Each of the young ladies had a basket full by her side , and the colored missiles fell upon their heads and shoulders in a shower . In an instant they all started to scale the balcony , for the lower doors were , to be sure , carefully bolted and barred . The height of the balcony was not less than fourteen feet from the street . It was supported , not by column , but by iron braces projecting from the wall obliquely upward . These braces were full eight feet from the side-walk . The officers sprung to the escalade and , like true sailors , began to mount upward , the projections of the windows affording them footing to reach the braces . Two of them , as I came up , were hanging to them and trying to clamber up over the verge of the balcony , their situation being precisely like passing by the futtock shrouds over into the ship 's tops , only in this case they had no other support than an iron rod for feet and hands . The ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into their faces and bosoms a perfect hurricane of grape . They were deluged with rose water . The young American lieutenant at length got his hand over so as to grasp one of the uprights of the balustrade , but the moment he lifted his face it was battered with these rose scented missiles . He was blinded with the fluid , and the crash of the shell upon the face or in the eyes was by no means pleasant . He made several desperate efforts to get up , but at length , fairly blinded by the rose-water , he was forced to retreat , amid the shouts of the spectators , who looked on , enjoying the scene with infinite gusto . I could not keep my eyes off the four beautiful girls , for they had a handsome cousin , Donna Irene , to assist them in defending their fortress and their lips ! Their faces were so gloriously animated , so brilliantly flushed , and so full , withal , of laughter , that at length rendered them almost incapable of throwing their missiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty enchained my gaze . I never witnessed a sight so beautiful and captivating . Their mellow laughter , too , rang most musically . The crowd , which was composed of officers , soldiers , black and white , slaves , maskers , monks and sailors , encouraged , cheered , hissed , shouted and roared with laughter . The American officer and the other Englishman made a second attempt . They reached the verge of the balony and closing their eyes clambered over . The Englishman was driven back for an instant .  --  The American pressed forward while the crowd cheered him on . The ladies retreated , still keeping up a spirited fire into the drawing-room . The American followed , and the Englishman bounded in after him .  --  In a moment or two we heard loud laughing , shrieks , and the multitude shouted viva ! bravissimo ! ' The cavaliers had won the victory ! The people now dispersed , seeking amusement in some other quarter ; for the town was all over mad with frollicing . I have now to relate an egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have just describe ; but as it is personally interesting to me , Paul Perril , I will give it as it happened . After I had seen the adventure thus happily terminated , I was seized with a desire to be the possessor of some scores of blue , red , and green eggs which I had seen a negress carrying in her basket upon her head , while the scaling of the balcony was going forward . I now approached her and asked her if they were for sale . Si , Senyah , ' she answered . How much a dozen ? ' Kart real , ' she answered , in her negro Portuguese . Four reals , which is half a dollar , was a great deal of money for me , when the reader remembers the depth of my purse . I had but two dollars and three quarters in the world ; for as yet the old gentleman had not paid us any portion of our dollar per diem . He preferred , he said , paying up in the lump ! The temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and transferred from the basket very carefully to my handkerchief . I then opened the enormous doors which led into our court-yard , with the intention of ascending to the roof and having some private sport of my own with the eggs . Some thoughts of bombarding the opposite house , where dwelt the daughters of Don Pedro , passed through my mind ; for it occurred to me that an egg of rose-water might be a means of introduction to them , in a merry way . Of course I did not intend to hit them , and expected to draw their fire upon me . I had ascended but a few steps of the flight which led to the roof of the casa ' when my eye fell , by ill-luck , upon an old vinegar-faced virago who dwelt in the next court . She always sat in her door , with a striped handkerchief upon her head , smoking paper cigars , which she made for the purpose by skillfully rolling up cut tobacco in small slips of white paper , pinching the ends so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched , and been more than once tempted to play a trick upon her . If I could have got powder into her tobacco , it would have been there . She was so cross , and beat two old negro slaves so , and scolded so fiercely and vixenishly , that I had a grudge against her . The reader will not forget that I was eighteen , and something wild and wayward , and often did things with little reflection upon the consequences . Upon reaching the first landing of the stair-way , I saw the old yellow-visaged crone seated upon her door step , smoking . Her face was turned with its profile towards me . I thought of my eggs , and slowly descending the stairs again to the court approached a hole in the wall , as large as a hat , out of which two or three bricks had fallen . She was within five feet of me as I looked through at her , with an egg , the largest in the lot , in my fingers . I only wished it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised my hand , and taking good aim hit her fairly in the cheek . The howl she set up was tremendous . I sprung aside , but not before she saw who it was that had scented her with rose-water ; for which she ought to have been most grateful .  --  Finding I was discovered , I proceeded boldly to discharge a second missile ; but she was as active as she was hideous ; and springing lightly aside she caught up half of a brick and discharged it through the hole at my head . It flew with unerring aim , and as I darted back it fell at my feet , rebounded , and dashed in pieces a huge demijohn of vitriol within half a yard of me , three of which belonging to the old gentleman were placed against the wall . The contents flew all over me like liquid fire . I remember uttering a yell of the most excrutiating agony , and the next instant I was up to my chin in the cistern , into which I had instantly leaped . I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell from me in tinder before I had touched the water and my body and arms , to say nothing of my legs , were on fire . The water gave me temporary relief . My first outcry , rent from me by inconceivable torments , had brought from the balcony both of my friends and the old man . They flew to my relief , but he on seeing his demijohn demolished , began to swear . The old witch , with her tanned and devilish visage filling the hole in the wall surveyed the scene and langhed with malicious triumph as she saw me up to my neck in the cistern . The sight of her kept me from showing my agony in my face ; for , I believe , if she had not been looking on , I should have fairly roared and howled . I can bear physical pain as well as most persons ; but every body has not been victimized by a smashed demijohn of the oil of vitriol . What with the old man 's oaths , the vixen 's laughter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me by way of variety , there was quite a scene . I was at length got to my bed , half-flayed alive . I had not a piece of skin left below my knees , and above them it was taken off in large patches . I had had enough of the carnival ! I kept my bed three days ; but with care and kind attention from my three friends , in a week I was in the shop again , with a whole skin , but somewhat a tender one , as may be supposed . By the time I got out , carnival was over . Lent had begun , and the town was fasting , and as quiet and solemn as the Sabbath in New England . The contrast was most extraordinary . Every man looked as if he had just buried his brother , or as if the plague reigned . Having recovered , I bore no grudge against the old woman ; for I fairly deserved what I got . I had been the aggressor , and while she only intended to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lesson I have never forgot . It has cured me of many prejudices , and taught me never to assail those whom I have reason to think can not avenge themselves . With this little bit of a moral I will go on with my narrative . The siege of the town was daily becoming closer , and during the last two or three days of Carnival , the Patriots contributed fire-works to aid the general festivity ; they were , however more solid than picturesque , coming over the walls in the shape of eighteen-pound shot and shell , not charged with rose-water , but old iron and bullets . This contribution to the amusement of the citizens was by no means relished and the streets were less thronged , and many of the balls bounced into them and sometimes went skipping along over the paved walks for a square doing some mischief and producing more terror . Llavelleja had taken advantage of the merry-making within the walls to advance his lines , and one night he threw into the old convent a large force , with five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surprise and dismay of the garrison , opened his battery upon the walls . From this time the joys of carnival were a little qualified by personal apprehension , for the shot came clattering upon the roofs and hopping into the streets at all hours of the day . The Brazilians returned the fire from the walls , but discreetly kept within their defences . Thus the last day or two of my confinement to my room I was regaled with the almost continual music of a two-sided cannonading . A shot very unceremoniously knocked over one of the urns on the corner of our roof , and striking the battlements of Don Pedro 's house opposite , made a breach that exposed the whole area of the house top to our view . Fortunately the Senoras had a few minutes before finished their evening promenade and gone down into the parlor . We all got quite used to the roar of cannon , and were unconcerned even at seeing a ball light in the street before our shop door and kick up a dust that rattled upon our windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons killed or wounded . The soldiers on the walls had the worst of it , judging from the number of poor , bleeding forms that were carried every half hour or oftener by our door to the hospitals , borne on the shoulders of their comrades . Custom has such influence upon the mind that these painful sights , as well as the falling of the shot into the bosom of the town , were very soon regarded by us almost with indifference . The old gentleman and his son Edwin , however , never could get accustomed to it ; and turned pale and shrunk up into as small a space as possible at every discharge of the guns . The former was as nervous as he could live , and seemed to endure the tortures of a living death . Doubtless his conscience troubled him , and he knew better than any one else what sins he had to answer for , This state of things continued for nearly a week after the carnival , the bombardment being only for a few hours intermitted at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still sold soda , for although it was Lent , and fasting was commenced , there was no papal bull against soda-water dashed with Port . At length one afternoon Fairfax came in . He said he had boarded out nearly all his money , and that it was time something should be done . In this we fully concurred , and we agreed to meet that evening at the coffee-house , by his invitation , he holding the purse , to discuss the matter . Before we closed the shop , however , it was resolved that we should ask the merchant for our dollar per diem . The amount due each of us was twenty four dollars , excluding the Sundays . So when the doors were about to be closed , and the others had come in from their shops , I , with some misgiving , asked the old man , who was counting at the drawer his gains for the day , if he would let us have the wages due to us . CHAPTER X. The Coffee House . In a minute after I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but continued to count the money , until he had ascertained the amount of the day 's receipts . He then looked up and setting his spectacles more firmly upon the bridge of his nose , peered at me sternly through the glasses . Wages ! You are in a hurry , young gentlemen , ' he answered with a sneer which became his face much better than any other expression ; I do n't expect to pay you except quarterly . Besides , I begin to think that a dollar a day is exhorbitant  --  enormously exhorbitant . Do you know that you are running great risks , very great risks in compelling me to pay for your services . The law here looks upon you as my servants , sons , for you are under age , and it will sustain me in my authority . I have inquired into the matter and know all about it . I shall not pay you any thing  --  not a stiver ! If you dare to leave me I will have you arrested and thrown into prison , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay your passage out here and then pay you a dollar a day . No , no ! I am not the old fool you think me . I have had counsel and know that you must stay with me on my own terms or try the comforts of a Portuguese prison . You may tell your story but who will believe you in the face of my own , and the fact that you have come out with me . No , no , young men , independent as you think yourselves you are completely in my power ! ' Our indignation , our supreme astonishment at this reply kept us silent . We looked at one another in thorough amazement , and then by one impulse quietly walked out of tho shop and hastening to the coffee house . Here we found Fairfax . We immediately took him aside and made known to him the old man 's answer to our application . We then swore vengeance . Having seated ourselves at a side table , and called for coffee and toast we began to discuss the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the old man has been consulting with some persons here as to the authority he can have over minors , and that he finds the infernal Portuguese laws will sustain him in any exercise of authority he chooses to display over us . He would not talk so boldly , if he was not convinced that the law was on his side . He is right in saying that his story will be believed before our own , inasmuch as our having come out with him shows a voluntary act of submission on our parts . ' So far as I can see , ' said I , we are in a fix . The old man is bad enough for any thing . As to remaining with him longer I will not .  --  He refuses to pay us what he owes us , and we ca n't compel him to , that seems clear . ' What shall be done ? ' asked Hewitt with a snuffle of the nose , and looking somewhat perplexed at the crisis affairs had taken . My opinion is , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the city and joining the Patriots . ' There I am with you , ' said Fairfax and Radsworth warmly . I am not so certain that we can get there or better ourselves , ' responded Hewitt . For my part I have about resolved to remain with the old codger , till I can get some clever Yankee Captain to give me a passage home . There will be some vessels soon going back to the States , I dare say , as soon as they find they ca n't reach Buenos Ayres . ' We felt disposed to look with contempt upon Hewitt 's forbearance , and began to talk over ( we three ) the best means of getting out of the city . Fairfax said that he was satisfied that we could not pass out by the gates , and the only way would be to try and possess ourselves of a boat at the mole in the night and pull across the water , a mile and a half to the inland shore . At this moment , a Boston sea-captain , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fine social qualities , came up to the table where we were . As he approached a Portuguese lieutenant who had been leaning against a columu near by smoking his cigar , slowly retired , though not before I had caught his eye which met mine with a singular expression . Ah , my young friends , you love to drink coffee better than soda , eh ? ' said Capt . Conway with a smile . Well I am glad to see you enjoying yourselves . ' Will you take a cup , Captain ? ' we asked . No . I have to go to the Consul 's to supper , and it would spoil my appetite . ' With these words he left us , and passed on up the saloon . He was a large , portly , bluff looking gentleman , and had the air of a lover of jokes and of good cheer . He was master of the barque Blakely which lay then in the harbor , having been turned from her destination ( Buenos Ayres ) as we had been , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become acquainted with him by seeing him in the shop . After he had left us , we finished our coffee , and together took a stroll up into the Grand Square to hear the Governor 's band play . We then returned homeward , still deeply engaged in the discussion of the best way of getting out of the city ; for we were resolved not to remain in it another day . Upon reaching our lodgings about half past eight o'clock , we met at the door our friend , Captain Conway . The moment he beheld us , he hastened towards us in the greatest excitement , saying , I am glad to see you at last . You have no time to lose . ' What is the matter ? what has happened ? ' we asked earnestly and filled with surprise . Your imprudence at the coffee-house has betrayed you into difficulty . At this moment , I suspect an order is being issued for your arrest . ' By old Bedrick ? ' I asked indignantly . No . But lose no time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry in bundles and then follow me to the quay .  --  My boat is there awaiting me . Your only safety is in reaching my vessel without delay . ' We did not fully comprehend the source from whence danger was to be apprehended , but assured that it menaced us , we did not ask for further explanation , but hurried to our rooms , moving as lightly as we could not to disturb the old man . There were but three of us , Hewitt having left us in the square , to call round and see Saul Freelove.  --  We had no time to think of him , though we resolved not to go without him , as he was exposed to the like danger with ourselves . We hurriedly took from our trunks what articles were mostly needed by us , such as shirts , socks , vests , &c.,; and tied them up in our handkerchiefs . We were not five minutes about it , and on returning to the street door we found the good Captain walking up and down impatiently waiting for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now follow me to the mole . ' As we were leaving the door , Bill Bedrick appeared , and wanted to know where we were going ? As he was a friend of ours we told him that there was an order out for our arrest , and that we were going on board the Blakely for security . Here 's with you then , ' he answered . I will just go back and get my bundle , and I will be with you before you reach the quay . But what are you to be arrested for ? ' We hardly know , ' I answered ; but Capt . Conway has given the alarm and recommended us to fly . ' Why , the young mad-caps , ' answered the Captain , have been overheard at the coffee house , declaring their intention to quit the city by the first opportunity and join the patriot army . This has been reported to the Governor-General by some spy who overheard it ' That confounded sly-looking Portuguese lieutenant , ' I exclaimed warmly . But we spoke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Governor has his spies every where . You have acted imprudently , but there is no help for it now . You have to get out of their reach as soon as you can . Come , my friends , do not delay , for in less than fifteen minutes a file of the city guards will be at the door in search of you . ' We now pushed on after the generous hearted Captain , and reached the mole five minutes before the nine o'clock gun was fired . Young Bedrick joined us in a moment or twoafter our arrival . The Captain 's boat with our men was waiting for him at the stairs . The sentry stopped him and asked his name , and that of his vessel , and then let him pass on . As it was dark we passed with him as his sailors , having previously , at his suggestion , tucked our coat-skirts up under our waists to make the garment look like a roundabout . We also assumed a swaggering , rolling gait , the better to deceive the soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said to us , Boys , if he refuses to let you pass , we will take his musket away , tumble him into the boat with us and take him on board . We , however , passed him without suspicion . The watch , too , was not kept with such dilligence in going from the mole , as coming into the city ; and the numerous sea-captains constantly passing and re-passing rendered the sentries less vigilant at that point . We got into the boat , the Captain having sent one of the men to Freelove 's to inform Hewitt of his danger , and advise him to remain quiet where he was , until he could join us on board the barque . We pushed from the mole stairs just as the nine o'clock gun fired , and pulled out to wards the Captain 's vessel . The harbor was filled , crowded with ships and brigs of every maratime nation , with about thirty Brazilian vessels of war anchored about here and there among them . To reach the barque , therefore , we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now under the stern of a Brazilian gun-brig ; then the cable of an English merchantman would bring us up , or the stern hawser of an American ship . It was , dodge in and out for a quarter of a mile , when we came along side of the barque , and ascended the sides . When we stood on her deck , we felt a sensation of freedom that we had not experienced for some time . To be again on the deck of a Yankee vessel , drew us in association back to our country ; and to tread upon plank that had grown in the pine forests of Maine , made us feel ourselves almost at home again . The Captain invited us down into the cabin , turned out both cook and steward , and ordered a hot supper . After a little while we sat down to the table with him , and for me , I enjoyed one of the heartiest meals I had ever partaken of . During the progress of the supper , no allusion was made to the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon general subjects , such as the next news from the States , the condition of the garrison , the force of the patriots , the progress of the siege . At length , after we had well eaten , the good Captain ordered wine and glasses . These being placed before us , at his invitation we filled and drank the following toast proposed by him :  --  The Star Spangled Banner ! If we suffer one of the stars that beam in its blue field to be extinguished , may we have the thirteen stripes laid upon our backs ! ' Having drank this sentiment with immense applause , and proportionate pounding upon the table , we were reminded of our peculiar position at that present time , by the following propounder from the hospitable Captain :  --  My lads what do you intend to do ? ' For at least a minute there was no reply . We looked blankly at each other . We had decided upon nothing , and it had been continually upon my thoughts ever since we left the house , what we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radsworth resolutely . We can be landed by your boat on the main . ' That will not be so easy as you think , ' answered Captain Conway . The whole shore is watched by guard row-boats . No boat can land or take the water without discovery . If you will take my advice you will do better , perhaps , than join Llavelleja  --  I mean for you to reach Buenos Ayres ! ' How ? ' we exclaimed all at once . I will tell you , ' he answered , as he filled another glass of old Maderia and passed the bottle to us with the admonition not to take too much for our health . ' CHAPTER IX . The Preparation . After we had filled our glasses I proposed the health of Captain Conway , ' which was drunk with grateful enthusiasm . Two glasses all round I think will do for young people like ourselves , ' said the Captain smiling ; now for my plan . I submit it to you , and let you judge for yourselves . ' We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we answered . Well , hear first what I have to propose . You say you wish to join the Patriots . Now the best and the only way to attain your end is to try and reach Buenos Ayres . ' But the blockade , Captain , ' said Fairfax . Very true . But if you are the young men I think you are , you will not let half a dozen Brazilian blockades be any obstacle in your way . As it is , Montevideo is no longer safe for you . You say you do not care about returning to the States without accomplishing something more than selling soda-water by the glass . I like your spirit .  --  When I was a young man I felt just so . As to your agreement with Mr. Bedrick that is of no force . He has shamefully deceived you ( we had told the Captain the history of the affair of our coming out to South America , while in the boat ) and you have nothing to reflect upon yourselves for leaving him . Besides , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time your house has been searched , and I have no doubt the town will be strictly overhauled to find you ; for it is death to make any attempt to join the Patriots ; and if you are taken you will be likely at the very least to be thrown into the calaboose , and be kept there till the war is over . The American Consul could not save you after your open expressions of attachment to the service of the enemy . I am not sure that you will be safe on board my vessel many hours , or you should remain as long as you like . I have no doubt I run great risk in bringing you on board ; for if they should find you here , my vessel would be confiscated . ' We will leave it this moment , Captain , ' I answered warmly , rather than involve you in any danger . ' This is noble in you , but I have begun to save you , and I never do things half way . There is no doubt but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will search every American vessel in port . Now hear the plan I have thought of for your safety , and also for bringing about your wishes . I have on board swinging at the quarter deck , a whale boat , which I picked up off San Salvador , adrift . It is almost new , staunch , and will do service . The mate has amused himself in calm weather , in making a mast and sail for it , as he thought it would be handy to pass to and from the vessel in , when we should lay in the outer roads from Buenos Ayres , which are two leagues from the landing . Now this boat , which is worth about eighty dollars , is at your service , and you may pay me for it in Boston when you can . You shall take her with four oars , mast and sail , and try to reach Buenos Ayres in her . It is a perilous attempt I allow , and requires bold hearts and steady nerves to go through with it successfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have no doubt you will achieve the adventure handsomely , and do honor to Yankee land . ' We assurred him that we would try to do so , and thanking him for his offer told him with one voice that we would make the attempt to reach the blockaded city . There can be no more danger before us than now surrounds us , ' said Fairfax ; but ready as I am to undertake it , I do n't see how we are to get out of the harbor , much more reach Buenos Ayres . ' It will be a delicate affair to manage , young gentlemen , and will require all the coolness and energy you possess to carry it through .  --  But I feel confident that you will succeed , young men , if success is possible . About twelve o'clock to-night would be a good time to start , for you will be less likely to fall in with the guard-boats , for at that time they generally pull in to relieve duty . By muffling your oars , two of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look out at the bows , you may be able to pull safely out among the fleet in the harbor . Once outside the guard-ship , and half your danger is over . You will then step your mast and make sail on her and run for the British frigate Doris , which is , you know , anchored about five miles out in the river . By the time you get up with her , you will be far enough out to put your helm up river and steer right for the blockading squadron , which you know stretches across the river about five leagues above this city . The blockading squadron you will find anchored within gun-shot of each other , from shore to shore , making a chain of vessels a mile and a half apart , and sixty miles long . Through this squadron you will have to pass ; and as you will come in sight of the lights of the vessel before day , ( for the wind is fresh and fair for you outside ) I should advise you to strike your sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bearings of the two nighest vessels and pull mid-way between them . In the darkness , and your boat lying so low in the water , you will not be discovered like a larger vessel . If you get through in safety , as I hope you will , you had best pull on again a mile or two before you set your sail . Then you will have the river all before you for an hundred and twenty miles ; but as there will probably be cruisers stealing about for many leagues above the squadron , you must keep on the constant look out , and pull into the land when you see any thing suspicious looking . For the rest , you will be guided by circumstances and your own judgment . In four or five days you ought to be at Buenos Ayres , if all succeeds with you . Now you have my plan and can embrace it or not at your pleasure . The whale boat is at your service , and I shall order Jack the cook to boil some beef and pork for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buscuit and some wine , and I will lend you a chart of the river , a compass and a spy-glass , so that you may be able to detect the enemy 's colors at a distance and keep out of their way . ' The kind Captain having ended , we thanked him with grateful enthusiasm and pledged ourselves to be guided by his directions and reach Buenos Ayres or die in the attempt . I know that you will , my lads . And that you shall not want for arms to defend yourselves with in case of need , I will let you have a pair of boarding pistols a piece , and a cutlass ! ' As he spoke he took from a rack half a dozen old Turkish sabres , but in good condition . These I bought in Smyrna at auction , with half a dozen more like them . They belonged to a Turkishpirate who was captured and brought in there while I was there . Doubtless they have done some service in their day . The pistols , also , are Turkish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire-arms . Help yourselves to them , and if you get to Buenos Ayres safely , you may pay me for them when you can . Remember , ' he added , smiling , that I only loan them to you ; so that you are not at liberty to surrender them to any Portuguese rogues that may give you chase ! ' We shall bear it in mind , Captain , ' answered Fairfax in the same spirit ; and if you never see them again be assurred it will be because we are not living to restore them . ' Do n't be rash , boys ; but if you let the Brazilians capture you I shall be very much disappointed in you . ' From what I have seen of Brazilian prisons I would rather die than go into one , ' I answered . But , Captain Conway , ' I added suddenly , how did you learn our danger and hear that we were to be arrested ? ' After I left you at the coffee house , I passed out and went on my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazilian officers , one of whom had come out of the coffee house before me . They were conversing , and hearing the word Americanos , ' I quickened my pace and listened , as one was talking to the other in a loud , animated tone . They did not heed me behind them , and so I overheard that one of them had heard four young Americans ' in the coffee house propose to join the patriots , and planning a way of escape through the gates . He further said that they had spoken against the Governor-General , the Emperor , and the Brazilians in a mass ! ' This was true , ' said Fairfax . Did the officer whom you heard speaking , wear a scarlet , round cap , with a gold chain , and a green jacket ? ' I asked . And was he tall and very slim ? ' Yes . ' I saw the fellow and caught his eye . He seemed to be smoking and paying no attention to us ! ' I said indignantly . He was a spy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said the Captain . Coffee houses are not safe places to speak one 's mind in , especially in Montevideo with an enemy at the gates .  --  Well , this man , whom I knew could be only speaking of you , said to the other , that you had spoken enough to show that you were both enemies and traitors to the Emperor , and that he was hastening to have you arrested . Upon hearing this , I immediately turned back in great alarm to put you on your guard , and found that you had quitted the place . I hastened to your lodgings and learned from a black woman , who stood in the door , that you were not in . I then went from place to place for you , where I supposed you might be , and finally after going a second time to your house , fell in with you . ' We thanked the noble Captain for his kind efforts in our behalf , and assurred him that we should never forget him ; and here I pay this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not whether he be living now or not ; but if he is , and his eyes chance to fall upon these pages he will see that he is remembered , though many years have elapsed since we met him . A little before midnight all the preparations were made . The whale boat which was but eighteen feet long , sharp at both ends , with four thwarts , or seats , was lowered into the water , and drawn along under the starboard gangway . In it the mate had placed a bag of boiled corn beef , and a bag of biscuit , not forgetting a box of wine , the compass , spy-glass , and chart of the river . The latter was valuable to us , to enable us to find out where we were as we run up along the shore . We now came on deck with our pistols , ammunition and sabres , and passed them into the stern of the boat . The mast and sail were snugly furled together , and laid traversly along the thwarts in the centre .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part that played in the row-locks , and placed upon the seats . A dark lantern was also supplied and put in the locker with the compass . All these preparations without the least possible noise , for a vessel of war was close by us . Every thing being reported by the mate as ready , the Captain once more called us into the cabin , and repeated some of his previously-given instructions , particularly enjoining the strictest silence as we passed out of the harbor , Give every order in a whisper . Choose your helmsman and your look-out , while two take the oars , and keep each to his station till you get fairly clear of the port . If you are challenged by any of the Brazilian vessels of war that you pass near , answer one of the Doris , ' in a clear , free manner , and you will be suffered to pass , as you will be taken for the Doris ' ( the British frigate that lays outside ) boat which often goes off with her captain as late as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trust , however , that you will manage to creep along so stealthily that you will not be observed . If you are you must trust to your presence of mind to take care of yourselves . Perilous as the path is before you , it is quite as dangerous for you to remain behind . So my brave young countrymen , good night , and God bless you It is time you were off ! ' He shook us warmly by the hand all round , and tears glistened in his manly eyes . We , ourselves , did not part with him without some emotion . At the side he again took leave of us , and as we descended his last words were , If you love me , do n't let me be told to-morrow that the Brazilians have you in their hands . Remember that you are Yankees , and that each one of you is equal to twenty of these Portuguese . Good bye , boys , and move along as quiet as a fish two feet under water ! ' CHAPTER X. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farewell to the excellent Captain as he leaned over the side , we quietly took our respective stations in the boat preparatory to starting on our perilous enterprise . It was a clear , starry night , with just wind enough to cause the little waves it raised to break into heads . The only sound that could be heard were the howling of dogs from the streets in the city , and the calls of the sentries to each other . Fairfax took the helm ; Radsworth and Bedrick the two oars , and I stationed myself in the sharp bows to look out ahead . Are we all ready ? ' whispered Fairfax . All ready , ' was our subdued answer . Pull away , then , ' he added ; and pushing from the side , we noiselessly let fall the oars and began to move on . The barque was on oll sides enclosed by vessels at anchor . We had not taken thirty strokes when we passed under the stern of an English ship . The officer of the watch was whistling as he paced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly that we feared our rowing would have been detected ; for it would have been dangerous to have been hailed by any ship , as it would have drawn towards us the attention of the Brazilian vessels of war which were all about . We let the oars fall as softly as if they were made of feathers and passed under the stern , and so near that we had to bend low to prevent the rays of light shining through the cabin windows from falling upon our persons . The next vessel was a Yankee brig , which we passed across the bows and so nigh that I gave the boat an additional impetus by taking hold of the cable which we went under . The next vessel was a large Brazilian brig of war of sixteen guns , anchored with her best bower out forward and a kedge astern . I had to keep a sharp look out not to run our boat against the cable or hawser , which , in the obscurity of the night , it was difficult to do . As we came close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently , and at the same time gave directions to Fairfax how to steer her . Seeing the outline of a sentry in the gangway , I thought that our safest course was to keep close under the counter of the vessel ; as he might detect as if we were off a few yards distant attempting to pull by . So I whispered to Fairfax how to steer and we run directly under her taffrail , and so near that I touched her as we passed , and pushed the skiff along . We had not passed three strokes of the oars before we were started by a sudden and loud cry upon decks . My heart jumped into my mouth . I felt certain that we were discovered , and so did the others . But the cry formed itself into intelligible words , and we were relieved by hearing the all 's well ' of the Portuguese sentry instead of an order for us to come to . We now pulled on steadily , gaining confidence with every vessel we got safely by , until we had passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once nearly upset our boat by striking against the cable of a French barque . The noise alarmed a watch-dog on board who set up a loud baying , and to escape detection we pulled directly under the bows and lay there as still as death . The officer of the deck took the alarm and not only looked over the quarter himself to examine the water , but we heard him give orders to his men ( for I understood a little French ) to look about forward . We could see the men 's heads peering over , but as we were so snugly hidden under the bulging bow we remained undiscovered ; though every little while a dog would set up a howl . After remaining perdu about ten minutes finding all still we shoved out and pulled stealthily away and met with no other misadventure until we had , as I have said , passed safely about twenty vessels , when we came to a Brazilian corvette of twenty guns . This ship lay at anchor broadside towards us , and as she had a boat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keeper . We , therefore , pulled out as far from her as possible , though at the risk of falling aboard a gun-boat which was anchored fifty yards astern of her . We laid as low to the water as we could , taking off our hats , and making ourselves show as little as we possibly could . We then pulled steadily on , and had nearly passed between the two , when we were electrified by a sharp hail from the quarter-jeck of the corvette . Kien loh ! ' was the sound though not the words , that reached our ears ; but I give the sound rather than the orthography . Who goes there ? ' Doris ! ' promptly responded Fairfax with a presence of mind that could not be too highly praised . Pass on ! ' answered the sentry . Now give way without fear , ' added Fairfax . We shall be suspected if they do not hear your oars . Shorten them to the place where they are not muffled , so as to make them play noisily in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until we had passed one or two merchant vessels near the ship , when once more we began to steal along with muffled oars ; for a large Brazilian frigate lay just before us ; and notwithstanding we had deceived successfully the sentry of the corvette , were not rash enough to try to pass the frigate . Fortune might not favor us again . We , therefore , pulled along until we came near her , when I stood up and made a careful survey of her position . To avoid her booms ' was the most perplexing part of the affair . At them I saw two boats , and thought I could discover the tender ' in the one nighest to us . I asked Radsworth to hand me the glass from the locker , and opening it , I was satisfied he was in the boat . All around the frigate were anchored Brazilian vessels of war to the number of half a score , and some so near each other , that two oared boats could not pass one another between without trailing their oars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or across her bow would expose us most certainly to the observation of the boat tender . There was , however , no time for hesitation . The dark hall of the frigate towered above us , casting its black shadow nearly towards us , and embracing us within it . Trusting to the gloom , I said to the rest , Pull on , boys ! Steer so as to run under her stern , Fairfax . There is no alternative . If the boat keeper discovers us we must tumble him into the water and pull for it . Give way , but row as if your oars were dipped in down . ' We pulled steadily on and steered past the boom unobserved , ( the fellow being asleep no doubt ) and direct for the frigate 's counter . We shot in under her guns which overhung us , and then stopped our way under her stern-room windows . Some one was thruming a guitar upon her deck , and we could hear voices in the cabin . The tramp of the sentry upon the deck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ears . The least imprudence upon our part would have betrayed us and placed us prisoners on board ; and what account could we give of ourselves ? Tell what story we chose , though not one of us would have concealed the truth had we been taken , I am confident they soon would have found out from the shore that we were flying from arrest and were friends to the patriots . There is little doubt but that we would have been shot or else thrown into the calaboose to lay till the war was over ; for by professing to have an intention of joining the patriots , we had ( though we did not reflect upon it at the time ) so far denationalized ourselves as to place us quite beyond the protection of the American Consul , or the Government at home . But wisdom and due discretion are not to be expected of youths of eighteen . After remaining a few moments under the friendly shelter of the frigate 's stern we were satisfied that all was safe yet , and once more pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving our places to the others , Bedrick at the helm . We now moved on past vessel after vessel with the same caution we had hitherto used . Once we were startled by the barking of a dog on board an armed schooner , and laying on our oars waited till he was silent ; though he was probably barking from some other cause than consciousness of our vicinity . But we were startled by it not a little . Still we perseveringly kept on our way , and at length had the satisfaction of coming in full view of the guard ship , which was the last ship in the harbor . This had once been a Spanish line-of-battle ship , but was now dismantled and moored exactly in the mouth of the pear-shaped harbor . The entrance at the best was very narrow ; but this huge hulk lying in the way left but a narrow passage between each extremity and the shores for vessels to come in and go out . The shore either from her bows or stern was within musket shot . On the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile , the guns of its castle commanding the entrance ; and on the left shore close to the water and nearly upon a level with it was a formidable battery . The guard-ship lying between and showing them three tiers of guns , pointed inside and outside the harbor , completed the defences . Every vessel that entered or went out was challenged from the guard ship , along side of which numerous armed boats were always held in readiness to board every suspicious craft . When we came within about two hundred yards of this formidable monster of oak and iron , we , with singular discretion for us , lay on our oars and deliberately surveyed her island-like hulk This looks like a case , boys , ' said Fairfax dryly . It looks confoundedly ugly , ' responded Radsworth . We shall be likely to fetch up here all told , ' observed Bedrick with the sort of devil-me-care air characteristic of him . There is nothing like trying to go by her , ' said I , after taking in her formidable outline with the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might all soon have a view of the filling up ! We have accomplished more than this , ' But these fellows in the boats at the booms , ' said Bedrick looking with the glass ; I think if we get by it ' ll be with the shaving of our eye-brows ! ' After some debate it was finally resolved to stand in shore on the Mount side , and hug the beach , and creep by in this manner . When we had pulled in close to the land , what was our surprise and confusion on discovering a sentry pacing up and down on the sward . We backed water quickly , and then continued to go backwards until his form was lost in the gloom . We were now hear the guard-ship again .  --  There was now no alternative but to take the middle course , and if we were seen to trust to our oars , and escape into the offing . For this purpose we shipped the two other oars , and all four pulled together .  --  We passed along like harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came abreast of the stern of the hull , our bosoms swelled with the strong emotions of hope and fear , which at such moments of suspense irresistably take possession of the human heart . We moved on and on , and for five minutes I verily believe not one of us breathed a full breath . We had passed her in safety ! We could see her each moment fading into the darkness . When we knew that we could no longer be visible from her , we ceased rowing as by one impulse . I sprung up and waved my hat and cane , and came very near giving three cheers for our success . But I did not indulge this exuberant feeling , though we all felt quite mad with joy , and shaking hands all round congratulated one another upon our achievement . A the suggestion of Bedrick , the locker was opened , and a bottle of champagne opened by knocking off the neck against the side of the boat . We filled bumpers in a tin pot and drank success to the Universal Yankee Nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one dipper . It was now proposed that the sail should be hoisted , as there was a five knot breeze blowing fair for us . This proposition was well received , for we were pretty well tired of rowing , having been nearly two hours reaching that point of comparative safety . I say comparatively , for we were not yet , by any means , safe . There were Brazilian cruisers constantly beating about the mouth of the harbor , sometimes running in , sometimes standing down the river or stretching up to communicate with the blockading squadron . We were , therefore , each moment in danger of falling into the power of one of these . We , however , stepped our mast , and , hauling our sheet aft , let the wind drive us on . We now sailed merrily . All we had to do was to sit quietly down together in the stern , save one to look out ahead , and enjoy our success . We had indeed achieved a remarkable adventure , having passed safely through a fleet of above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brigs , where on every deck a constant watch was kept . We run on for about three miles , our way lighted by the stars , while the watch lights of the castle on the mount , of the guard-ship , and the port , were visible far behind us . I was looking out ahead when I saw looming up before us a large vessel . I soon saw that it was a brig standing towards us . We doused our mast and sail instantly , and threw ourselves flat in the bottom of the boat . She passed within fifty yards of us , and the swell of her wake as she receded violently rocked us . We rose up to see her disappearing in the distance , not a little overjoyed at our escape . I took good care to keep a sharper look-out , and Fairfax lent the aid of his eyes also . At length we discovered a light close to the water some ways ahead , and took it for that of the British frigate Doris which we knew lay off here . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had set it again ) when we came near , in case it should prove to be an enemy 's light . But as we came near , we saw the dark form of a large ship at anchor , looming up , and in a few minutes were satisfied that she was the Doris , by the position of two lights on board which Captain Conway had described to us as being marks by which to distinguish her . In five minutes more we came so nigh as to be discovered from her decks and hailed by the sentry . CHAPTER XI . The Frigate Doris . ' Boat ahoy ! What boat is that ? ' resounded gruffly over the space between us and the frigate , before we replied . Shore boat ! ' Shore boat come along side ! ' was the stern command . There was a light at the same moment passed along the deck to the gangway , which showed us the sentry pacing his platform outside , and the forms of two or three persons in the port . We had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves by this time running pretty high , for the wind had increased as we got outside of the harbor , and we found that without great precaution , we should be in danger of getting our frail skiff dashed against the lofty sides of the frigate and swamped . As we came near I stood in the bows with a short pike and fended off , while Fairfax caught a rope which a sailor threw over his head . He passed it forward to me , and in a moment I had secured the end by a double turn about the bow thwart . Our little boat in the meanwhile , bobbed actively up and down on the restless chop seas that broke against the frigate . Come on deck one of you and let us know your business , ' said an officer looking down upon us , and trying by the aid of a battle lantern held by a marine , to make us out . As I was nighest the ladder , I seized the man-rope and ascended to the gangway port where he stood . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , to whom I had frequently the honor of selling many a glass of brandied soda . I called him by name . He looked closely at me , and then recognizing me said , How is this ? Why are you off here in an open boat at this time of night ? ' To escape from the Brazilian authorities , ' I answered . Why what have you been doing ? ' We got tired of remaining at Montevideo , our original destination having been Buenos Ayres , and we planned to get out of the city and join the patriots for want of something better to do . Our plan was listened to by a spy and reported to the Governor-General , and we got wind of it in time to make our escape in the boat . ' And how have you got out of the harbor ? ' By muffled oars and stealing along , and once when we were challenged , we got off by making use of the name of your frigate . ' By this time Fairfax and the others had reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm welcome , and said that he was very glad that we had not fallen into the hands of the Portuguese , but , ' he added , I fear that we shall not dare to protect you , if the Brazilian Government should order you to be surrendered . ' We do not intend to burden you with any responsibility , ' answered Fairfaz ; we have started with the intention of going up to Buenos Ayres . ' In that little whale boat ? ' Yes , sir . ' You know that the river is blockaded , and also thronged with cruisers . ' We are aware of it , ' I answered ; but we shall try to get past them , and trust we shall succeed as well as we have done in getting out of the harbor , through the fleet and past the forts . ' This is a bold enterprise , and I fear you will be unable to carry it through . Wait here a few moments and I will let Sir John know you are on board , for it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you men go down and keep their boat from knocking her nose to pieces against the ship . ' With this he left us and went aft . We stood by the gangway surrounded by middies and petty officers and seamen , who had gathered at the spot to hear our story . They asked us innumerable questions , and being well aware from experience of the vigilance preserved in the port , they could hardly believe that we had succeeded in coming out undetected . But there we stood , and there along side , danced our little bark in attestation . At length the lieutenant returned , and said , that Sir John Sinclair would like to see us in the cabin . Upon entering the cabin we found the English Captain seated in an arm-chair wrapped in a silk brocade dressing gown , and his feet thrust into yellow slippers . So these are the four young Americans who have run away from Montevideo , and are going to try and break the blockade ? ' he said looking at us and then addressing his lieutenant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added in a kind cordial manner . Tim get the wine and glasses ; they must feel like taking something after their long tug out ! So my brave fellows , ' he said turning to us , so you took a fancy to join the patriots ? ' Yes , sir , ' answered Rsdsworth , on whom his eye fell as he put the question . That is just like you , Jonathans all the world over . You drink in love of republics , and hatred of kings and emperors with your mother 's milk . But if you wished to join the army outside you should have been more cautious . It seems you were overheard making your plans , and an order was sent for your arrest as enemies and traitors to the Government ? ' Yes , Sir John , ' answered Fairfax . We learned it through an American Captain , who aided us in getting on board his vessel after nine o'clock ; and there we obtained the boat with which we escaped out of the harbor ! ' A whale boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come through the whole harbor fleet and pass the guard-ship and forts in safety ? ' We came with great caution , ' I answered , having our oars muffled and one to keep look out while two others rowed and one steered.  --  We had several hair-breadth escapes ; and once was challenged , but we promptly answered Doris , ' and so passed as your gig . ' That was well done  --  capitally done ! You are a set of brave fellows ! How in the dence you run the gauntlet of so many armed ships I ca n't imagine ! ' We repeatedly struck their cables , ' I replied ; and once aroused a dog on board of one , but we pulled under the bows and lay concealed until all was still again . Several vessels were passed by pulling directly under their taffrails ; we found it safer to hug them close than to keep out at a distance where we might be seen ! ' You did , eh ? By St. George , you made your calculations and carried through your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go over to the patriots ? Are you mere adventurers ? You do not look like such ! ' We were passengers in a Boston brig bound to Buenos Ayres , ' answered Fairfax ; whither we were going for the purpose of being clerks . We were brought to , and carried into Montevideo . There we have turned our hand to keeping a soda-shop ; but as we had no desire to make this our profession , we resolved to leave the city and join the patriots in hopes that we should be able to achieve something worthier our ambition . It was while we were discussing this subject and proposing means to get out of the city , that we were overheard ; and but for the friendly aid of an American Captain , who got intelligence of the kind intentions of the Governor-General towards us , we should now be in the calaboose instead of on board your ship ! ' Well , I am glad to welcome you ! But if you will take my advice you will not think of attempting to reach the blockaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in contemplation .  --  You will be sure to be captured , and then a sovereign to a sous you would be shot ! ' There is no alternative , ' Sir John , ' I answered . The same good fortune that has favored us to-night , I am persuaded will continue with us . We can not compromise you with the Brazilian Government by making your frigate an asylum . There are no vessels going to the United States , in which we could take passage . Besides , we have come to South America in the hope of making our fortunes ; and as the war has placed us in the position we are now in , we are ready to avail ourselves of the war to see what it will do in our favor . We know that promotion is rapid in the Patriot service , and that four young Americans will be a welcome arrival ! We propose two of us on reaching Buenos Ayres , to join their navy , and the remaining two take the field with the army ! ' And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir John . Yes , sir , ' was our almost unanimous reply . Well , then you must take your own way . But you are to encounter great risks . None but a set of infernal young Yankees would ever think of embarking upon an expedition of this kind . If you will go , Heaven prosper the bold and the brave ! What is it you have come outside in ? ' An eighteen foot whale boat , Sir John , ' responded the lieutenant . And in this shell you hope to reach Buenos Ayres alive ! It is like a voyage at sea . You know the distance is one hundred and fifty miles or thereabouts , and that the river is in some parts fifty feet wide . The pamperos sometimes toss up a sea that your boat would not live in three minutes . ' We must risk all these dangers , sir , ' said Bedrick resolutely . Well , then , young men , if you will , I will do my best to fit you out . Mr. Colverton , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart of the river put into their boat , and if you can spare a spy-glass let them have one . It will enable them to make out enemies at a distance and run in shore to avoid them . ' We thank you kindly , Sir John , ' said I , but through the care of the American Coptain , we are provided with all these . ' The dence you are . Have you beef and bread ? ' Plenty , sir . ' I 'll lay a wager you have n't champagne at least . ' We had a dozen when we left port , but we opened one to celebrate our safe passage by the guard-ship . ' Well , another dozen wo n't come amiss . Have it sent into the boat and a demijohn of French brandy . Are any of you acquainted with the river ? ' None of us , ' I answered . ' Then I will lend you a couple of my men . They will assist you in managing the boat and otherwise be of service . ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged leave respectfully to decline them , saying that any more would encumber the boat , which was full narrow enough quarters as it was ; and that if we got into any difficulty we preferred to share it alone rather than involve others in it . ' Well , you are a generous and brave party of young men and deserve success , and I hope you will attain it . Let me give you some directions as to your course . When do you wish to set out ? ' Each moment is of importance to us , Sir John , said I , as we are desirous of getting past the blockading squadron before daylight . ' The deuce you do ! Why you talk as if getting by was the easiest thing in the world . Do you know that the Imperial fleet occupy the whole breadth of the river , and are anchored within gun-shot of each other . A shark could n't go by without his fin being seen . ' We shall try and keep equi-distant between two of the vessels and dropping our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I perceive , that you need no advice of mine . You can get along very well of your own wits , from what I see . But I would advise you to keep in with the northern shore for a hundred miles ( if you get safely by the fleet , that is ) until you approach Colonia , a town and fortress opposite Buenos Ayres , which is thirty miles across the river from it . Colonia is in the hands of the Brazilians , as well as all the North shore between Montevideo and Colonia . But there is no towns or settled places between . Before you get to Colonia , I would recommend you to strike across to the South shore of the river towards Buenos Ayres . ' We thanked Sir John Sinclair for his directions and expressed our grateful sense of his kind interest in our welfare . We then joined him in a glass of wine , in which he drank to our success . He then shook us all heartily by the hand , and bade us good-bye and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant upon deck where we took leave of him and the other officers who crowded about the gang-way port . They gave us their best wishes , and the lieutenant said that he should go into town early in the morning , when he would report our arrival so far , to our friends , especially to Captain Conway . Two men were tending the boat , which otherwise would have been dashed to pieces against the frigate 's side . They had stepped our mast for us and reefed our sail , as the wind blew quite hard . After we had got into the little dancing affair , and secured a footing , we thanked the men and told them to let her go ! ' I took the helm , while Fairfax hauled aft the sheet and secured it by a turn under the thwart , for we had no belaying pins . Radsworth and Bedrick took a position forward to look out . The instant the two men sprung out of her to the ladder , the little boat darted away like an arrow shot from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frigate out of sight . CHAPTER XII . The Fleet . The very brief space of time in which we had dropped the frigate into the darkness , showed us the velocity with which we were scudding along . The waves ran alarmingly high , and sometimes broke over the bow , but we actively baled out the water , and let her jump with the bit in her teeth ! ' I have said that the river at Montevideo is about sixty miles across from shore to shore , and gradually lessening in breadth for one hundred and twenty-five miles to Buenos Ayres , where it is but thirty miles wide . It is indeed , like a huge bay , not dissimilar to the Deleware in shape and dimensions . In depth of water , however , it is very opposite to this bay ; the La Plata River being so shallow throughout its whole breadth and length , that ships can anchor in any part of it with a few fathoms of cable out of sight of the shores on either side . The Brazilian blockading squadron taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably anchored in a line , from shore to shore , there being vessels enough to form an unbroken chain of sixty miles , the space between each vessel being about a mile and a quarter  --  that is , within point blank range of any thing that might try to pass between them . The fixed squadron remained from day to day , with its sails furled and with nothing to do but to keep watch that nothing went up the river past them . It had also videttes in the shapes of schooners and gunbrigs in advance that boldly sailed up the river within sight of Buenos Ayres , off which in the outer roads , Admiral Brown 's fleet was getting ready to make a descent to force the blockade . Cruisers also scoured the river below the blockading fleet quite to the mouth of the river , to look after vessels coming in and politely informing them of the blockade , escort them into Montevideo . We were fully acquainted with all these circumstances before we left Montevideo and well knew the risks we had to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through with what we had began without fear or shrinking . In less than twenty minutes after we had run the frigate out of sight the dark outline of the castillated mount had disappeared in the darkness , and around us was visible only the wide expanse of water and the starry skies over our heads . The wind blew very fresh , and our little skiff waltzed to its hoarse music from wave to wave with the lightness of a feather . The white caps rose around us and high as our heads , and sometimes ; owing to the unskillful management of the helmsman tumbled aboard of us , half deluging the boat . We threw out the water again with our buckets aud let her drive through a constant shower of spray that wetted us to the skin . We were only anxious about our powder , which , however , were well packed away in the locker , the little door of which we defended by our jackets so that no water could enter . As we could see no land , and the Northern star was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , we , at length , struck a light and lighted our dark lantern . By its aid , we not only were enabled to look at the compass which told us we were steering a West course , our proper one , but also to ascertain what hour of the night it was . Fairfix boasting the possession of a silver watch , we found it was ten minutes to four . We must be pretty well up wish the fleet , ' said Fairfax , as he replaced his watch ; it is an hour and a half since we left the frigate . This wind ought to drive us along eight knots , for if it blew a thimble full harder , it would drive us under . Let us keep a sharp look-out ahead , boys ! ' And a sharp look-out we did keep . Three of us gave ourselves to this duty , one at the bows , and the others on each side . We were apprehensive of falling aboard some gun-boat or schooner acting as tenders to the fleet , and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eyes busily watching the surface of the river , and the horizon . At length , I being in the bows and keeping a sharp look-out thought I detected a break in the dim line of the horizon ahead . After watching it sharply , I was satisfied that some object was before us and not very far distant . Let go the halyards , ' I cried , we are right aboard something or other . ' Fairfax whose duty it was to tend the main-sheet , let it go flying at the same moment that Radsworth slipped the halyards from the thwart around which they were made fast . Down came our little sail by the run , for it had halyards as well as brails , and the next moment a lugger-rigged gun-brig hove in full sight out of the darkness . Down , lay close ! ' I cried as she came dashing on seemingly right before us . We had no alternatives , but to get run down or be taken prisoners . Bedrick , with great presence of mind unstepped the mast and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head with it as it fell . We then crouched so closely that nothing could be seen of us , though we could look out upon the enemy . The lugger came on and tumbled past us within seventy feet . We could see that she had a good many men in her , and their voices reached us distinctly .  --  We trembled lest we should be discovered . Our hearts , at least mine , was in my mouth , till I saw the lugger 's stern , and beheld her rapidly fade away in the darkness . We now took a long breath , and sprung to our feet with mutual congratulations upon our narrow escape- We now took a careful look out ahead , to see that there was no more coming , and then once more hoisted our little sail and dashed onward upon our course . That was one of the infernal Portuguese gun-boats that carry forty men , ' at length said Fairfax . If we had been seen we should have been taken , unless we fought for it ! ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be captured , either by gun-boat or gun-brig , and renewed our resolutions made to Captain Conway that we would die before we would surrender to a Brazilian vessel . We now sailed on with all our eyes open and watching sharply for any thing else that might heave in sight . We calculated ourselves to be nearly up with the squadron which was but fifteen miles above the port out of which we had run the gauntlet . Silently we drove on , eagerly intent upon the discovery of the first vessel , when Bedrick electrified us by calling out , A light , a light ! ' Scarcely had he got the words out of his lips , when I discovered another , and Radsworth repeated the cry from his side of the look-out . There were three lights in a range just ahead of us . They were as dim as the faint fire-tip of a cigar , but they at once indicated to us the position of the fleet . In a moment afterwards two more lights were made , and in a range with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Radsworth with great animation . Yes ; they are the lights on board the anchored vessels , ' I answered with joy at having at length come in view of the long-wished for squadron . We were all excited and exalted by the sight , and felt like giving vent to our excess of spirits in a right down Yankee hurrah . But we restrained the impulse with that discreet caution which the reader will see hitherto governed our proceedings . The lights seemed to be about half a mile apart , at the distance we discovered them , and at about equal distances from each other . Two of them were much lighter than the others ; and these pronounced to be on board the two frigates , one of which carried Admiral Lobo 's flag , and which we were told by Captain Conway would lay nearly in range of our course . After a short consultation as to the most likely way to pass through the squadron in safety and unseen , we at length decided to run between the two frigates and steer as near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make us within half a mile of each . We knew that the officers on board would be likely to sweep the water around constantly with night-glasses , and that any vessel of any size would unquestionably be discovered . But we trusted in the insignificance of our craft to pass through the fleet wtth impunity . It would take sharper eyes and better glasses than the Brazilians have to see us half a mile off with our mast and sail down , ' said Radsworth . I do not fear them ! ' The main danger is , ' said I , of falling in with any boats crossing from vessel to vessel . ' We must risk that , ' said Fairfax , and if they trouble us we must fight ' em , we gain fast upon the lights . ' Yes , I can make out the outline of two of the vessels , ' said I.  --  They ca n't be more than a mile distant . ' Then it is time we douse sail and mast and take to our oars , fellows , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until we could clearly make out the spars of the nearest vessels and then dropped our mast and sail and took to the oars . Fairfax kept the helm , it being his hour to steer , for we took turns at each duty . I took the starboard oar , and Radsworth the larboard , while Bedrick took the lookout ; but for that matter we all looked out , for it was a critical time with us ; for if we could pass the fleet in safety we had the river all before us with no danger to apprehend save from the videttes that might be cruising above to watch the movements , or rather the preparations of the patriot squadron ; for it had just reached Admiral Lobo 's ears that Commodore Brown of the Buenos Ayrean navy had sworn he would break through the blockading squadron before thirty days had passed . The two vessels of war which we had selected to pass between , grew larger and more distinct to the eye as we advaneed . We were perfectly still , and our oars being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint sounds are heard at great distances upon the water , and that any discretion on our part might betray our presence to the ears of our enemies if not to their eyes . We had some misgivings that we also might be seen ; for we were well aware that men were stationed aloft to scrutinize the surrounding water , and that their eyes accustomed to the duty could detect objects at a great distance . Still we had hope and courage , and trusted to the good fortune which had thus far attended us . We rowed steadily on , now watching this vessel now glancing sus piciously at that . Gradually we drew near and lost the lights in the stern and got sight of the stationary battle-lanterns gleaming through the ports . We were now between them . Both were distinctly visible and so large in size that they seemed much nearer to us than they really were . Steady pull , boys , ' said Fairfax in a low voice . We are right abeam now and they have not seen us yet . Lay low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that ? ' cried Radsworth as a distant cry startled us as it was borne wildly to us across the water . It is the sentinel 's call of all 's well , ' said I , recognizing gladly the tones , which at first I had feared was an alarm . We are safe , yet , boys ! ' cried Fairfax . Paul take the helm , and Bill and I will relieve you and Radsworth . ' The change was silently and gladly made by us , for we had pulled nearly a mile very hard , and were rejoiced to have a relief . We now kept steadily on forging each moment ahead of the two vessels which were anchored bows up stream , and at length we had the satisfaction of looking behind us to see them . We pulled on for about half a mile without stopping , and then seeing the ships just blent with the haze of night and scarcely discernable , we ceased rowing and shook hands all round with warm congratulations ; and it being moved and carried that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we forthwith took one from the locker , and in a tin cup drank the following classical sentiment : - Hurrah for Yankee-land and confound the Portuguese squadron . ' It was not drank standing , for our boat knocked about so like an egg-shell tossed in a whirlpool we could not keep our legs long enough . We , however , honored it with three hearty cheers which our enthusiasm would no longer suffer us to forego . Having emptied our bottle of champagne we stepped our mast , set our sail , and giving the little craft which had done her duty so well , to the influence of the winds , we in a few moments left the blockading squadron out of vision , save one faint , distant glimmer of a light upon the deck of Lobo 's frigate . The morning twilight now began to light up scarce perceptibly the Eastern heavens , and gradually the night became gray , and the line of the watery horizon was defined against the sky . We now began to feel anxious lest we should not get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We , therefore , carefully trimmed our boat , and swelled the threads of the canvass by casting water upon it to make it hold the wind better , and thus having done all in our power for safety , we seated ourselves in the stern of the boat and quietly left the issue to Providence . CHAPTER XIII . The Voyage . As the morning dawned we watched the horizon around us with the closest scrutiny . At length we could discern the land on our right , ( the northern shore of the river , ) about eight miles distant . It had at first the appearance of a long black cloud , low upon the horizon ; but as the light of day grew stronger , we could see clumps of trees defined upon it , and in one place was a whitish spot , which we took to be a house . The day at length commenced , and the sky over us began to be flushed with crimson . We could now look around us , and see whatever was upon the water within the circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship of the blockading squadron , which we could just discover like a black spec full three leagues down the river .  --  South and west of us all was clear  --  not a boat or vessel was in sight . We had the river , as far as we could see above us , all to ourselves . The sun now rose and enlivened us with his beams and made us feel cheerful . We had every reason to be in high spirits  --  we had met with the most triumphant success , and left the fleet of the enemy far astern . A hundred miles above us , or a little more , was the city of Buenos Ayres , though on the southern shore . If we fell in with no Brazilian cruisers in this hundred miles , we should be at the blockaded port in safety . Now , fellows , ' said Radsworth , rubbing his hands as the sun sent his bright rays aslant the water ; what do you think of running the gauntlet , hey ? Do n't you say that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I had time , ' said Fairfax , I would propose we went back and take breakfast with old Lobo . ' Talking of breakfast reminds me of our salt beef and biscuit , ' said I ; suppose we set the table and breakfast on board our own craft . What with rowing and the night air I feel as hungry as seven men . ' I second the proposition , ' said Fairfax . Gentlemen , suppose we omit the table-cloth for this morning , seeing they are gone to be washed ; the first frigate we take we 'll lay in a supply of clean ones . ' I am not particular , ' said Bedrick . We will supply ourselves with silver forks also then ; but we must carve and eat with our sabres for what I see . ' I wonder , ' said I , how the old man breakfasts this morning ? I should n't wonder if he had lost his appetite . ' He has certainly lost four first rate appetites , ' said Fairfax , cutting off a huge slice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jaws . At this we all laughed heartily ; and thus in the merriest mood possible we breakfasted . Besides the beef and cold ham , we had ship-bread , and some bottles of ale , with which we washed down the beef and hard-tack . I never ate a heartier breakfast in my life : and the others were very positive that they never had . While we were eating we let the skiff drive on with a flowing sheet , it requiring only a little attention now and then at the helm , between our mouthfuls , to keep her steady on her course . Now if we had cigars , ' said Bedrick , as we carefully put away the remains of the breakfast into the locker ; we should feel like aldermen ! ' Cigars , however , were a luxury to be denied to us , and we bore the deprivation like philosophers . As we had been awake all night it was now proposed that we should divide ourselves into two watches , of four hours each , so that we all might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first watch fell to Fairfax and myself . The other two then rolled themselves up into a knot and coiled away , one forward and the other in the centre of the boat , to take a nap . In a few minutes they were fast asleep , rocked by the cradling motion of the waves . The wind had lulled as the sun rose , and by the time we had got through our breakfast , it blew very gently from the south-east . The skies were clear and the waves gradually fell , till the river by and by became as smooth as a lake . We moved pleasantly along within three leagues of the shore , at about four knots , while our watch below ' slept , and part of the time caught ourselves napping . The shores , which I examined with the spy-glass , presented only a barren ridge sloping to the water , and here and there diversified by a ravine or clump of low wild peach trees . No signs of habitation were apparent . In one instance I saw a drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , galloping along the ridge-slope for a while , and then disappearing over the verge towards the interior . The prospect was barren and uninviting . The line of the shore was nearly straight , with scarcely an indenture for serveral miles . We compared our observations with our chart , and at length discovering , some distance up the river , a projection like a cape , we found on looking for it in the chart that we were forty miles above Montevideo . This was about ten o'clock in the forenoon  --  a pretty good run since twelve o'clock the night before , all the circumstances taken into consideration . Our watch below ' were waked at twelve o'clock , just after we had passed the point above mentioned . They had slept without stirring hand or foot for four hours . They waked heavily at first , but were soon made to understand where they were and what was wanted of them . The first thing they did was to look sharply all about to see if any enemy was in sight ; and they did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , we could not help laughing . I now proposed that we should dine before going to sleep ; this was seconded and carried . Our dinner was corned beef and hard-tack , like our breakfast , but instead of beer was washed down with champagne . Fairfax and I now coiled ourselves up in the bottom of the boat , and in three minutes were both in oblivion . At four o'clock we were called out , and found to our regret that we had been laying almost becalmed , and that the watch had rowed two hours out of their four . We had , however , gained six miles , which was something . We now all four took to the oars , and began to pull vigorously up the river , for there was not a breath of air . We were desirous of getting as soon as possible out of the neighborhood of the blockading squadron and their cruisers ; and we were aware that the farther we ascended the less likely we were to fall in with them . The shores along which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were within four miles of them , still presented no feature of cultivation or of inhabitants . The whole coast was a black sun-burnt ridge , with here and there a patch of stunted trees . Our chart showed us no inhabited spot until we should come to Colonia , a fort and small town , directly opposite to which was Buenos Ayres . But as Colonia , with all the shore on this side of the river , was in the possession of Brazil , we had no intention of going up so high before crossing over ; we also deemed it best to keep a good offing , as possibly there might be parties of the enemy on the land provided with boats . We might have crossed the river where we were , but as it was fifty miles wide there , and pamperos often came up suddenly , in which our boat could not have lived , we thought it best to hug the Bonda Oriental shore until we came near Colonia , where , the river being but two leagues across , we might run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon , seaward and landward , and up the river , scanning the shore and the offing with the closest scrutiny . If we were seen by any cruiser , we felt quite sure of being chased ; and to render our skiff a less prominent object , we began to discuss the expediency of keeping our mast and sail down while daylight lasted , and sailing only at night . But in this we were divided , as rowing all day was not by any means desirable or pleasant . There was , however , no wind at present . As the sun drew towards the west the night breeze began to blow in from the sea , at first gently .  --  We hailed its approach for its refreshing influence , as well as a relief to our rowing . We again put it to vote whether to hoist sail or not , and we decided to make sail and run as long as we could in safety , but to keep a good look-out all around . We shall be sure to see any vessel before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loom up so much larger than ourselves ; and if we douse sail at once and keep low or pull in shore we shall escape . ' We therefore hoisted sail , and once more glided smoothly along .  --  The sun was about half an hour high . Nothing was visible but sky and water , and the strip of barren coast , parallel with which we were steering . I had the helm and Fairfax the look-out , while the other two were seated amidships dozing , for they had not slept since noon . I had just taken the glass and swept the horizon outside , but seeing nothing was about to lay it down , when it occurred to me that I would look in shore , from which we were about three and a half miles . I levelled the glass and slowly swept the line of beach , when , at the mouth of a ravine , I discovered a large boat or lugger with two masts . I could hardly credity my eyes , but after exnmining closely I was convinced that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained men , while others were ashore . Fairfax , ' said I , take the glass and look at that dark hollow in shore , and see what you can discover . ' He came aft and took the spy-glass , and the next instant cried out aloud ,  --  Portuguese , by Heaven ! ' The exclamation roused our two dozers , and springing to their feet bewildered , they gazed wildly round , and cried ,  --  Where ? where ? ' One of them at the same time grasped a pistol and the other seized a sabre . We laughed at their alarm , and then cautioning them to be silent and keep collected , we gave them the spy-glass and showed them the enemy . They are skinning cattlet , ' said Bedrick ; it is a gun-boat that has run in there for fresh provisions . Boys , we must douse sail and take to the oars , and pull dead out into the river . ' The mast was struck instantly , and we seized our oars and began to run away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , I took the spy-glass and levelled it at the land . To my dismay I saw that the lugger was in motion towards us , pulled by at least six sweeps on a side . Now , boys , ' said I , we must run for it ; it is neck or nothing  --  Portuguee and Yankee ! They have seen us , and put off after us with as many legs as a centipede ! ' Each one took the glass in turn to satisfy himself , and then we took off our jackets and began to pull like club-oarsmen racing for a silver cup . The sun was now about a quarter of an hour high ; it seemed to me it would never go down  --  for on the darkness depended our escape ; for in a dead pull in daylight the lugger was sure to have the best of it , for we should by and by have to give in for want of wind . We watched the slow sun with the most anxious eyes  --  yet there was no signs of fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet we were by no means solicitous to be any nearer the gun-boat than we were ! For my part , ' said Radsworth , as he kept his eyes fixed on the sun , I ca n't conceive what Joshua wanted it to stand still for  --  I would give a bag of dollars , if I had it , if it would take a dive and disappear . If it should stand still now where it is , we should have to fight or be taken and shot . ' The sun at length went down , and as it disappeared we shouted and bent with more energy to our oars . The little skiff fairly jumped beneath our efforts , and in truth all the life we had in us we lent her . The lugger gained perceptibly , but the twilight was as rapidly deepening into night .  --  We began to gain confidence . I wonder , ' said I , if that lugger does n't carry a long Tom ? If she does we are likely to have a game at bowls with her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardly had the words fallen from my mouth when a flash lighted up the dusk ; the next instant a rushing was heard in the air above us , and then a splashing in the water beyond us , and then the deep roar of the gun upon our ears . For a moment we were appalled . Let us up sail and drive her , ' I cried ; they ca n't do more than sink us , and they have seen us already as plain as they can . ' The mast was stepped , the sail hoisted , and away we went scudding before a six-knot breeze , the starboard gunwale dipping under water . CHAPTER XIV . An Adventure . How anxiously we watched the progress of darkness over sky and water ! Night alone could save us ! The dark form of the lugger could be seen nearer and nearer , her sails hoisted and oars flying in eager pursuit . It may be regarded as surprising that a small whale boat , scarcely visible to them , should have been deemed an object worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken into consideration , in reference to which every object upon the river was taken notice of , this surprise will be removed . Lobo would have stopped a carrier-pigeon if he could have done so ! Slowly , oh ! how slowly the darkness came on ! The masts of the lugger faded fast from view , and then gradually the dark mass of her hull was blended with the haze of night . When , at length , she was no longer visible , our hearts beat freer ; yet each instant we watched for the flash which should send another shot after us . Now that she can no longer see us , ' said Radsworth , who had the helm , suppose we tack and stand towards the shore , so as to reach it higher up . They will probably keep straight on this way , and by tacking and running in shore we shall be likely to get them off the scent . ' This suggestion was unanimously approved of , and the next minute we had put the helm hard up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles distant . We were as silent as possible ; not a word was spoken above a whisper . Our little skiff pranced on like a well-trained steed , dashing from her prow the foaming waters . We kept up the river obliquely towards the land , so as to give the lugger as wide a berth as possible . After we had run on this course about ten minutes , closely scanning the darkness to windward to see if we could discern our enemy , we were startled by a flash not a quarter of a mile abeam of us , which showed us for an instant all the proportions of the gun-boat . To our great joy we saw that she was standing straight upon our former course , and firing in the direction she supposed we were . She will run her nose against the south shore if she keeps on long enough , ' said Fairfax . What an escape we have made !  --  boys , fortune favors us , there is no mistake ! ' The report of the gun sounded like closely exploding thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it did not alarm us  --  we saw that we had eluded her by our ruse , and that so long as she kept on that tack and we on ours we could laugh at her . Each moment the space between us was widening , and when , fifteen minutes afterwards , she fired again , we could but just detect the distant , dull report , at least three miles off . There was cause for mutual congratulations at defeating her , and we expressed our satisfaction in very exulting words . We did not , however , intermit our vigilance ; we knew that we had a dangerous enemy in our neighborhood , and that , though darkness now befriended us , daylight might reveal us to them , or to some other . She will be sure to tack before she runs on another hour , ' said Bedrick ; and then we shall run a chance of falling in with her .  --  Suppose we pull about now dead before the wind , and stick her nose up river ? We shall be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion was adopted , and just as we came within sight of the dark line of the shore , we cast the sheet free and sailed merrily along parallel with the coast . There goes another gun , ' cried Radsworth , who was looking in the direction of the lugger 's course ; but the flash is as faint as the report . ' She is full six miles off , ' answered Fairfax ; we have fully done her brown ! ' Do n't be too sauguine , ' said Bedrick ; we may find two for this one before we go far up the river . ' It is our determination to fight to the last , is it not , boys ? ' said I. Yes ! ' was the unanimous reply , we will not be taken alive ! ' And in this purpose we were all thoroughly determined . Our situation was each moment one of the most imminent peril , yet we kept up good spirits and firm courage , and had but one heart and one mind . I have no doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have fought to desperation before yielding . We were well armed , and like most youths , perfectly fearless ;  --  yet , as the reader will have noticed , our reckless daring was tempered by prudence and discretion . At length we could neither see nor hear any thing more of the lugger , and having taken a tin cup of champagne all round  --  for we had nothing else to drink save ale and the rum-water  --  we set the watch for the night . Fairfax and I had the first watch below , ' and coiling ourselves up between the thwarts , we were soon oblivious . I had slept about three hours when I was awakend by Bedrick calling , in a hushed tone ,  --  Fellows , up quickly ! ' What is it ? ' I cried , grasping my cutlass and gazing round . To my surprise I found we were lying becalmed within a hundred yards of the shore , which hung its dark shadow over us . We seemed to be in a small cave , for land was all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What place is this ? ' asked Fairfax and I in surprise . The wind went down an hour ago , and we had to take to the oars , ' answered Radsworth ; and coming up with a point of land which jutted far out into the river , we found this cave and pulled into it to rest , and dropped the keeleg . We thought we would n't call you till your four hours were out . ' And not now , ' chimed in Bedrick , but we have been listening the last quarter of an hour to the most infernal howls from the shore that mortal ever heard . They have been growing louder and nearer , till just as I waked you we were saluted by a yell from the beach as if we had been hailed by a hyena . There it is again ! ' And there it was , sure enough ! Such a howl  --  so wild , so fierce and fiendish  --  never saluted my ears . My blood ran cold in my veins . What under heavens can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than I know , ' answered Bedrick . Hear that again ! ' The scream was repeated , followed by a crackling in the bushes and a splash in the water , as if a horse had plunged in . Then came the dashing noise of swimming , as if some huge animal was making his way towards us . I sprang to the locker and took out four or five pistols and handed them to my companions . Our sabres were also taken in hand , and thus armed we stood awaiting the coming of the foe . I believed it to be a wild horse , but Fairfax was very positive it was a panther or hyena . We stood awaiting him calmly ; I remembered then having read of a traveller in India whose boat had been attacked by a tiger and overset ; I thought we might have some such enemy , and cautioned my friends . Nearer and nearer came the monster ; the splashing of his passage was tremendous . We could hear his heavy panting , and then two glaring balls of fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I cried . When he comes within ten feet of us let us fire ! ' Coolly and firmly we awaited his approach . We would gladly have taken to our oars and pulled out of his way  --  for his visit was by no means welcome  --  but this course was from the first too late , as he swam very rapidly , giving us no time to do more than seize our arms and prepare to defend our boat as well as we could . When about ten feet from us we made out his head and shoulders and white breast with distinctness ; his eyes seemed to emit a phos-phorescent fire . By one impulse , with the eager cry , Now let him , have it ! ' we discharged our pistols at his head . The report of five pistols ( for Bedrick blazed away with two , ) and the smoke for a moment confused us . No cry or sound of pain followed the furious volley , and not seeing him when we looked we believed we had finished the monster , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our respite was but brief . A splash and an excrutiating yell , like the screaming of a gigantic file , heard behind us , told us that the fight had but just began . He had dived at the flash of our pistols , and risen on the other side of the boat , and within six feet of it . Before we could recover fully from our astonishment , he had floundered towards the boat and flung his huge paw over the gunwale . The weight of his huge bulk at once caused the boat to begin to take in water , while we shouted to each other to keep on the upper side . We were not idle withal : Radsworth and I seized our cutlasses , and at the same moment brought them down upon the monster 's paw with all our strength . He opened his tremendous jaws , showing double rows of glittering sharp teeth , and from the cavernous depths of his throat there issued a sound that has no likeness on earth save to itself ,  --  a compound of a locomotive whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting off steam from the escape-pipe of a high-pressure engine . Perhaps what is called an Arkansaw yell ' might come near to it . The paw was pulled back bleeding and dangling by the tendrons , and the panther , thinking he had enough of our quality , turned away and began paddling for the shore , every two or three seconds on his retreat uttering a sharp cry of pain . We did not fire after him , for we felt no disposition to goad a discomfited foe , and were glad enough to get rid of him on his own terms . We listened until he reached the shore , and heard him for some time afterwards cracking the dry brush as he limped over it , ever and anon lifting up his voice in a shrill cry of suffering . We could not but feel pity for the poor fellow , who had doubtless been attracted by the smell of our larder , and had paid us a visit to take a cold bite . The animal was doubtless one of the Paraguay panthers , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters , whom he sometimes overthrows , horse and rider . We felt thankful for our escape , and consulting upon our situation and prospects we finally came to the conclusion  --  especially as we heard a good deal of stir upon the shore , as if a new attack was contemplated by the panther 's kindred  --  that it would be best to pull up the river without waiting for a wind , and keeping at least half a mile from the shore . We were apprehensive too that the firing of our pistols might bring upon us enemies quite as dangerous as the panther , either from passing cruisers or parties of Quachos upon the land . So we hoisted in our keeleg , and taking our oars pulled out of the cove and so up along the shore . The stars shone brightly , the air was pure and soft , and the river perfectly smooth . We pulled on till past midnight , when the wind began to blow gently from the land , and we spread our sail to it gladly , for we were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set , and taken our seats astern began to talk over the affair we had had with the panther , and to promise that we would serve in the same way any of the Portuguese that should dare to board us , ( the considerate reader must allow something for the boastings of youths under nineteen ! ) when we were all taken by surprise by discovering a large vessel within a cable 's length of us to leeward . She was so near that we all discovered her at the same moment , and should have done so much sooner but for the intervention of our sail . Not a word was uttered ; the sheet was cast loose ; we sprung to the mast and unshipping it dropped it flat into the boat , and then threw ourselves at length upon our backs , so as to show as little surface above the water as possible . Our eyes , however , were at liberty . The vessel was a large gun-brig under top-gallant sails , and standing down the river . She passed us within pistol shot without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . We let her get well out of sight before we sat up . We then took two or three long breathes a-piece , and began to consult what was best to be done , for the river seemed full of enemies ; for a Brazilian we knew she must be , as no Patriot vessel would trust herself alone so far down the river . Two of us were for running under sail , and two for rowing . At length we cast lots , and the lot fell in favor of wind against arms . So we up mast , sheeted home , and let her go again , the wind blowing us along about five knots . In this manner we hugged the shore till day began to dawn , keeping about half a mile from it , and occasionally serenaded with a howl from a ravine or wood . With the dawn of day our vigilance and weariness increased ; and when the full light of the morning showed us a schooner and a barque outside of us , and a sloop-of-war of twenty guns ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as see the Brazilian flag flying. ) four miles ahead , we began to think that darkness was better than light , ' though we would not admit our deeds to be evil . ' CHAPTER XV The Ravine . Our surprise and consternation on finding ourselves at day break in the vicinity of two vessels of the enemy were very great . At first we could hardly believe our eyes , but as the growing light revealed them in all their warlike proportions , we could not longer disguise from ourselves the fact that we were caught in a very intricate position . Our first act was to drop the mast and sail , and we then consulted what was to be done . The sloop-of-war was under easy sail standing down the river , and the schooner was at anchor with her main-sail only set . We were about three quarters of a mile from the shore , which presented a level , barren plain only here and there relieved by a stunted tree , and covered with grey looking grass eight feet high . There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Radsworth . But the confounded panthers , ' objected Fairfax . It is Portuguee or panther , ' said I. We must choose one or the other . ' Then let us risk the panthers , ' said Bedrick . And we will have to move quickly too . If by any chance they look this way we will be seen , and then we are gone citizens . ' There was , indeed , no time to deliberate or delay acting . A slight haze that rose from the water as the sun rose , doubtless concealed us , while we could see them distinctly above it . This would soon disappear , and only the grey color of our boat blending us with the hues of the shore could prevent our being seen . We took our oars and began to pull in dilligently towards the land . I kept my eye upon both vessels as we rowed and was encouraged by not discovering any signs of their having seen us . In twenty minutes we reached the mouth of a small ravine , and in defiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it . We ascended rapidly , rowing the crooked canal about fifty yards , when a turn : in it hid us from the river . We could proceed no further on account of the reeds which obstructed it , and the branches of trees and huge vines that overhung it , tangled together in gigantic meshes . Glad to have got out of sight of the two vessels , we began to look with misgiving upon the dark cavities of the ravine , the recesses of which , seemed fit lairs for wild beasts . The first living object that we saw was a large bird with a white head and black wings tipped with white , that was seated upon the limb of a fallen tree . He did not fly at our intrusion , but flapping his wings , uttered a shrilly note of mingled defiance and alarm . He was about the size of a wild turkey . I was about to fire at him when Fairfax laid his hand on my pistol barrel . We ca n't be too still here , ' he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . ' I thanked him for his warning , and putting down the weapon I sprung ashore to fasten the boat to a wild vine that lay trailing upon the low bank . I had scarcery touched the ground when I leaped back into the boat again with the most commendable celerity . My vine proved to be an enormous serpent at least eighteen feet in length , of the anaconda species . Quicker than thought we pushed the boat out into the stream , and stood with our pistols cocked watching the motions of the unwieldy animal , and prepared to do battle if he made any hostile demonstrations . His head , which he had been resting upon the bank out of sight , basking in the warm morning sun , while his body extended to the water , he now raised and gazed around with quick , menacing glances . We increased the distance between us by crossing to the other bank and there waiting . After looking about for a few moments he slowly drew his lengthy form up the bank and in huge hoops rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were greatly relieved at his departure , and began to inspect narrowly such dangerous shores before again trusting ourselves upon them . The safest course for us , is to down keeleg and anchor , ' sald Radsworth . This was done about five feet from the brook . I was anxious to land to climb up the side of the ravine and look off to see what had become of the two vessels ; and after a close scrutiny of the shore , a suspicious and wary examination of every vine and limb to see that it was veritably vegetable and not animal , I once more jumped ashore from the end of the boat swung round for that purpose , and climbed the bank . The bank was a level plain covered with high grass , to overlook which , I was forced to climb a wild peach tree . From this elevation I had a wide view of the ocean-like river . The two vessels were in sight ; but the sloop of war was nearly opposite the mouth of the ravine standing down and less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag floating over her stern . Her men upon deck were also distinguishable . She stood steadily on her course and passed by greatly to our relief ; for I regularly reported what I saw to my companions in the boat beneath me . The schooner was no longer at anchor . She was under full sail and standing across the bows of the larger vessel as if to speak her . This she did do evidently from the manoeuvres , and then the schooner tacked and stood south towards the open river , while the sloop kept on her way . I watched them till both were full four miles away , when I prepared to get down confidant that we had not been seen , and that we had nothing to fear from them .  --  As I was leaving the tree , Bedrick called to know if any Anacondas or Panthers were in sight . I looked all around but could see none , not even a sign of my friend , the grape-vine serpent . I was , nevertheless very wary , and cautiously surveyed the premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I safely reached the boat , once more I felt that I had great cause for gratitude . I had , however , been successful in my object , in watching the movements of the enemy , and as were now free to proceed again I felt sufficiently recompensed for my risk . Once while I was in the tree I got very much alarmed . I detected about thirty yards off , a motion in the tall , reed-like grass . It swayed this way and that , and seemed to be agitated by some kind of beast crouching and creeping through it . I watched it with a palpitating heart and an unwinking eye . I drew one of my pistols , ( for I had taken two in a belt with my cutlass , ) and cocking it prepared to receive whatever might make its appearance with evil designs upon me . The motion however , shortly ceased and was not renewed again ; but I have no doubt it was caused by some animal whose departure was more gratifying than his visit would have been . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oars and pulled out of this ravine where serpents and also wild beasts made their abode , and felt quite safe when we once more found ourselves on the open river , albeit we had enemies there as usual ; and as we discussed the merits of our respective foes , we could not come to a decision which were the least to be dreaded , anacondas , panthers , or Portuguese , as Brazilians are more commonly called in that region . For my part , I felt that I had rather face six Portuguese than one anaconda or panther . But , as I have said , we were not unanimous upon that point .  --  After we had fairly got on our course again , we proposed to breakfast , and did so heartily upon corned beef , champagne and hard tack .  --  Having cleared away the table , which was the after thwart of the boat , we finished in a bumper , in which we drank confusion to panthers , Portuguese and anacondas . It was now moved and seconded that we should consult our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find Anaconda Creek , ' said Fairfax , there will be no mistaking our latitude . ' Or grape-vine ravine , ' said Radsworth looking at me slyly . What is the Spanish of grapes , Paul ? ' I 'll never forget that , ' said I laughing . We now compared the indentures in the coast with those on the chart , and after careful examination and comparing of notes , we calculated ourselves to be about eighty-five miles from Montevideo . This was our second day out of port , and under all circumstances , we thought we had done pretty well . Further examination of the chart showed us that we had nearly fifty miles farther to ascend the river before we should get opposite to Buenos Ayres , and there would be the river to cross which was there thirty miles wide . Thus we had about as far to go as we had come . It wo n't do to go too near Colonia , ' said Bedrick . No , ' answered Fairfax , We had best run up until we come in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can see us , and then strike across for Buenos Ayres . ' As we approach Colonia , I remarked , we shall have to be very careful . You all know that it is in the hands of the Brazilians as well as Montevideo , and that between the fleet and the fortress of Colonia , vessels , as we have seen , are constantly passing . My opinion is , that we had best cross the river at once and take the other shore . ' Sir John , ' answered Fairfax , advised us to keep on the northshore aslong as we could , saying that the main channel was on the south side , and that we should be the more likely to fall in with Brazilian cruisers there . Radsworth was of my opinion and Bedrick was with Fairfax . So , as we were all captains equally , we resorted as was our custom to drawing lots . The result was , that we decided to keep up the shore we were then upon until we came pretty well up to Colonia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current strong , we kept close in shore and hoisted sail , and in this manner we sailed pleasantly along for several hours without encountering anything upon the water or having our attention arrested by any striking object on shore . There was but one barren waste , now a limitless plain , now a broken ridge sloping to the river ; but in no part was there the slightest sign of cultivation or the possessions of man . Once in a while we saw huge cranes stalking into the water , and large birds unknown to us sailed above the beach on lazy pinions . We looked sharp for panthers and anacondas but did not discover any evidence of the presence of our legitimate foes ; indeed the Portuguese had got to be quite secondary affairs in our estimation . About three o'clock in the afternoon , while all three of my companions were napping , it being my trick ' at the helm , I took up the spy-glass to sweep the shore and horizon in the offing , as we made a practice of doing every half hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of us a boat drawn up on the beach , and under a bank was visible a small rude hut . This was the first sign of habitation we had met for nearly one hundred miles , for that distance had we now come . I was quite as much surprised at the discovery as if I had seen an anaconda . I let the boat keep steadily on , just as we had been running for the last few hours at about three and a half miles an hour , and continued to examine the hut without disturbing my companions . I saw , as we advanced , that the boat was a small piroque a few feet longer than our whale-boat , and that it was run upon the shore half out of the water . I knew it would take three or four men to launch it , and I scanned the hut closely , to see if any persons were about . At length we came opposite , and about a mile off from it . At this moment two men made their appearance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestures that we were observed and that our presence caused them surprise . I now waked my companions and pointed out the persons , the hut and the boat . We speculated upon their probable character , and finally decided that they were poor fishermen , and that we had nothing to fear from them . They now made signs to us and we could distinctly hear them shout to us . But we paid them no attention , keeping on our way in dignified silence , though eyeing them askance , for we had misgivings that they would launch their boat and put out after us . But we gradually lost sight of them and the hut , and after sailing a few miles further came opposite a delightful little nook in the shore , with a green natural lawn , bordered by trees , sloping to the water side . It looked so inviting that we resolved to go in there , and land and take our supper on the grass , under a wild fig tree that stood aloof from the rest . As we could see neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steered boldly in and beached our boat almost upon the edge of the lawn . The sun was within half an hour of setting as we stepped on shore armed to the teeth ; for precaution was one of our rare virtues . CHAPTER XVI . The Landing . We had scareely landed ere a terrible roar from the wood caused us to leap into the boat and put off , when a spotted panther came leaping like a grey hound towards us . He paced up and down the beach lashing his tail and howling with rage at the invasion of his domains . We fired at him without any apparent effect , though he shortly retired into the forest . At sunset the wind died quite away and we came to anchor in twelve feet of water right abreast of a ridge over which were dispersed a few trees . We resolved to lay here all night and sleep it out , for we were pretty well wearied , having slept but little since we left Montevideo .  --  It was decided that two should sleep half the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all that opportunity for repose of which we stood so much in need . Bedrick and Radsworth watched till twelve o'clock , but without any thing to interrupt the quiet of the night . The land was in darkness , and silence reigned on the broad river . At midnight , Fairfax and myself were aroused and took our turn to watch . I felt greatly relieved by the six hour 's sleep I had enjoyed and felt in good spirits . The watch we had relieved had hardly laid the heads down ere they were sound asleep . It was a beautiful night . The air had that delicious quality which has given to that region the name of Buenos Ayres , or good air . ' It was fresh , pure , soft and delightful to breathe . The stars sparkled in splendid constellations , unknown to Northern skies , and the placid bosom of the river reflected them with increased lustre . Not a breath of wind stirred . Our boat seemed to float in the atmosphere , with sky and stars above and sky and stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some dark cloud stationary in mid air . I sat in the stern of the boat and thought of my native land ; of my father 's house , my friends , and the familiar and past scenes which I had left , for a foreign land . Fairfax was similarly occupied and neither of us spoke for an hour , but sat silent and thoughtful . At length I supposed he was asleep , and spoke to him to ascertain . He answered promptly , I have not been asleep , but thought you were . I have been thinking of home , ' said I. And so have I , and what fools we were to start off on this South American adventure . ' Yes , we have not shown either wisdom or prudence in coming from the United States with Mr. Bedrick , ' said I. But we have put our hand to the plough and we must make the furrow . ' Well , we are young , and have our health , and if we ca n't make out in this country we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered Fairfax . We ought to be up with Colonia by to-morrow noon , and to-morrow night reach Buenos Ayres . ' Yes . I am tired of voyaging in such a little boat , ' said I. I would give a bottle of champagne , though we have but five left to stretch my legs upon the land once more . ' So would I , ' said Fairfax . Suppose we up keeleg , pull in shore , and have a race . ' Anaconda ! ' said I dryly . A plague on this confounded country , ' answered Fairfax angrily ; it is n't fit for Christians to live in ! Well , suppose we take to rowing . I had rather than sit here ; and we shall be gaining something . When we get tired we can anchor . ' We took in our little anchor , and placing the oars in the row-locks , began to pull steadily along the line of the shore . After rowing about an hour , we anchored again within a hundred rods of a projecting point dark with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevation than we had seen since we had left Montevideo . After watching its shape sometime , I became satisfied that it was shaped into angles and bastions , and directed the attention of Fairfax to it . There never was a natural hill so square upon the top , and with such projections like towers , ' he said . That is my opinion , ' I answered . It looks to me like a fort , or the ruins of one . ' It does indeed , ' said Fairfax in a low tone ; suppose we pull away from this ? ' I should like to know first if it is a fort , ' I replied . If you will agree to it , we will pull close in and examine it . ' I am agreed , ' answered Fairfax , taking an oar , while I pulled in the anchor . We pulled in close to the shore and then by the aid of the glass , we clearly made it out to be the ruins either of a fort or convent . All was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have landed but for our former experiences in that way , and for some mysterious sounds heard among the trees ; and satisfied for the present , with our scrutiny , again pulled out and continued our course up the river . Twice during the next hour we heard howlings upon the land , and on each occasion we congratulated ourselves on not having landed .  --  At length the morning broke , upon us , and as the light increased we scanned the river both up and down , but could see nothing . On shore we discovered three huts and an enclosure , which , when the sun fairly rose and lighted up the scene , we saw was filled with several hundreds of wild cattle . We examined at a mile distant , this place of curiosity ; and not without emotions of pleasure ; for anything like signs of human habitation were a relief to the barren monotony of the shores we had been coasting . We were soon discovered , and six or seven men came out and gazed after us ; but as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not apprehend any danger from them . We now breakfasted , and by the time we had done had lost sight of the huts , and had abreast of us only the sloping pampas , vast plains , receding from the river and extending to the base of the Andes , hundreds of leagues , the only inhabitants hunters ( quachos ) whose occupation is the chase and slaugh-ter of the countless herds of wild cattle that roam over the boundless plains . About noon , the sun pouring down excessive heat upon our heads . we resolved to arm ourselves , and go into a shady cove and bathe and refresh ourselves under the trees . We therefore , steered in shore , and run the boat upon the beach . We had previously surveyed the place , without sign of panther , anaconda or Portuguese . We stepped ashore each armed with a brace of pistols , and our cutlasses , and as a first precaution , marched together to the ridge top to have a look round to see that no enemy was in the neighborhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank we could see nothing on pampa or river , brute or human , and secure in our possession of the spot , we descended to the skiff and undressed ourselves to bathe . Our bath was truly refreshing to us , and greatly invigorated us . We how took a lunch of beef and ale , and then went under a tree where the grass and shade were inviting . There we sat , pistol in hand , and our cutlasses lying by our sides upon the grass , enjoying the coolness of the spot ; such a contrast as it was with our former situation in the skiff upon the river , the boat acting as it were , as a focus to collect and condense upon us all the sun 's rays . We now really enjoyed ourselves , and laughed and told jokes , and talked about old Bedrick 's consternation and wrath when the information of our departure was communicated to him . We felt that we had done ' the old gentleman fairly and justly , and reflection upon our present course always gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet achieved our escape . We were but little more than two-thirds of the way , and we had yet dangers to pass ere we should rerch our desttnation . At any moment we might fall into peril which would menace both our liberties and lives . Yet we had now , as it were , got habituated to the excitement , and began to take everything coolly and easily . Our successes thus far had inspired us with confidence , and familiarity with our situation had rendered us less nervous in the presence of difficulties . Experience had increased in us that coolness and courage which is necessary to the successful result of any enterprize , and especially one of the kind we had undertaken . Tempted by the shade and agreeable change from the narrow limits of the skiff , which the reader will remember was an ordinary whale-boat eighteen feet in length , we remained three hours reposing . Fairfax fell asleep , and Radsworth , for fear of what might happen , climbed into a tree , and tying himself to a limb also gave himself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands clasped over the top of his head , and stretched out with the most comfortable ease of posture , his eyes half-closed . I felt more like walking about and exercising my limbs ; and so taking a pistol in one hand and my cutlass in the other , I took a run up the bank . Upon reaching the top , seeing another ridge or mound farther off , I resolved that I would go and ascend it , supposing that from its summit I should see Colonia.  --  Warily stepping along , as it expecting enemies on every quarter , I crossed the level space to the mound , the distance being about a quarter of a mile . I ascended it and then looked around me . On two sides of me , North and West , stretched the interminable pampas like a sea . Before me was the ocean-like river , whose opposite shore we had not yet seen . Following the coast on the side upon which we had landed , I beheld , to my great joy , about ten miles off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . They were scarcely visible but were not to be mistaken . I was about to hasten down to my companions with the news , when I discovered about a mile distant a party of horsemen , some thirty in number . They were galloping along a sort of road that led to the river , and moving in a direction that would bring them near the mound . At first I thought they were hunters , but the flashing of steel in the sun , and the scarlet color of many of their dresses , showed me that they were cavalry ; perhaps either a body of Quacho cavalry going to join the Patriot army , or of Brazilian cavalry making a sortie from Colonia for forage . In the uncertainty which enveloped their true character , it was only left for us to act as if they were toes . If I could have known them to be Patriot cavalry I would have awaited their coming , and I have no doubt my companions as well as myself would have joined them at a moment 's notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach nigh enough for this purpose , they might prove to be enemies and then it would be too late for me to escape . I therefore resolved to return without delay and alarm my companions and take to our boat . I could not descend the mount , however , without being seen ; but to make myself as little conspicuous as possible , I bent double and started on a run down and across the level space to the river . In the meanwhile , the horsemen were galloping on at the same rapid rate at which they were going when I discovered them , and so were within half a mile of me when I crossed the plain in full view of them . They saw me , and I beheld three or four of the foremost spur forward and heard them shout . I did not wait to honor their notice of me , but straightening my body , I flew over the ground like the wind and dashed down the steep bank , shouting to the ears of my startled comrades . The Portuguese ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the boat and let us pull for our lives . ' I had no cause to repeat my warning . The two under the tree springing to their feet grasped their weapons and sprang for the boat . I reached it at the same moment , and we launched it with a single effort . We sprang into it , when looking round I missed Radsworth . He was still struggling in the tree to release himself , and his handkerchief having got into a hard knot in his haste , he was fairly caught . For Heaven 's sake do n't leave me here ! ' he cried . Leave him ! The bare idea made our cheeks tingle . We would have stood by him at all odds . I was just about to spring ashore and cut him down with my cutlass , when he severed it with a clasp knife , and dropped to the ground . He did not take many seconds in reaching the boat and bounding into it . We took our oars and using them as poles , pushed swiftly away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to row like heroes . Our skiff fairly jumped . It seemed to be quite as much frightened as ourselves , and did its best to show the enemy a clean pair of heels . CHAPTER XVII . Colonia . We had got about eighty yards from the shore , and were pulling away with all our might to widen the distance , when we heard the trampling of horses , and the next moment appeared two of the mounted troop upon the verge of the ridge . They wore scarlet jackets , white trowsers , and broad-brimmed straw hats , boldly looped up in front .  --  Carbines were slung at their backs , and long curved swords swung at their belts . Their saddles were without holsters , their belt answering the purpose by holding a formidable brace of pistols . Upon reaching the bank and discovering us pulling away in the boat for dear life , they set up a shout , made signals to the rest of their company who were not yet come up in sight , and then dashed down the bank at a mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance  --  a fiery-looking , dark-complexioned fellow , with long black locks and moustache  --  called to us in Spanish to stop . We paid no attention to him , but rowed the faster ; he , therefore , spurred into the water at huge leaps , for it was shoal for many yards from the shore , and at the same time discharged a pistol . His comrades followed him , unslinging their carbines as they rode , and the ridge was at the same moment filled with the remainder of the troop . Two or three of them followed the leading ones , but the rest remained quietly seated in their saddles looking at the scene . The shot from the pistol did not reach us , for we saw it plainly strike and spurt up the water twenty yards astern of us . As we were rowing our faces were of course turned towards the shore , so that we could see all that passed . Pull away , boys ! ' cried Fairfax ; pull like good fellows ! ' That fellow with the carbine will hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly , ' said I ; there he levels it !  --  now stoop all ! ' We bent ourselves forward as low as we could ; the carabine was discharged , and we distinctly heard the balls , at least half a dozen of them , whistling over and about us . We felt that it was becoming rather a ticklish affair , so far as we were concerned . We encouraged each other to row , but hardly had we raised ourselves and taken three strokes , when another carbine was levelled , and down we ducked . The shot must have fallen far short of us , or wide of us , for we heard no whistling . Now make her jump ! ' cried Bedrick ; in a few moments we will get out of their reach . ' But this did not seem likely : two of the horsemen , after having galloped their horses in as far as they were able to advance in this manner , pressed them forward to swimming , and they came on at such a rate that I verily believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took up a pistol and fired at them ; this set a good example to the rest , and in three seconds we had given them the contents of eight pistols . As we fired with one hand we rowed with the other , and so we kept increasing our distance . At this reception the two horsemen reined up , and began to swim back towards the shore , while the rest discharged a volley over their heads at us . Nearly every shot fell short except one , which dropped harmlessly into the boat as if it had been thrown from the hand , the force being spent by the distance it had come . I picked it up ; it was quite warm , and in size as large as four common musket balls ; it was made of iron , not of lead , and roughly enough cast at that . We soon gained a safe distance from our foes , and then lay upon our oars to rest , and gaze back upon the horsemen . They continued to fire every now and then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole party rode out of sight over the ridge , and we saw no more of them . They afterwards were proved to be a party of Patriot cavalry going to join Llavelleja before the walls of Montevideo , and having despatches to him from the Buenos Ayrean Congress . But our ignorance of their character , and their ignorance of our friendly wishes , made us , meeting as we did , foes of course . They supposed us to be Brazilian spies , and we naturally took them for Brazilian cavalry , seeing them so near Colonia . That was a close brush , boys , ' said I , as the last horseman disappeared . I was pretty sure one of us was booked that time for the land of Nod , ' said Bedrick . I believe , ' remarked Radsworth , instinctively flinching as he spoke , that if I had n't stooped as I did , one of the bullets would have gone through my head  --  it seemed to singe my ear-locks as it was . ' The fellows aimed well , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they carry ; I would as lief be hit by a four pound shot as one of them  --  just look at this ! ' and he exhibited the ball which had come on board . It is my opinion , ' said Bedrick , that these fellows were Patriots . ' But Patriot or Portuguese , ' answered Fairfax , we were all the same to them . We did right in keeping out of their way ; before we could have assured them of our friendly feelings , we might all have had our throats cut . There is no trusting a party like that here in this desert plain . ' We perfectly agreed with him , and were quite satisfied at our escape , whatever they might be . There was some wind , and we spread our sail to woo it . It was about three o'clock in the afternoon , and although Colonia was not in view from the boat , I pointed out its direction , and proposed that we should stand on until we came in sight of it , and then strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated ourselves in the stern , reloading our pistols and talking over our recent escape . Bedrick was strongly of the opinion that we could not too soon get away from this shore , for he firmly believed that some of the three horsemen wounded would go back to Colonia and have a gun-boat sent out to intercept us . We discussed the probability , and finally came to the conclusion that they would not take so much trouble about us . The shores now appeared more pleasing to the eye . In the distance were cultivated spots and farms , and we observed many white dwellings of the inhabitants . The houses were square , with flat roofs , and usually but one story high . We could see also , as we glided along , persons in the fields and men on horseback ; but as we kept out full a mile from the land , we did not apprehend any danger . We discovered , moreover , several small boats at one place where a dozen houses were congregated ; but we paid them no other regard than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one hour before sunset , a distant projection of land over which had hung a haze , gradually resolved itself into the battlements of Colonia , about two leagues off . We now stood on with caution ; two of the party were for putting the helm up , and striking straight across for Buenos Ayres , but Fairfax and I opposed it , wishing to have a good view of the place before turning aside from it . The others yielded , and we kept on until within about four miles , when we were able to discern , rising over the battlements , the masts of several vessels . We suspected that they were Brazilian vessels of war , and with the spy-glass we made out distinctly the brilliant flag of the Emperor , one of the most gorgeous flags in the world . We now concluded that it was best to be wary . The wind , which had been getting light , now died away as usual towards sunset , and we took down our mast and resumed our oars . With the glass we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were fishing , and it occurred to us that we might approach much nearer , so as to get a view of the vessels in the port , reflecting that our report would be useful to Admiral Brown on the other side . This step , however , was warmly opposed ; but finally the objections were overruled , and we rowed on till we came within two miles of the fort and town . We then pulled out so as to open the harbor , and were enabled to look in . With the aid of the glass we counted three brigs of war , five schooners , and nine or ten lugger-rigged gun-boats . The fort was a low fortification on a point of the shore , and the harbor a snug cove , around which were a few farm houses ; but near the fort was quite a large collection of houses , with a tower and one or two turrets , a long high wall with embrasures , and a battery with cannon . We could see the soldiers upon them , and also persons taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town did not probably contain more than five or six hundred inhabitants . The country was not elevated , but was pleasant to the eye . Very few trees were visible , and these , like all of those on the pampas , of stunted growth . We took our observations at the distance of about two miles , the atmosphere clear , and the sun brightly illumining the landscape . I think if we had twenty whale boats , with ten Yankees in each , ' said Radsworth , we might take the town , vessels and all . ' I hope Brown will try it , ' observed Fairfax with animation . What a fine opportunity for him to run over in the night and surprise the place ! They do n't seem to have a single vessel off the port on the look-out to guard against it . ' I am not so sure of that , boys , ' said I , as I caught sight of a large brig coming up the river . They all uttered an exclamation of surprise on discovering her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by us so lately for the reason that our attention had been so intently fixed upon the town .  --  She had the green and gold Brazilian flag flying and flashing in the light of the setting sun . Our first movement was to take to our oars and pull out into the river , so as to get an offing and elude her as night came on . Whether she saw us or not we did not know , nor did we care to wait to ascertain . Bedrick had suggested the idea that she might be just from Montevideo with knowledge of our escape , and perhaps with orders to look us up . This conjecture gave us strength and energy . Colonia was behind us , and the brig on the larboard beam standing straight for us , but we pull ed on , wishing for night . We could say with Wellington at Waterloo , Oh that Blucher or night were come ! ' only that we would substitute Brown ' the Admiral , for Blucher , the General . We had witnessed some quick movements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to our mind a suspicious appearance , else we should have kept on straight past the mouth of the harbor , instead of standing straight across , which course would bring the brig nearer to us each instant until we had the offing . The sun set . Colonia was four miles astern , and the brig two miles to leeward . She has not changed her course , ' said I watching her . She steers as at the first , direct for Colonia . I do n't think she even suspects us ! ' Scarcely were the words out of my mouth , when a flash lightened from her bows , dash , dash , dash ! came a shot along the surface of the water within a hundred rods on our starboard hand , and plunged beneath it about two hundred yards ahead of us . The brig at the same instant kept away from us . We are in for it now , ' said I , after the first surprise at this salutation was over . What shall be done ? ' said Radsworth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it only with herself , ' said Bedrick . The wind is full a mile ahead of her , ' cried I. See it ripple . It will reach us in a few minutes , and then let us up sail , and scud and row at the same time ! ' In a few minutes we may be sunk , ' said Bedrick . I move that we pull back into Colonia . Seeing us turn they will cease firing , supposing they have mistaken us ; for I have not the least doubt but they have orders respecting us ! ' This proposition was not carried . We resolved to do our best with our oars till the wind came , and then add the sail ; and strongly did we bend to the pliant sweeps making the water sing under our bows . CHAPTER XVIII . The Passage Across . The brig kept on for a few minutes longer in ominous silence , and then banged away at us again . The shot roared above us , and made our hearts to cease beating for full half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for lost time . Our hopes of escape were , as on a previous occasion , in the coming night , which in that latitude rapidly follows sunset . A small object like our boat is hard to hit at two miles ' distance , ' said I , straining my oar and snapping it in two as I spoke . This was a severe accident to us in this dilemma ; but most fortunately the wind struck us at this very moment . Our sail was hoisted in an instant , and as the breeze was of full five knot force we gave a glad hurrah and bounded merrily before it . We still plied the three oars , one of us being at the helm to steer . Night fell upon us swiftly and we began to feel that if we could escape being hit for twenty minutes more , we should be hidden by the darkness from their view . But twenty minutes with a brig firing upon one is a long time . We trusted through the haziness of twilight and the smallness of our boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the brig only gave new energy to our efforts , and as none of the shot came very near us , we began to be indifferent to the firing , and cracked more than one joke upon the bad powder and unskillful gunnery of the Brazilians . At length the brig was hidden from us by the increasing night , and of course we were invisible to her . We therefore resolved to outwit her as we had done the other vessel two days before , by tacking and doubling on our course . We , therefore , put about and run towards Colonia , supposing the brig , if she was after us , would stand on as we had last seen her steering . We run along landward on our larboard tack for about half an hour , and were just about preparing to go about to cross the river , supposing we had eluded the brig , when suddenly she appeared down directly towards us . At first we could scarcely believe our eyes , she came upon us out of the darkness so unexpectedly . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck , and not two cables ' length from us . We were taken by surprise , but not disconcerted . The mast was struck instantly , and in the impulse of the moment , I cried , Overboard and hang on to the sides ! ' To escape was impossible . She would inevitably pass within forty feet of us . To escape being discovered seemed impossible . In an instant we were in the water and concealed by the starboard side of the skiff from the brig 's deck . We were immersed up to our chins , and supporting ourselves by the gunwale of the boat . We could not see the brig as she came on , except by tipping down the boat , so we knew we could not be seen ; and it the boat was discovered we hoped they would pass it as a drift-boat , and not take the trouble to heave to for it . This was the only chance of escape . We had not been thirty seconds in the water , when the brig came so near that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Nearer and nearer she came , moving at about six or seven knots , and she was within sixty feet of us . For a moment we apprehended that she would pass directly over us , and had spoken to warn each other to dive deep if she should . She came on and surged by within seven fathoms of us , the bow swell of our advance lifting us and our skiff upon its roll . We could count distinctly her ports as she passed by and hear the men talking between decks distinctly enough to understand that the language was Portuguese . She passed us , and the stern light burning in her cabin window flashed upon our eyes . At the same instant , just as we were about to congratulate ourselves upon our escape , we saw an officer spring upon the taffrail and the next moment call out in Portuguese , A boat adrift ! See what it is ! ' It is neither of the brig 's boats , ' we heard answered by some one in the gang way . Whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutter and send for it ! ' said the first speaker . We thought our time had now come without remedy . But in danger one 's wits are always active . Presence of mind and invention are given us by Providence as weapons in dangers , as the quills are bestowed upon the fretful porcupine . ' In danger , men 's energies and coolness always rises to a level with his peril . As the imminency increases , so does firmness and wits meet it and master it . We saw that it would take them at least five minutes to bring the brig to and get down and man a boat . The brig , in the meantime , would be forging to leeward , while our own little craft would be stationary . By the time a boat can reach us , ' was our rapid decision as we spoke with each other , the brig will be full half a mile to leeward .  --  Let us get in , ' said we unanimously , up sail and stick her nose right into the wind 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant , dripping like fish , we had clambered again into the skiff , and the mast was at once raised , the main sheet drawn aft , and the bows of the skiff stuck right into the eye of the wind . ' The brig was by this time far to leeward . She had laid her main top-sail aback , and we could hear the creaking of blocks as she lowered down her cutter . But every instant of time thus occupied by them we were widening our distance from the brig , while the latter was of necessity drifting to leeward . We could lay a point and a half closer to the wind than a large vessel , and in the superior ability of our little bark , we hoped to get away from them . We trimmed our boat with the nicest precaution and fairly eat into the wind right away from the brig . One had the helm , another kept a sharp look-out for the flash to tell us when to dodge , while the other two rowed to help along her sail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brig was scarcely visible to leeward . By laying our ears down close to the water , we could distinctly hear the noise of the oars of the pursuing boat , rattling in the row-locks . But as they were invisible to us , we knew we were equally so to them . Steadily we worked our way to windward . Gradually the brig faded from sight , and the sounds of the distant oars of the cutter grew fainter , until they were no longer to be heard . We did not , however , speak to begin to congratulate ourselves .  --  We had not yet fairly insured our safety , and we chose to be sure of it , ere we gave free vent to our joy . At length hearing no more of the enemy , we were partly well convinced of our security , and began to express to one another our glad emotions . We had not before come so near capture . It was now proposed to bear away and steer directly across to Buenos Ayres , which was thirty miles distant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , it being now about ten . The helm was accordingly put up , the sheet eased off , and the bows of the skiff set direct for Buenos Ayres , the bearings of which we took by compass , which we were enabled to examine by means of a dark lantern we had brought with us . The shores of Colonia gradually faded from view , and nothing but night and its stars with the wave-tossed water was about us . Merrily we danced on , and although we were so thoroughly wet by our bath , we were in great spirits , and sang in full chorus the Canadian boat-song . As singing made us dry ( I do not mean outside ) we opened the locker and cracked a bottle of champagne . We had but one more remaining , which we resolved to open only when we should come in sight of Buenos Ayres . The excitement of our recent escape , our wet clothes , in which , if we slept we feared we should take cold , and the prospect of shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no watch below . ' We sat together talking over the past , and discussing the future . What we were to do when we reached Buenos Ayres , neither of us were very decided . Fairfax and Bedrick thought of trying to get a clerkship , and if unable to join Brown 's squadron . Radsworth and I thought of Llavelleja and his brave army , and looked to distinction and fame under his banner ; our purpose being to join some party going to reinforce him and offer to him our services . But in the main we were to be governed most by circumstances . We resolved to do whatever fortune had for us to perform . The little skiff danced merrily over the white capped waves . As we talked over our affairs , and about two in the morning , while we were about preparing to look out ahead for the Buenos Ayrean shore , Bedrick suddenly cried out , Land ho ! ' We looked eagerly forward , and saw the dark mass of the Southern shore just perceptible in the darkness . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that we were now safe ; that we were now beyond the reach of Portuguese cruisers and under the protection of the Patriot flag . We now eagerly watched the shore towards which our bark was bounding , anxious to make out the outlines of the city , its towers , domes and fortification . We stood in until we could discover that there was a forest before us , instead of a city ; and in vain our eyes sought through the gloom of night for the signs of human habitation . We ran in within a quarter of a mile of the shore , and then coming to , gazed with blank surprise upon the dark forest which stretched along the bank . This is odd , ' said I. We have missed the city and fallen upon the land either above or below it . ' Below it , most likely , ' said Fairfax in a disappointed tone ; the current has drifted us below it . ' We ought to have calculated for that , ' said Radsworth . We steered straight for the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course we should fetch it . But not making allowance for the lee-way of the river 's current , we have struck the land I dare say a dozen miles below the city . ' I should n't be surprised if we had , ' was the general response . We shall know where we are by daylight , ' said Bedrick . So , fellows , suppose we down the sail , anchor , and all hands go to sleep till morning . ' We anchored and unshipped the mast , and Bedrick and Fairfax went to sleep ; but I was too watchful and also too anxious to get the first sight of the shore by dawn to lay down . So Radsworth and I chatted and watched for the day . At length it began to dawn , and slowly as the darkness receded , the outline and aspect of the shore were apparent . We now awoke our friends and began to survey our position as the morning slowly threw light upon it . The shore was one unbroken forest for miles up and down the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us . When the sun rose , we could see that this inlet wound into the land through the forest . We resolved to explore it . So raising the keeleg we took our oars and rowed shoreward and entered the mouth of the inlet . It was deep and canal-like in its appearance , and very serpentine . We cocked our pistols and laying them by our sides , pulled steadily on for five or six minutes , when , suddenly in turning a bend , we came in sight of the masts of two brigs and three schooners appearing over the top of the trees not a quarter of a mile distant . We stopped rowing at once and gazed upon this sight with doubts and misgivings . Not knowing where we were , we were not sure they were not Brazilian vessels . We examined their yards and rig , and at length Fairfax roundly swore that one of the brigs was a Yankee . The vessels seemed to be lying in another bend of the creek ; and what they could be doing up there looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we could get no information by talking , we resolved to row carefully on until we came in sight of them , when we should be able to judge by their appearance of their country ; and besides we expected to be able to see the colors , which probably flying from the peak could not be seen by us where we were . So we pulled on , but with the wariness of a party about to surprise an enemy . CHAPTER XXI . The Arrival at Buenos Ayres . After rowing on about five minutes and almost in a circle , the creek was so tortuous , we opened all at once upon an extensive natural basin several acres in extent , in which were anchored five vessels , three schooners and two brigs . At the peak of one of the brigs , a handsome bright-sided vessel , floated the Yankeestars and stripes ! As soon as we saw this flag we sprung upon our feet , took off our caps and swinging them above our heads gave three hearty cheers . We then seized our oars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we rowed on that the basin was nearly round and on one side stood a wretched looking village of huts mostly built of reeds and mud . Our shouts had drawn to the side of the brig the mate and several of the crew , who looked at us with no little surprise and curiosity as we came near . Without a word we pulled under the gangway ladder , and securing our boat , clambered one after another upon deck . The mate looked as if he was undecided whether to receive us as friends or buccaneers . I approached him and said : We are four Americans who have escaped from Monte Video , and seeing your vessel , have come on board to learn where we are and also have the satisfaction of being once more under our country 's flag . ' When I had spoken these words the mate , a fine , clever , whole-hearted Marble- head man , grasped my hand and said he was very glad to see us . He shook hands with all round , and then inviting us down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast for four , and see , ' he added , that you get double allowance , for these young gentleman must be hungry ! ' We now told him our story , to which he listened with very great interest . He then told us that we were in the port of Ensenaca , thirty miles below Buenos Ayres by water , but only eighteen by land , and that we had been borne down by the strong current instead of making that port as we had intended to do . He said the brig was the Caroline Augusta , commanded by Captain Reed of Boston , son of the celebrated High Constable Reed . The Captain , he continued , was then up to the city ( Buenos Ayres ) where he was transacting business with his merchants . We had a capital breakfast and did full justice to the mate 's double allowance . ' After we had finished our meal we all went on deck and began to hold a consultation as to our further movements . Bedrick and Fairfax were for leaving the boat at Ensenaca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the mate said they could hire a horse for a dollar each , and a guide to show them the way and bring the horses back . Finally , completely tired of the skiff , Bedrick and Fairfax resolved to quit it and try the land route . We sha n't get to the city before to-morrow morning , if we do then , ' argued Fairfax , and on horseback we will be less than two hours going ! ' Radsworth and I did not like to leave the skiff and give up before we had reached the city in her . As we were equally divided , it was finally settled that they should go up by land , and we by water ; that they would find lodgings for us by the time we come and also meet us at the quay . We all went on shore to see our friends off . The place where we landed was a wretched collection of huts thatched with straw and arranged with some attempt at the regularity of a single street . There was one principal shanty around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the pulpesia orrum-shop of the place . Near the door were several half-naked quachos , who upon seeing our approach , came running towards us , crying out each louder than the other , Caballo , senores ? tendran ustedes , caballos ? ' ( will you have horses , gentlemen ? ) Fairfax answered in his Spanish that he would like to have two horses to take him to Buenos Ayres . Each fellow clamoured for the precedence , and at length a bargain was struck with one of them for the use of himself and horses at a dollar and a half . In a little while he brought up two horses with old tattered Spanish saddles strapped upon theirbacks , the pummel half a foot high . The horses were small , fierce looking animals with wild eyes , uncombed manes and fet-locks streaming with hair like a trooper 's helmet . They had ropes for bridles . Fairfax mounted one of them , though with some misgivings , and Bedrick the other . Their owner then vaulted upon the back of a third , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three horses with their riders dashed off at a furiousrate . The last we saw of our two friends for that day was as they were disappearing in a distant jungle , their heads level with their horses necks , around which they were clinging as if their necks depended on their hold . We were very well satisfied with our choice of the skiff , after witnessing this feat of horsemanship and being told that the three horses would probably keep up the same speed till they reached the city or pitched over their own heads . And if they tumble down with them , ' I asked of one of the bystanders , and break their necks ? ' They take a fresh horse at the first rancho , ' was the quiet reply of the man who never seemed to think that the rider might happen to get his neck broke as well as the horse . The mate then informed us that horses were scarcely of any value there . That fine ones could be bought for five and ten dollars ; that they were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , when they went any distance , till they broke down , when they would transfer the saddle to another . The plains or pampas , he added , which every where surrounded the city of Buenos Ayres , and which from the vessel stretched like a wide ocean of grass before the vision , are filled with droves of horses and cattle , thousands and thousands of which are killed , especially the latter , only for their hides . The bee when it is killed to preserve is hung up in pieces in the air and dried ; for such is the purity of the atmosphere , that nothing taints or putrifies . In this manner is made all the jerk-beef , such quantities of which are exported from Buenos Ayres , the meaning of which is in English , Good Air ! ' We returned on board the brig and passed two or three hours very pleasantly , and then prepared to resume our voyage in the skiff . After taking a lunch we got into it once more , and with the hearty farewells of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were soon again on the main river . As the wind was fair , though light , we hoisted our sail and seating ourselves in the stern let the skiff run along by the shore at about two and a half miles an hour .  --  We kept near the land , for the mate had told us that two days before he had seen from the main-top of the brig a large Brazilian schooner of war standing up the river within four miles of the shore . He said that she kept on her course about a league up the river , and then hauled her wind and stood over towards Colonia.  --  This , we at once decided , must have been the vessel from which we had had such a narrow escape off Colonia . The shores along which we sailed were strait and presented to the eye neither beauty nor variety , Now and then a few stunted peach trees would relieve the monotonous level line of the banks , and sometimes they would be broken by a ravine . For twenty miles there was but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The night at length gathered about us when we were within about three or four leagues of the city , though we could not see it . We sailed on by the star-light keeping about half a mile from the shore . The wind was still very light so that our progress was slow . At length we were startled and rejoiced to hear the barking of a dog upon the land . We could see nothing but knew we must be in the vicinity of some dwelling . By our calculation , we ought to have been within three miles of the city . We kept on when gradually the banks of the river carved so as to show ahead of us two or three miles the dark outlines of domes , towers and ranges of roofs  --  the whole profile , though indistinct , of a large city . Our joy now was boundless . We clapped our hands and hurraed . As we drew nearer we could see lights sparkling in the distance , and soon after the deep tone of the cathedral bell tolling for midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to us the mouth of a creek in which we saw several small vessels ; and with the glass I could make out four or five miles off in the outer roads , several square-rigged vessels at anchor . We knew they were merchantmen from what the mate had told us . They were anchored there on account of the shoal water which would not allow vessels of any size to approach nearer than a league and a half of the town All cargo was landed in lighters . Each moment we drew nearer the city , making out more distinctly in the star-light , its imposing outline  --  for to the eye Buenos Ayres is one of the most striking and noble looking cities in South America . At length the barking of dogs fell upon our ears in deepmouthed baying , as if hundreds were engaged in this canine pastime . When we judged we were about a third of a mile from the shore and were looking to see where we should find the quay , we suddenly found ourselves aground . Upon trying the depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely eighteen inches any where within our reach , and close along side it was scarcely a foot . Supposing that we had run upon a shoal , we tried to push off , but finding ourselves fast we concluded to lay there quietly till morning . We , therefore , threw over our small anchor , and then lowering our sail made as good a bed of it in the bottom of the boat as we could , and then prepared to turn in and sleep , both of us , till day light should reveal to us our true position . In a few minutes we were both snugly ensconced in the bottom of the skiff . But it was sometime before I could get to sleep .  --  The incessant baying , yelping , howling , of at least twenty thousand dogs ( for there are one hundred thousand inhabitants and at least a dog to every five ) kept me awake . I had never listened to such an uproar not even in Monte Video . They made night hideous , and I began to reflect upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of such a ferocious horde as doubtless prowled in every street and thronged the landing . At one time a band of them were heard scouring along the shore with a terrific chorus of howls , and swept on till their voices were lost among the miscellaneous yelping and baying of the main body . Doubtless they were in pursuit of some miserable horse or wretched cow . At intervals the deep tolling of a bell would reach my ear , awakening strange sensations . At every new sound I would raise my head and look over the edge of the boat to reconnoitre . At length gradually overcome with fatigue and watching , I sunk into a deep sleep from which I was awakened by the splashing of water and loud shouts . Radsworth and I both sprung to our feet . It was broad day . The sun had just risen and was shining brightly upon the domes and towers of the city . I recollect my impression of this first sight of it . It seemed to me the most magnificent place on earth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty towers with turrets innumerable and vast ranges of battlemented roofs . But we had no time to admire the novelty of the scene . Close at hand , the nearest not twenty yards from us , were galloping and splashing towards us about a score of wild-looking fellows , mounted on horses wilder looking , if possible , than their riders . CHAPTER XXII . The Reception . We were at a loss to understand what this movement , which seemed so hostile in its bearing , could mean . We thought that we were about to be attacked and put to the sword , being probably mistaken for Brazilians . No sooner did the idea seize upon our minds than we resolved to sell our lives as dearly as possible . We each seized a pistol and cutlass and stood upon the defensive . No sooner did these wild looking fellows witness these demonstrations on our part than the foremost drew rein and came to a full stop . The others did the same , and then they commenced shouting at us and making the wildest gestures . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , then waving his hand , point to his crupper and make his horse curvet and whirl round in the foaming water like a top . We did n't understand their manoeuvres and maintained our warattitude . At length one of them in a moment of comparative stillness , for what with the dashing of the water by their horses ' hoofs , and their uproar of voices , there was the utmost confusion prevailing , one of them called out in Spanish Senores , somos amigos . ( We are friends . ) We have come to ask you to ride ashore on the backs of our horses . We charge you only two reales apiece . ' As I was able to understand him , our fears of being massacred as Brazilians at once subsided ; and when we come to look at the great distance we were grounded from the shore , it seemed to us that the only way we could get to land would be by mounting a horse . They are Buenosayrean Hackmen , ' said Radsworth . Yes , ' I answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come along side , ' said I to the man , you and another , and we will talk with you . ' Two of them came galloping up , splashing us with water like a shower of rain . They looked like half-bred Indians , with coal-black hair worn long upon their shoulders . One of them had a broad straw hat upon his head , the other wore a red cap . Both of them had dirty scarlet blankets with a hole in the centre to thrust their head through , and soiled white cotton drawers fringed around the bottom . Beneath the drawers their brawny brown legs were thrust naked .  --  One of the fellows had buckled on his bare heel an enormous iron spur with the rowel as large as a dollar . Its weight could not have been less than a pound . As we did not care about landing except with the boat at the quay , which we could no where see , we told them we would pay them to help us shove off our boat and show us where the Mole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles off around the bend of the shore , and that it would be a hard row , as there was no wind , to reach it . One of them proposed that we should ride ashore with them , and that when he had landed us he would come back to the boat and take it round to the landing-place for us . We consulted together upon this movement . The quacho had told us that the house of the American Charge de Affairs , Col. Forbes , to whom I had a letter , was not far from the place where we then were , and he would send a boy with us to show the way . We were quite tired of rowing and were anxious to get ashore and traverse the streets of the city that lay before us . The fellow looked honest , and at length we resolved to mount behind him and his friend and land where we were , leaving them to take the skiff round to the quay . There was nothing of any consequence to steal in the skiff . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few pounds of beef and bread . These they were welcome to . Our baggage we could pack away in our pockets . The chart , spy glass and compass were all that were of any value and these we took with us under our arms . Having got all ready we prepared to mount behind our guides . The process of backing up to the boat so that we could get on , was , after several trials , successfully accomplished , and almost before we knew it we found ourselves each astride the crupper and galloping on towards the shore dashing the water twenty feet around us . These fellows always ride as if they were sent for ! and in five minutes we were high , but not dry , upon the beach . Here we dismounted and paid over two reales and off went the fellows back again to look after our boat . We stood on the shore watching them until we saw four of them dismount and together push the skiff into deep water . Then one of them fastened the boat 's painter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse lady-fashion , began to whip him up and drag the skiff along through the water towards its destination . It was the coolest act I ever saw done , and to our minds , appeared from its novelty , infinitely ludicrous . After we had watched its progress for a few minutes and seen that it was likely to reach its destination , we began to ascend the bank to the town . The shores for two miles are in their natural state . Not a wharf obstructs the complete range of beach . The city streets all terminate at the range of the bank , which is about eighteen feet above the beach . Upon the sands we saw about a quarter of a mile below us , more than a hundred women washing clothes , piles of which lay around them , like heaps of soiled snow . Some of them were mid-knee in the water , others upon the beach . Children were playing round them or sporting in the waves . Up and down the shore there were footmen , quacho horsemen , galloping like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in countless numbers . The whole scene was one of life and novelty .  --  At the distance of five miles in front of the town , we saw several vessels at anchor all of which I supposed were merchantmen ; but on looking at them with a glass I recognized the Buenos Ayres flag , ( a rising sun , gold , on a blue ground ) flying at the mast head of several of the vessels , which I saw were armed . One of them was a sloop of war of twenty guns , and others were brigs and schooners . There were also two merchant ships with English and Danish colors , and one American . Colonia , which was beyond them on the other shore , thirty miles distant , I could not see with the glass , though from the towers of the city it is visible in a clear day . We now ascended the river bank and came upon the level on which the city stands . There was a space of about eighty yards between the verge of the bluff and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This space is a common ; and was covered with the bleaching skeletons of thousands of horses , dogs and cattle , and here and there , within range of our eye , were visible , groups of dogs tearing to pieces the flesh of dead animals . Yet , with all this , there was no stench perceptible , an evidence that Buenos Ayres well deserves its name , of pure , or Good Air . ' The houses did not front the river , but turned to it the high convent-like walls of their court-yards . The streets opened at once into the town between two angles of a court wall , or between two houses without windows on the lower floor . We passed up a street , preceded by a ragged Spanish lad , whom the quacho had given us for a guide . The houses were similar to those in Monte Video , with stuccoed fronts , doors wide enough for coaches , balconies projecting from the second story windows , many of which were barred , and in which stood flowers , and often a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After passing along four squares , we came to the heart of the city and into a street which is the Broadway of BuenosAyres . It was thronged with people , and had in it some very fine houses . At length we came to a stately orange colored edifice , of an appearance altogether imposing . Upon the flat roof was a flag staff on which to our great joy we beheld flying the stars and stripes of our native land . Who that has not been in a foreign land can understand the emotion with which the wanderer from home hails the sight of his country 's flag . It is an emotion enjoyed and appreciated only by the traveller . He alone can feel what it is . It is like the sight of an old friend , but the feeling is deeper than friendship ; and was mingled with a sort of pride and sense of patriotism that can not be explained to the home-stayer . Our pulses throbbed with joy , and a sense of security which we had not felt for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information communicated by the boy that , This is la casa del ministro Americano ! ' We entered the court-yard and crossing the patio where a fountain was playing amid the foliage of orange trees , we came to a spacious stair-way which conducted to a broad piazza facing the interior of the court . Here we saw a mulatto servant of whom we inquired for Col. Forbes , when a stout , fleshy gentleman of about fifty-five came out of a door opening upon the gallery , and looking at us , said in English , I suspect you are the two young Americans whom I have been expecting . Your friends reached here yesterday . ' We told him that we were the persons he supposed , when he shook us heartily by the hand , and invited us into his breakfast-room , where the table was already laid . We breakfasted with him , and at the same time related to him our adventures . He said that he had heard them briefly from Fairfax the day before , and that he was glad to have an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his praises of our courage and perseverance . After breakfast we were delighted with the appearance of Fairfax and Bedrick . We met as if we had been parted a year . They told us that their arrival had created the greatest excitement throughout the city , and that they had been constantly followed by crowds . There had been no intelligence from below for ten weeks , and the news brought by us was important to the merchants ; for we had with us , it will be recollected , a list of all the merchant vessels in the harbor . During the day hundreds of persons called upon us , particularly merchants , to learn the news , and many to gaze on us ; for we had all at once , to our surprise , risen into the rank of heroes . In the evening Commodore Brown called at the Charge 's to see us , and question us respecting the fleet in the harbor , and the state of naval matters , and to learn if we had heard of any contemplated movement of Admiral Lobo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that was valuable and received his thanks , and at the same time very flattering compliments upon our daring exploit , ' as he was pleased to call our expedition . The Commodore was dressed in full uniform , and was accompanied by two lieutenants and a midshipman . One of the lieutenants was a New Yorker , the other a Buenos Ayrean , and one of the handsomest looking men I ever saw . The midshipman was an English youth . Brown himself was an Irishman . He was formerly a lieutenant in the British navy , but for some reason , withdrew from it and attached himself to the fortunes of Buenos Ayres . He was about forty-five years of age , short and stout , with a fine , bold countenance , and looked every inch a sailor . He limped when he walked , from a wound received in the leg in some of the numerous sea-fights he had been engaged in . He was a brave and useful man in the Buenos Ayrean service , or indeed , the only person who could at such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in command of a corvette , four brigs , six or seven schooners , and about a dozen gun-boats , These he had been diligently fitting for service , and the fleet was now nearly ready . His greatest difficulty was in obtaining officers .  --  His intention was , as soon as he could obtain them , to weigh anchor and sail down the river , attack the Brazilian fleet , and try and break the blockade . After conversing aside for a few moments with the Charge , the Commodore turned to us , and said in a frank , hearty tone , Now , my young friends , as you do n't seem to be engaged yet in any particular business , how would you like a berth each in the navy . I am told you have some knowledge of the sea , as you must have , to have come the voyage here , but the Buenos Ayreans have hardly seen salt water . They make good soldiers , but are no sailors . If you will enter the navy , you shall each of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . Come , what do you say ? ' We told him in reply that we would talk over the subject together , and give him an answer the next morning . After he left , I showed to Col. Forbes my letter of introduction , which , in the hospitality of his reception , I had forgotten . He immediately manifested a new interest in my affairs ; and calling me into his library , advised me not to consent to enter the navy , as I should see nothing but hard knocks , no pay , and little credit . He talked with me a long time , and finally I gave up the idea , which I warmly seized upon , the moment Commodore Brown had suggested it . That night we discussed the matter , and Bedrick was the only one who resolved to join the navy . The next day he entered it and went on board . Fairfax in a day or two after , got a clerkship in the house of Frazier &; Co . Mr. Gilbert , a Connecticut gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to share the hospitalities of his house , which I did so , as Colonel Forbes had to leave for a few days for San Isidro up the river . CHAPTER XXIII . The Conclusion . The account of our adventures appeared in the Spanish paper El Gaceta Mercantil , and for some days we were quite lions . As we had nothing to do but to enjoy ourselves , and as every facility was afforded us for going into the best society , we passed our time for two or three weeks very pleasantly . But as I felt no disposition to intrude upon the hospitality of my friends , and had very little money , I began to look about me to find something to do ; but all business was suspended . Fairfax had by great good fortune , obtained a place in a commercial house . Bedrick had gone into the navy which in a few days afterwards weighed and stood down the river to fight the Brazilian squadron . Radsworth and I were without any prospect of doing any thing . We at length sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was divided . The skiff had safely been towed round to the mole ; and when the rumor that four Americanos ' had come up from Monte Video in it spread , hundreds flocked to see it , and for some days we shared with it equally , the honors of the popular admiration . But it is time that I bring the narrative of my famous South American expedition to a close , which I shall do in the present chapter ; as I have nothing more to write that has not been written before of the manners and customs of the people of Buenos Ayres . After remaining there a portion of the winter , and finding that I could do nothing to advantage on account of the war , I resolved to return to the United States in the brig Caroline Augusta which was to go out of the river in ballast . The Brazilians did not object to vessels going out of the river from Buenos Ayres . They would have been glad to have them all left before Brown had bought and converted any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nearly every vessel in the squadron under his command , having been a merchant vessel . The Commodore had offered Captain Read a large sum for his , but the Captain preferred returning home in her . The day at length came for sailing .  --  At nine o'clock in the morning I startedupon horseback for Ensenada , escorting with the Captain and two sailors , a cart containing stores and baggage . The cart was as rude as if it had been made before the flood . It had huge wooden wheels , and the body was made of poles and covered like a huge coop with a lattice of withes . It was drawn by an ox and a mule , driven by a half-breed Spaniard . It was the most grotesque affair in the way of a carriage , that ever came before my eyes . After various adventures , we reached Ensenada , and once more I stood on the deck of the brig which we had first seen on coming up from Monte Video . Radsworth had concluded to remain and go into the navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of them was a large Frenchman by the name of Ducosse , who had with him about four thousand dollars in gold and silver , and used to amuse himself on the passage in pouring it out on the cabin floor and counting it over . He said he had been a captain under Napoleon , and showed numerous scars in attestation of his having been in battle . The other passenger was from Wilmington , North Carolina , by the name of Bennett , a mere youth who had a brother as consul in some part of South America . Captain Reed himself proved to be one of the finest men in the world ; a thorough seaman , and as bold and fearless as a true man ought to be . His mate by the name of Durgin , was a large red-haired man , and a person of excellent temper . He was also an exemplary Christian . He had some mechanical genius , and on the passage invented a perpetual motion machine , on the principle of the repelling and attracting magnet . The day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was towed out of the creek into the river La Plata . As we were moving out , I heard the sound of heavy and distantcannonading , and going aloft , could see clouds of smoke rolling along the horizon in the direction of Colonia . The sound was like far off thunder . We understood afterwards that Brown was bombarding Colonia , and the Brazilians were playing their batteries in return . The result , however , was , that the Buenos Ayrean Commodore finally withdrew and stood down the river . After gaining deep water outside of the mouth of the creek of Ensenada , we called our boat aboard , made sail , and lay our course down the river . The afternoon of the next day we came in sight of the Brazilian fleet , and then I fearned for the first time that Captain Reed intended to run the gauntlet by .  --  He had got into Buenos Ayres by doing it when he came up , for he had reached Buenos Ayres after the blockade was established . In going up he had kept well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twenty hours , but escaped by his superior sailing and reached his port in safety . He was , therefore , as well as myself marked by them . He knew that , if he was recognized he would be stopped and taken into Monte Video , and perhaps imprisoned , besides losing his vessel . All the while going down , I had been feeling some misgivings , if I should happen to be recognized by the boarding officer , as I might be , for nearly every Brazilian officer had doubtless seen me in the soda shop . ' When , therefore , Captain Reed told me that he should drive by , I felt very much relieved . All vessels leaving a blockaded port are compelled not only to leave in ballast , but they are brought too and boarded , and strictly searched . Captain Reed was in ballast , but he resolved not to be boarded ; for he knew that his vessel would be recognized and seized . So as we approached the squadron , he said to me , I shall try your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between yonder brig of war and corvette . We shall , with this breeze get by ' em before they can harm us ! They will not suspect us either , till too late , for I shall run down and begin to clew up and take in my royals , as if I was going to come to ! ' The fleet lay , as before , stretched across the ocean-like river , in a line that diminished towards the horizon northand south . Directly before us and within three miles lay the brig and corvette , both at anchor . We steered directly for them , and as we approached the brig loosened her top-sails and hove short . When we got so near that we could see the men on deck and distinguish the officers , Captain Reed began to clew up , but still standing on . In this manner we passed the range of their guns and were pursuing our way astern of them before they suspected our intention . But they waked up , when they saw us point away our royals again , shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main-topsail , square away before the wind . Gun after gun was fired from both vessels , but we were too far out of range as they lay , for the shot to hit us ; and before they could wear so as to bring their broadsides to bear upon our stern , we were a mile and a half below them . We were not , however , out of danger . Below us about four miles , we saw a brig and schooner , cruising . These , hearing the firing , and seeing us pass as we did , bore up to intercept us . To avoid them we had to make a long stretch towards the shore , and having the wind of them , we got by in safety , though they bowled away at us at long shot , though without touching us . Indeed , we could not see where their balls hit the water . Monte Video with its fortress on its summit was now in full sight , and soon we opened the mouth of the harbor and had a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not get by so easily . The sound of the firing had started three vessels from the port and we saw them standing out . Again we had to manoeuvre , and try the speed of our brig . It was however impossible to pass without going very near one of them , and Captain Reed resolved to risk her fire . We stood boldly for her , and acted precisely as if we were going to speak her . Captain Reed with his trumpet in his hand , sprung into the main rigging and took his stand with his trumpet ready as if to hail . The fellows in the Brazilian brig were at their guns . Our royals were dropped , and topgallant sails clewed up as before . We seemed to them as we were dashing by , just about to round to under their stern , when we up helm , squared the yards , and went like an eagle on our way . In three minutes bang bang came the guns . Captain Reed ordered us all to lay on our knees . The shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails and pudded into our wood-work . As we were in a raking exposure , nothing but the bad gunnery of the Brazilians saved us from being greatly damaged . As it was , in twenty minutes we were out of reach of their shot , and dashing down the river at the rate of eight knots . At sun-down the distant towers and mount of the city faded into the haze of twilight , and in the morning we had passed Cape St. Mary 's , and were bounding over the blue ocean homeward . After seventy-six days we reached Boston . The last land we had seen had been Cape St. Rogue , and so true had been our reckoning , that we made Cape Cod within two hours of the time in which the Captain said we should . The sail up the harbor of islands , was most refreshing to the eye after be long at sea . The sight of land , of green trees , and verdant slopes , seemed to me more beautiful than any sight I have ever beheld . Coming from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has forgotten to reflect anything but the ship and the sea , the green earth looks like a paradise . The voyager wonders he never thought it so filled with beauty before . I found my friends well , and very much surprised to learn the result of my foreign mercantile expedition . When the merchants who had been referred to were called upon , they denied all knowledge of Bedrick 's intentions , supposing that he really meant to do what he professed to . As I had no redress , I took my experiences for my pains and turned my attention to making my fortune in my native country . I had been but three months at home , when one evening a person called at my father 's who was shown into the parlor . What was my surprise and joy at beholding Radsworth ! He had tried to get something to do after I left , but without success . He went on board of one of the brigs of war , the sight of which was enough for him . He was glad to get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had before entertained touching the affairs of the country . He soon took passage home in a ship that left in ballast . We sat and talked over our adventures till the small hours ' came round , and then parted . He is now , I believe , a merchant in Calais , Maine . In a few weeks afterwards , Hewitt returned from Monte Video , having embarked on board an American vessel for Boston . From him we learned the rage and fury of Bedrick at our departure , and how he informed the Captain-general where we had gone , who sent a gun-boat with twelve soldiers in it after us . Fortunately for us , and perhaps for them , they did n't overtake us . Hewitt has given up foreign travel and is now we believe , a very successful Dr. in Bangor . Bedrick , I have heard , had his leg shot off in an engagement under Brown . His subsequent career is unknown to me . His brother Edgar was engaged in smuggling goods between Monte Video and Buenos Ayres with his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . Ned was way-laid and assassinated . The old gentleman still resides in that country . Fairfax also remained there and has been a merchant of some property . He lives on a vacienda about twenty miles from Buenos Ayres , and is the owner of thousands of cattle . I see by the Gaceta Mercantil , that he was lately the interpreter between General Rosas and the American Commodore . Thus I , Paul Perril , finish the narrative of my adventures , and with many thanks , gentle reader , for your kind company , now take my courteous leave of you .
