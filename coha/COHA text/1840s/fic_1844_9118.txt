HOMER . OSSIAN . CHAUCER . EXTRACTS FROM A LECTURE ON POETRY , READ BEFORE THE CONCORD LYCEUM , NOVEMBER 29 , 1843 , BY HENRY D. THOREAU . HOMER . The wisest definition of poetry the poet will instantly prove false by setting aside its requisitions . We can therefore publish only our advertisement of it . There is no doubt that the loftiest written wisdom is rhymed or measured , is in form as well as substance poetry ; and a volume , which should contain the condensed wisdom of mankind , need not have one rhythmless line . Yet poetry , though the last and finest result , is a natural fruit . As naturally as the oak bears an acorn , and the vine a gourd , man bears a poem , either spoken or done . It is the chief and most memorable success , for history is but a prose narrative of poetic deeds . What else have the Hindoos , the Persians , the Babylonians , the Egyptians , done , that can be told ? It is the simplest relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth than science does , and the latter at a distance slowly mimics its style and methods . The poet sings how the blood flows in his veins . He performs his functions , and is so well that he needs such stimulus to sing only as plants to put forth leaves and blossoms . He would strive in vain to modulate the remote and transient music which he sometimes hears , since his song is a vital function like breathing , and an integral result like weight . It is not the overflowing of life but its subsidence rather , and is drawn from under the feet of the poet . It is enough if Homer but say the sun sets . He is as serene as nature , and we can hardly detect the enthusiasm of the bard . It is as if nature spoke . He presents to us the simplest pictures of human life , so that childhood itself can understand them , and the man must not think twice to appreciate his naturalness . Each reader discovers for himself , that succeeding poets have done little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as naturally bright , as gleams of sunlight in misty weather . Nature furnishes him not only with words , but with stereotyped lines and sentences from her mint . " As from the clouds appears the full moon , All shining , and then again it goes behind the shadowy clouds , So Hector , at one time appeared among the foremost , And at another in the rear , commanding ; and all with brass He shone , like to the lightning of gis-bearing Zeus . " He conveys the least information , even the hour of the day , with such magnificence , and vast expense of natural imagery , as if it were a message from the gods . " While it was dawn , and sacred day , was advancing , For that space the weapons of both flew fast , and the people fell ; But when now the woodcutter was preparing his morning meal In the recesses of the mountain , and had wearied his hands With cutting lofty trees , and satiety came to his mind , And the desire of sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their valor broke the phalanxes , Shouting to their companions from rank to rank . " When the army of the Trojans passed the night under arms , keeping watch lest the enemy should re-embark under cover of the dark , " They , thinking great things , upon the neutral ground of war , Sat all the night ; and many fires burned for them . As when in the heavens the stars round the bright moon Appear beautiful , and the air is without wind ; And all the heights , and the extreme summits , And the shady valleys appear ; and the shepherd rejoices in his heart So between the ships and the streams of Xanthus Appeared the fires of the Trojans before Ilium . " The " white-armed goddess Juno , " sent by the Father of gods and men for Iris and Apollo , " Went down the Idan mountains to far Olympus , As when the mind of a man , who has come over much earth , Sallies forth , and he reflects with rapid thoughts , There was I , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ august Juno hastening flew through the air , And came to high Olympus . " There are few books which are fit to be remembered in our wisest hours , but the Iliad is brightest in the serenest days , and imbodies still all the sunlight that fell on Asia Minor . No modern joy or ecstasy of ours can lower its height or dim its lustre ; but there it lies in the last of literature , as it were the earliest , latest production of the mind . The ruins of Egypt oppress and stifle us with their dust , foulness preserved in cassia and pitch , and swathed in linen ; the death of that which never lived . But the rays of Greek poetry struggle down to us , and mingle with the sunbeams of the recent day . The statue of Memnon is cast down , but the shaft of the Iliad still meets the sun in his rising . So too , no doubt , Homer had his Homer , and Orpheus his Orpheus , in the dim antiquity which preceded them . The mythological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only mythology of the moderns , the poem of mankind , interwoven so wonderfully with their astronomy , and matching in grandeur and harmony with the architecture of the Heavens themselves , seems to point to a time when a mightier genius inhabited the earth . But man is the great poet , and not Homer nor Shakspeare ; and our language itself , and the common arts of life are his work . Poetry is so universally true and independent of experience , that it does not need any particular biography to illustrate it , but we refer it sooner or later to some Orpheus or Linus , and after ages to the genius of humanity , and the gods themselves . OSSIAN . Footnote : 1Kb The genuine remains of Ossian , though of less fame and extent , are in many respects of the same stamp with the Iliad itself . He asserts the dignity of the bard no less than Homer , and in his era we hear of no other priest than he . It will not avail to call him a heathen because he personifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes did " worship the ghosts of their fathers , " their thin , airy , and unsubstantial forms ? we but worship the ghosts of our fathers in more substantial forms . We can not but respect the vigorous faith of those heathen , who sternly believed somewhat , and are inclined to say to the critics , who are offended by their superstitious rites , do n't interrupt these men 's prayers . As if we knew more about human life and a God , than the heathen and ancients . Does English theology contain the recent discoveries ? Ossian reminds us of the most refined and rudest eras , of Homer , Pindar , Isaiah , and the American Indian . In his poetry , as in Homer 's , only the simplest and most enduring features of humanity are seen , such essential parts of a man as Stonehenge exhibits of a temple ; we see the circles of stone , and the upright shaft alone . The phenomena of life acquire almost an unreal and gigantic size seen through his mists . Like all older and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lives of its heroes . They stand on the heath , between the stars and the earth , shrunk to the bones and sinews . The earth is a boundless plain for their deeds . They lead such a simple ; dry , and everlasting life , as hardly needs depart with the flesh , but is transmitted entire from age to age . There are but few objects to distract their sight , and their life is as unincumbered as the course of the stars they gaze at . " The wrathful kings , on cairns apart , Look forward from behind their shields , And mark the wandering stars , That brilliant westward move . " It does not cost much for these heroes to live . They want not much furniture . They are such forms of men only as can be seen afar through the mist , and have no costume nor dialect , but for language there is the tongue itself , and for costume there are always the skins of beasts and the bark of trees to be had . They live out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive storms and the spears of their foes , and perform a few heroic deeds , and then , " Mounds will answer questions of them , For many future years . " Blind and infirm , they spend the remnant of their days listening to the lays of the bards , and feeling the weapons which laid their enemies low , and when at length they die , by a convulsion of nature , the bard allows us a short misty glance into futurity , yet as clear , perchance , as their lives had been . When Mac-Roine was slain , " His soul departed to his warlike sires , To follow misty forms of boars , In tempestuous islands bleak . " The hero 's cairn is erected , and the bard sings a brief significant strain , which will suffice for epitaph and biography . " The weak will find his bow in the dwelling , The feeble will attempt to bend it . " Compared with this simple , fibrous life , our civilized history appears the chronicle of debility , of fashion , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real refinement in the poetry of the rudest era . It reminds him that civilization does but dress men . It makes shoes , but it does not toughen the soles of the feet . It makes cloth of finer texture , but it does not touch the skin . Inside the civilized man stands the savage still in the place of honor . We are those blue-eyed , yellow-haired Saxons , those slender , dark-haired Normans . The profession of the bard attracted more respect in those days from the importance attached to fame . It was his province to record the deeds of heroes . When Ossian hears the traditions of inferior bards , he exclaims , " I straightway seize the unfutile tales , And send them down in faithful verse . " His philosophy of life is expressed in the opening of the third Duan of Ca-Lodin . " Whence have sprung the things that are ? And whither roll the passing years ? Where does time conceal its two heads , In dense impenetrable gloom , Its surface marked with heroes ' deeds alone ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; As objects by the moon 's faint beams , Reflected from a distant lake . I see , indeed , the thunder-bolts of war , But there the unmighty joyless dwell , All those who send not down their deeds To far , succeeding times . " The ignoble warriors die and are forgotten ; " Strangers come to build a tower , And throw their ashes overhand ; Some rusted swords appear in dust ; One , bending forward , says , ' The arms belonged to heroes gone ; We never heard their praise in song . ' " The grandeur of the similes is another feature which characterizes great poetry . Ossian seems to speak a gigantic and universal language . The images and pictures occupy even much space in the landscape , as if they could be seen only from the sides of mountains , and plains with a wide horizon , or across arms of the sea . The machinery is so massive that it can not be less than natural . Oivana says to the spirit of her father , " Grey-haired Torkil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glidest away like receding ships . " So when the hosts of Fingal and Starne approach to battle , " With murmurs loud , like rivers far , The race of Torne hither moved . " And when compelled to retire , " dragging his spear behind , Cudulin sank in the distant wood , Like a fire-upblazing ere it dies . " Nor did Fingal want a proper audience when he spoke ; " A thousand orators inclined To hear the lay of Fingal . " The threats too would have deterred a man . Vengeance and terror were real . Trenmore threatens the young warrior , whom he meets on a foreign strand , " Thy mother shall find thee pale on the shore , While lessening on the waves she spies The sails of him who slew her son . " If Ossian 's heroes weep , it is from excess of strength , and not from weakness , a sacrifice or libation of fertile natures , like the perspiration of stone in summer 's heat . We hardly know that tears have been shed , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes . Their joy and their sorrow are made of one stuff , like rain and snow , the rainbow and the mist . When Fillan was worsted in fight , and ashamed in the presence of Fingal , " He strode away forthwith , And bent in grief above a stream , His cheeks bedewed with tears . From time to time the thistles gray He lopped with his inverted lance . " Crodar , blind and old , receives Ossian , son of Fingal , who comes to aid him in war , " ' My eyes have failed , ' says he , ' Crodar is blind , Is thy strength like that of thy fathers ? Stretch , Ossian , thine arm to the hoary-haired . ' I gave my arm to the king . The aged hero seized my hand ; He heaved a heavy sigh ; Tears flowed incessant down his cheek . ' Strong art thou , son of the mighty , Though not so dreadful as Morven 's prince . Let my feast be spread in the hall , Let every sweet-voiced minstrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sons of wave-echoing Croma . ' " Even Ossian himself , the hero-bard , pays tribute to the superior strength of his father Fingal . " How beauteous , mighty man , was thy mind , Why succeeded Ossian without its strength ? " CHAUCER . What a contrast between the stern and desolate poetry of Ossian , and that of Chaucer , and even of Shakspeare and Milton , much more of Dryden , and Pope , and Gray . Our summer of English poetry , like the Greek and Latin before it , seems well advanced toward its fall , and laden with the fruit and foliage of the season , with bright autumnal tints , but soon the winter will scatter its myriad clustering and shading leaves , and leave only a few desolate and fibrous boughs to sustain the snow and rime , and creak in the blasts of ages . We can not escape the impression , that the Muse has stooped a little in her flight , when we come to the literature of civilized eras . Now first we hear of various ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monuments is for every age . The bard has lost the dignity and sacredness of his office . He has no more the bardic rage , and only conceives the deed , which he formerly stood ready to perform . Hosts of warriors , earnest for battle , could not mistake nor dispense with the ancient bard . His lays were heard in the pauses of the fight . There was no danger of his being overlooked by his contemporaries . But now the hero and the bard are of different professions . When we come to the pleasant English verse , it seems as if the storms had all cleared away , and it would never thunder and lighten more . The poet has come within doors , and exchanged the forest and crag for the fireside , the hut of the Gael , and Stonehenge with its circles of stones , for the house of the Englishman . No hero stands at the door prepared to break forth into song or heroic action , but we have instead a homely Englishman , who cultivates the art of poetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackling faggots in all the verse . The towering and misty imagination of the bard has descended into the plain , and become a lowlander , and keeps flocks and herds . Poetry is one man 's trade , and not all men 's religion , and is split into many styles . It is pastoral , and lyric , and narrative , and didactic . Notwithstanding the broad humanity of Chaucer , and the many social and domestic comforts which we meet with in his verse , we have to narrow our vision somewhat to consider him , as if he occupied less space in the landscape , and did not stretch over hill and valley as Ossian does . Yet , seen from the side of posterity , as the father of English poetry , preceded by a long silence or confusion in history , unenlivened by any strain of pure melody , we easily come to reverence him . Passing over the earlier continental poets , since we are bound to the pleasant archipelago of English poetry , Chaucer 's is the first name after that misty weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , though he represents so different a culture and society , he may be regarded as in many respects the Homer of the English poets . Perhaps he is the youthfullest of them all . We return to him as to the purest well , the fountain furthest removed from the highway of desultory life . He is so natural and cheerful , compared with later poets , that we might almost regard him as a personification of spring . To the faithful reader his muse has even given an aspect to his times , and when he is fresh from perusing him , they seem related to the golden age . It is still the poetry of youth and life , rather than of thought ; and though the moral vein is obvious and constant , it has not yet banished the sun and daylight from his verse . The loftiest strains of the muse are , for the most part , sublimely plaintive , and not a carol as free as nature 's . The content which the sun shines to celebrate from morning to evening is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravished but consoled . There is a catastrophe implied , and a tragic element in all our verse , and less of the lark and morning dews , than of the nightingale and evening shades . But in Homer and Chaucer there is more of the innocence and serenity of youth , than in the more modern and moral poets . The Iliad is not sabbath but morning reading , and men cling to this old song , because they have still moments of unbaptized and uncommitted life , which give them an appetite for more . He represents no creed nor opinion , and we read him with a rare sense of freedom and irresponsibility , as if we trod on native ground , and were autochthones of the soil . Chaucer had eminently the habits of a literary man and a scholar . We do not enough allow for the prevalence of this class . There were never any times so stirring , that there were not to be found some sedentary still . Through all those outwardly active ages , there were still monks in cloisters writing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . The battles of Hallidon Hill and Neville 's Cross , and the still more memorable battles of Crecy and Poictiers , were fought in his youth , but these did not concern our poet much , Wicliffe much more . He seems to have regarded himself always as one privileged to sit and converse with books . He helped to establish the literary class . His character , as one of the fathers of the English language , would alone make his works important , even those which have little poetical merit . A great philosophical and moral poet gives permanence to the language he uses , by making the best sound convey the best sense . He was as simple as Wordsworth in preferring his homely but vigorous Saxon tongue , when it was neglected by the court , and had not yet attained to the dignity of a literature , and rendered a similar service to his country to that which Dante rendered to Italy . If Greek sufficeth for Greek , and Arabic for Arabian , and Hebrew for Jew , and Latin for Latin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these will serve to teach truth " right as divers pathes leaden divers folke the right waye to Rome . " In the Testament of Love he writes , " Let then clerkes enditen in Latin , for they have the propertie of science , and the knowinge in that facultie , and lette Frenchmen in their Frenche also enditen their queinte termes , for it is kyndely to their mouthes , and let us shewe our fantasies in soche wordes as we lerneden of our dames tonge . " He will know how to appreciate Chaucer best , who has come down to him the natural way , through the meagre pastures of Saxon and ante-Chaucerian poetry ; and yet so human and wise he seems after such diet , that he is liable to misjudge him still . In the Saxon poetry extant , in the earliest English , and the contemporary Scottish poetry , there is less to remind the reader of the rudeness and vigor of youth , than of the feebleness of a declining age . It is for the most part translation or imitation merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and oftentimes the falsehood and exaggeration of fable , without its imagination to redeem it . It is astonishing to how few thoughts so many sincere efforts give utterance . But as they never sprang out of nature , so they will never root themselves in nature . There are few traces of original genius , and we look in vain to find antiquity restored , humanized , and made blithe again , by the discovery of some natural sympathy between it and the present . But when we come to Chaucer we are relieved of many a load . He is fresh and modern still , and no dust settles on his true passages . It lightens along the line , and we are reminded that flowers have bloomed , and birds sung , and hearts beaten , in England . Before the earnest gaze of the reader the rust and moss of time gradually drop off , and the original green life is revealed . He was a homely and domestic man , and did breathe quite as modern men do . Only one trait , one little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the world may think the author fit to wear the laurel crown . In the dearth we have described , and at this distance of time , the bare processes of living read like poetry , for all of human good or ill , heroic or vulgar , lies very near to them . All that is truly great and interesting to men , runs thus as level a course , and is as unaspiring , as the plough in the furrow . There is no wisdom which can take place of humanity , and we find that in Chaucer . We can expand in his breadth and think we could be that man 's acquaintance . He was worthy to be a citizen of England , while Petrarch and Boccacio lived in Italy , and Tell and Tamerlane in Switzerland and in Asia , and Bruce in Scotland , and Wickliffe , and Gower , and Edward the Third , and John of Gaunt , and the Black Prince , were his own countrymen ; all stout and stirring names . The fame of Roger Bacon came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still exerted the influence of a living presence . On the whole , Chaucer impresses us , as greater than his reputation , and not a little like Homer and Shakspeare , for he would have held up his head in their company . Among early English poets he is the landlord and host , and has the authority of such . The affectionate mention , which succeeding early poets make of him , coupling him with Homer and Virgil , is to be taken into the account in estimating his character and influence . King James and Dunbar of Scotland speak with more love and reverence of him , than any modern author of his predecessors of the last century . The same childlike relation is without parallel now . We read him without criticism for the most part , for he pleads not his own cause , but speaks for his readers , and has that greatness of trust and reliance which compels popularity . He confides in the reader , and speaks privily with him , keeping nothing back . And in return his reader has great confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads his story with indulgence , as if it were the circumlocution of a child , but discovers afterwards that he has spoken with more directness and economy of words than a sage . He is never heartless , " For first the thing is thought within the hart , Er any word out from the mouth astart . " And so new was all his theme in those days , that he had not to invent , but only to tell . We admire Chaucer for his sturdy English wit . The easy height he speaks from in his Prologue to the Canterbury Tales , as if he were equal to any of the company there assembled , is as good as any particular excellence in it . But though it is full of good sense and humanity , it is not transcendent poetry . For picturesque description of persons it is , perhaps , without a parallel in English poetry ; yet it is essentially humorous , as the loftiest genius never is . Humor , however broad and genial , takes a narrower view than enthusiasm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonne 's Preeste 's tale , is genuine humanity . I know of nothing better in its kind , no more successful fabling of birds and beasts . If it is said of Shakspeare , that he is now Hamlet , and then Falstaff , it may be said of Chaucer that he sympathizes with brutes as well as men , and assumes their nature that he may speak from it . In this tale he puts on the very feathers and stature of the cock . To his own finer vein he added all the common wit and wisdom of his time , and every where in his works his remarkable knowledge of the world , and nice perception of character , his rare common sense and proverbial wisdom , are apparent . His genius does not soar like Milton 's , but is genial and familiar . It shows great tenderness and delicacy , but not the heroic sentiment . It is only a greater portion of humanity with all its weakness . It is not heroic , as Raleigh 's , nor pious , as Herbert 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child of the English muse , that child which is the father of the man . It is for the most part only an exceeding naturalness , perfect sincerity , with the behavior of a child rather than of a man . Gentleness and delicacy of character is every where apparent in his verse . The simplest and humblest words come readily to his lips . No one can read the Prioress ' tale , understanding the spirit in which it was written , and in which the child sings , O alma redemptoris mater , or the account of the departure of Constance with her child upon the sea , in the Man of Lawe 's tale , without feeling the native innocence and refinement of the author . Nor can we be mistaken respecting the essential purity of his character , disregarding the apology of the manners of the age . His sincere sorrow in his later days for the grossness of his earlier works , and that he " can not recall and annull " much that he had written , " but , alas , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not do what I desire , " is not to be forgotten . A simple pathos and feminine gentleness , which Wordsworth occasionally approaches , but does not equal , are peculiar to him . We are tempted to say , that his genius was feminine , not masculine . It was such a feminineness , however , as is rarest to find in woman , though not the appreciation of it . Perhaps it is not to be found at all in woman , but is only the feminine in man . Such pure , childlike love of nature is not easily to be matched . Nor is it strange , that the poetry of so rude an age should contain such sweet and polished praise of nature , for her charms are not enhanced by civilization , as society 's are , but by her own original and permanent refinement she at last subdues and educates man . Chaucer 's remarkably trustful and affectionate character appears in his familiar , yet innocent and reverent , manner of speaking of his God . He comes into his thought without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zephyr to his ear . If nature is our mother , then God is our father . There is less love and simple practical trust in Shakspeare and Milton . How rarely in our English tongue do we find expressed any affection for God . There is no sentiment so rare as the love of God . Herbert almost alone expresses it , " Ah , my dear God ! " Our poet uses similar words , and whenever he sees a beautiful person , or other object , prides himself on the " maistry " of his God . He reverently recommends Dido to be his bride , " if that God that heaven and yearth made , Would have a love for beauty and goodnesse , And womanhede , trouth , and semeliness . " He supplies the place to his imagination of the saints of the Catholic calendar , and has none of the attributes of a Scandinavian deity . But , in justification of our praise , we must refer the hearer to his works themselves ; to the Prologue to the Canterbury Tales , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories of Griselda , Virginia , Ariadne , and Blanche the Dutchesse , and much more of less distinguished merit . There are many poets of more taste and better manners , who knew how to leave out their dulness , but such negative genius can not detain us long ; we shall return to Chaucer still with love . Even the clown has taste , whose dictates , though he disregards them , are higher and purer than those which the artist obeys ; and some natures , which are rude and ill developed , have yet a higher standard of perfection , than others which are refined and well balanced . Though the peasant 's cot is dark , it has the evening star for taper , while the nobleman 's saloon is meanly lighted . If we have to wander through many dull and prosaic passages in Chaucer , we have at least the satisfaction of knowing that it is not an artificial dulness , but too easily matched by many passages in life , and it is , perhaps , more pleasing , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We confess we feel a disposition commonly to concentrate sweets , and accumulate pleasures , but the poet may be presumed always to speak as a traveller , who leads us through a varied scenery , from one eminence to another , and , from time to time , a single casual thought rises naturally and inevitably , with such majesty and escort only as the first stars at evening . And surely fate has enshrined it in these circumstances for some end . Nature strews her nuts and flowers broadcast , and never collects them into heaps . This was the soil it grew in , and this the hour it bloomed in ; if sun , wind , and rain , came here to cherish and expand the flower , shall not we come here to pluck it ? A true poem is distinguished , not so much by a felicitous expression , or any thought it suggests , as by the atmosphere which surrounds it . Most have beauty of outline merely , and are striking as the form and bearing of a stranger , but true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all friendliness , and envelope us in their spirit and fragrance . Much of our poetry has the very best manners , but no character . It is only an unusual precision and elasticity of speech , as if its author had taken , not an intoxicating draught , but an electuary . It has the distinct outline of sculpture , and chronicles an early hour . Under the influence of passion all men speak thus distinctly , but wrath is not always divine . There are two classes of men called poets . The one cultivates life , the other art ; one seeks food for nutriment , the other for flavor ; one satisfies hunger , the other gratifies the palate . There are two kinds of writing , both great and rare ; one that of genius , or the inspired , the other of intellect and taste , in the intervals of inspiration . The former is above criticism , always correct , giving the law to criticism . It vibrates and pulsates with life forever . It is sacred , and to be read with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are few instances of a sustained style of this kind ; perhaps every man has spoken words , but the speaker is then careless of the record . Such a style removes us out of personal relations with its author , we do not take his words on our lips , but his sense into our hearts . It is the stream of inspiration , which bubbles out , now here , now there , now in this man , now in that . It matters not through what ice-crystals it is seen , now a fountain , now the ocean stream running under ground . It is in Shakspeare , Alpheus , in Burns , Arethuse ; but ever the same . The other is self-possessed and wise . It is reverent of genius , and greedy of inspiration . It is conscious in the highest and the least degree . It consists with the most perfect command of the faculties . It dwells in a repose as of the desert , and objects are as distinct in it as oases or palms in the horizon of sand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a caravan . But the pen is only an instrument in its hand , and not instinct with life , like a longer arm . It leaves a thin varnish or glaze over all its work . The works of Goethe furnish remarkable instances of the latter . There is no just and serene criticism as yet . Our taste is too delicate and particular . It says nay to the poet 's work , but never yea to his hope . It invites him to adorn his deformities , and not to cast them off by expansion , as the tree its bark . We are a people who live in a bright light , in houses of pearl and porcelain , and drink only light wines , whose teeth are easily set on edge by the least natural sour . If we had been consulted , the back bone of the earth would have been made , not of granite , but of Bristol spar . A modern author would have died in infancy in a ruder age . But the poet is something more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he is a Cincinnatus in literature , and occupies no west end of the world , but , like the sun , indifferently selects his rhymes , and with a liberal taste weavexs into his verse the planet and the stubble . In these old books the stucco has long since crumbled away , and we read what was sculptured in the granite . They are rude and massive in their proportions , rather than smooth and delicate in their finish . The workers in stone polish only their chimney ornaments , but their pyramids are roughly done . There is a soberness in a rough aspect , as of unhewn granite , which addresses a depth in us , but a polished surface hits only the ball of the eye . The true finish is the work of time and the use to which a thing is put . The elements are still polishing the pyramids . Art may varnish and gild , but it can do no more . A work of genius is rough-hewn from the first , because it anticipates the lapse of time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are broken off , an essential quality of its substance . Its beauty is at the same time its strength , and it breaks with a lustre . The great poem must have the stamp of greatness as well as its essence . The reader easily goes within the shallowest contemporary poetry , and informs it with all the life and promise of the day , as the pilgrim goes within the temple , and hears the faintest strains of the worshippers ; but it will have to speak to posterity , traversing these deserts through the ruins of its outmost walls , by the grandeur and beauty of its proportions .
