txt A POSTHUMOUS work of the late Mr. Southey can not fail to excite interest . A Life from his pen , of Dr. Bell , for whom and whose system ho was known to entertain so marked a respect , addresses the reflecting with a still ' higher claim to attention , and illustrates the veneration which greatness has for greatness . The present biography comes also before us with special authority ; for the materials were , in great part , intrusted by the subject of it to the writer , and clauses to that effect were , we are told , inserted in most of the wills that Dr. Bell executed ; in one of which he gave directions for a complete edition of his works to be prepared jointly by Mr. Wordsworth and Mr. Southey ; but , in consequence of this having been afterwards commenced by Bishop Russell , the clause was omitted in his final will , in which , instead , Dr. Bell submitted to Mr. Southey " his books , papers , letters , arid college essays , for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  " but not so as to interfere with Mr. Sou they 's designs , who will , of course , have access to all my papers . The trustees of the will , however , saw reason to request that Mr. South ey would write the Life of Dr. Bell and appointed a committee to select such documents from the mass of his papers as would be available for such purpose . In this labor much credit is due to Mr. Davies , ( Dr. Bell 's amanuensis , ) who , to promote the object in view , took lodgings at Keewick , and drew up a series of narratives for Mr. Southey 's use ; a course rendered quite needful , it seems , by the vast and formidable mass of materials *ccumu-lated " And ( continues the preface ) it must be borne in mind that these were not all important letters , containing specific and available information , but that perhaps several hundreds had to be searched , even for a single fact or date ; and the Doctor 's pursuits and employments being often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same papers have often passed forty or fifty times through Mr. Davies ' hands . As soon as the papers had arrived at Keswick , and been arranged by Mr. Davies , my father commenced his labors ; but being only able to devote a small portion of each day to this purpose , he proceeded but slowly . The materials being too cumbrous to be conveniently removed to Greta Hall , he regularly went down to Mr. Davies ' lodgings , remaining from seven until nine o'clock in the summer mornings , and from daylight until that time in winter . His first step was to read through the great body of the letters , and mark such as he wished Mr. Davies to copy . This alone occupied him twelve months ; and so many papers were afterwards sent him , that twelve months more were similarly employed . Meantime Mr. Davies , with unwearied XXXVI . LIVING AGE . von . iv . 10 145 patience and industry , was col.lecting all the matter that could possibly be available into a series of connected narratives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but many circumstances combined to retard his progress . In the summer of 1838 , when he made a short tour on the continent , he had brought the Life down to the point where it has fallen to my office to resume it ; and on returning home for some of the winter months , he partly occupied himself in hearing Mr. Davies read over the notes and memoranda he had made during a visit to Swannage . From the spring of 1839 until the following August he was again absent ; and from the period of his return until his death , I deeply regret to say , he was totally incapable of resuming his literary labors . " To this simple narrative there is attached a melancholy interest , as relating the last occupation of a powerful mind just previous to the destined time of its extinction . Only the first volume , however , was the laureate 's production  --  the second and third are by his son . The opening paragraphs bear the mint-stamp of the poet 's exquisite prosestyle ; and , besides , present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of Alexander and Margaret Bell , was born in the city of St. Andrew 's , on the 27th of March , 1753 . His father was a barber in that city  --  a personage of more importance in the age of periwigs , and when considered as a surgeon of the lowest ' class , than in these times . He had been educated for a better station , but was thus reduced by a complication of misfortunes brtiught upon him , his son says , in early life by his inexperience and credulity . That his immediate ancestors were persons of some consequence appears from this circumstance , that they are remembered to have been the first persons in the city of St. Andrew 's who introduced the luxury of tea , arid could boast of a China tea-service . He was a man of extraordinary abilities ; and having acquired no inconsiderable degree of mechanical and pmetical science , added to his original trade that of clock and watchmaker ; regulated by observations the timepiece in the public library of the tusiversity , and assisted Dr. Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments . His habits and appearance were singular , yet not so as to lessen the respect in which he was held for his talents , probity , and strength of character . He is described as tall and ungainly , with thick lips and ' a great mouth , which he commonly kept open , and wearing a large , bushy , weil.powderecl wig . Persons are still living who remember him hastening through the street , with a professor 's wig , ready dressed , in each hand , his arms at halfstretch to prevent their collision . After trimming one professor he would sit down arid breakfast . with him , and then away to trim and breakfast with another ; his appetite , like his mouth , ( and his mind also , ) being of remarkable and wellknown capacity . He was at one time hailie of the city ; and once by his personal intluenee , after ali other means had failed , he quelled what is called a meal-mob ' - riots upon that score being then so frequent as to obtain this specifie denomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his own , stood in South Street , on the east side of the town or parish church , and adjr*ining it . It consisted of two stories , with an Getter staircase supported by wooden pillars , and a. wooden projectiozi* // into the street . This served for his shop , and there he enjoyed his afternoon lounge . This style of building was formerly common in old Scotch towns ; particularly in Edinburgh , Kirkcaldy , and St. Andrew 's . It has now become rare in Scotland ; and the specimens of it which were common in the North of England a generation ago , have almost all been replaced in a manner which , if it be as much more commodious as it is less picturesque , must be considered a great improvement . Balie Bell was a proficient at draughts , backgammon , and chess . Such of the students , and of the professors also , as were fond of these games , used to meet at his house , and Andrew , while a mere child , acquired such singular skill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cngaging with him . A more remarkable instance of the bailie 's versatile talents is , that he engaged with Mr. Wilson , afterwards professor of astronomy at Glasgow , in a scheme for casting types upon some plan of their own . They were employed upon this , his son said , day and night , night and day , in a garret ; and though they did not succeed , yet , after the professor 's removal to Glasgow , the wellknown printers Robert and Andrew Foulis , are said to have been beholden to him for the beauty of their typography . Bailie Bell , having saved a little property , retired from business a short time before the close of his life . " Dr. Bell was the second son of the bailie . His first school experiences are curious , not only as giving indications of his future course in life , but as recording a system which the world has happily now outgrown " He never spoke of the discipline , or rather tyranny , which he witnessed and endured in those years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible ! ' he said , the remains of feudal sevenAy ! I never went to school without trembling . I could not tell whether I should be flogged or not . ' His father , he used to say , had been driven from the grammar-school by cruelties that would now hardly be believed ; yet neither his father nor he were wanting in capacity or diligence . Schools were everywhere conducted in those days upon a system of brutal severity , which never ought to have existed except where the master happened to be a man of singular humanity . In proof , however , that the severity of Scotch parents was then little less in degree , Dr. Bell instanced the case of a little boy , who , on his return from school after a merciless flogging , was observed to sit very uneasily : the father examined him , and though he saw that a great wound had been made , he merely observed there was room enough for more ! But mind , ' Dr. Bell added , he did not forget to remonstrate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earnest desire of improvement , his thoughts were so wholly engrossed by his lessons , that the family often said it was a wonder Andrew did not go east instead of west when he went out of the door ; and , indeed , though he did not lose the way , yet when he was going to any particular place he generally overpassed it , being lost in thought as he went along . What he knew the knew well , and never forgot ; but a want of verbal memory rendered that which , for common capacities , is , however unattractive , the easiest of their tasks at school , to him the most difficult . According to his own account , he never could correetly get by heart a single rule of the Latin syn tax , though he perfectly understood the meaning7 and was at no loss to apply it . My old master , Dr. Vincent , used to say , Give me a reason , boy ! I would always rather you should give me a reason than a rule . ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become in my days , and a less reasonable master , this natural defect or peculiarity sufficiently accounts for the fear with which Andrew took his way to school . Notwithstanding this , he made good progress in Latin ; Greek , in his country , was seldom or never taught at that time in such schools . I do not suppose , ' he said , the master could have taught it ; so we began our Greek alphabet when wo went to the university . ' The inclination which led him to scientific studies was manifested at thit time in the earnestness with which he applied himself to arithmetic . Dissatisfied with the book of arithmetic which was used in the school , he se* about composing one for his own improvement , taking , it is said , Main 's for the foundation . No* only his leisure hours were devoted to this object , but much nightly labor also-so early did he acquire that uncomfortable and injurious habit ; and , young as he then was , he completed the task so much to his own satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his papers were lost in a shipwreck , he particularly regretted the loss of this . " We are always disposed to take reminiscences of this kind with many grains of allowance . So early as 1769 , Andrew Bell matriculated at the United College . He was the youngest pupil in the mathematical class , and obtained the prize in that class when still young enough to be called Little Andrew ; and subsequently , " several public and honorable marks of distinguished merit and proficiency . " During these years he held the Glendie bursary as next-of-kin ; his mother , ( Margaret Robertson , ) being descended from the Dean of Cashel of that name , who founded , by his will , a bursary at St. Salvator 's , for the benefit of his descendants . The resources derived from this privilege were , however , scanty , and young Bell was compelled to eke them out by teaching . He diligently applied himself to mathematics and natural philosophy ,  --  having for his instructor in the latter Dr. Wilkie , the author of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent and characteristic digression . On attaining twenty-one , Andrew Bell resolved on seeking his fortune in the colonies , and having received some offers from Virghmia , embarked for America , first providing himself with honorable testimonials . It was in the year 1774 that he sailed from Glasgow . For the next five years nothing is known . In 1779 he was engaged as private tutor at an annual salary of 2001. , in the family of Mr. Carter Braxton , a wealthy merchant of West Point . Two years later he accompanied the sons of this gentleman to Europe , and devoted himself to their education ; and so prudent had he been , that he was now in possession of or held securities worth not less than 8 or 9001. , though unfortunately few of these securities were realized . He had much trouble with the young men , but 146 // 147 qwq to my frie nd and colleague , Archdeacon Leslie , and Arcot .

This would not conduce to their happiness . What I wish only is to render them easy In their circumstances , and comfortable in their sphere of life ; and I shall be glad of your opinion of what is necessary for this purpose . I wrote to professor George Hill , that there may be some provision for that mortality which reigns so much in my mind at present . 1 say nothing of Dean of Guild Kerr . I know he will not be wanting in his good offices and services , and IL trust I shall be able to repay them . *** , Adventurers to the East Indies , as one of Bell 's correspondents remarked to him , brought with them but little science , and therefore there is less to wonder at in Dr. Bell 's rapid success there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaplain of Fort St. George , was attached the office of-undertaker ! - that is , the chaplain was the person by whom funerals were actually furnished , the working undertaker being only his functionary , and receiving a graduated per percentage on the cost . We have a copy of Bell 's instructions to this personage , which are characteristic , but too long for quotation ; soon after issuing them , however , he gave up the business . He was not only ashamed of it , but preferred lecturing , and in the spring of 1793 delivered a scientific course in N his own house at Madras , realizing thereby 600 pagodas . We now approach the grand mission of his life : - " When the Madras government desired Captain Dempster to leave Dr. Bell there , instead of carrying him on to Bengal , according to his original destination , it was in conformity to an application from the committee then employed in establishing a Military Male Orphan Asylum in that presidency . The committee made this application , because they looked on him as a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion so justly formed at this time of his peculiar talents , placed him in the way of preferment , and enabled him to lay the foundation of his fortune ; and the office to which he was in consequence appointed , called forth those talents in the manner which has signalized his name. ** We have not space to relate the rise and progress of the institution : suffice it to say , that Dr. Bell offered his services without salary . The successive appeals to the public were successful , and application was from time to time forwarded to the Court of Directors to increase their funds ; though the company at first refused , they had help from other quarters , and the affair went on prosperously , so that they were soon able to provide for 200 boys . Rules were of course appointed ; an acting president and select committee were nominated ; an annual examination was had ; the practice of inoculation introduced , the patients being removed to the hospital ; and while Dr. Bell 's solicitude increased , the establishment grew into reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system of education , which originated at the Madras asylum , and has since spread its branches over divers lands . The following fact is curious " Fathers were not more desirous to obtain for their children the benefits of this asylum , than the mothers of those who were fatherless were at first averse to it . Most of these women , being Moors or Hindoos , were so ignorant of European customs , and so prepossessed with a notion that the religion of the English was as inhuman as their own , that when , by order of those to whose guardianship the boys had been left , they brought them to be admitted upon the foundation , they supposed the children were to be sacrificed to some unknown god , and went through all the ceremonies of mourning for them . Others fancied that they were giving them up to slavery ; and even the least unreasonable thought they were delivered over to hard taskmasters . A short time sufficed for dispelling such suppositions ; and when they understood what the object of the institution really was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admittance for them . " No*v then for the origin of the system itself " Dr. Bell was dissatisfied with the want of discipline , and the imperfect instruction in every part of the school ; but more particularly with the slow progress of the younger boys , and the unreasonable length of time consumed in teaching them their letters . They were never able to proceed without the constant aid of an usher , and , with that aid , months were wasted before the difficulties of the alphabet were got over . Dr. Bell 's temper led him to do all things quickly , and his habits of mind to do them thoroughly , and leave nothing incomplete . He tells us , that from the beginning he looked upon perfect instruction as the main duty of the office with which he had charged himself ; yet he was foiled for some time in all the means that he devised for attaining it . Many attempts he made to correct the evil in its earliest stage , and in all he met with more or less opposition from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they considered as implying some reflection on their own capacity or diligence ; in proportion as he interfered , they thought themselves disparaged , and were not less displeased than surprised , that instead of holding the office of superintendent as a sinecure , his intention was to devote himself earnestly to the concerns of the asylum , and more especially to the school department . Things were in this state , when , happening on one of his morning rides to pass by a Malabar school , he observed the children seated on the ground , and writing with their fingers in sand , which had for that purpose been strewn before them . He hastened home , repeating to himself as he went ECQ ? Zxe , ' I have discovered it ; ' and gave immediate orders to the usher of the lowest classes to teach the alphabet in the same manner , with this difference only from the Malabar mode , that the sand was strewn upon a board . These orders were either disregarded or so carelessly executed , as if they were thought not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made without either expectation or wish of succeeding , the usher at last declared it was impossible to teach the boys in that way . If he had acted on this occasion in good will , and with merely common ability , Dr. Bell might never have cried EvQ'jxc ' a second 148 // his purpose by the obstinacy of others nor to be baffled in it by their incapacity ; baffled , however , he was now sensible that he must be , if he depended for the execution of his plans on the will and ability of those over whose minds he had no command . He bethought himself of employing a boy , on wh*se obedience , disposition , and cleverness he could rely , and giving him charge of the alphabet class . The lad 's name was John Frisken ; he was the son of a private soldier , had learned his letters in the asylum , and was then about eight years old . Dr. Bell laid the strongest injunctions upon him to follow his instructions ; saying , he should look to him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be pursued , and hold him responsible for it . What the usher had pronounced to be impossible , this lad succeeded in effecting without any difficulty . The alphabet was now as much better taught as till then it had been worm than any other part of the boys ' studies ; and Frisken , in consequence , was appointed permanent teacher of that class . Though Dr. Bell did not immediately perceive the whole importance of this successful experiment , he proceeded in the course into which he had been , as it were , compelled . What Frisken had accomplished with the alphabet class , might , in like manner , be done with those next in order , by boys selected , as he had been , for their aptitude to learn and to teach . Accordingly , he appointed boys as assistant teachers to some of the lower classes , giving , however , to Frisken the charge of superintending both the assistants and their classes , because of his experience and the readiness with which he apprehended and executed whatever was required from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such perfection , that Dr. Bell did not hesitate to throw upon him the entire responsibility of this part of the school . The same improvement was now manifested in these classes as had taken place in teaching the alphabet . This he attributed to the diligence and fidelity with which his little friends , as he used to call them , performed his orders . To them a smile of approbation was no mean reward , and a look of displeasure a sufficient punishment . Even in this stage he felt confident that nothing more was wanting to bring the school into such a state as he had always proposed to himself , than to carry through the whole of the plan upon which he was now proceeding . And this , accordingly , was done . The experiment which from necessity had been tried at first with one class , was systematically extended to all the others in progression ; and , what is most important with scholastic improvement , moral improvement , not less , in consequence of the system , is said to have kept pace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because of their standing in the school , retained their influence at all times , and it was their business to interpose whenever their interference was necessary : such interference prevented all that tyranny and ill usage from which so much of the evil connected with boarding-schools arises ; and all that mischief in which some boys are engaged by a mischievous disposition , more by mere wantonness , and a still greater number by the example of their companions . The boys were thus rendered inoffensive towards others , and among themselves ; and this gentle preventive discipline made them , in its sure consequences , contented and happy . A boy was appointed over ' 49 each class to marshal them when they went to church or walked out , and to see that they duly performed the operations of combing and washing themselves . Ten boys were appointed daily to clean the school-rooms , and wait upon the others at their meals . Twice a-week during the hot season , and once a-week during the monsoon season , they were marched by an usher to the tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any purposes of instruction , the master and ushers were now virtually superseded . They attended the school so as to maintain the observance of the rules ; though even this was scarcely necessary under Dr. Bell 's vigilant superintendence , who now made the school the great pleasure as well as the great business of his life . Their duty was , not to teach , but to look after the various departments of the institution , to see that the daily tasks were performed , to take care of the boys in and out of school , and to mark any irregularity or neglect either in them or the teachers . The master 's principal business regarded now the economy of the institution : he had charge both of the daily disbursements and monthly expenditure under the treasurer . The precise date of that experiment which led to the general introduction of boy-teachers can not be ascertained ; but that these teachers had been introduced in 1791 , or early in the ensuing year , is certain . In private letters , written to his friends in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , and the impressions made upon his own mind by the complete success of his exertions in a favorite pursuit . These letters show also how soon he became aware of the importance of the system which he was developing and bringing to maturity . " Dr. Bell had , of course , to contend against the opposition of masters and ushers , with whose interests the new system seemed to be inconsistent . But such opposition was but a rope of sand contrasted with the decision of his character with whom they had to deal . The measures he took to counteract it were as various as the kinds of annoyance resorted to , and at length succeeded in establishing reform . It was not done , however , without involving the resignation of the schoolmaster , who declared himself incapable of undergoing the fatigues involved in his duties . On Dr. Bell inquiring what duties he meant , he replied " Almost every duty . " He was asked also , " What fatiguesP ' and he replied , " The fatigues of the mind . " Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they desiderate only mechanical employment , and a routine of tasks , involving no thought , and inducing none in their unfortunate pupils . That this mental indolence has in great part been now corrected is due to Dr. Bell 's perseverance and sagacity . The boy Frisken proved a capital coadjutor to the doctor ; though only eleven years of age , he taught all the younger classes , amounting to a third of the whole school . The education at the asylum , under Dr. Bell 's superintendence , was so complete as far as it went , and the character of the boys in consequence so good , that applications were made for them from all quarters . I SOUTHEY S LIFE OF DR . BELL . // Of one of these boys , named Smith , an interesting account is given , for which , however , our readers must consult the work itself ; where they will find recorded the scientific accomplishments of the celebrated Tippoo Sultan . Attached as Dr. Bell was to India , still he was haunted occasionally by a desire to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . For this purpose he went to Pondicherry , to Tanjore , and to Trichinopoly , but still his health declined . Nevertheless , long after he had obtained leave to return , he still lingered on the scene of his labors . At length , however , leaving the superintendence of the Orphan Asylum to the care of Mr. Kerr , he prepared to return to England . And with this terminates the laureate 's portion of the work before us . The amount of materials contained in the narratives drawn up by Mr. Davies would , if printed , have made from twelve to fourteen large octavo volumes ; Mr. C. C. Southey had , therefore , to select from this vast mass what is contained in the remaining two volumes of the work before us . Previous to quitting India , Dr. Bell took care to embody the result of his labors and experiments in a final and authentic account of his new system of education , and this report was accepted as a record of the institution which he had established . The rapidity with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , considering his position , and that the regular emoluments averaged only about 4,000 pagodas , or 1,0001. a-year . We find that on his return to England , in the year 1800 , his property amounted to no less than 25,9351. 16s. 5d . Nevertheless , when he abandoned the intention of returning , he sought a retiring allowance from the East India Company in reward of his extraordinary labors . In his memorial , he stated that when Mr. Kerr succeeded to the charge of the asylum , a salary of 140 pagodas a month was assigned him , and that the amount of this salary , together with the interest on the parts of it as they fell due , was the sum which the asylum had benefited by what he had given up ,  --  at which rate the sacrifice made by him amounted to about 6,7001 . The Court of Directors granted him a pension of 2001. per annum , while he remained in Europe ; soon after which he published his report , with additions , under the title of " An Experiment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting a system by which a school or family may teach itself under the superintendence of the master or parent . " " It is not , " says Mr. C. C. Southey , " to be inferred from Dr. Bell 's previously hesitating to publish this report , that he was not at that time aware of the inherent powers of the system he had discovered , or the important objects to which it was capable of being directed . It has , indeed , been asserted , that until Mr. Lancaster took up the subSOUTHEY ' S LIFE OF DR . BELL . ject , and brought it into general notice , Dr. Bell had given up the cause as hopeless . This , however , was far from being the case . No man was ever more sensible of the value of his own discovery than he was ; and his hesitation seems to have arisen chiefly from his doubting whether the period had arrived when it would meet with due attention . Its ultimate success he never doubted . I have printed my essay , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mode of teaching at the male asylum , and have now a design of publishing it . By the end of next century I hope it will be generally practised in Europe ; but it is probable that others will fall upon the same scheme before this be much attended to . ' And in one of his letters to the printer , he says- ' You will mark me for an enthusiast ; but if you and I live a thousand years , we shall see this system of education spread over the world . ' What he meant by the system , ' says the author of The Origin , Nature , and Object of the New System of Education , ' is apparent both from the title and the whole tenor of the pamphlet-not writing in sand , not syllabic reading , nor any of the improvements in detail , but the main principle and main spring of the wholethe new mode of conducting a school by the medium of the scholars themselves . Had Dr. Bell done no more than conceive the idea of this system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done enough . ' * * Unless Dr. Bell had abandoned all clerical duties and made education his profession , he could not have promoted the extension of his discovery more than he did . He had spared no pains in rendering the report perfect in all its parts ; and having thus laid before the publ*c a clear description of the system , together with most abundant testimony to its success in the only establishment where it had been tried , he had done his part , and it remained for the nation , and especially for those engaged in education , to discharge theirs . " " The system " was introduced into the school of St. Botolph 's , Aldgate , in 1798 , and the second practical experiment was made in the schools at Kendal , by Dr. Briggs , in the following year ; an incidental trial was successfully made in the Blue Coat school , and Dr. Bell also attempted to introduce the system into Edinburgh ; but was met by insuperable obstacles . One thing , however , as he now kept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the 3rd November , 1800 , he wedded Miss Agnes Barclay , eldest daughter of the Rev. Dr. Barclay , of Middleton . The lady was an intimate correspondent of Dr. Darwin , and an acquaintance of the learned Lady Audley . Whether prejudice against learned ladies be correct , or whether in Dr. Bell 's temper and habits was some incompatibility , the marriage proved unhappy . The biographers purposely suppress all particulars ; so that all we know is , that the parties separated in April , 1800 , and were not re*iuited . Soon after the marriage , Dr. Bell became rector of Swanage , a village in Dorset , the income of which amounted to nearly 8001 a year . Some account of an extraordinary man , one of its inhabitants , is here given , and by way of encouragement , must be quoted by ourselves // " Among those whom Dr. Bell first visited was Mr. Thomas Manwell , who lived close to the rectory , and who was one of the most extraordinary men in Swanage , having originally been a quarryman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seeing a great number of books in the room , and on expressing his astonishment to Mrs. Manwell , was informed by her that there were ten times the number up stairs , ' and that her husband had long been in the habit of spending all his spare money in the purchase of books , and all his leisure time in their perusal . This person was the son of George Manweil , quarryman , whose history , and that of some of his ancestors , is sufficiently interesting to claim some notice here . The following account is taken from a letter of George Manwell , jun. , to his son Henry , March 2 , 1814 . - . I can trace the family no further back , ' he says , than to my grandfather on that side , and but little more on my grandmother 's . After London was burnt some years , and the city began to &amp;*e rebuilt and flourishing , there was an uncommon eall for Purbeck stone , and paving was sold at so high a price as 30s. per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the neighborhood round and numbers of boys from different parishes , at the distance of twenty miles , were apprenticed here to the stone trade , and premiums given . This increased the inhabitants greatly , and other tradesmen were wanting . Our grandfather , J0-seph Manwell , was then a young man , a carpenter by trade , and came to Swanage from the parish of Strickland , near Abbey Melton , and as there was no carpenter in Swanage , thought it a good opening for business . He then married our grandmother , Elizabeth Abbot , youngest daughter of farmer Abbot of Worth . Our great-grandfather Abbot was very wealthy for that time . He gave all his children livings except grandmother , to whom , being about to marry a man intended for trade , he gave 1001. for her firtune . This was a capital sum in those times , for her father had then carried twenty-one bushels of wheat , great measure , from Worth to Poole , and sold it for 40s . Father was not one year old when his father Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left with three youngchildren . However , with the little property she had , and her own industry , she bred them without any assistance . Father , of course , under these circumstances , had scarcely any education , and at the age of eleven was put an apprentice to a quarryman , with a premium , by the Rev. Mr. Lewis , rector of Margate , who was , by the best information I can obtain , either uncle to grandmother or cousin . * * Father was a man of uncommon strong memory , could easily have learned anything , but no chance for improvement , and scarcely , or never , wrote his name , till after he was a man , when working in Portland about Westminster-bridge . ' " The individual here mentioned , George Manwell , was the chief means of introducing music into Swanage as a science , little or no attention having been previously paid to it . He first learned the art of singing by notes from a person who had come there for the purpose of giving lessons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an excellent ear , gave him some gratuitous instruction . The knowledge he had thus acquired he was anxious to disseminate , and under his tuition his three sons soon made great progress ; he also gave similar instruction to numbers of young men of the place , and a foundation was 151 thus laid for that musical knowledge which has since been much cultivated in Swanage . Of Thomas Manwell , the eldest son , often called the Swanage philosopher , it is said that he never attended any school after he was eight years old , at which time he was taken by his father to the quarries , to learn the stone-cutting trade . He was of a delicate constitution , and his father perceiving this , and his great love for reading , kindly supplied him with a few books , and avoided putting him to the severer labors of the quarries . By the time he was fourteen years of age , he had instructed himself fully in the theory of navigation , and before he was seventeen he had constructed a sun-dial on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made another for the church , which still remains . He continued to follow his trade as a stone-cutter , devoting all his leisure moments to study , until after the French Revolution , when from the excellent character he bore , and from his scientific knowledge , he was appointed to the situation of midshipman under the lieutenant of the signal-post off Swanage , called Round Down , which appointment he held , except during the ten months ' peace of Amiens , until after the battle of Waterloo , when the signal-posts were discontinued . The solitude of this place was well suited to his habits and feelings , and the leisure which the situation often afforded , gave him an opportunity of following his favorite studies , which were now botany and astronomy , although he also paid much attention to mathematics , history , chemistry , and philosophy . On these subjects he not only studied but wrote , having compiled upwards of twenty volumes of different sizes , all closely written in imitation of printing . These chiefly consist of extracts from books on philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own observations . * * He appears to have been a man of retiring habits , and of a very abstracted turn of mind , passing much of his time alone , and avoiding all intercourse with any but his own family and most intimate friends . Even when engaged in his stone-shed he rarely conversed with his fellow-workmen , having few subjects of common interest with them , and being unwilling to communicate his knowledge where . it could not be understood or appreciated . This reserve and taciturnity , however , entirely disappeared when he met with men of congenial tastes and habits , and this was the case in a remarkable degree in his intercourse with his two brothers , who were also men of no ordinary powers of mind . They were in the habit of meeting occasionally at the house of one of the brothers , and here they used to spend hours in conversing on philosophy , astronomy , history , the arts and sciences , &amp;c. &amp;c . Thomas , ' said an old lady who was well acquainted with him , was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eclipses , ( which he calculated with great exactness , ) and numbers of other matters which we could not understand . ' Had* Manwell received a liberal education , and had better oppor-*. tunities of pursuing his studies , he would doubt*. less have distinguished himself in scientific pmij*. - suits ; he does not , however , seem to have pussessed much ambition , or indeed ever to hajr*ewished to quit his native placq . Dr. Bell , having been struck with the number and subjects of the books in Manwell 's house , became desirous of seeing the owner , and subsequently had much in .. - tercourse with him ; never failing *t pay him* * // visit , or ask him to the rectory , whenever he came from his duties at the signal-post . On these occasions , they used to spend many hours in conversation on philosophical and scientific subjects ; and Dr. Bell used often to say that Manwell possessed more actual knowledge on the theoretical , and , hi many instances , on the practical parts of philosophy , than almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in introducing his system into his own parochial schools ; nevertheless by degrees he did so . It was not until f806 , however , that he seems to have been at all satisfied with the result ; when , having separated from his wife , he turned again to the system to which he had been previously wedded , and which henceforth engrossed the whole of his attention . Soon after his arrival at Swanage , Dr. Bell introduced vaccination among his parishioners in place of inoculation : on this subject , he thus wrote in a letter to a friend " Sunday the 15th , ( June , 1806 , ) I did what was never done before in Swanage-preached twice , and the same sermon , both forenoon and afternoon , on cow-pock . The consequence is , that I have now this year vaccinated 211 subjects , which , added to the three former years ' list , make 504 I have vaccinated . A mother has brought a second child from Portsmouth , on purpose for my vaccination , because the elder had resisted the small-pox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had vaccinated with my parishioners and neighbors ; for I sent none away . Among other causes , I am detained by the vaccination ( brought on before the usual period by the natural smallpox breaking out in the neighborhood ) from returning to London so soon as I intended . ' And in the course of the next month he writes- ' I have now almost finished my fourth annual vaccination for the cow*pock , amounting in all to 658 subjects , from seventy-eight years of age to twelve months ; and have set old women , school-mistresses , &amp;c. , in neighboring parishes , inoculating with vaccine matter . ' " Dr. Bell also busied himself in introducing the manufacture of straw-pInt into the village . The facts detailed in the work before us , undoubtedly settle the priority of Dr. Bell 's claim , as founder of the educational system of mutual instruction ; still we think that both the doctor and his friends ( including both Mr. Southey and Mr. Coleridge ) pressed too hardly upon Mr. Lancaster in the matter . In this they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England . Had Mr. Lancaster not so used the system , however he came by it , as to contribute apparent strength to the dissenting interest-had he , in fact , not been a f*rmidabIe and successful rival , his proceedings would have been passed by in silence , and not violent opposition . A strong delusion , however , was upon all parties ; they loved victory more than charity , and enacted scenes whereat the angels wept . Life is a tragi-comedy , and in the conduct of the best of men there are *oints over which we would willingly draw the veil . The present biography , however , does not SOUTHEY ' S LIFE OF DR . BELL . do so ; but , in its text and appended correspondence , furnishes the evidences of partizan advocacy , not as things to be regretted , but to be boasted of . Doubtless the quarrel then commenced , which has been since continued , and still rages , whether the Church , or Dissent , or both , shall have the education of the peGple ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless he pursued them by vulgar means , and made his appeals , with equal effrontery , to the less and the more refined . All this may be conceded ; nevertheless , why should the rivals in a good work be other than friends 2 and what if the members of a secular institution were to declare themselves the enemies of every man in the same state , not belonging to their body , in precise proportion to his activity in promoting like worthy objects ? Mr. Southey and Mr. Coleridge were just the men to see the truths at which we have glanced , whenever they had to deal with the general argument , but no sooner did the question become personal and specific , than they , as it seems to us , sacrificed their philosophical character to the spirit of partizanship and malevolence . The last word is not too emphatic for the animosity exhibited in the correspondence of men estimable alike for their genius and virtues , but as strong in their talents when they erred as when they did well . Lancaster 's efforts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in religious feelings . Immediately on its publication , he adopted its principles , which shows that his heart was in the cause of education , and that he was on the look-out for whatever would serve the great purpose of his life . If he afterwards sinned in denying the aid that he received , he most amply expiated his guilt by the persecution that he excited , his consequent poverty and miserable death . Let his brethren , nevertheless , weep over him , as a true prophet , who performed his mission , though in the manner of doing it , he suffered himself to be misled , and was punished for yielding to an unworthy temptation . What Mr. Lancaster proposed may he gathered from a pamphlet , published by him in 1803 , which , says Mr. C. C. Southey , in the passage we are about to quote , suggests " a system of education which , if carried into effect , would have been of the most pernicious tendency . " Mr. C. C. Southey is a young man , his father was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as older than either , and there are in it very different opinions on this point " After making ( says Mr. C. C. Southey , ) some remarks on the necessity of gentle measures in all matters relating to a reform in society , and more especially in education , Lancaster proposes that a society should be formed for the purposes of education . This , ' he says , should be established on general Christian principles , and on them only . Mankind are divided into sects , and individuals think very differently oi*i religious subjects , from the purest motives ; and that common gracious Parent , who loves all his children alike , // beholds with approbation every one who worships him in sincerity . Yet it can not be reasonably supposed that *orimientiou* men should promote a religious opinion directly contrary to their own . A Pi7e*byterian , Baptiat , Quaker , or any other , can not , with *incerity , sacrifice their opinions to those of their amiable and Christian brethren in the Establishment ; neither can the last conscientiously unite entirely in opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of Christianity alone is broad enough for the whole bulk of mankind to stand on , and join hands as children of one family . * * * Ah ! then , let all the friends of youth , among every denomination of Christians , exalt the standard of education , and rally round it for their preservation , laying aside all religious differences in opinion , and pursue two grand objects  --  the promotion of good morals , and the instruction of youth in useful learning , adapted to their respective situations . * * * Indeed , ' he goes on to say , it is not to be wondered at that no general plan of this kind has been adopted : there are few things in which it would appear , at first sight , that the different religious interests of sectarians would clash more ; and so they must , if a Plan of this kind is eagerly pursued by one or more parties with a view to increase proselytes , or make it a vehicle to convey their favorite tenets . It has been generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a national system of education , that party would soon be likely to possess the greatest power and influence in the state . Fear that the clergy should aggrandize themaelves too much , has produced opposition from dissenters to any proposal of the kind ; on the other hand , the clergy have opposed anything of this nature , which might originate with dissenters. * * * However , there is yet hope left ; the common ground of humanity is adapted to all-none can conscientiously scruple to meet there . All are agreed that the increase of lea and good morals are great blessings to society . If they can not unite to do good in every particular instance , yet let them be fellowhelpers as far * they can , and cordially assist to do it with one mind , that society at large may no longer suffer loss by a set of the most valuable and useful men our nation can boast , employing themselves to little better purpose than to declaim against or make wry faces at each other . ' I conceive any person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pamphlet , whose moral character and abilities were likely to ' make him serviceable to the rising generation , should be an object of the society 's protection , let his denomination of religion lie what it may , and let him pursue whatever method of religious or other instruction his sincere and best intentions may dictate . ' " It is far from our intention to debate this point ; we merely produce it thus prominently that the character of Mr. Lancaster may be rightly understood ; to treat of the expediency or otherwise of eclecticism would require a volume , not a few columns ; but we believe it is not yet ruled that the eclectic is necessarily a criminal . One trait of Lancaster 's character , however , is amusing : he had the simplicity to think that Dr. Bell might be induced to subscribe to the Lancasterian schools ; we may imagine the consternation into which this threw the Doctor , who pronounced the " manner " of the request to be " indelicate . " But faults were not all on one side . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and advocates much trouble . The lengths to which this error compelled his friends to go in his defence , may be judged of by the following letter from Mr. Southey " Robert Southey , Esq. , to Dr. Bell . KzswmcK , Ocf. 11 , 1811 . " My dear Sir ,  --  This evening I have sent off the conclusion of a long , and I trust , conclusive article to the Quarterly . Had there been time , it should have passed under your eye ; but it has occupied me much longer than I expected , because I have been very solicitous to strike as hard a blow as possible : it is so hard , that you will see your desire upon your enemies . I have managed better about the passage which has been the occasion of so much false accusation , than the British Reviewer did ; for I have admitted its inconsistency , shown in what manner your very zeal for the furtherance of your great object betrayed you into it , and then made a thundering charge of malice and calumny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in direct contradiction to the whole tenor of the book . " No further proof is needed , that we must not judge of the character of either litigant from the controversy that raged between their partisanswhat was so written being in the spirit of advocacy , not of justice . Leaving this disagreeable part of the subject , we must content ourselves with referring the reader to the volumes before us , for an account of the manner in which the system spread itself ultimately . It was all along antagonized by the Lancasterian , which , nevertheless , if we may be permitted to use philosophical language , was manifested as a correspondent opposite , in obedience to a law generally recognized both by Mr. Southey and Coleridge , but strangely forgotten by them while engaged in the dispute on the subject before us . The royal and noble patronage which had at first been acquired for the Lancastenan system , had been now turning itself to Dr. Bell 's . The queen made an application to the National Society for a person to organize the Windsor school on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention among foreigners , which probably induced Dr. Bell to propose a continental tour ; which , after visiting the north of England and Scotland , he undertook . Soon after his return to England , he was gratified by permission to visit her Majesty , as the guest of the Princess Elizabeth . Nor was this the only honorable notice that he received ; the archbishop offered him a stall at Hereford : difficulties arising in the way of this , he was presented to one in Westminster . A place of worship also had been set apart for the Central School , and gave him an opportunity of showing his generosity in presenting to it a service of sacramental plate , which was done under peculiar circumstances that involved him in much unexpected expense . This period of his life manifests great activity . He went from 1*3 // place to place , still engaged on his apostolic errand , diffusing the blessing of education wherever he could . There is , however , appointed an end to all earthly labor ; and , in September of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lost the power of articulation , and was obliged to communicate his wishes by means of a slate and pencil ; still his mind remained vigorous . He showed great anxiety about the posthumous publication of his writings-a complete edition of which he desired to be undertaken by Mr. Wordsworth and Mr. Southey . Mrs. Wordsworth took a journey to Cheltenham for the purpose of coming to some arrangement ; but the result was unsatisfactory . " Dr. Bell 's views were in a very unsettled state , both respecting the disposal of his property and the publication of his works ; and owing to this and the irritability of his temper , Mrs. Wordsworth 's visit was anything but one of pleasure . He seems now to have thought that his present illness would be fatal to him ; and on Mr. Marriott 's leaving Cheltenham , ( whose visit we shall presently have occasion to notice , ) he gave his gold repeater into his charge , as a memorial , to be presented to Lord Kenyon ; and he directed that some boxes , containing part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of George the Fourth , should be sent off at once to Miss Marianne Kenyon . He also wrote at this time to Lord Kenyon , requesting that he would destroy all his Apology , and other papers which had the least of controversy concerning Sherburn hospital in them , that were in his possession . My work , ' he said , may be said to be done , as far as my earthly existence extends ; and it is most fitting and right that everything which savors of disputation or controversy be buried in the grave with me . ' To this Lord Kenyon replied , that his commands to him with respect to any publication or correspondence ever entrusted to him , he might rely on it , should be faithfully observed : but he added ,  --  ' As , however , no one can tell what time may produce , I should not think it expedient to destroy any documents , but to preserve such , solely for the purpose of irresistibly refuting falsehoods , should falsehoods be uttered , when the means for their refutation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion Dr. Bell appears to have acquiesced , since he neither repeated this request , nor did he himself destroy all those papers on this subject which were in his own possession . During his illness , however , he committed many of his papers to the flames , which , On the whole , was perhaps a fortunate circumstance for his biographer ; for , having throughout his life till now , preserved every letter and even note he received , had he not destroyed some of them , the composition of his Life would have been still more difficult and laborious than it has been ; while it is highly improbable that any new information of importance could have been derived from them . " Another incident occurred , which is character-istic " Meantime Miss Bell had manifested a great wish to visit her brother at Cheltenham , and with some reluctance he consented that she should do so ; but no sooner had he given his consent , than he again recalled it , and wrote to her to that effect . She had , however , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arrival at Cheltenham , she was affectionately received by her brother . For some weeks they lived very happily together , and by a deed of conveyance , dated the 17th of May , he made over to her Lindsay cottage and grounds , whereby she was admitted tenant and proprietor of it , though he retained possession of it until his death . On the day following the date of this deed , Dr. Bell also delivered to her the following letter : Yesterday I surrendered to you the cottage and grounds , and all the appurtenances and premises belonging to them ; and accordingly , I now proceed to deliver up , give , and present to you all my furniture , goods and chattels , books and letters , and MSS. , here and at Sherburn house , the carpet and the covering of the coronation chair which fell to me at the coronation of King George the Fourth ; and elsewhere , my silver plate , gold coins , rings , chaiiis and trinkets , money and cash , here and at Messrs . Pitt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to me by the vestry of the Cowgate Episcopal Chapel at Edinburgh , and the sacramental plate presented to me by my Indian pupils , of which a duplicate was presented to the chapel of the National School , Ely-place , London , you have to deliver to the minister and vestry , for the time being , of the Episcopal chapel of St. Andrews . ' Two days after this was written , the doctor put a slip of paper into his sister 's hand , with these words upon it : - Bequeath my gold chain and medal to the Madras college , St. Andrews . ' At present Dr. Bell was on good tennis with his sister ; but , unhappily , circumstances soon afterwards occurred , which caused an entire breach between them , and which , however painful it may be to do so , I must here briefly mention , as silence on this point would probably lead to erroneous impressions of Dr. Bell 's conduct , and lay him open to the charge of unjust and capricious treatment of his sister . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in a fit state to make a will , and she accordingly expressed her conviction to others that he was not in his right mind . ' This was more to be regretted than wondered at , when we consider the immense property which Dr.Bell possessed , and the natural expectation which she must have entertained of sharing largely , in common with his other relations , in his accumulated wealth . Be this , however , as it may , by some means or other , Dr. Bell began to suspect his sister 's intentions ; and having ascertained , beyond a doubt , how matters stood , he put a paper into her hands , stating that it was necessary for his health and peace that she should immediately leave his house , and giving her the choice of St. Andrews , London , or Malvern . She accordingly chose the latter place , and at once proceeded there . " Mr. Southey also visited Dr , Bell , with a view of assisting in arranging the disposal of the property he had accumulated . The subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no space to enter . Dr. Bell died January 27 , 1832 , aged seventynine years . The elements of his character were , a strong mind , with great perseverance , a rigorous sense of order , and a great stock of worldly prudence . 154 // From the Athen*um . The Attach6 ; or , Sam Slick in England . By the author of " The Clockmaker . " Second and Last Series . 2 vols . Bentley . THE Clockmaker 's last revelations were so truly diverting , that the present ones will be anxiously looked for . They will be read , we may at once add , without disappointment . Nevertheless , one or two differences have passed over Sam . Good society has not " taken the shine " out of his impudent shrewdness , nor blunted the edge of his acute common-sense ; hut it seems to have called out a certain sentimentality , ( soft sawder of a new quality , ) which we like less than his sarcastic humor . Perhaps  --  and the phenomenon may be noted as distinctive-no professedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mirthful and the pathetic own one and the same source in a superior fineness of sensibility . How far the success has been as universal as the attempt , is entirely another question , the discussion of which would be out of place , when the public is wanting to hear the Clockmaker turned Diplomatist , holding forth on our behavior , institutions , and such delicate subjects . As early as his eighth page , the incomparable Sam treats us to a reading of the civility of our high civilization , well worth pondering , and in any case very droll . The scene is the Liners ' Hotel at Liverpool , in the corner of which " sat or stood the barmaid , for the purpose of receiving and communicating orders : " " Look at that gall , " said Mr. Slick , " ai nt she a smasher ? What a tall , well-made , handsome piece of furniture she is , ai nt she ? Look at her hair , ai nt it neat ? and her clothes fit so well , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her complexion so clear , arid she looks so good-natured , and smiles so sweet , it does one good to look at her . She is a whole team and a horse to spare , that gall ,  --  that s a fact . I go and call for two or three glasses of brandy-cocktail more than I want every day , just for the sake of talking to her . She always says , What will you be pleased to have , sir ? ' Somethin ' , ' says I , that I ca n't have , ' lookin ' at her pretty mouth about the wickedest ; well , she laughs , for she knows what I mean , and says , P'r'aps you will have a glass of bitters , sir P and she goes and gets it . Well , this goes on three or four times a day , every time the identical same tune , only with variations . About an hour afore you come in I was there agin .

You ca n't tell that till you try , ' says she ; but you can have your bitters at any rate , ' and she drawed a glass and gave it to me . It taint so bad , that , is it ? Well , now she has seed you before , and knows you very well ; go to her and see how nicely she will courtshy , bow pretty she will smile , and how ladylike she will say , How do you do , sir I hope you are quite well , sir ; have you just arrived ? *Here chambermaid , show this gentleman to No. 200. - Sorry , sir , we are so full , but to-morrow we will move you into a better room. - Thomas , take up this gentleman 's luggage ; ' and then she d courtshy agin , and smile handsome . Do n't that look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , eh ? if you do you are hard to please , that s all . But stop a bit , do n't be in such an everlastin ' almighty hurry : think afore you speak : go there agin-set her a smilin ' once more , and look close . It s only skin deep-just on the surface , like a cat 's paw on the water , it s nothin ' but a rimple like , and no more ; then look closer still and you will desearn the color of it . I see you laugh at the color of a smile , but still watch and you 11 see it . Look now , do n't you see the color of the shilling there , it s white , and cold , and silvery ,  --  it s a bought smile , and a bought smile , like an artificial flower , has no sweetness in it . There is no natur ' - it s a cheat-it s a pretty cheat-it do n't ryle you none , but still it s a cheat . It s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all in , and shut your lips down on it tight , and it s nothin ' - it s only a mouthful of moonshine ; yes , it s a pretty cheat , that s a fact . This ai nt confined to the women nother . Petticoats have smiles and courtshys , and the trowsers bows and scrapes and mylords for you , there ai nt no great difference that way ; so send for the landlord . Lardner , ' says you , Sir , ' says he , and he makes you a cold , low , deep , formal bow , as much as to say , Speak , lord , for thy sarvant is a dog . ' I want to go to church to-morrow , ' says you ; what church do you recommend ? ' Well , he eyes you all over , careful , afore he amwers , so as not to bark up a wrong tree .
