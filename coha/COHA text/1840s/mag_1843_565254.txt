txt IT would seem to be admitted as an established axiom in the philosophy of history , that the character of a people in its early life , involves the condition of its ultimate destiny . Hence the great importance attached to faithful portraitures of the founders of states , and the necessity of a right record of the principles which formed the basis of their systems of civil polity and religious faith . A key is thus furnished by which to account , in a great measure , for the developments of every subsequent age . Havi ngthe eye fixed upon the events of the past in their succession , and being acquainted with the influences which gave them their origin and distinctive form , we generally find our present experience according with our natural anticipations , while we are enabled to read the future with almost prophetic certainty . " Armed with the twofold knowledge of HISTORY and the HUMAN MIND , " says Mr. Coleridge , " a man will scarcely err in his judgment concerning the sum total of any future national event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rich with the adventures and sacrifices of the best of men in their efforts to found a new empire . They succeeded in their enterprise , and died with the full assurance of a remembrance in the hearts of a grateful posterity " till the world 's end . " Our annals hitherto have afforded nothing more worthy of national pride , than the events which transpired at this early period . The leading principles of all the peculiar forms of American society , were at that time established by the fathers of New England . They originated the American idea of a civil constitution , providing at once liberty and security to all on condition of obe dience to laws enacted by the popular will . Their popular system of a free government has continued for more than two centuries unchanged in all its essential features . If we are so much indebted to our predecessors , it is a most irnperative duty to bring forth to the light of our times their true character and principles . And the dictates of the purest patriotism , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their memory should be made by the historians of this passing generation , and transmitted to those who are to come after us . No future period can be so favorable to make historical collections , and to correct the numerous misapprehensions which prevail as to the real character and purposes of the Puritans . Assuredly a great work will have been accomplished , when all sections of our wide republic shall forget their local jealousies , and learn to regard Plymouth IRock with reverence , as the basis from whence has arisen the superstructure of a new civilization which is to immortalize the American name . Nor will the impression which the truth , when well understood , will make in foreign countries be less happy . The permanence of our infant institutions is yet regarded by many abroad as problematical . But civil and religious freedom are among the oldest of our anclent things ; and it is much to be doubted whether the last two centuries have witnessed in the old world any thing , either in modes of government or forms of religious faith , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions *rhich American Puritanism brought into being and has thus far sustained . There has surely been some occasion of national reproach , in the // indifference of too many , even of our scholars , relative to our colonial his tory , especially when we find Mr. Alison sustaining his accusation against us by so respectable authority as De Tocqueville , wh6m he quotes as saying , " that so regardless are the Americans of historical records or monuments , that half a century hence their history , even of their own times , could only be written from the archives of other nations . " We believe , however , that reflective minds among us , are beginning to feel the importance of this great subject . The formation of historical associations in different parts of New England , are indications of an increasing interest . A rich accession has been made . to our literature by the labors of Mr. Sparks , in his publication of the writings of Washington and Franklin , the great impersonations of the valor and the wisdom of the Revolution . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the historic traveler , in every stage of which there will be found instances of as devoted patriotism as any which shone in the more conspicuous era of the Revolution . The five generations who lived , and labored , and passed away before the contest with the British crown , were never in bondage to any foreign domination . They owned the authority of the English monarch , because they needed his protection ; but they obeyed the laws which they themselves enacted . The historian of New England colonization needs other qualifications than an accurate knowledge of statistics , or the power of pleasing description . He must be able to appreciate the nature of those principles which led the first colonists from their native shores , or he will he likely to confound their simplicity of character , and devoted patriotism , with the faults of their age , and weaknesses common to humanity . He will mistake the depth and earnestness of their piety , for what their enemies have termed the follies of a stern and rigid superstition . If , however , he apprehends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they cherished above all price , he will award to them the high honor of having founded an ecclesiastical system , more in harmony with democratic institutions , than any that the world had seen . And though the idea of universal toleration was not at first recognized as it is now understood ; yet it is their praise , that an absolute and perfect religious freedom has grown up , as the natural product of their institutions . That the great body of the American Puritans were political or religious enthusiasts , in any dishonorable sense of the word , during any period of their colonial history , is an aspersion from which we express our utter dissent . The term Puritan first appears in the reign of Elizabeth , as the court appellation of a party demanding the farther reformation of the church of England . Long and bitter controversies arose , which were never terminated till the expulsion of the house of Stuart from the British throne . At the revolution of 1688 , the Puritans obtained satifaction in relation to most of the essential principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights were secured by the British constitution , and the enjoyment of their religious opinions and worship was granted by an act of parliament , extending equal toleration to all dissenters from the established church , except Roman Catholics and Unitarians . From the fact that Puritanism does not appear in the form of a party organization , after the accession of William and Mary , it has been very common for late English writers to speak of it as a historic relic , rather than as a living spirit , still efficient and predominant . Nothing // can be more erroneous than such an impression . The causes which led to the settlement of the American colonies , and afterwards to the revolutions of 1648 and 1688 , were the results of a social movement , hardly less important than that of the Reformation of the preceding century . Protestantism restored vitality to the Christian church-Puritanism was destined to complete the work of religious reform , and relieve mankind from the bondage of civil despotism . Indeed , in its historic character it must be regarded as social rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a member of the state , and as a worshiper in the church , rather than as the champion for any particular forms of faith or worship . If it became a sect , it became such by being persecuted , and expelled from the church , which it sought to purify and reform . Driven forth into the wilderness , it established for itself those forms and usages of which our New England churches and states are the depositories . As soon , however , as the Puritans had secured the establishment of their own institutions , they granted toleration to all forms of Christian doctrine , in strict accordance with their principles . Indeed the mission of Puritanism every where has been to ameliorate the social condition . Speaking of the Puritans of the sixteenth century , in the days of Elizabeth , Dr. Arnold , in his lectures on modern history , says , " If we examine the case closely , we shall find that in strictness they were a political party , and that the changes which they wanted to introduce were political ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious , if we apprehend the distinetton involved in these words more accurately than seems to be done by the common usage of them . " Thus we find , that in its earliest as well as latest developments in Eng land , Puritanism*embodied the genuine ideas of Saxon liberty , and the exalted patriotism of the British race . It was for that reason , rigid and resolute in the maintenance of its rights , but liberal in the administration of authority , and never the advocate of injustice and oppression , not even of its enemies . Hume , the defender of the Stuart dynasty , and the most inveterate opponent of the manners and religious tenets of the Puritans , has honored their love of liberty in an eulogium as remarkable , considering the source from whence it comes , as it is historically just . The origin of Puritanism , and its results during that most eventful period of English history , to which we have referred , are to us chiefly important , as they enable us to estimate correctly its triumphs on a wider field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were destined as the chief means in the political renovation of Europe . At least they were the prominent pioneers in the great work . The pilgrims of Lincolnshire had entered on their mission but a few years before , and in the world of Columbus a new civilization was to be born . Love of liberty burned in the hearts of both alike . The Puritans , during the reign of the Stuarts , were true Englishmen , with hearts beating high with the pride of a people who had been a thousand years distinguished , and not one jot or tittle of the same precious inheritance , did their brethren , the Pilgrims , renounce , when they came hither to found an empire of their own . But while they sought objects that were similar in their nature , and while they sympathized warmly for each other , the courses allotted by Providence for the attainment of their ends , were as diverse as can well be conceived . The progress of English liberty was attended with all the difficulties which always arise , when the projudices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The friends of freedom , in their zeal for innovation often misjudged , as to the temper of their times . They often attempted to subvert when they could only modify and ameliorate . They sometimes contended as earnestly for the forms as for the principles of popular institutions . The nation at length became weary of the conflict , and the popular party compromised much in the revolution of 1688 , for the sake of which some of the best blood of England had been shed . Such , men as Hampden , and Vane , and Milton , would have been satisfied only with institutions which , in their external costume would have much resembled the popular constitutions of American Puritanism . But the existing state of European society , rendered the ideas of these men impracticable . In their enthusiasm , they anticipated the universal regeneration of mankind as near at hand , and like the millenarians of our day , appear not only to have misunderstood the prophetic chronology of the Scriptures , but also to have greatly overestimated the importance of their direct agency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they performed a great work , although they least of all anticipated the events which were introduced by their labors , and which now stand revealed to our eyes , by the light of two centuries . They made England the home of a free people , although they could not destroy the regal establishment . The monarchy sustained by the loyalty of the realm , and the recollections of its ancient glory , was united with the strong power of the popular element , and thus formed , the British constitution soon gave Great Britain the predominance among all nations . Mankind are yet to rejoice in the consummation of that high destiny , by which Providence seemed to have designed her , as the almoner of her laws and the blessings of the Protestant faith to the most distant dependencies of her vast empire . In tracing the progress of American Puritanism , a succession of events is presented , which finds no parallel in English history ; not even during the commonwealth . The pilgrims appear as the founders of states . They wished to enjoy those institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land of their fathers ; and they labored to plant the wilderness with wholly a right seed . They fled from their oppressors before the great battles in defense of English liberty had been fought . The constitution of Robinson 's church was revolutionary in relation to the prelatical pretensions of the establishment , and therefore opposed to the authority of the civil power . The noblest spirits of the British islands could not longer remain on their native soil , and their pilgrimage was commenced . In Holland they found the field circumscribed . They needed a world for their habitation , for they bad a world of work to do . They founded states where the highest degree of rational liberty was entirely consistent with the rigid restraints of just laws . They provided for the instruction of all classes of the community , and established colleges for the cultivation of letters . They made liberal provision for the religious training of the people , relying mainly on the divine precepts of the Scriptures for controlling the conduct of men . They loved the primitive forms of Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she came down from heaven , and caring little for the trammels and fantastic drapery which the traditions of the elders and the superstitions of the monasteries had thrown around her , and which had almost concealed the beauty and glory of that simplicity which belongs to whatever is divine . // Thus they brought with them to this place of their refuge , liberty , letters , and religion in its purity , and with these elements , they laid the foundation of what may properly be called the highest style of Christian civilization . Their enterprise was begun in weakness , and for a long time was carried on in obscurity ; but it was the fit mode to ensure success . Such a work needed centuries to unfold and perfect the great design . A nation 's founders , if they are just and wise men , are from their station and labors , the greatest of its benefactors . Hence among the ancients , the earliest heroes of a people were numbered among its tutelary deities , and even in the early annals of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscured by time , romance and song have not less clearly expressed the feelings of national pride and partiality . Our ancestors require aids of romance to set them in their proper light . Let only a perfect record of what they did , and what they designed , be made by the historian who would honor them most . The truth will be stranger than fiction . They will need no higher deification . Among our fathers , the name of Robinson stands conspicuous , for he must be regarded as the great apostle of American Puritanismalthough he was never permitted to accompany his flock in their pilgrimage to " freedom 's holy land . " Indeed , none of the great reformers of the preceding century is more deserving of celebrity . He was not surpassed , even by Luther himself , in many of those qualities which belong to a master mind . Nor was the work he was destined to accomplish , of much less importance in the blessings it was to confer on July , mankind . He had not that striking , commanding impetuosity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would have proved fatal to his cause if he had possessed it ; but he had equal integrity , with more mildness , and with a moral firmness the most uncompromising . He swerved not from the path of right in the days of persecution , attended with imminent perils . He was alike unmoved by the voice of praise , and declined the honorable proposals made to him by the Leyden professors , who would have induced him to accept emolument and place for himself in the university . He chose rather to suffer affliction , and refused to be separated from his beloved pilgrim flock . His disinterestedness is perhaps the most prominent of his virtues . Although he may be called the founder of a new church , he was entirely free from the ambition of apostleship , and did every thing in his power to discountenance a bigoted attachment to himself , which the great excellence of his character might have very naturally produced among his followers . Especially did he renounce with great earnestness , all pretensions to be regarded as an authority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the religious controversies of the day , and a powerful disputant with the most eminent theologians of the period when Arminius and Episcopius flourished , as the doctors of Amsterdam have borne ample testimony . His liberality deserves honorable mention , which was especially displayed towards those ; who , on account of his faith , had driven him into exile . This appears from his controversy with the Brownists , with whom some respectable historians have erroneously identified the church of Robinson . He denounced their exclusiveness , and declared his readiness to commune with the church of England and // his approval of her doctrines , and expressed his opposition only to her prelatical pretensions . Who among the great names we are accustomed to venerate , displayed greater moral firmness than Robinson in the execution of his purposes ? Both his object and his plans seemed to be attended with almost insuperable difficulties . In the general estimation of the world at that time , the realization of his hopes was at least as problematical as the existence of another continent before the days of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of principles which he knew to be true , although the world denounced them as delusions , and the belief of them as a sin . Banished from his native land , with peril of martyrdom if he should return , he was doomed to dwell among strangers , not having the sympathies of whole provinces , nor receiving the smiles and safe conduct of princes , as did Luther when he went forth to war with wickedness in high places . He was compelled to suffer reproach without commiseration . Not only the Catholics , but the Protestant world also looked on with indifference , or to ridicule the man who dared to assert the necessity of a progressive reformation in the church , and who had started the chimerical project of a church-state on the bleak barren coasts of North America , " amid wilde beasts and wilde men . " Yet he failed not fearlessly to point out the defects of the Reformation , in an age when the influence of its burning and shining light was at its spring-tide , and especially to plead against hierarchical oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all hope of the farther progress of religious reform and freedom in the state , he earnestly set himself and his faithful followers , to prepare for their great mission to the new world . And now there was wanting something besides the zeal of a reformer , to inspire a consistent as well as undying devotion to the cause in which they had engaged . Mere enthusiasm might indeed have led them to embark in an enterprise far more hopeless . There was needed the sound wisdom of the philosopher , combined with what is much more rarely met with , the patience and practical discretion of the great statesman , to render successful this novel scheme of colonization . The memorials that yet remain , though defective , are enough to show that he possessed all these qualifications in a high degree . For eleven years he instructed his people in Holland , and then they were ready to depart . That probationary period of the pilgrims , under the tuition of such a pastor as Robinson , is a chapter in their history , full of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences as to the future character of the colonists , and the institutions they were to establish . When we subsequently wit* ness the wisdom of Carver and Bradford , the approved piety and meekness of Brewster , " their ruling elder , " the courage of Standish , and the patience and fortitude of all , even the weakest of the pilgrims , when perils and perplexity came upon them , we can be at no loss to discover the grounds of that attachment and reverence which they always expressed for " the excellent Mr. Robinson , " as well as the nature of the instructions he bad given them . It was during this period also that Mr. Robinson stood in the relation of the great Jewish lawgiver to the children of Israel in the wilderness , being the founder of the civil polity as well as the religious code of his people . He did not indeed prescribe for them definite formularies for their social organization , but he had most thoroughly imbued their minds with all the great principles of civil and religious liberty . Like Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // flock in their pilgrimage , he was not permitted to enter with them the promised land . But he accompanied them to the water-side on the day of their embarkation , to give them his benediction , and to comfort them in the sorrows of that separation , which they , the first of their emigrant race , were the first to suffer . Had we no other memorial than the address he gave them when they left the city of Leyden , that alone would be sufficient to immortalize his name . We venture to say , that no document in the religious history of Europe is more worthy of consideration , and that no assemblage ever convened under circumstances of more thrilling interest , than did the church of Robinson on the day of fasting and prayer preparatory to the embarkation . They were not assuredly an assemblage of enthusiasts , although the occasion of their coming together was so unwonted and strange . Emotions too deep for tears pervade their solemn meeting , whilst those who are to remain behind are thinking of the separation on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the counsels of their faithful pastor . So appropriately does his address accord with the true nature and destiny of their expedition , that we might almost be justified in the idea , that it was inspired by a presentiment of the glorious results as they stand unfolded to our own view . The loftiest principles of religious liberty , are uttered in language of impressive brevity , of matchless pathos , of the most catholic spirit , and without one word of railing accusation toward those who had been the occasion of all their sufferings . " Words , " says Prince , the yenerable New England chronologist , " almost astonishing in that age of low and universal bigotry , which then prevailed in the English nation ; wherein this truly great and learned nian seems almost the only divine , who was capable of rising into a noble freedom of thinking and practicing in religious matters , and even of urging such an equal liberty on his own people . He labors to take them off from their attachment to him , that they might be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This address of Robinson is well worthy to be regarded as the Magna Charta of the conscience , till the end of time . It should be forever taught in all the schools and churches of the descendants of the Puritans . It should be read at the ordination of every New England pastor . We lately heard it on such an occasion . Nothing could exceed its appropriateness . It has already become the creed of a mighty people . It will , crc long , triumph over the proudest spiritual dominations of the world . If the last act of the pilgrims , on bidding adieu to the old world , was most befitting their great undertaking , their first transaction was no less appropriate and significant , when they approached the shores of the new . This was the formation of their civil compact , in the cabin of the Mayflower . We will not here describe its provisions or its principles . The eloquent words of De Tocqueville declare , respecting it , that " a democracy more perfect than any which antiquity had dreamed of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that American civilization was so constituted by its founders , as to be " the result ( and this should be constantly present to the mind , ) of two distinct elements , which , in other places , have been in frequent hostility ; but which , in America , have been admirably incorporated and combined with each other . I allude to the spirit of religion , and the spirit of liberty . " It is often said , by those who would withhold due praise from such men as Robinson , Carver , Bradford , and Davenport , that they could not com // prehend the results of their own labors , nor even understand fully the nature of the principles they professed ; and therefore their merits are to be estimated by what they accomplished for themselves and their contemporaries . Let it be admitted that success is the proper criterion of merit , and that praise should be awarded to great actions , and not to good intentions never executed ; still a just view of the American Puritans , will assign them a high place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their enterprise depended on time , as one of the elements in their original designs . Their glory consists , then , in having begun the work in the right manner ; and their merits are to be measured by their ideas and anticipations , wherein they could not complete what they commenced . Their ends were clearly apprehended , and their deliberations as to the future , were in the main , directed by the convictions of a cool reason , and a religious regard for their posterity . The results which they themselves lived to witness , do not fill up the measure of their glory . The sailing of three small ships from the port of Palos , was an occurrence no way distinguished , except in the unheard of object of the voyage ; and when at length land was descried , it was but an insignificant island , a mere appendage of the boundless continent . But the praise of Columbus , is in no way proportioned to the extent of his own actual explorations , nor aught diminished by the fact , that other European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recur to the embarkation at Delfts Haven , or the civil administrations of Carver and Davenport , we shall witness transactions in little keeping with the pageantry and costume , which clothe even the trivial acts of princes and parliaments , with an adventitious consideration . The hut of the Missourian emigrant may be a comfortable abode , compared with the wretched shanty in which the adventurers of the Mayflower first found refuge , and in which they held their early legislative courts . But there were men of might even in those primitive assemblies , and in their simple discussions , the identical doctrines of liberty were recognized , which , in the stirring times of the Revolution , a hundred and fifty years after , were heard from the lips of the Adamses , and Franklin , and Hancock , in the hall of independence-a fact which has not escaped the notice of the philosophical Guizot . We do ourselves , as a people , not only great mischief , but great injustice , when we count the past the day of small things , in comparison with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , would lead us to the conclusion , that from the point we now occupy , the past is to assume , in the minds of all reflecting men and true patriots , an importance as deeply interesting as is the value of our dearest hopes of the future . " The past , " says Mr. Webster , " is at least secure . " It can not but be treasonable , to treat it with scorn or ridicule . For that people can not be destined to a long or a prosperous career , who are regardless of the names and virtues of those who laid the foundations of its NATIONAL MANNERS , and its NATIONAL RENOWN . The manners of the American people , are at once the origin and only security of all their popular forms of government . they are the resultants of national associations , habits , prejudices , and opinions . They are not the growth of a day , or subject to sudden vicissitudes . They belong to the necessary laws of national existence , and will continue so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality . Amid all mutations and improvements of its external condition , these will be retained and grow more vig // orous , with the maturity of the national life . It is not uncommon , however , to meet with speculations sanctioned by those for whom a high degree of respectability is claimed , which countenance the idea that something better is needed , as a predominant element in American manners , than the Puritanism of New England . Hence at home and in foreign countries , it is spoken of by its enemies with reproach , and as the means of doing this most efficiently , the effort is made to confound it with sectarianism ; keeping out of sight as much as possible , the fact of its historical character , as being social , rather than as the index of a particular system of religious faith . Thus its great achievements and important destinies , in the progress of American civilization , are concealed by the ambition of real sectarians , or by the hostility of heartless demagogues , who dread the social restraints exerted by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the universal degeneracy of manners . We hear it said by some , that a revolution is at hand , or already in progress , that is to effect great changes in the religious usages of our fathers . Particularly has it been affirmed beyond the Atlantic , by those who have taken it upon themselves to manufacture opinions and facts , . for our special benefit , that Puritanism is fast losing ground among us , as appears most evident from the rapid advance of papacy and prelacy of all sorts , in the United States ; and there are not wantin* those on this side of the water , who respond to the notion that all Protestant Christendom is becoming weary of its restless search of novelties , and is longing to return to that repose where the law of deference to the Vatican , or perhaps to some more " ancient universal hierarchy , " was every where respected and obeyed . From another class of writers , perfectly the opposite of this , comes the announcement , that the end of Puritanism draweth near . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to them ; the makers and venders of philosophical fancywork of the latest fashion . They profess to be well versed in German literature , and are perfectly entranced with the rhapsodies of Jean Paul Richter . They speak of great social revolutions , and philosophical millenniums , and the reign of " liberal Christianity . " Not long since , a band of the most resolute of these world reformers , emigrated from the capital of New England , and penetrated as far into the wilderness as the town of Roxbury , where , according to the latest accounts , the colony is still surviving , although in a sickly condition . Its future pros . pects seem endangered by the later project of the Fourier associations . These men have little true reverence for the past , although they dwell among the earliest graves of the pilgrims . They and those who hold a literary fellowship with them , speak of the Puritans as merely the pioneers of the bright day of which they are the luminaries . They do even garnish the sepulchers of such as were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the oldest " religious societies " in Boston and its vicinity , and may honor them as the " great , earnest men of their time , " whose political views were indeed well enough conceived and adapted to their social condition . But their philosophical and religious speculations were " according to the light they had , " and must now retire from the presence of more " rational " and " liberal " dispensations . If it is true that their religious tenets were the delusions of weak and wayward minds , or their works were temporary in their benefits and good influence , then verily they had their reward in the enjoyment // of temporary success , and temporary honors . If the pilgrims of the Mayflower , and their successors , did not do something for the cause of civil liberty , that will endure ; if they did not do something for an immutable morality , and the " permanent " as well as " transient " in Christianity , then let oblivion hide from our sight men of short perspective , and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either the abettors of foreign " tractators , " who would again bring back into the world the obsolete wisdom of past folly , or we will fall down the devoutest heroworshipers of the latest illuminati , who would have us believe they have discovered all past wisdom to be folly . It is most true that the Puritans lived and labored with the firmest faith , that what they accomplished would endure . They sought not the world 's approval of their conduct , for a banishment , ocean wide , had quite separated them from all European sympathy . They knew , however , that the eye of posterity would be ever on them ; and under the full conviction that they were to be patterns of holy living and dying for all time to come , it was not unnatural for them to adopt laws and a system of manners , the rigidity of which was shocking to the liberalism of the court of Charles II . But , however far short of our standards of perfection they may have come , they have a right to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what they actually accomplished in behalf of civil liberty , and for the example which they gave of devotion to truth , to God , and to the welfare of unborn generations . The vast structure of American civilization was mainly reared by their instrumentality , and we think it can be said with entire truth , that the influence of no one sect of Christians , at the present time , does more to preserve and per feet our social system , than that which is the representative of the genuine old fashioned Puritanism of Plymouth rock . We would not be understood as treating lightly the veneration which Christians of other lands have for their patrial forms of worship , many of which are more ancient and venerable than our own . Our temporal life , how varied soever it may be in its external circumstances , will be closely allied , by a thousand associations , with the life that is to come . And these may be as strong and salutary within a Puritan sanctuary , as under Gothic arches , consecrated with a lord prelate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity of sects in our own New England , foundedona conscientious difference of opinion or taste . We have no desire to see realized again in the world 's history , the idea of a universal church . The expectation of such an event in the universal domination of any one of the numerous Christian sects , is a chimera . That the peace of mankind , and the prosperity of vital religion , depends upon denominational divisions , is a far more rational idea . The millennium of church supremacy , is most clearly discernible in the past , and not in the future . American Puritanism will accomplish one great end of its destiny , if it shall prevent a recurrence of what was so disastrous to true Christian liberty-that liberty which imparts to every sect and every conscience , independence upon earth , while at the same time , " The pledge is given , One monarch to obey , one creed to own , That monarch , God ; that creed , his word alone . " We have alluded to opinions which oppose the spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence is not an essential element of American society , and that something better can be substituted in its room . These errors being 1843. *361 // the offspring of an erroneous philosophy , or of a superstitious attachment to the antique usages of foreign countries , may prevail so extensively , as at length to excite serious apprehension . But a greater and more immediate danger is to he feared from a more numerous class , who are under no such influence as has been referred to . We mean those who deny the necessity , and even the utility , of the conservative restraints of any form of religious belief , in any department of the social system . We mean those , especially , who , in matters of civil legislation , " mean license , when they cry liberty . " We mean , also , the multitudes of those who are almost entirely ignorant of the true history of New England , and who can not , therefore , appreciate the real character of those who , in weakness and peril , laid the strong foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We mean those , moreover , who seem to be born only to be repositories of the errors and faults of their ancestors , instead of their virtues . A generation bath arisen , with many of whom it would seem our heroic age is likely to be remembered , only to be ridiculed and reviled . In this work of desecration , it forms no part of their purpose , to award the tribute of merit to the principles which , in the main , actuated those whose conduct could not always be approved , inasmuch as humanity is frail ; but the conduct of the men of a former age , is scanned by the light of the present , for the obvious purpose of reviling the best of principles . With the recklessness of political partisans , in assailing the public and private reputation of their living rivals , the holy dead are dragged mercilessly from their tombs , to answer for the errors of former centuries . Thus in the frequent charges we hear against the Puritans , for a want of conformity to the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproach upon the faith they loved , and which is still cherished with affection by the mass of their descendants . But mention is not made of the fact , that the Puritans themselves , broke down the barriers which they had at first set up , to protect their own churches , in the infancy of the colonies , and that in the state of Connecticut all sects were admitted to equal privileges with the Puritan churches , a long age before these nineteenth century champions of toleration , could possibly begin their labors of liberality . The same class of persons always select the Puritans of Massachusetts as subjects of malediction , for believing in witchcraft , and the inhabitants of Salem and Boston are regarded as sinners above all men of that generation , because they hung sundry persons , supposed to be witches , in conformity with a doctrine deemed scriptural throughout Christendom , alike by Papist , Churchman , and Puritan , and in conformity with legal maxims , approved by the highest judicial authorities in England , more than a century later . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Puritans were the first people in the world to detect this delusion , and that the Puritan ministers in general were the foremost in denouncing it , and that it was banished from New England more than a hundred years before these modern denouncers of dead men 's prejudices , were born . In claiming so much for the honor of New England manners , as being the origin and principal conservator of American liberty , we are aware that our declarations conflict with the opinions of many of our contemporaries , who have honestly enough come by them . In the hostility of rival sections ; in the neverceasing strife of political parties ; in the acrimony and jealousy of a thousand interested sects , it is not strange that many things in the past should be overlooked or misrepre // sented , in the common struggle for notoriety and dominion . But surely it does not become those who are devoted to literary pursuits , or political ambition , to be the victims of prejudices , which tarnish the bright honor of that country which is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be enrolled the record of their fame . Nor should those who resort to institutions of learning , for the lessons of practical life , or to prepare for a professional career , depart from those seats of wisdom , in profound ignorance of this necessary condition of society in our own country , and indeed in every country , that there is hardly an object of solid worth , either in the private possessions , or patriotic associations , or the religious institutions of mankind , for which they are not very much indebted to the generations that have preceded them . But New England is not to be in future , the representative of the national manners ; she has already become a small portion of the great Union of states , to which she has given her own free constitutions . Her institutions were planted on bleak and barren hills , by the hand of patient toil . What will be the effect of the rich soil of the Mississippi valley , even if it should be wholly planted by New England emigrants ? And again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of the west , occasioned by its political power , and boundless wealth ? There is something , indeed , in the onward progress of our civilization to the great central seat of its habitation , which is more impressive than the heavy tread of arrayed battalions . A great people have commenced their career of conquest and acquisition , " In life 's morning march , when the hosoin is young . " But its aggressions are peaceful , and not those of violence . Jt is an invasion of unbroken solitudes , and smiling villages and cities , active with the " hum of busy life , " not rapine or ruins , mark its footsteps . This phenomenon , so extraordinary in the world 's history , has attracted the attention of all eyes , and they are anxiously turned to see the distant goal towards which it is directing its way . Who can determine the remote consequences , in a political point of view , which must flow from the energies of a people whose population doubles every twenty-three yeais ? What form of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or please the tastes of the hundred millions , among whom many now in childhood will live to be numbered ? Every will , and voice , and arm , is to be free in the eye of laws enacted and administered by those who are to obey them . Will the spirit of true liberty " rule the free ? " In that wide field , so soon to be filled with thinking immortal intel . ligences , will there be an arena where the human intellect , in its sway of moral power , shall win some of its noblest triumphs ? The rapt inspiration of Berkeley , more than a century ago , announced the consummation of the great histo* nc drama , by " time 's noblest offspring , " in an empire of the west . Can we at this day more distinctly descry such a terminus , as the result of the toil and conflict of nations in their search after social happiness ? Or must we consider such ideas as poetic fancies , and the highest attainments of the social condition to be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profusion ? If the Puritan element in our civilization shall be lost in the overwhelming current of opposing tendencies , we do not say that in a comparison with other nations the American republic may not maintain a conspicuous rank , and that great events may not mark its history . // But they will be such as belong to the past civilization of the old world , while we shall have lost that characteristic which so strikingly distinguishes our own civilization fr'orn all that have yet existed-a civilization antichivalric , antimonarchical indeed , but which has for its great ends whatever is useful and true  --  a civilization whose annals record the triumphs of peace , not those of war and conquest ; and which honors even Washington more for his wisdom as a statesman , than for his prowess in the field  --  a civilization to which even Napoleon himself , in the height of his power , paid homage , not less than to the brightest name it has produced , when he said " the fame of Washington would be immortal among all men , and constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . " Did he , with the presentiment by which minds of the highest order read the future , perceive that he was to be the last of the great heroes of the old civiliza-tion ? These considerations lead us back instinctively to study the institutions of our fathers , and especially their conservative elements . Dangerous opinions and prejudices prevail , but we believe they may be counteracted by a timely opposition . The memory of the New England fathers will be cherished forever by such as choose to dwell by their graves , and are trained after their models . The moral and intellectual power of New England will still remain unimpaired , and by these means she can still sustain with a strong arm the institutions she had the honor first to establish . She can also set f6rth their true nature and history , so as to attract the notice of all beyond her borders who would search for the light , and so as to compel the attention of all who would willingly shun it . To this end measures should be taken to cultivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sons . We do not wish a spirit of exclusiveness or sectional jealousy should be cherished . There is nothing more liberal than genuine New England patriotism , while it is not inconsistent with the strongest local attachments . This feeling can be promoted especially by the pastors of those churches who are the representatives of the religious faith of our ancestors . It is a mistaken idea to suppose that Puritanism was ever antisocial in its tendencies . The Puritan pastor will deem it his first official duty to instruct his flock in the way to heaven ; but he is not a monk or an anchorite . In his private relations he is a citizen , and is entitled to all the sympathies of his fellow citizens . In his public capacity he may not mingle in the petty conflicts of politicians , or contend for the honors or spoils of office . In all that relates to the permanent interests and moral improvement of his people , he has a deep concern , and is invested with a solemn responsibility . He may address the public conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickedness in places of power , and denounce every species of oppression . A religion that does not require all this at the hands of its ministers , is not worth the having . Especially is he , by virtue of his office , made the repository of the " traditions " of the New England " church , " and these he should on all proper occasions and " festivals " faithfully portray . The anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims , or the sabbath nearest to it , might be observed as one of those festival occasions . The event which it commemorates , in its relation to the American church and civil polity , is analogous to that which led to the observance of the passover among the Hebrews ; and to every true son of New England it would seem that the occasion would recur with equal interest . At Plymouth , the 22d of December // has long been known by the endearing appellation of forefathers ' day , and for more than seventy years it has been generally observed with appropriate ceremonies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On this day , also , the " New England Society , " in the metropolis of the Empire State , have for many years paid their tribute of remembrance and affection . " They have lingered round Each spot of ' consecrated ground , And hill and valley blessed ; There where out banished fathers strayed , There where they loved , and wept , and prayed ,  - -  There where their ashes rest . " Why should not *his day be generally observed as a New England festival ? In the " sunny season " we celebrate the anniversary of our national independence with civic processions and rejoicings , and we do well . The idea of " the most eloquent defender of the Declaration , on the floor of the continental congress , " should he carried out till the end of time . But when the " midnight of the year " has come , and the winds of the winter solstice freeze " The bay where the Mayflower lay , " why should not the New England pastor commemorate an event which awakens associations equally patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the faith he loves ? The voices of the dead would then be once more heard among the living , disarming a thousand prejudices , and disclosing to all , even the most prejudiced and illiberal , the truth and the whole truth as to their labors , their patience , and their hopes . They would tell us of our present duties , and while they would reveal to us their own bright visions of the final triumphs of our Christian civilization , which they saw two centuries ago , they would censure with the severest rebuke , those of their recreant sons , who dwelling on intermediate ground , between the sufferings of the distant past and the glories of the distant future , are alike indifferent to the pa- tience and the faith of their fathers.
