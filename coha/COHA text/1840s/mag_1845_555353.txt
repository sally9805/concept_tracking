txt WE would again , at the risk of being read by only a few of those who look over this Journal , solicit the attention of the public to some of the military concerns of the nation . The many-paged document , the title of which is placed at the head of this article , is not likely to be read by any parts of it will be glanced at by a few . And yet its contents are highly important . They contain much information which should be generally known . And those who submit to the task of rendering that information sufficiently attractive to be noticed may be said to perform a beneficial service to the public . In most cases , samples may be hung out , which will give a tolerable idea of the bales within ; and many will cast an eye upon the former who would not think of examining the latter . We will not attempt to answer the often propounded question , whether these public documents could not be made more brief , convenient , and popular , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come forth , they are almost wholly useless . They are not generally even laid aside , uncut , for the contingent benefit of future reference ; but fall into the receptacles of waste paper , like the newspaper of yesterday . It is half amusing and half deplorable to witness the residuary documents which are found lumbering , for a short time , the rooms of an ex-member of congress . A retired stationer , who has not yet sold off the remnants of his stock , is not in a more littered and encumbered condition . The document before us has more than seven hundred pages , besides unpaged matter , such as returns , printed out in all their length and breadth . There is much of this with which we have nothing to do . The reports which accompany the report of the secretary of war form , however , more than five hundred and fifty of these pages . But we may deduct from these more than two hundred pages which belong to the Indian department ; with these we have no concern ; and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // general , has as little . It may well be asked , why such a mass of unimportant details should be printed each year at the public expense . The " one hundred " reports relating to the Indian department , filling nearly two hundred pages , might as well have remained in the pigeon-holes of the Indian commissioner . They show the manner in which a great variety of small agencies , in every nook and corner of the frontier , have discharged a benevolent trust , and that the Indians-those quasi wards of the government-are under a careful guardianship . But if each bureau were to swell its communications to its proper chief after a similar fashion , - were to dilate , or dilute , its matter after this manner , - congressional printers would have as much presswork as they could do , and the public mails more documents than they could carry . If there be no process of distillation at the bureaux , to extract the spirit , leaving the crude matter behind , we might expect a more sharpsighted discrimination in congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is probable that whatever leaves the bureaux passes , like a sealed package , through all its stages of transmission , unread and unseen , until it reaches the printer 's hands , where there is no motive to curtail , nor power to do so , even if the motive arose . We turn over all the pages of this document until we come to the report of the secretary of war . Our war secretaries have latterly had but little time to learn the duties of their station . During the last four or five years , they have shifted as often as the almanac . Occasionally , they have not even outlived the annuals . Under such variable circumstances , experience has not been looked for , being a plant of somewhat slow growth . Fortunately , the welfare of the army does not depend for its stability upon this high functionary . He may go out and come in with each season ; he may be as deciduous as the leaves ; and yet the military establishment , and the national defence , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a permanency in the command of the army , and in all the subordinate departments connected with its administration , that makes it nearly independent of these fluctuations . We would suggest a change in the present subordination of the military bureaux at Washington . Having been established , we believe , at a time when there was no commander-in-chief 28 * // there , nor , indeed , anywhere , they were all placed , of course , in immediate communication with the war department , - that is , in direct communication with the executive . There is a want of symmetry and congruity in this plan . All these departments ( excepting , perhaps , the engineer and ordnance departments ) should he concentrated under one head . The commander-in-chief is now that head . He is the proper channel from the army to the cabinet , and from the cabinet to the army . Any other arrangement divides and diminishes responsibility , produces awkwardness and embarrassment , and is a departure from military and efficient organization . We do not apprehend that any bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine that seldom deviates ; there are regulations which prevail under all circumstances . It is satisfactory to contemplate the well ordered and fixed character of one of our institutions , where the benefits intended to result to the public depend so much , not to say entirely , upon such a character . The report of the secretary of war , which appears in this document , compares advantageously with many that have preceded it . When a secretary comes into office , and is called upon for a report such as this , before he has had time to become familiar with its details , he may well be at a loss for materials to give it the customary length . In such a case , if he were to make a brief report , and refer to subordinate reports , which are made tinder all the advantages of long experience , he would probably lose no credit with the public ; and he would certainly set an example of brevity , which is much needed in these days , when prolixity is so fashionable . But unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or canal ; it is the length , and not the area , that is calculated . The immediate predecessor of Mr. Wilkins , in a like strait as to familiarity with his charge , adopted a new , if not clever , expedient to eke out his report , and give it due elongation . The returns of the adjutant-general of the army , which were presented to him in figures , he rendered into 1 ) lain prose . Many , who were desirous of knowing the position and composition of our various garrisons , were pleased to find all these details put into a shape that gave them entrance into any newspaper . The adjutant-general 's returns come in such a shape as excludes them from these ordinary avenues to the public eye . // They have too much length and breadth , too much superficies , to find accommodation anywhere but in such a " Document " as is now before us , which can hardly be said to meet the public eye . It may be difficult for a secretary , with all the helps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose on himself . He is the lens to collect into one focus the lights thrown in by ten distinct offices or bureaux . If he transmit them without such concentration , he becomes almost a useless medium . A piece of tape , sufficient to stitch the various reports together , would perform the office nearly as well . How much to admit , how much to reject , may be hard to determine . The report before us is most respectable in its character . It is well written , and marked by liberality of opinion throughout . It is not a mere echo . While the secretary indorses all the suggestions of the subordinate bureaux which have his approbation , he hazards several somewhat new suggestions , which were not acted upon by the last Congress , and which it may be well to examine in anticipation of another session . The secretary says , " Efficiency and military spirit are much improved by keeping troops in mass . Central depots , on healthy sites , whether forts or not , so that they are readily accessible from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required , are the best locations for the barracks for troops . In several of the seacoast fortifications , the plan of defence has excluded , as barracks and quarters for the garrison , separate and exposed buildings , but providing instead thereof , and in the body of the rampart , bomb-proof accommodations , designed to avail for the comfort , health , and safety of the troops , as well as for the proper defence of the works , under the circumstances of actual warfare and of sieges . Pro per and well designed as the casemates no doubt are for these objects , I have nevertheless formed the opinion , from my limited personal observation , that it is advisable , in time of peace , to afford the assembled troops and the hospitals barrack establishments , on airy and spacious sites , separate from the forts . With this impression upon my mind ( an impression which seems to prevail throughout the army ) , I would he remiss in my duty , did I not express the hope that Congress may authorize and appropriate funds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaboard , care being taken that by their location and construction they shall not interfere with the proper purpose and action of the fortifications . " // The plan here suggested of collecting troops into large bodies has often been formed , and occasionally carried partially into effect . No military man has ever doubted the advantages of such concentrations . There are certain modes of discipline which can never otherwise be introduced . Still , admitting all this , paramount considerations may forbid them . Every captain of a company naturally desires that the men under his command may be brought together , that he may instruct them fully in all their appropriate duties . Every colonel has the same desire with respect to his regiment ; and the brigadier-general and the major-general entertain similar ambitious and commendable anxieties about their respective commands . The opinions that govern them all are praiseworthy . A division of troops , with all its appurtenances , forms a perfect military body , and can he instructed to the full scope of discipline . Much larger concentrations are made in the older countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the military establishments , render them unobjectionable and convenient . The question is , Can such concentrations , even in a subordinate degree , be unobjectionable and convenient here ? In the first place , our country is uncommonly large , and our army uncommonly small . We have a very great extent of frontier to guard . Fortifications have been erected , and posts have been established , at suitable distances , along this whole extent . It is intended that these fortifications and posts shall be occupied . The army is kept up for that purpose . In time of peace , it may be said , it is kept up for that purpose alone . If the troops he dispersed among these defences in a proper manner , there is no surplus for the concentrations recommended by the secretary . Then the determination must be , that such concentrations , beyond a very limited degree , can not properly be made . What is the consequence of this determination ? It may be frankly admitted , that our troops have no chance , under ordinary circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the line . The brigadier-general and the major-general have no opportunity to exercise themselves in these evolutions . Their duties become , for the time being , supervisory and conservative . A regiment is occasionally embodied ; battalions , often ; and thus a measure of military proficiency is preserved , which answers // all ordinary demands upon the army , and upon which , in times of action and enlarged operations , the movements and habits of larger bodies can easily and promptly be ingrafted . Segregation is the condition of our small army ; and we must make the best of it . The way to do that is , to watch our garrison discipline with a strict eye and a steady hand . Give these component parts all the proficiency of which they are susceptible , and they will be prepared to coalesce at any moment on an emergency . These emergencies are not often so pressing as to allow no time to acquire a conformity with the change . Indian difficulties are generally sudden . But our largest posts are in the Indian vicinity and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not call for extraordinary skill in the broad tactics . We need not apprehend any state of things , which is likely to make us feel that our army - disciplined as it may be , and at this moment actually is , though scattered among our numerous posts - is wanting in adaptation to all the purposes of national defence , so far as its numerical force admits . There were times some years since , when , under the influence of opinions similar to those set forth in the report we are now considering , posts were evacuated , in order that concentrations might be effected for improvement in discipliiie upon a larger scale . Colonels saw their regiments deteriorating as regiments , and their own importance dwindling away . All was quiet around them , and it seemed to be thought nothing was likely to disturb that quiet . Garrisons here and there were withdrawn , and others were strengthened . These instances occurred upon our interior frontier ; and in most of them , an Indian disturbance , accompanied by some bloodshed , much expense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the consequence . The evacuation of a post near the savages always leads to misapprehension on their part . They see the usual restraints upon their uneasy disposition diminished , and , without looking beyond their immediate sphere , to see if other restraints , not probably far removed from that sphere , are increased in strength , they feel that their proneness to aggression and plunder , always curbed with difficulty , may be indulged with impunity . It is in vain to reason about this character of the dangers against which we are to guard . Ye must take them as we find them , and , if sev // eral small garrisons secure the public tranquillity better than one or two large ones , we must distribute the troops accordingly , even at the sacrifice of many degrees of military proficiency . When the board of officers , which , a few years since , made a most able report on the national defence , was considering the proportion which certain works , required for the protection of certain straits , would bear to the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested , that , where the immediate object of the works did not call for an extent capable of embracing a large garrison , subsidiary barracks should be built in the neighbourhood . Such an arrangement , under such circumstances , would be obviously proper . We do not apprehend , however , that the secretary alludes to such cases alone . His recommendation is very general ; too general , probably , to obtain support . He remarks that the plan seems to have the approbation of the army . The general commanding does not allude to it . The chief engineer proposes , in accordance with what he supposes to be the wish of the government , subsidiary barracks in some instances , as at Governor 's Island ( New York harbour ) , and at the Barrancas ( Pensacola ) , stating good reasons in support of the proposition . Many of our largest works have been constructed with casemates , or bomb-proof arched halls within the ramparts . They are contrived a double debt to pay , accommodating guns ( each casemate having an embrasure ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases of bombardment , the garrison is safely lodged under this shelter , and manages the defence with no fear of the shells , that might , and probably would , otherwise drive it out of the works . There is an opinion prevailing among the troops , that these accommodations are not equally well suited to both the abovenamed purposes ; that the guns have greatly the advantage , being impassive under the dampness and closeness of the massive arches that inclose them . At first view , those who occupy these deep and rather dark recesses seem to live a troglodite life . The dense and thick bulk of masonry and earth that is above and on each side of them makes them cool and damp , with little modification from the changes of the atmosphere without . Whether this makes them unhealthy is the question . The troops have generally decided // that it does . The chief engineer says they were constructed for warlike purposes ; that they fulfil those purposes and are also thought to be applicable to the secondary purpose of quartering troops in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , " justifies this expectation " ; and that he believes " we have experience of our own in corroboration " ; adding , that , " before judgment is entered against the use of casemates in all cases , it might be well to weigh facts rather than opinions ; and where the health of the occupants is , as it would be with the greatest propriety , taken as an index , to rely on medical reports and statistics , rather than on mere belief and theory . " The surgeon-general does not noti*e this subject in his report connected with these documents . In some of his previous reports , however , he expresses himself strongly against the use of casemates , particularly for hospitals . The opinion of this officer , in such a case , is entitled to much consideration . He is the peculiar guardian of the health of the troops . His objection to the use of rooms for the sick which are habitually damp , and which can not have very free ventilation , should be received without further evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides the physician . Climates and general positions are beyond control . Troops may necessarily be placed where both are unfavorable to health . But the hospital , in fixed garrisons , is , so far as relates to comparative advantages , the result of choice and design . The remedies there applied should not be counteracted by artificial causes . Sick men should not be placed where well men are likely to become sick . The spear that wounds at one end , though it heal with the other , is almost useless . But in condemning the use of casemates for ordinary quarters for officers and men , evidence of their unfitness should be produced . The records of the hospital bureau must have such evidence , if it exist . A comparative examination could be instituted , which would silence dispute . It is not enough to show that officers and men are occasionally , or are often , sick in casemates , unless it be also shown , that they are not sick in the same degree under other and different shelter within the same post . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humanity , and even sound economy , forbid it . To keep men in good health is a saving , not only of physical strength , // but of money to the treasury . Still , the extensive modifications proposed in some of our largest posts should not be resorted to without a conviction of their necessity . Such conviction can not be said yet to have been produced . " Opinions only , " and not " facts , " as the chief engineer says , have thus far decided the question . The next recommendation of the secretary exhibits rather an odd conjunction ; that is , the " substitution of the single iron for the double wooden bedstead , and the erection of buildings for religious worship , and schools , at all the permanent fortifications . " The branch of this recommendation which is placed first in order appears to have originated in the benevolent mind of , that functionary , as no suggestion of the kind is found in the report either of the quartermastergeneral or of the surgeon-general . Such a substitution would undoubtedly contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunks are unavoidably subjected to a pest that renders them almost intolerable , and any thing but beds of repose . But most readers of the report will ask whether a matter of police like this calls for such a grave recommendation , for the interposition of the President and Congress . If wooden bedsteads may be provided without such high sanctions ( as they are so provided every day ) , it would seem that iron ones might also . The difference of the material can hardly call for such a wide difference in the sanction . We apprehend that either material can be adopted without new authority , without any enlargement of habitually exercised powers ; particularly , as the difference in the cost would probably be inconsiderable . The objection may lie against the want of room , as it is assigned under the present regulations . But that allowance can be increased in conformity , if it be found necessary . We hope the improvement may be made . It is not often that a small matter has such a great recommendation . We now proceed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its dignity or importance by coming in at the foot of the bedsteads . This subject is urged by the quartermaster-general in his report , which states , that , " since the employment of chaplains has been authorized by law , numerous applications have been made for means of erecting chapels or houses for religious exercises . But as Congress has never authorized any expendi // ture on account of ' such buildings , the authority to put them up has in every case been refused . Recently , however , instances have occurred of commanding officers causing buildings to be put up , to be used both as schoolhouses and chapels ; for which purpose , both public materials and public money have been used . The whole proceeding being in direct violation of law , those who have caused this expenditure of money and property must necessarily lose the amount expended , unless Congress relieve them . It would seem reasonable , that , where chaplains are authorized , suitable places should be provided for them to officiate . " The quartermaster-general adds , that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars " to provide these " necessary buildings at the several posts . " It does not appear whether this part of the appropriation passed or not . We hope it did pass , and that the posts where chaplains are stationed will hereafter have places for religious worship which will be consistent with the solemnity and importance of the objects in view . At remote posts , far from all hallowed associations and privileges , the beneficial influences of this worship can hardly be overestimated . The class of people , which , in time of peace , furnishes most of our common soldiers , has a downward tendency , and it requires all helps of this kind to preserve them , at such posts , from sinking into a heathenish state of feeling . The next recommendation introduced in the report of the secretary relates to the few companies of " horse or light field artillery " now belonging to our military establishment . We have four companies which are thus organized , being a part of the four regiments of artillery . They are now stationed at Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbour ; Carlisle Barracks , Pennsylvania ; and Fort Mdllenry , Baltimore harbour . At all these stations they are associated with one or more companies of ordinary artillery . Some two years since , there were two companies of the mounted artillery combined at one post . This arrangement prevented that distribution of them which is deemed best suited to their usefulness and the wants of the public service . Singly , however , the companies , since the last reduction of the army , are too small " for this light artillery exercise in full battery . " The general commanding the army says , in his report , that the present association // of ordinary companies with the mounted companies is intended to bring , in succession , each company of the four regiments of artillery " through its school of practice with field batteries and horses . " the secretary , while he commends the plan of diffusing this kind of instruction through the whole corps , under present circumstances , appears to consider that an enlargement of the mounted companies , so that they shall embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable ; and he accordingly proposes that their complement shall be restored to the former footing . In case this be done , the practice with horses will doubtless be confined to the light companies . Whether this would meet the approbation of the general commanding , we are not told . It is likely that it would , and that this plan of passing each company through the ordeal of light artillery instruction was the result of necessity , and not of choice . If each soldier of the four regiments could become proficient in all the branches of artillery service , a most desirable degree of perfection would be attained . But this is more desirable than practicable . All profitable instruction must be somewhat exclusive . Too many seeds sown together obstruct each other 's growth . That which is acquired by much drilling is preserved only by continued drilling . If each of these mounted companies can be made complete for all the purposes connected with their service , both officers and men remaining , as a general rule , unchanged , the best results will no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly the importance of these light artillery companies , nor pay too high a compliment to the expertness which they exhibit . The facility and promptitude with which they man*uivre are wonderful . To an ordinary spectator , it is like legerdemain . We can not measure the beneficial service they may render the country in an hour of need . They are the lightning as well as the thunder of our small army . But the secretary says they " are injudiciously stationed when in forts , for it is emphatically an arm for the open field service . " The truth of the last part of this remark will be fully conceded ; and yet it may not follow that the habitual station of these companies should not be at or near our forts . They are not for any one place , but to be in readiness to move hither and thither as emergencies arise . Their action , most probably , // in time of maritime difficulties , would be , to dash for any threatened point between our regular fortifications , and serve as a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a chain , which , although nowhere joined together , stretch out , with magical celerity , wherever menace shows itself . They have nearly all the advantages of continuity , without its magnitude or expense . Those who recollect the war of 1812 , when our coast was pierced in many directions by predatory bands , can well suppose the incalculable service a few such companies , stationed as these light artillery companies now are , would have rendered . They would not have saved Stonington , - glorious Stonington ! - but they would have made the event of Stonington so common , as to have been lost in the crowd of similar repulses . At Bladensburg , Commodore Barney 's few unwieldy pieces made a most gallant stand ; they made the enemy waver . That wavering might have been converted into a retreat , had a flying battery been in their place . Following up his remark upon the injudiciousness of the p resent stations of these companies ( probably meaning to except that of Carlisle , which is " interior " ) , the secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be in the interior , or in the Western States , where forage and horses are cheap , and where they would probably , also , serve to more advantage as a model for forming spirited uniform volunteer companies , " &amp;c . This suggestion strikes us as being singularly mistaken and objectionable . Forage and horses are undoubtedly cheaper in the interior , or in the Western States , than on the seaboard ; but this , of itself , we apprehend , furnishes no sufficient reason for fixing any part of our means of national defence , established for exterior protection , and almost for that purpose only , far within and away from the frontiers , merely for the saving of something in the price of forage and horses , and affording a model for militia companies . As for the latter object , it would be utterly futile , as no occasional trainings can make either men or horses expert in the duties of light artillery . Many militia companies , with only such drills as civil occupations admit , become expert at the musket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by constant and undivided application to its appropriate drill , - such application as enlisted soldiers alone can make . // But it is unnecessary to dwell longer on this unadvised suggestion . The proper place for our light artillery companies is in connection with our seaboard defence . They are placed near the forts , because they there find public grounds , and all the public facilities of supply , - most important considerations , and which can not be overlooked with due regard to convenience and economy . If this be their proper position in time of war , it is their proper position in time of peace . They form a most valuable and essential part of our maritime defence , and are at all times ready to move towards any quarter along the coast , with a rapidity that railroads and steamboats can make like that of a racehorse , whenever the urgency demands such speed . The company at Newport can shoot through New-England like a meteor . This hardly seems exaggerated language , when we take into consideration the helps found on all the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at New York , Carlisle , and Baltimore . They are all like salient bastions , or batteries , connected with the works to which they are attached ; not fixed , and commanding only a certain range , but bearing forward their point blank to meet the danger afar off . If there be any objection to their present relative position , it is to the comparative proximity of Carlisle and Baltimore . If it were not for the public grounds and barracks at Carlisle , that place might properly be abandoned for some more southern position , as the South is not sufficiently cared for in the present arrangement . We have dwelt the longer on this part of the secretary 's report , because we feared that a suggestion , so pregnant with objections , coming from such a high quarter , might find abettors among those who look more to the savings proposed , than to the preservation of a well ordered system of national defence in all its parts . Besides , it is unsound policy to * This allusion to policy suggests to us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown away . It is easily discerned , that the virulence often evinced in the speeches of certain members of Congress against military and naval officers does not arise so much from hostility to means of national defence , whether personal or material , as to " epaulets , " " lace , " " bright buttons , " &amp;c . There is no objection even to these insignia in their proper place . The most showy uniforms excite no irritation , even in the most splenetic and sensitive , when exhibited within the chain of sentinels , or upon the quarter-deck . It is when they display themselves on the sidewalks , and at the hotels , that they disturb these morbid humors. // place any part of our army in situations not manifestly military and congruous . The parts , so placed , would soon be regarded as superfluous , because apparently unnecessary at improper places . Whenever the shield is thrown on the back , it seems to be an incumbrance , and probably will soon be thrown away . Where these companies are now , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when not in the field , these accommodations are necessary . Were the companies temporarily sent into the interior , or into the Western States , such accommodations would have to be provided , even at the risk of being soon abandoned in case of an emergency . One such miscalculation would overbalance the savings proposed in forage and horses many fold . We can not hereafter flatter ourselves that war will send forth its heralds of warning , so that each one may have time to buckle on his armor , the careless to rouse themselves , the remote to come up to the danger . Steampower has made an important revolution in the facility of attack . The cloud does not now show itself in the distant horizon no bigger than a man 's hand , - thence slowly rising and expanding , and giving time to gird up one 's loins and flee to shelter . The bolt may break forth from the clear heavens . It is , therefore , necessary that our maritime frontier should at all times be in readiness with such means of In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen except within the strict sphere of duty . John Bull has a jealousy of the sword , and this jealousy is respected . Brother Jonathan has the same jealousy , and it would be politic to respect it in the same manner . We shall be pardoned for throwing out one more hint . The army is attacked from within as well as from without . It has eruptive disorders it may be the " black tongue . " The fable of the members of the body quarrelling , and proposing to dispense with each other , is familiar to all . There are instances of such fatuity in the army . The foot would cut off the hand , even the head , and pare off the shoulders . The present organi. zation has existed in substance , though not in form , ever since we were a nation ; that is , every thing that is now done has been constantly done , or attempted to be done , only in a different way , or by different hands . Ex. perience of evils has led to divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We now do that well and economically , which was formerly done perfunctorily and with prodigality . Formerly the army was fed by contractors , who made great fortunes by filching from the soldiers their small rations . They now have the full ration , of the best quality , and at a far cheaper rate . The change in the other departments has been equally beneficial both to the army and the public . The army lives , and moves , and has all things done , in order . If the Florida war cost , under the organization of 1*4O , " forty millions , " it would have cost , under such an organization as we had between 11315 and 1821 , four hundred millions . 29* // defence as government has provided . The war secretary assumes a perilous responsibility , whenever he throws any of those means hors de condition . He can not add one jot to them ; neither must he diminish them one tittle . Any misuse of them , or any thing short of the best use of them , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the men are at his disposal . The former are nothing without garrisons ; and the latter are nothing , unless connected with the frontier defences . We now propose to turn our attention to the reports of the chief engineer , and of the colonel of the topographical engineers . They are full of interest , and it is to be regretted that they stand so little chance of being read . They present a minute view of the operations and expenditures of the two corps during the last year . These operations and expenditures were very extensive and important ; the former spreading over our whole maritime and interior frontier , and the latter embracing many millions . It is not our intention to look beyond a few parts of the system . The appropriations which have been made annually for some years , for these objects , show that public opinion is sound with respect to the national defence . Some years since , there was ground for much anxiety . Heresies sprang up in high places , which were likely to affect injuriously both that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . Apprehensions were entertained that innovations were to unsettle all that had been established , and that tried and long approved systems were to give way to mere experiments . But , happily , Congress did not coincide with this proneness to change . A sluggish spirit for a while prevailed over all these operations ; only delaying , however , their progress , not altering their course . There is reason to congratulate the country that no worse effects followed this temporary hallucination of those in authority . If the present system be permitted to prevail until our seaboard he guarded by adequate fortifications , we shall be as invulnerable as other nations are which are similarly guarded . All civilized nations , which have common prudence , guard themselves thus ; and , unless we are without that quality , we shall not relax our efforts until we are in the same condition . It is now some years since the chief engineer proposed , that a company of " sappers and miners " should be raised ; but it was // not until the last session of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . It then passed the House of Representatives , and would undoubtedly have passed the Senate also , had there been time . We allude to this company only to express our hope that it will be authorized at another session . There has been scarcely a military proposition before Congress , since the suggestion was first made , which has been more strongly recommended by economy and the wants of the service . If any one will take the trouble to look over the reports of the chief engineer on this subject , he will be convinced that our extensive fortifications , costing so many millions , can be properly preserved only by such a company . Ordinary skill can be supplied by the mechanics of the country . But such laborers and mechanics as are formed by degrees in these companies can be found nowhere else in any country but in such companies . There is no ordinary calling that teaches such handicraft . It is peculiar , and can be acquired only by engineer teaching . We would now more particularly ask attention to the lake frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand the most generous encouragement and careful protection . The public eye has been turned in that direction by much that has been written and said respecting the population and wealth bordering upon those waters . It is now not quite thirty years since there was not a commodious harbour upon either Lake Erie or Michigan . Presqu'ile ( Erie ) , where Perry 's fleet was built , was no harbour at all . That fleet had to float into the offing without its armament , taking it in there . Any one of the vessels which were afterwards so gloriously captured from Commodore Barklay would have been sufficient then to have scattered this fleet , in that predicament , to the four winds of the lake . Put-in Bay , where this fleet reposed on its laurels after the victory , is on an island , and of no more use to the main shore as a harbotir , than a harbour on Guernsey is to France . Perry 's fleet , after its short career of glory , was sunk for preservation , and only now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this state of destitution continued , had art refused to assist nature , - those sails would still have remained few and far between . But we did not stop where nature left us . We have now on those // lakes over twenty harbours , built by appropriations made by Congress . These harbours are all artificial . Thirty years ago , scarcely one of them was habitually open . Sandusky came the nearest to an exception . All of them had sand-bars at their mouths , which rendered them generally accessible only to row-boats . At certain parts of the season , these bars gave way . When the thaw of spring , or when heavy rains , swelled the streams which had their outlets there , the strengthened current made a breach in the bar , which would admit even large vessels , until the next storm restored the impediment . Thus , a vessel might get in to-day , which could not get out to-morrow . And this contested power was not equally divided between the river and the lake . The former had its day only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the predominance ; while the latter held undisturbed control the major part of the season of navigation . Such a state of things held out little encouragement for commerce . It was not even " fast and loose . " The game presented no temptation to enterprise which looked to the water for scope . There was much speculation at the time as to the practicability of opening these river-mouths in a permanent manner . Soon , the population , collecting upon them , and in their neighbourhood , became such as to demand the aid of government . Fortunately , the president of the United States had just visited those waters , and the government was administered at that time upon principles that allowed these improvements to be regarded as of a national character . Mr. Calhoun , then at the head of the war department , had the forecast to perceive the beneficial influences of such improvements afar off . He saw into the future beyond the common ken ; he believed , that , if he could remove these sandy barriers , which put asunder what nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensue which no man could estimate . He sent up United States engineers , who devised expedients , which gradually curbed the alluvion drifting along the southern shores of Lake Erie , until nearly every river there flowed through an unobstructed channel into the lake , drawing in and sending out a great amount of tonnage , in its thousand shapes , which has all been launched within the last twenty or thirty years , and which may be said to have been brought into // existence by the fostering influence of these harbour improvements . The national wealth which they have thus , as it were , created , renders the cost of these improvements as dust in the balance . Northern Ohio has grown up under them . That part of this great State would otherwise have been merely a remote interior to the river Ohio . These improvements at once gave her a new and better frontier . She was before like a plant which had the sun only on one side . All her growth was towards that side . The other was , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke down that wall , and let in an invigorating light on that side also . Doubts have often been expressed whether this beneficial work should be continued by the general government ; even , whether that which has already been done should be preserved . Mr. Calhoun , who , under Mr. Monroe 's benignant administration , ushered in this lake prosperity , bas hazarded the remark , that the United States should withdraw its sustaining hand , and leave the States bordering on the lakes to keep it up . Such a policy could be justified only on the ground that the improvements are not of a national character . If they were once national , they are still so . It would be difficult to prove , to the satisfaction of any reasonable man , that they have not been national from the first ; that they do not continue to be so ; that they are not only almost , but altogether , national , with hardly any exception . Cleveland has but a tithe of interest in the accessibility of her harbour . The whole sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has a deep interest in that of Buffalo harbour . The occlusion , either from neglect or any other cause , of that artificial harbour , would be felt like another " Boston Port Bill " ; it would agitate the country from the Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico . The inconvenience and injury would be felt far and wide . New York could only have her share in them . The preservation of it is emphatically a national concern . And the same may be said with respect to most of the other artificial barbours on the lakes . They are not all national in the same degree ; but none of them are so little so , as to become local or State concerns . F he natural harbours of the seacoast are not objects of more general concern , than the artificial barbours of the lake frontier . It is not their size or // importance that makes them so ; it is their exterior position . In most intimate connection with this subject , we would point out an improvement to be made on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long postponed . We allude to a channel through the " St. Clair Flats . " There was an item in the " lost harbour bill " of some forty thousand dollars for this purpose . The late president could not have " pocketed " a greater injury to the Northwest . We do not see that this subject was introduced this year by the colonel of the topographical engineers in his report the item , therefore , must have obtained its place in the bill through the exertions of the Michigan delegation . They would have been exceedingly unmindful of their duty , had they omitted these exertions . Lake St. Clair is known to connect the strait of Detroit with the river St. Clair , forming together the links that connect lakes Erie and Huron . This improvement has attracted less attention than its importance demands , arising from the fact , that , since the commerce of the lakes has become extensive , the level of the waters on those flats has been generally high enough to accommodate the craft floating over them . But there are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods , of a year or two each in duration , within the last thirty years , when not a tenth part of that craft could have floated over them . The theory relative to this rise and fall of the lakes was , for many years , that the change was periodical , the water rising for some seven years , and then falling during an equal period . And until 1828 , this theory was in accordance with well established facts . Since then , the high level has been maintained , and the theory , as well as the facts on which it was based , has probably been forgotten . Whether the waters will hereafter maintain their present high level , or subside as they have before subsided , is an unsettled question . There is about as much ground for apprehension as confidence ; and unless that apprehension be removed , a strong necessity exists for a channel through the flats . The very great interests involved require such an improvement . We have seen many statements of the amount of tonnage which passes through these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doubt exists , that millions of property are constantly afloat there // and these millions are yearly on the increase . Should the level of these waters subside , as it has often subsided heretofore , and as it may often subside again , nearly all these millions would come to a dead stand at this point ; a stand as dead as if a dam had been suddenly stretched across the lake . By unloading in part , or altogether , as was formerly done under similar circumstances , the boats and vessels might , in due time , be got over , and the trip , after much delay , be resumed . It would he difficult to reckon the cost of such hindrances ; but there would be no extravagance in the supposition , that the hindrances of one month ( and they might outlast a series of months , or even run through a series of years ) would defray the expense of the improvement many times over . This being the case , it behooves all the States concerned ( and they are many and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay . There is no reason that can be urged against it ; and the reasons for it are a legion . The hazards of delay are imminent . We know not what a season may bring forth . Scarcely a season opens , which , when the channel is buoyed out over these flats ( and this task has to be performed at each opening of the navigation ) , does not threaten to cut off this great communication between the upper and the lower lakes , and cause a fearful looking forward to the embarrassments of the future . It is then that a painful regret is felt that something energetic has not been done to remove this annual cause of deep inquietude . Some three years since , the topographical department set some of its officers on a hydrographic survey of these straits . A perfect system of surveys and soundings , from lake Erie to lake St. Clair , and of the flats at the bead of the latter lake , was completed at the end of the second season . We shall have occasion to allude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit river . The flats alluded to stretch , like an outspread fan , from the Canada side of the lake to the Michigan shore . A chart has been made of them , which exhibits all their features , together with the channels that come down to them from the river St. Clair . These channels are three in number ; the " north channel , " the " middle channel , " and the " south channel . " The boundary line of the country runs through // the last channel ; and a line drawn through this channel from Detroit to the foot of Lake Huron is but slightly deflected at any one point . The same wind would carry a sail vessel the whole length of it . It is not necessary to be a navigator to see the advantages of such a direct course . The middle channel is of a subordinate character . The north channel is called the ship channel , because all the large vessels and steamboats are obliged to take it . In following this , the route to the waters above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the south channel uniting the two ends of the curve . While , as we have remarked , the same wind would take a vessel through the south channel from Detroit to Lake Huron , many changes are required to get through the north channel . Before steam came into use , the impediments crowded within the few miles of this deep curve were regarded as more formidable than those of all the residue of the voyage . Vessels , which had overcome them under favoring changes , often performed their voyages , and , on their return , found others , which had been close in their wake at the entrance of this channel , but which had been less favored by the caprices of the winds , still at anchor there . This north channel , besides these embarrassments , has more than twice the length of the south channel . Such are the relative positions and courses of these channels . The chart which is before us represents , with great accuracy and particularity , the soundings of each , as they were found in the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high stage . According to this chart , no craft , drawing over three feet , can pass over the flats at the mouth of the middle channel . No craft , drawing over six feet , can pass , in like manner , into the south channel . After the flats are passed , there is ample depth for any craft in both cases . The minimum depth over the flats of the north channel is about nine feet . This makes close rubbing for all the large craft afloat . But there is at present no alternative ; though there is not a large steamboat that now goes through this channel which does not leave a muddy wake for several miles behind . The width of these flats at these three points is the next question , and the most important one in its bearing upon an improvement in the navigation there . This width at the mouth of the north channel is about five miles . Through // this distance there has been found , during the last ten years , a somewhat devious channel , whose minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a few yards to a quarter of a mile . To render the traverse of the fiats at this point safe and effectual , a commodious channel must be excavated and protected . The excavations would not be required to be continuous ; there appear to be many places within the five miles where that labor could be dispensed with ; but the protection of the channel , such a protection as would keep it open , would be indispensable the whole distance . No estimate , we believe , has been made of the probable cost of the requisite improvement at this point . It needs , however , little reflection upon the premises to lead one to the conclusion , that it would be comparatively very great . The width of the fiats at the mouth of the middle channel is about a mile ; that is , from ten feet depth of water below to the same depth above . An excavation of this length would connect waters of sufficient depth for any craft going into the upper lakes . If it were not for a channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as in all other respects , an improvement here would recommend itself very strongly in comparison with the north channel . It is true , that it joins that channel two or three miles before it enters the straight course of the St. Clair river . This renders it objectionable for sail vessels , though not in the same degree as the north channel . We now come to the south channel , that channel which we have before described as having unrivalled advantages as to directness of course , in connection with the waters above and below . It was from the first considered by all who had any familiarity with these waters , that this channel ought to be that which should be improved , provided the expense were not inordinate in comparison with others . According to the chart which is now before us , the width of the fiat at the mouth of this channel is rather more than half a mile that is , from eleven feet depth of water in lake St. Clair , to the same depth in the channel above . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , then , should the improvement be made . This chart presents to view the whole of the flats , as well as the channels , and it requires little more than a glance to lead every one to this // conclusion . The length of the excavation will be the shortest , and the quantity of earth to be removed the least . The cost of this improvement is supposed , by the words of the appropriation which passed both houses the last session of Congress , to be forty thousand dollars . If it were likely to cost twice or thrice that sum , it ought to be made . But the probability is , that it will not cost even that amount . No plan for the improvement has yet been distinctly proposed . There are but two which will probably be set forth for adoption . One is , to lay down a line of cribs on each side of the channel designed to be excavated , and then to excavate the channel itself . For the sum introduced into the appropriation bill , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a plan that would be effectual , and exclude all doubts as to the fulfilment of the purpose intended . No objections can be urged against it , even on the score of expense . There is , however , another plan that has been suggested by a competent judge ; which is , to omit the cribs altogether , and merely excavate a very broad channel through the distance required . The ground where the digging is to be made consists of sand and clay , which have considerable tenacity . This ground has been proved , as the chart states , to the required depth . It is probable that a channel of liberal width and depth would maintain its dimensions , even without any exterior guards . The only cause that would act against this permanency of character would be the westerly winds , sending back upon the flats the alluvion afloat in lake St. Clair . Even supposing this cause to have some considerable force and activity , we may rely on the increased strength of current , which the excavation would naturally produce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing that an improvement of the comparatively simple character here brought forward would be sufficient , and that the cost of it would not much exceed one half of the amount named in the appropriation which has been referred to . We may have appeared to give undue importance to this improvement . It has been the subject of little discussion no importunity has urged it into public notice ; and even those most concerned have hardly introduced the proposition in or out of Congress . XVhile the canal around the rapids of St. Mary called forth much zeal and exertion , a channel through the St. Clair flats has excited little of either . That // canal is undoubtedly worthy of all the efforts that have been made in its behalf . It will throw down the middle wall which now separates two inland seas , and make them one . It will he undoing , with our most simple implements , the stupendous work of Michabou , who , according to the Indian tradition , when Groscap and Point Iroquois of lake Superior were rent asunder , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast , with Titan hands , huge rocks into the straits , and stayed the outpouring of the waste by heaping up the present barrier there . But the immediate necessity for this canal , compared with the channel through the St. Clair flats , is small . The one is to open a new region , whose riches will be all the more speedily developed by such facile means of reaching the mines where they are hid . On the other depends the welfare of an extensive commerce , already full of life and fruitfulness , but liable at any moment , through the influence of causes that have often been in operation , and which may often again be in operation , to be brought to a ruinous stand in the midst of a prosperous career . The apathy that has marked the conduct of those who know the extent of this commerce , and also the dangers which threaten it , is as surprising as unaccountable ; or it can be accounted for only by the supposition , that all fear of a revival of those causes has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , if it lead to continued neglect of this most necessary improvement of the lake navigation , it may end in a punishment as signal as disastrous . While on this subject , it is proper to allude to another improvement in those waters , which one of the respectable senators from Michigan , at too late an hour of the session , strove unavailingly to introduce into the appropriation bill . It is well known , that , when the boundary line was run through the Detroit river , its course at the mouth threw the customary channel entirely within the British jurisdiction . This was an unavoidable arrangement . It has since been constantly hoped , that another channel , sufficiently practicable for an emergency , would be discovered within our own jurisdiction . No surveys , however , were made with a view to determine this desirable fact , until within a few years . General Macomb , nearly thirty years ago , had an imperfect examination made , which led to the hope here alluded to . When the surveys of the Detroit river , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the channels which form the outlet of the river were sounded , and an exact chart was made of the same , showing the width , course , and depth of each . By this chart it appears , that there is a channel , immediately under our own shore , which has sufficient depth ; but it is too narrow and tortuous at one or two points for convenient use . It was urged , that an appropriation should be made to render this channel available for all ordinary purposes . The bare statement , that the other channel passes between two shores which are only a few hundred yards apart , both of which are owned by the British , ought to have been sufficient to demonstrate the necessity of the improvement . While the two nations are at amity , vessels will suit their convenience as to the channels , and pass under the British guns without fear or molestation . But this should not be the only safe course open to them . There should be an alternative . We should have a channel of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundings show that it is practicable ; and we should not wait until the moment of necessity arrives , which might be too late , before we clear it out . Should the British portal at any time be suddenly closed upon our boats and vessels , and they be crowded into the other channel until a new way could be prepared , we should be laughed at for our stupidity and want of forecast . The primary cause of Hull 's disaster was the necessity of sending the vessel , which was carrying his baggage , sick , and letters , from the Maumee to Detroit , through this British channel , instead of the one under our own shore . It went into the jaws of the enemy , and , of cour*e , was devoured . A few thousand dollars would effect this improvement , and avert similar disasters . The amount called for appears to make it a small concern , but it is a national concern , and the national character and dignity require that it should not be neglected . Take but the crumbs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raft appropriation of the Red River , - appropriations so important to the national prosperity , but so unimportant in their immediate influences upon the national honor and national defence , - and this new channel will be laid open . No Elsineur will then , in courteous forbearance , watch over the sound of our inland Baltic , until the horn of provocation or temptation sounds , satisfied with being potentially the master of nearly all our outgoings and incomings there . // The defence of these upper lakes has , of late , elicited considerable discussion . Canada , by the liberal aid of the parent government , has been greatly facilitating the means of water communication between her several parts . The St. Lawrence , though presenting to the eye on the map a broad stream , and really having a vast volume of water flowing between its banks , was , until within a few years , almost useless for general purposes of navigation . The many rapids and chutes which interrupt its course render it difficult and even dangerous to the smallest craft . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has happened upon a small one every year , or month , since the wreck of his flotilla . Lake Ontario was little more connected with the navigation below Montreal than it was with lake Erie above the Falls of Niagara . Such was the case in the war of 1812 . But Britain profits by experience . The lessons of the past are not thrown away upon her . Soon after that war , she began a system of canalling , stretching from the tide-water to the lakes , which is intended to bring the ocean and those lakes virtually upon a level . This system has now made great progress towards a completion , and the result will be nearly the same as if the ocean were really elevated , or the lakes depressed , so as to effect this accommodation of level . Under this system it is apprehended that Great Britain , in the event of another war , instead of being obliged to construct a fleet upon Lake Ontario , as was the case during the last war , to be left there at its termination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detach from her great maritime force on the ocean such vessels as may be required , to mount up into that lake , there to do her bidding , and then to descend again to their larger and more appropriate sphere when that bidding shall have been done . Nor is the scope of these facilities to end with that lake . The Welland canal , which now accommodates all ordinary craft , is , it is said , to be fitted for the passage of war-steamers , so that while we , like the eels , which make constant attempts to climb the great wall of the Niagara Falls , find our upward progress constantly arrested by that formidable obstacle , our neighbours will soon easily send their craft , both of war and peace , step by step , up the dividing grounds , and place themselves , in much of their strength , on a level with all the rich ports which extend from Buffalo to Chicago . 30* // To counteract the effects of these lofty strides over all impediments , apparently reaching our inmost shores with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been proposed to make the Illinois canal , which is to connect the Mississippi with the lakes , a national work , and fitted to allow a free passage for such public steamers as may he collected at the Memphis navy-yard . Such a facility , it is urged , would place us , at one end of these interior seas , on the same footing as the British are , or will soon be , at the other . There is much in this proposition that is worthy of attention . Such an improvement would be strictly a national one , though made through the heart of a State . Hurlgate is embraced by New York ; and so are many thoroughfares embraced by other States , on which millions of the national money have been expended . It is not because the Ohio and the Mississippi pass between States , that they have been considered proper objects of such expenditures . They are the great avenues of the nation , and must be kept open , not to benefit the States lying on their banks , but to benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could not , keep them open . The nation alone can do it . The case of the Illinois canal is not so strong . The State of Illinois will open it herself as soon as she is able . When that ability will be gained is the question . If it be likely to arrive too late for the national safety , then the general government ought to take the work in hand . This avenue is already , with all its present lets and hindrances , a great national thoroughfare ; all those who pass through are not inhabitants of Illinois . They are a multitude of human beings , nearly all parts of the country contributing to swell their number . Considered in respect to our national defence , this improvement presents itself in a strong light . With an avenue at that end of the chain of waters , which would admit upon the lakes war-steamers from the Mississippi below , no emergency would seem likely to take us unprepared in that quarter . We should appear to be upon an equal footing with the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes from that on the tide-waters . And that very equality might remove the temptation on the part of the British , in any hostile emergency , to attempt to throw up from the ocean any part of her maritime force . In the war // of 1812 , it was a contest between the ship-carpenters of Sacket 's Harbour and of Kingston , and the war of construction was carried on nearly pan paseu . If the contest hereafter were to be , who should introduce the greatest number of war-steamers upon the lakes , it might end in the same manner , or the race might be to the swift . But , even in that case , if the British have the advantage as to the number of these war-steamers , the United States has thousands of steamboats at hand , which , though now mere Quakers , would come out knight-clad at a moment 's warning . We could in that way match them two to one , or ten to one , if it were necessary . This speculation proceeds upon the supposition that government will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lake Michigan with the Mississippi . But we do not believe it will do this ; though it might not prove half so expensive a job as the clearing out the Red River raft , which , like a thrifty tree , seems to have grown only the more for the trimming it annually receives . But even if the lakes are left as they are , and the British do all they propose to do , we do not despair . There are now hundreds of steamboats on the upper lakes , as above remarked , which could easily be made to play a formidable part in the work of attack or defence . It has been said that we have no artillery on those waters . This is not true . There is a public arsenal near Detroit , which has its stores of this kind , and each military post has spare ordnance . This , we admit , is not enough ; but we could soon have enough , and to spare . It is not at this time as it was in 1812 and 1813 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its weight in much more precious metal than that of which it was made . Supplies then almost burrowed their way to the frontiers ; now , they take wings unto themselves , and fly to their destination . We should in these days hardly call upon Aladdin , even if we knew he would come . The horse , which now draws with ease his many tons along the canal , could then scarcely carry his own provender ; and wheels now revolve as great a distance in one hour over iron rails , as they could then in one day over corduroy roads , or even over turnpikes . New York was then a broad State ; she is now contracted to a span . Both Watervliet and Pittsburg are now , as it were , in the neighbourhood of Lake Erie . Their munition and their ammunition , if called for to-day , could be there on the // morrow . In a week 's time , they could arm every steamboat on that lake to the teeth . But , though there may be a doubt whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lakes , there ought to be none as to its providing proper land defences upon the Detroit , the St. Clair , and the St. Mary 's frontier . A fort is at length going up on the first , occupying the most commanding position on the Detroit strait . But Fort Gratiot , at the outlet of Lake Huron , one of the cardinal points of defence on that frontier , is still nothing but a stockade work ; such a work as suited well the times when it was erected , when the Indian rifle and tomahawk alone were to be resisted . In these times , it is little better than mere frost-work . A proper fort - such a fort as has been sometime recommended by the engineers - should he commenced there without delay . Another stockade work - now almost in ruins - is on the straits of St. Mary , another cardinal point of defence . Such stockade works are not even scare-crows in these days , and only give an air of ridicule to those parts of our defensive arrangements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a broken foil in his hand . We should not be misled by the long peace which the civilized world has now enjoyed , and deem even ordinary precautions unnecessary . We are not reposing under our vine and fig-tree , with nobody to hurt or make us afraid . There is much to hurt us , though little , perhaps , to make us afraid . Nations appear to have become impatient of repose . A new generation has arisen , which bears none of the scars of past wounds , and sees in the dragon 's teeth which are springing up on every side only a coming harvest of glory . This feeling has more of the Marcellus than the Fabius in it ; is better fitted to give spirit to actual war , than to preserve the blessings of peace . But whether we have war or peace , preparation for defence is a bounden duty , as well as a dictate of common prudence . It is true , that reason and justice have great influence over international affairs now-adays . A nation would blush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without seeming to have both in favor of its cause ; and as long as honorable negotiation can continue , the evil day is put off . Still , if it be inevitable , its coming is hastened or retarded by the condition , whether unpre // pared or prepared for defence , in which a nation is found . The chances of success in negotiation are diminished or increased in proportion as that condition sways one way or the other . The best reasons of the lamb had no weight with the wolf . We hope that a nation is trebly armed whose quarrel s just ; but it would be madness to rely on the armor of justice alone . The king of Israel , who was assured by Heaven that victory would be on his side in the coming battle , still sent forward his picked men to the front of the fight.
