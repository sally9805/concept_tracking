txt PERHAPS some of our readers are still ignorant i.s that form of Philosophy which sinks God and Nature in man . Let us explain . God , man , and nature , in their mutual and harmonious relations ( if indeed the absolute God may be said ever to be in relations ) are the objects of all philosophy ; but , in different theories , greater or less prominence is given to one or the other of these three , and thus systems are formed . Pantheism sinks man and nature in God ; Materialism sinks God and man in the universe ; Transcendentalism sinks God and nature in man . In other words , some , in philosophising , take their point of departure in God alone , and are inevitably conducted to Pantheism ; - others take their point of departure in nature alone , and are led to Materialism ; others start with man alone , and end in Transcendentalism . It is by no means difficult to deny in words , the actual existence of the outward universe . We may say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no more outward existence than the thoughts we refrain from expressing ; we may affirm that it has merely a different kind of existence within our soul . When I say 1 perceive an outwardly existing tree , I may be mistaken ; what I call a tree may have no outward existence , but may , on the contrary , be created by my perception . Who knows that a thing which appears red to me may not appear blue to my neighbor ? If so , then is color something which I lend to the object . But why stop at color ? Perhaps hardness and weight have no existence save that which the mind gives . " Whether nature enjoy a substantial existence without ( says Mr. Emerson ) , or is only in the apocalypse of the mind , it is alike useful and alike venerable to me . Be it what it may , it is ideal to me so long as I can not try the accuracy of my senses . " " What differs it to me ( he asks on another page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some god paint the image in the firmament of the soul ? " Fabre d ' Olivet believed the outward universe to be so dependent upon the individual soul that we might properly be said to create it ourselves . He thought that we ourselves produced all forms and the world , that we might create whatever we would , isolatedly and instantaneously , and hoped to construct a system of magic on this fact as a basis . In truth , if all outward things depend for their being and manner of existence upon ourselves , and upon our inward states , a change in those states involves a change in outward nature . If we discover , therefore , the connection of our thoughts and feelings with outward nature , the whole universe is in our power ; and we may , by a modification of ourselves , change the world from its present state into what we all wish it might become . Mr. Alcott thinks the world would be what it should be were he only as holy as he should be ; he also considers himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . A friend once told me , while we watched the large flakes of snow as they were slowly fallin* , that , could we but attain to the right spiritual state , we should be able to look on outward nature , and say , " 1 snow , I rain . " To Mr. Emerson a noble doubt perpetually suggests itself , " whether nature outwardly exists . " In the eighth number of the Dial we find a beautiful poem touching upon this theory , from which we make an extract " Allis but as it seems The round , green earth , With river and glen ; The din and mirth Of busy , busy men ; The world 's great fever , Throbbing for ever ; The creed of the sage , The hope of the age , All things we cherish , All that live and all that perish , These are but inner dreams " The great world goeth To thy dreaming . To thee alone Hearts are making their moan , Eyes are streaming . Thine is the white moon turning night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. W. Emerson . Boston : James Munroe &amp; Co. 1844. // Thine is the dark wood sleeping in her ray ; Thee the winter chills ; Thee the spring time thrills ; All things nod to theeAll things come to see If thou art dreaming on ; If thy dream should break , And thou shouldst awake , All things would be gone . " Nothing is if thou art not . Thou art under , over all ; Thou dost hold and cover all ; Thou art Atlas - Thou art JoveThe mightiest truth Hath all its youth From thy enveloping thought . " Thus man is made to he the only real existence , and outward nature a mere phenomenon dependent upon him . Man exists really , actually , absolutely ; but nature is an accident , an appearance , a consequent upon the existence of the human soul . Thus is the universe sunk , swallowed up , in man . The concluding lines of the extract are an example of the Transcendental Theology , an example of the swallowing up of God in man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cover all ; Thou art Atlas-thou art Jove . " Materialism makes man the result of organization , denying the existence of separate and individual souls , and thus sinks man in nature : it also identifies God with the active powers of the universe . As Pantheism sinks man and nature in God , as Materialism sinks God and man in the universe , so Transcendentalism sinks God and nature in man . It must be confessed , however , that our Transcendentalists are , by no means , consistent . Sometimes they express themselves in a way that leaves us in doubt whether they are not , at bottom , Materialists . For example , the poem from which the foregoing extracts are cluoted , is followed by another , of the same author , made up of beautiful and clear statements , where , in the midst of explicit repudiations of Transcendentalism , traces of the sensual system of D ' Holbach are distinctly visible . We quote a few lines - " Dost thou dream that thou art free , Making , destroying , all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul 's liberty ? Lo ! an atom crushes thee , One nerve tortures and maddens thee , One drop of blood is death to thee . The mighty voice of nature , Is thy parent , not thy creature , Is no pupil , but thy teacher ; And the world would still move on Were thy soul forever flown . For while thou dreamest on , enfolda/ In natures 's wide embrace , All thy life is daily moulded By her informing grace . And time and space must reign And rule o'er thee for ever , And the outworld lift its chain From off thy spirit never . " Here the soul is evidently sunk in nature ; it is , to use a mathematical expression , spoken of as a function of the universe . IL . Having spoken of some of the peculiar characteristics of the Transcendental school of philosophy , we shall now take occasion to say a few words concerning its origin and progress . But here it will be necessary to speak of the philosophy of Kant , a subject not easily handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , initiate the reader into the whole system . Here it is , as near as we recollect it . " If any truth he present to the mind with a conviction of its universality and necessity , that truth was ( lerived to the mind from its own operations , and does not rest upon observation and experience : " And , conversely , if any truth be present to the mind with a conviction of its contingency , that truth was derived to the mind from observation and experience , and not from the operations of the mind itself . " For example , we know that every effect must have its cause , and this truth lies in the mind with a conviction of its universality and necessity ; this truth is derived , therefore , not from observation and experience , but from the operations of the mind itself ; it is born not from outward nature , but in and , from the mind itself . In other words , to pass to the technology of the Scotch School , we are forced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , so that the principle of causation may be said to be a law of our intellectual natures . On the other hand , we say , we know the sun will rise to-morrow ; but we are not absolutely certain of this fact . This second truth lies therefore in our minds with a conviction of its contingency , and not of its necessity , and is , consequently , // not derived from a law of our intellectual natures , but from observation and experience . By every fact of experience a revelation is made to the soul , not only of the idea which it has appropriated to itself , but also of those conditions of the external world , and of its own nature , which rendered that acquisition possible . For example , when we perceive moonlight , it is necessary , first , that there should be something out of us to produce the effect of moonlight upon our sensibility ; and also , second , certain internal lhculties which are receptive of the influences of moonlight . Without the outward object there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise no perception ; for the moon shines upon the trees as well as upoa me , but the trees do not perceive , being devoid of the perceiving faculty . Now the idea I have of moonshine might have l ) een modified by a change either , first , in the outward object , or , second , in my perceiving faculty . Had the moonshine been different , it would have produced a different effect upon my sensibility , and , consequently , the idea would have been different . Had my perceiving power been different , the influence or eflbct of the moonshine would have been different , and the idea resulting would likewise have been different . All this is plain . Now the faculties of the mind are permanent , and always operate in the same manner ; therefore , the truths given by the faculties , where nothing ? rom the external world intervenes , are universal and necessary . But the outward world is always changing ; therefore , the truths given by observation and experience are always contingent . Perhaps we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly seen machines for cutting nails ; if they have not , the consequence is by no means grave , for the instrument may be easily described . A nail-machine is composed of a pair of shears , which are made to work up and down , sometimes by steam , sometimes by water-power . A man Stan ( ls before the machine and inserts the end of an iron plate between the two parts of the shears when they open -- when the shears shut , they cut off a nail from this plate , and this nail depends for its size and shape upon the form of the shears-The machine is in operation . The plate is inserted , and the machine says , I perceive something hard , black , cold-what is this something I perceive Down come the shears , the nail is cut off , and rattles away into the box . Ah , ha says the machine , I now begin to see into the mystery of those same perceptions of which I was conscious a moment ago . It was a tenpenny nail , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat at the other . By this time the shears come down agaid , and the machine says , another tenpenny nail , by all that is glorious ! This aquisition of knowledge is beginning to be interesting-I must know a little more of the philosophy of this business . So the machine goes on to soliloquise-Listen I have now , says the machine , in my experience , memory , or nail box , several tenpenny nails. , These were undoubtelly acquired from , the external world , and are all that I have as yet acquired from that world . Therefore , if aught beside tenpenny nails exist in the external world , I have no conception of such existence , and that world is , consequently , for me , a collection of tenpenny nails . The following appear , therefore , to be unvarying laws of actual existence : Iirst , all things are long and four sided , and second , all things are sharp at one en ( l , and flat at the other . But stop ! says the machine-let us beware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same nails , I am not so clear that they were not formed by the concurrent action of two agents . Perhaps the material was furnished by external nature , while the form resulted from the law of my nature , the constitution of my shears , of my own nailmaking being . The following conclusion , at least , can not be shaken : -I may look upon every nail from two distinct points of view-first , as to its material , and second , as to its form ; the material undoubtedly comes from without , and is variable ; some nails are of brass , some are of iron ; but the form is invariable , and comes from within . All my nails must be long , and four sided , and that universally and necessarily ; but the material may vary , being sometimes brass , sometimes iron . This is plain ; for 1 acquire all my nails according to the law of my nail-making being ; that is , being translated from scientific into popular language , according to the form of my shears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the following postulate as the foundation of all my ulterior philosophy . " Whatever I may find in my nail-box , whether nails , or whatever else relating to nails , if I be convinced that it is what it is necessarily , and must be as it is universally , that same thing , whatever it be , was not derived to my nail-box from external nature , but finds the reason of its existence in the formation and shape of my shears . " And , conversely , whatever I may find in that same nail-box , which is neither necessary nor universal , but variable and contingent , has its origin , and the reason of its existence , not in the formation and shape of my shears , but in the external world . " Having relieved itself of this postulate , the machine continues its meditations in silence . The difference between the postulate of the nail-machine and that of the K6nigsberg philosopher , is by no means * reat . Let us use them both in eneavouring to get a clearer conception of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all material objects under the relations of space ? Is not space a necessary and universal form of all our sensible perceptions ? But what says the postulate ? The notion of space can not come from the external world ; for , if it did , it would not be attended with the conviction of universality and necessity with which it is attended . The notion of space comes then from the mind , and not at all from the outward world . ( We speak as a Kantian . ) Space then has no outward existence , and the supposition that it has , is the merest hypothesis imaginable . The arguments brought to prove such a position fall at once to the ground , for we have before proved that all our notion of space comes from within ; and any inference from the within to the without , is utterly invalid . We may treat time in the same manner , for time is the medium in which , universally and necessarily , we perceive events . Sensible objects and events , are the iron , brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed by the shears . After all , what can we make of time and space ? Simply this : time and space are the color of the intellectual spectacles through which we look on outward nature ; they have no real existence , but are a distorting medium which we spread before our eyes whenever we look on the outward . ( We give the Kantean statement . ) But it is impossible for any one to remain satisfied amid the skepticisms which arise from a denial of the real existence of space and time . If space and time are mere distorting media , through which we perceive outward nature , all our sensible perceptions are erroneous ; and , if no new method of acquiring knowledge can be discovered , we may as well doubt of every thing . What shall we do then : This is the question asked by our Transcendentalists . The first course which presents itself to the mind is that of en deavoring to eliminate the elements of space and time from all our conceptions ; but this is evidently impossible : we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can we transcend space and time ? This also is evidently impossible ; and the nearest approach to such a transcendent position , is a selfdeception by which we persuade ourselves that we have attained it , while we ignore every thing that tends to convince us that we are on the same standpoint with other men . The confused system of things seen from the point of view which seems to transcend space and time , gives us Transcendentalism . But why will this system sink God and nature in man ? For this reason-When a man has cut himself off from every thing which is not himself , ( which he must do if he attempt to transcend space and time ) he must find the reason of all things in himself . But the reason of God and the universe are not to be found in man , and , if we seek them there , we shall deny both God and the universe , putting some chimera , which does find its reason in man , in their place and stead . Transcendentalism is , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contradictions in the same subject . To follow a transcendental writer , we must not endeavor to find the logical connection of his sentences , for there is no such logical connection , and the writer himself never intended there should he . We ought rather to transcend space and time ( if indeed we can , ) and follow him there . A transcendentalist never reasons ; he describes what he sees from his own point of view . So the word Transcendentalism relates not to a system of doctrines hut to a point of view ; from which , nevertheless , a system of doctrines may be deduced . This explains to us why so many , whose desires were right , have // been unable to read the writings of the new school . They have tried to find a system of doctrines where they ought to have looked for the point of view . But to return to our postulate . We see every thing according to the law of cause and effect . The fact of causation is universal and necessary ; for every fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , which comes from the outworld , and on the other its form , which comes always in part from the law of causation . Let the reader turn for a moment to the postulate of the nail-machine . He will find that every truth which lies in the mind with a conviction of its universality and necessity , is derived to the mind from its own operations , and that it does not rest at all on observation and experience . But does not the truth that every effect must have its cause , lie in the mind with a conviction of its universality and necessity ? The consequence is clear . The law of causation is another distorting medium through which we look upon the outworld , and we have no legitimate authority for affirming that the external world is in any way subjected to that law . It is true that we are forced to look upon nature under that relation , but the necessity of the case arises not from the fact of the reality of the law of causation , ( we speak as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here all positive knowledge is annihilated . An idea is good and valid , if we may have any confidence in these forms of the soul ; hut what is the relation of the form of the shears to the outward object independent of the machine ? Who shall infer from the inward to the out-ward ? The system of Kant is one vast skepticism ; admit the fatal postulate , and there is no dodging the conclusion . It will he seen that our transcendentalists have not been unfaithful to the thought of their master . III . New systems of thought are propagated in various manners : sometimes by preaching , sometimes by private teaching , sometimes , as was the case with Mahometanism , by the sword . Neither of these methods has been adopted by the transcendentalists . Their doctrine has been a new religion rather than a new philosophy . Admission into their ranks has taken place by initiation rather than by instruction . In fact , many of the initiated seem to have remained ignorant , even to this day , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have aspired to the construction of a new power in society , one that should maintain the rights of the instinctive tendencies of the soul against the encroachments of conventionalism . The force of the school has been much increased by the mystery which it threw around its operations-which were , indeed , the greater part of the time , no operations at all . Hence arose the form of action par coterie . I-lad the real character of the system been known , the curiosity of the world would have remained tranquil , and Tran scendentalism , which , in a great measure , depended upon that curiosity for its actual existence , would have been stifled at its birth . There are , however , several objections against the form of operation par coterie . First , it is incompatible with the possession of powerful doctrines , for a sect holding to a strong creed is irresistibly impelled to preach it to the world and make converts . Secondly , a coterie inevitably forms a dialect for its own use , which can not be understood by any except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clique as bad as the conventionalism of the world ; thus the main end of the establishment of the sect is defeated . Experience has shown that such is the natural course of events ; for a cant has grown up and become current among the Transcendentalists which is worse , and more sickening , than that of the Millerites . Again , the ranks of a coterie are recruited , not by the earnest-minded , the thinking , but by those who are curious to dive into things shrouded in mystery , by those who are desirous of appearing to know more than their neighbors , of possessing some key to the secrets of the universe , of which the million are deprived . Thus , a movement beginning in strength degenerates into weakness ; vain and airy speculation takes the place of philosophy , fancy that of imagination , and mystification that of reasoning . No poet can thrive in such an atmosphere , for the genuine poet speaks to universal humanity , and can not be heard by a coterie , where they seek honor one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although commenced in strength , as a reaction against conventionalism , has totally miscarried . The strong members // have left the coterie for the world , and those that remain keep up the form of existence without the power thereof A late reviewer of Mr. Emerson 's Essays remarks , that he ( Mr. Emerson ) has a large and constantly increasing circle of readers . It is well for Mr. Emerson that his works are confined to no such large and increasing circle ; he speaks no longer to a coterie , to a private circle , however large and increasing . His works are beginning to he appreciated by his countrymen at large , and they will be judged , not by any conventional standard , hut according to their inherent merits . Private meetings of young *adies to settle the manner of the birth of the universe , the nature of social relations , and the basis ot self-reliance , are no longer the only l ) ublic to which he can appeal . The organization of the sect ( and it has an organization , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do which it has done . Its mission is past , let us call no names , but leave it to dissolve in peace . If the remains of a former vitality give it for a moment the form and appearance of life , let us resliect its present insignificance , remembering the good it has done . IV . The limits of this notice will not permit us to speak in order of each essay in Mr. Emerson 's new series . Like the ancient philosopher , who showed his customers a brick as a sample of the house he wished to sell , we shall select a small portion from the volume under consideration , as a specimen of Mr. Emerson 's whole edifice . Not that the parallel is by any means complete , for the portion we select , is , in itself , a living whole , and , although not a perfect exponent of the volume in which it is found , is , nevertheless , a very good exponent of Mr. Emerson 's general doctrine . It might indeed be wished that the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are now constructed , there is no connection between the beginning , the middle , and the end , no connection between the consecutive chapters . The Essay on " Experience , " however , seems to form a perfect whole , containing as much thought and poetry as any in the volume , and is , moreover , capable of being analysed : we select it therefore as the basis of our further remarks . But here a difficulty arises . The soul , as we have seen in the beginning of this notice , creates all-man , the universe , all forms , all changes ; and this wonderful power s possessed by each individual soul . Will there not then be necessarily a confusion , a mixture of universes , arising from the conflict of the creative energies of distinct souls ? This difficulty may be made to vanish . Suppose , for a moment , that I have a magical power over some great public building , the City Hall for example ; suppose every one of its parts , by a pre-existing harmony , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will the windows to open and shut , the doors to turn on their ninges , &amp;c. , they immediately do it . Would not this City Hall , thus immedidiately obedient to my will , be a new body with which I am invested ? Suppose I have power over a dog in the moon , so that he barks , runs , wags his tail , according to the action of my will , am I not existing " in this dim spot which men call earth , " and also , at the same time , in " the orbed maiden whom mortals call the moon ? " In the first case I exist as a man , in the second as an animal of the canine species . Without doubt , I may have millions of bodies ; there is no difficulty in the matter ; all that I operate upon by immediate magical power , be magia , to use the technology of Jacob Behmen , is to me a body . So I may be in this world a nian , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one , for one soul animates the two bodies . But mark ! While Jam immersed in things of time and sense , paying no regard to the soul , which is under and behind all , I think the man who is now moving about , trading and traveling on earth , to be myself , and only after deep thought , fasting , and meditation , do I find that I am also a dog . But here mysteries thicken . I am not only both a man and a dog , I am also neither a man nor a dog ; for I am the soul that speaks through both . " What we commonly call man ( says Mr. Emerson ) the eating , drinking , planting , counting man , does not as we know him represent himself , but misrepresents himself . Him we do not respect ; but the soul , whose organ he is , would he let it appear through his action , would make our knees bend . " The man , therefore , who has attained to right knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual soul . There is but one soul , which is the " Over Soul , " and this one soul is the animating principle of all bodies . When I am thoughtless , and immersed in things which are seen , I mistake the // person who is now writing this notice , for myself ; but when 1 am wise , this illusion vanishes like the mists of the morning , and then I know that what I thought to be myself , was only one of my manifestations , only a mode of my existence . It is 1 who bark in the dog , grow in the tree , and murmur in the passing brook . Think not , my brother , that thou art diverse and alien from myself ; it is only while we dwell in the outward appearance that we are two ; when we consider the depths of our being , we are found to be the same , for the same self , the same vital principle , animates us both . ( We speak as a Transcendentalist . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , createst the same ; for we create not two universes but one , for we two have but one soul , there is but one creative energy , which is above , and under , and through all . Well  --  but all this is no new theory , and whatever reverent disciple may have imagined that Mr. Emerson , or any " favorite of the gods , " has herein shown a wonderful originality , betrays a most triumphant ignorance of what is , and what has been . Such a doctrine was well known in the East , before history began ; no man can tell when it arose , it is as old as thought itself . " Rich , ( say the Vedas ) is that universal self , whom thou worshipest as the soul . " We should strive , therefore , to disentangle ourselves from the world of matter , from the bonds of time and space , that we may take our stand at once in the Oversoul , ' which we are , did we but realise it . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , when we attain to our true point of view , where the whole universe is seen to be one body . Then do we know of a truth that it is we who think , love , laugh , bark , growl , run , crawl , rain , snow , &amp;c. &amp;c . Mr. Emerson has given a beautiful expression to this thought : " There is no great and no small To the soul that maketh all : And where it comet/i , all things are ; And it coineth every where . " There is one mind , " says Mr. Emerson , in his Essay on History , " common to all individual men . Every man is an inlet to the same , and to all of the same . He that is once admitted to the right of reason , is made a freeman of the whole estate . What Plato has thought , he may think ; what a saint has felt , he may feel ; what at any time has befallen any man , he can understand . Who hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that bath or can be done , for this is the only and sovereign agent . " It may easily be seen that this amounts to an identification of man with God ; yet this system is by no means Pantheistic ; perhaps , indeed , we may be permitted to coin a new term , and call it Human Pantheism . Pantheism sinks man in God-makes him to be a phenomenon of the Divine existence  --  but this system , so far from being an absorption of humanity in God , is an absorption of God into the human soul . A pantheistic friend once explained to me the difference between his system and that of the Transcendentalists. " 1 hold myself , " said he , " to be a leaf , blown about by the winds of change and circumstance , and holding to the extreme end of one of the branches of the tree of universal existence ; but these gentlemen ( referring to the Transcendentalists ) , think themselves to be some of the sap . " But to return to the second series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our remarks altogether to the essay on " Experience . " F or the sake of connection and order , we will give a detailed analysis of the essay , stating the doctriiie in our own words , but giving full quotations where the subject matter is interesting , that the reader may be enabled to judge of our faithfulness . ILLUSION-When a man wakes up , as it were , comes to a consciousness of his own existence , and asks himself the questions of his origin and destiny , as , whence came I ? where am I going ? why do I exist ? he almost inevitably loses himself in the outworld . El am endeavoring , as the reader will remember , to state the substance of the Essay on Experience . ) A chain of causes has preceded our birth and actions ; and the deeds of this present time will be followed by a chain of results . But who knows any thing of these chains ? " We find ourselves ( says Mr. Emerson ) in a series of which we do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We awake and find ourselves on a stair : there are stairs below us which we seem to have ascended ; there are stairs above us , many a one , which go upward and out of sight . " We appear to possess no power , no creative energy , independent of these circumstances . The soul within // seems to slumber , and we attribute all to what is without ; but while we float on , half seeing , living in appearances , the soul silently and secretly performs its creative acts , so that we are astonished at the end of a day when we have done nothing , to find that real effects have been produced . We seem lost to our* selves , having faith only in appearances . Where we ourselves are , all is mean ; but where others are , there is beauty ; for who knows but the thing which gives dignity to life may be with them while we feel that it is far from us . " It is said , all martyrdoms looked mean when they were suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sail in . Embark , and the romance quits our vessel , and hangs on every sail in the horizon . . . . I quote another man 's saying ; unluckily that other withdraws himself in the same way , and quotes me . " Even adversity , affliction , the death of friends , have not power to awaken us to ourselves . While our eyes are thus fixed upon the outworld , we are lost to the reality of existence ; these things are not the soul , neither have they power to move it . " In the death of my son , now more than two years ago , I seem to have lost a beautiful estate-no more . I can not get it nearer to me . If to-morrow I should be informed of the bankruptcy of my principal debtors , the loss of my property would he a great inconvenience to me , perhaps , for many years , hut it would leave me as it found me-neither better nor worse . " TEMPERAMENT  --  but even here we obtain a glimpse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he brings eyes to see . " We animate what we can , and see only what we animate . It depends on the mood of the man whether he shall see the sunset or the fine poem . " Temperament must always be taken into consideration . It is in vain that the landscape he spread out , if the beholder be of a cold nature , and regard it not . We are not the creatures of the outworld , for the outworld acts on us only according to our temperaments ; and , in this , we already see some pre-eminence of ourselves over nature . And these outward things are not so outward after all as we have supposed . Politics , creeds , conventionalisms of societies , are not themselves causes trammelling us , but ill-looking accidents we have impressed upon nature . " I knew a witty physician who found theology in the biliary duct , and used to affirm that if there was disease in the liver , the man became a Calvinist , and if that organ was sound he became a Unitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the consequences which flow from this doctrine of the temperaments . Temperament is final from the point of view of nature only , but a deeper insight will transcend it . The doctrine of temperaments , taken by itself , ( says Mr. Emerson , ) leads to physical neeessity ; but there is a door into every intelligence , which is never closed , through which the Creator passes , bringing with him light and higher knowledge . Succxssion. - We are first deceived by the outworld , thinking it to be real , and ourselves a part of it ; afterwards , when we have been undeceived by a consideration of temperament , we fall into new illusions , thinking temperament to be final . More thought will disclose to us the secret of this illusion also ; it is this -- each soul is constituted in a peculiar manner , subjected to moods and changes , and the soul , by its moods and changes , is the reason and ground of the temperaments , as these last are the reason and ground of outward nature . " The secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moods or objects . " Men are constituted each in his own way ; there is little that is infinite in them . The nature of each creates his temperament , the temperament of each does its part in creating outward nature . " A man is like a bit of Labrador spar , which has no lustre as you turn it in your hand , until you come to a particular angle ; then it shows deep and beautiful colors . There is no adaptation or universal applicability in men , but each has his special talent ; and the mastery of successful men consists in adroitly keeping themselves where and when that turn shall be oftenest to be practised . We do what we must , and call it by the best names we can , and would fain have the praise of having intended the result which ensues . " If we take one man , two men , with their temperaments , natural character , or what you will , it is not enough ; they can not constitute the universal harmony . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we seek . The parti-cobred wheel must revolve very fast to appear white . " SuRFAcE-Temperament finds its reason in the character of the individual man , and outward things are as the temperament of him who perceives them . // But is this really so ? Is the universe which we construct in thought , the same with that in which we have the good fortune , or the misery , to live ? Nay , hut who art thou , 0 man , that askest ? No good comes from too much prying into nature ; the actual , it must be confessed , 5 against us , and , if we have faith in it , we lose our convictions of the supremacy of the soul . " Nature hates peeping , and our mothers speak her very sense when they say , Children eat your victuals , and say no more about it . " We find , when we think , either a contradiction in our thoughts , or a want of harmony with actual existence . We are therefore , of necessity , skeptics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy and science , but live , as others , on the surface of things . " What help , indeed , from thought ? Life is not dialectics . " We live amid surfaces , and the true art of life is to skate well upon them . " The xvise man will live in the present . He knows that the appearances are at least appearances ; of other things he knows little . " Five minutes to-day , are worth as much to me as five minutes in the next millenium . Let us he poised and wise in our own to-day . Let us treat the men and women well : treat them as if they were real : perhaps they are . " This " perhaps they are , " is the profound sentence ; we have proved them to be mere appearances , yet even the doubt presents itself-perhaps they are real . What shall we do amid these conflicting doubts ? There is but one plan , enjoy the present , and let all these annoyances go by the board . Perhaps all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look deep , but skate on the surface . " Great gifts are not got by analysis . Every thing good is on the highway . " Let us no longer be troubled by these high ethical questions which result in no good . Follow your own impulses and all will be well . How can a man have peace when he calls that crime which is no evil , but , on the contrary , according to nature ? " Nature , as we know her , is no saint . The lights of the church , the ascetics , the Gentoos and Grahamites , she does not distinguish by any favor . She comes eating and drinking and sinning . Her darlings , the great , the strong , the beautiful , are not children of our law , do not come out of the Sunday School , nor weigh their food , nor punctually keep the commandments . If we will be strong with her strength , we must not harbor such disconsolate consciences , borrowed too much from the consciences of other nations . We must set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , past or to come . " Take things as they come , live in the present , enjoy the present , and ask no questions , " in the morning I awake , and find the old world , wife , hahes , and mother , Concord and Boston , the dear old spiritual world , and even the dear old devil not far off . If we take the good we find , asking no questions , we shall have heaping measures . " " We may climb into the thin and cold realm of pure geometry and lifeless science , or sink into that of sensation . Between these extremes is the equator of life , of thought , of spirit , of poetry-a narrow belt . " Live on the surface , and ask no questions . SURPRIsE. - It would , undoubtedly , be pleasant , if it were possible , to live in this world as knowing something beyond the mere surface of existence . But it is in vain that we construct our positive systems . " Presently comes a day , or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfits the conclusions of nations and of years ! " Our systems never cover the right matters , always is there a gap through which the reality oozes out . " Life is a series of surprises , and would not be worth taking or keeping if it were not . God delights to isolate us every day , and hide us from the past and the future . We would look about us , and with great politeness he draws down before us an impenetrable screen of purest sky , and another behind us of purest sky . You will not remember , ' he seems to say , and you will not expect . " ' We are not what we wish we were , we are not what we think ourselves to be . " The ardors of piety agree at last with the coldest skepticism - that nothing is of us or our worksthat all is of God . " " The individual is always mistaken . He designed many things , and drew in other persons as coadjutors , blundered much , and something is done ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always mistaken . It turns out somewhat new , and very unlike what be promised himself . " REALITy-Temperament gives us the key to Illusion . Outward nature is as it is , because our temperaments are as they are . But , again , these temperaments are a new , and a higher illusion ; they result from the necessity of succession in // the moods of the soul But these moods also are finite and transient ; where shall we look then for Reality ? Nowhere but in the soul itself can it be found . We have described life as a flux of moods , but we must not forget there is that in us which is permanent and unchangeable . This unchanging principle is revealed to us by consciousness , and by it we are identified , now with the infinite God , now with the flesh of the body . So we may look upon ourselves from two distinct points of view ; from the first , we are seen to be the absolute and unchanging God , from the second , we seem identified with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we give to this generalization the name of Being , and thereby confess that we have arrived as far as we can go . Suffice it for the joy of the universe , that we have itot arrived at a wall , but at interminable oceans . " SUBJECT as THE ONE. - " it is very unhappy , but too late to be helped , the discovery we have made , that we exist . That discovery is called the Fall of Man . Ever afterwards we suspect our instruments . We have learned that we do not see directly , but mediately , and that we have no means of correcting these colored and distorted lenses which we are , or of computing the amount of their errors . Perhaps these subject-lenses have a creative power ; perhaps there are no objects . Once we lived in what we saw , now , the rapaciowsness of this new power , which threatens to absorb all things , engages us . Nature , art , persons , letters , religions , objects , successively tumble in , and God is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective phenomena ; every evil and every good thing is a shadow which we cast . The great and crescent self , rooted in absolute nature , supplants all relative existence , and ruins the kingdom of mortal friendship and love . The soul is not twin-born , but the only begotten , and though revealing itself as a child in time , child in appearance , is of a fatal and universal power , admitting no co-life . Every day , every act , betrays the ill-concealed deity . We believe in ourselves as we do not believe in others . We permit all things to ourselves , and that which we call sin in others , is experiment for us . It is an instance of our faith in ourselves , that men never speak of crime as lightly as they think : or , every man thinks a latitude safe for him . self , which is nowise to be indulged to another . The act looks very differently on the inside and on the outside ; in its quality , and in its consequences . Murder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romancers will have it ; it does not unsettle him , or fright him from his ordinary notice of trifles : it is an act quite easy to be contemplated , but in its sequel it turns out to be a horrible jangle and confounding of all relations . . . . Inevitably does the universe wear our color , and every object fall successively into the subject itself . The subject exists , the subject enlarges ; all things , sooner or later , fall into place . As I am , so I see ; use what language we will , we can never say any thing but what we are ; Hermes , Cadmus , Columbus , Newton , Bonaparte , are the mind 's ministers . " CoNcLusIoN. - " Illusion , Temperament , Succession , Surface , Surprise , Reality , Subjectiveness ,  --  these are the threads in the loom of time , these are the lords of life . " First we wake up to a full conviction of the real existence of the outworld ; this is Illusion . Then we recognize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our natures , and find that much we considered real was a deception aris ing from our Temperament . Here com mences the emancipation of the soul from the illusions of sense , here commences the doubt whether nature outwardly exists . After this , we find in ourselves a law of consecutive changes , which unlocks new mysteries , showing us more clearly that we create the outworld and then deceive ourselves by supposing our own creation to have an outward existence ; this is Succession . Then comes the rule of life . If these things are mere appearances , they are at least appearances , and are real to us ; let us therefore live in appearances , skate on them , but never again allow ourselves to be involved in them ; this is Surface . But always , whatever rule of life we may form for ourselves , the soul intervenes ; new appearances , new forms , spring up , unexpectedly to ourselves , and the rule of life is found to be futile ; this is Surprise . This intervention of the soul reveals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this is Reality . After this , the full truth flashes upon us , that we are not only God , but also // nature , that God and nature are but aspects of the individual soul ; this is Subjectivetess . V. Such appears to be the meaning and connection of Mr. Emerson 's Essay on Experience . The other essays contain the same thoughts , the same general material , expressed in a different manner . We do not conceive it necessary to enter into any general appreciation of the system ; its partial and inadequate character is manifest , and its errors expose themselves . We have called this system Transcendentalism ; but only by a gross abuse of language . Idealism and Transcendentaism are very different from the doctrine we have been examining ; and we regret that our misapplication of terms has been rendered necessaiy by the popular usage . We shall take occasion to speak farther of this matter in a future article.
