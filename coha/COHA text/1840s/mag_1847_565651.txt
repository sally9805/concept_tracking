txt WE give , below , the titles of some few of the documents and speeches of the Congress which , as we begin to write , is just closing its existence . Publications of this class are rarely made the subjects of literary criticism . Perhaps if it were otherwise , our country might be the gainer , though some of our most conspicuous men might be the sufferers . But it is not our intention in this article to give an example of such criticism . We only propose , with these pamphlets and other materials of the same kind before us , to offer some free remarks of our own on the aspect of public affairs , and particularly on the state of political parties , at this present epoch of the dissolution of the twenty-ninth Congress . rrhe administration of President Monroe , from 1817 to 1825 , is remembered as " the era of ' good feelings . " An administration without an opposition was what had never before existed-not even in the days of Washington  --  and what can hardly be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted in the fact that the two great parties which had originated in the discussions and controversies attendant upon the adop * Message of the President of the United States to the two Houses of Congress at the commencement of the second session of the twenty-ninth Congress , Dec. 8th , 1846 .

For a time those parties were kept alive by the uncertainties incidental to the organization of the government under the Constitution1 and the gradual development of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of commercial restrictions , and Mr. Madison 's war with Great Britain . But at the close of the war , the federalists ceased to act as a party in national politics , and Mr. Monroe was elected to the presidency with only a slight show of opposition , which disappeared immediately afterwards . Individual federalists , no doubt , retained their old prejudices , not only against Jefferson and Madison , but against the men who were then holding the high offices of the general government . In some of the states the federalists were still in power , and party distinctions were kept up a little longer in reference to state politics ; just as in the dispensation of appointments under the general government those old distinctions were so vividly remembered , that no man 's chance of an office under Monroe was worth much , unless he had been a democrat under Jefferson , or at least had not opposed the war with Great Britain . But in reference to national politics , there was no opposition to the administration which had come in by lineal democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles or measures for which , or in those against which they had been contending , any sufficient reason for keeping up their opposition . The war and the embargo , and the various measures which had grown out of the relations of this country to the wars of the French revolution , were no longer in dispute ; but peace and commerce were shower-306 April , // ing their blessings over the whole Union . The federalist navy had fought itself into universal popularity ; and the gunboats that were to have superseded it were too much forgotten to be laughed at . A national bank , three times and a half as great as that created by Ilamilton , had been forced upon the democratic party , in spite of their principles and their prejudices , by the otherwise hopeless disorder which the war had produced in the finances and the currency . The acquisition of Louisiana , against which the federalists had protested on constitutional grounds , had become historical ; and so manifest were the benefits which that great measure had conferred upon the country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of universal national pride . And , finally , the Constitution itself , in the formation and adoption of which the parties , federal and anti-federal , afterwards federal and democratic or republican , came into being-had become the security and the joy of the whole country ; and the strong general government which the federalists had deemed so necessary to the public welfare , and which it was the object of the Constitution to create , had become so strong even in the hands of the anti-federalists and their auccessors , that the jealousy for state rights had even passed over , years ago , from the party that had framed the " Virginia resolutions of 1798 , " to the party that had followed the leading of Hamilton , Pickering , and Jay . For the federalists , in such circumstances , to have maintained themselves as a party  --  the old federal party-in opposition to an administration which could not be conducted otherwise than upon federal principles , and which was under an inevitable necessity of adopting federal measures , would have been simply factious . Happily they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a party they had grown too weak to have any hope of recovering their long lost power . Besides all this , the administration was conducted with so much of integrity and wisdom , and with so manifest a regard to the interests of the whole country , that no opposition could have held up its head without shame . The only great controversy in Congress , during those eight years , was the controversy between the North and the South respecting the admission of Missouri to the Union with a constitution which did not abolish slavery ,  --  a controversy with which the administration as such had nothing to do . TIws it came to pass that in the presidential election of 1824 and the preceding canvas , the democratic party was itself dissolved . As there was no opposition party it was impossible to have any one democratic candidate for the presidency . Cra*vford , Calhoun , Clay , Jackson , and Quincy Adams , who had all been democrats at least as long ago as in the days of Jefferson , were before the public as candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parties , were divided among these candidates partly by personal preferences and partly by local prejudices . So complete was the disorganization of the old democratic party , that of the three candidates who were returned to the tiouse of Representatives as having received the highest number of votes in the electoral colleges , the " regular candidate , " ( Mr. Crawford , ) nominated by a meeting of the democratic members of Congress , according to the then established usages of the party , had received the smallest number of votes  --  a smaller number than any other person voted for , save one . The parties which came into existence under the administration of Mr. Quincy Adams , resembled indeed , in many points , the parties which had been disorganized and // dissolved in the progress of the preceding administration ; but they were palpably not the same . The various elements of opposition to the reelection of Mr. Adams were consolidated into the Jackson party ; and the accession of General Jackson to the presidency in 18*29 , was claimed to be a triumph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in private and public life , found their party relations suddenly and strangely dislocated . Many a man who had been a federalist from the days of his youth , when Timothy Pickering was Secretary of State , and who as a federalist had made fun of the gunboats and the salt mountain , and had admired such sermons as that of Dr. Emmons on the character of Rehoboam , and had railed against the embargo , and the war , and the subserviency to Bonaparte , and had rejoiced in the Hartford Convention , now found himself , he knew not how , a democrat in regu . Jar standing and full communion . And on the other hand , men who had been steadfast democrats ever since the time of the whiskey insurrection-men who in public life had been the very champions of the party , and had achieved immortal honors in defending the war , the non-intercourse , and the embargo , were as suddenly , without any intention of change , transformed , they knew not how , into federalists of the deepest die . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotild have afflicted the unlucky subject with a more profound astonishment . Rip Van Winkle was not more completely mystified when he came down from his long sleep in the mountains , than was many a veteran politician , when the Jackson party -- tn defiance of the notorious fact that one element of its strength was the implacable dislike with which many federalists regarded Mr. Adams on &amp;Q**oUnL of his having deserted them so long ago*- ' *-clain-ied for itself a perfect identity with the party which had come into power with President Jefferson . There was no such identity . The most that could be said with truth , was that the party formed in Opposition to the administration of Mr. Quiricy Adams wa* an attempt to reorganize the old but lost democratic party , without adopt ' ing or intending to adopt those prin* ciples and measures of the old de ' mocracy , which experience had found to be impracticable , and by the relinquishment of which , federalism itself had been won to the support of a democratic administration . In the signs of the times now passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have divided the American people for somewhat more than twenty years , are soon to . be superseded by new political combinations . We do not indeed discover a complete parallel between these days of President Polk and the halcyon days of President Monroe . It has not entered into our thoughts that the term of the present administration will hereafter be characterized as another " era of good feelings . " Nor do we see any prospect that all parties will lose their organization and existence by being united in the support of an administration too l ) opular to he opposed . The dissolution of parties which we now venture , doubtfully , to anticipate , must needs be by a different process . If it is to take place at all , it will take place not by the absorption of all parties into one , but by the breaking up of all parties into separate fragments , and their reconstruction afterwards under the influence of other interests and other sympathies . Some old questions have been settled ; some old controversies have spent themselves ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forces which will ere long be powerful enough to sever all party bonds , not excepting that which Qne of our greatest 5t&amp;tes* // men has called " the cohesive power of public plunder . " The indications of a new epoch in the history of party politics seem not to have attracted the attention of the public at large , nor indeed do they seem to us to have received in leading political circles that consideration which they deserve . Our own position , independent of all parties , and aloof from the conflicts which can not but disturb the judg. me *t of those who engage in them , enaLles us to see some of these things in a different light from that in which they are seen by professed politicians . As we have watched the progress of affairs in Congress for a twelvemonth past , it has often seemed to us that the wise men there , and the unwise , of whatever party name , and from whatever portion of the Union , were swayed to a great extent by forces which they themselves had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Representatives during the last two sessions , how many in the Senate , have been quite perplexed on various occasions to know what party they belonged to . In how many instances have men found themselves , strangely enough , compelled to vote against what they supposed to be their own party . How many measures of an administration which was supposed to be sustained by a large majority in each wing of the capitol , have been defeated . Should it be said that all these things are because of the uncertainty whether Mr. Benton or Mr. Cass , Mr. Calhoun or somebody as little thought of as Mr. Polk was three years ago , is to be the candidate of the demo. cratic party in the next presidential election , together with the correlate uncertainty whether Mr. M'Lean or Mr. Clay , Mr. Corwin or some military chief , is to be the candidate of the whigs ,  --  we need not deny the assertion , but we ask what makes the uncertainty on both sides . Should it be said , on the other hand , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint is to be found in the imbecility of the President and his cabinet*-we need not take the trouble to deny that position , however capable of denial it may be ; but we ask , How came such an administration to be in power ? - by what fatality did it happen that the great democratic party , in selecting a candidate for the place of Jackson and of Jefferson , was compelled to pass over all its first rate statesmen , and to bring forward one whose superior availability as a candidate consisted in the fact of his comparative obscurity ? The proximate causes of these party dislocations , even if truly conjectured , are not the only causes to be inquired for . Whoever would not rest in an entirely superficial view of the changes which are going on , must resolve these changes not into the apparently accidental combination of circumstances , but into the steady and continued influence of remoter causes . Let them be thus considered , and we shall see in all these changes the germs of greater changes yet to come . First among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we conceive , are working to effect new combinations of political interests and sympathies , abd thus a dissolution and reconstruction of existing parties-is the fact , that now at last the seat of power and of those interests and impulses that are to control all others , is in the West . The transfer of power from the old States to the new , or , more strictly , from the Atlantic slope to the regions drained by the Mississippi , has long been foreseen ; and the effects of that expected transfer upon our government have been , from time to time , the subject of speculation . But now , already , more than half the population of the Union is west of the Alleghanies . Three years hence , another census will show the results of ten years ' growth , since // : 1840 , in those regions where the population nearly doubled itself , by immigration and natural increase , in the ten years preceding the last census . In the first Congress elected after the new apportionment consequent upon the census , the representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the result ? Not merely will the Vest come in for the lion 's share in the distribution of federal offices and the dispensation of patronage . Not merely will Presidents and Heads of Departments , Judges and Ambassadors , consuls and midshipmen , West Point cadets and Washington clerks , be mostly western men . All this indeed is what politicians of a certain class regard as the main chance in politics , but all this is only the dust of the balance . From that time , the question in regard to the entire course of our national legislation-the question in regard to all the direction of the federal government , will be , not what do the interests of the North require , nor what do the interests of the South require-not what will enrich the manufacturers of New England or the iron-masters of Pennsylvania , the cotton growers of Georgia or the slave breeders of Virginia ,  --  but what do the interests of the West requir&amp;. - what will bring prosperity and riches to the immense agricultural regions that are able to feed the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor , the impulses and passions , the sagacity and statesmanship that are to shape the character of our diplomacy and to control our foreign relations , the public sentiment by which questions of peace and war are to be ultimately determined , will be such as may proceed from those various elements , which , mingling and coalescing under peculiar influences , physical and moral , are now forming , or have already formed , the character of the West , whether for good or evil . In our politics , the West will no longer be a makeweight with which the South can overbalance the North , or by means of which the North can gain advantages over the South ; the West will be itself the country ; the interests of the West will be , or will be assumed to be , the interests of the United States ; the parties contending for ascendancy will be western parties , originating in different views of western interests , or in the rivalries or personal antipa tIles of western men ; and whatever advantages , in the collision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic States at the expense of another , must be gained only by means of such divisions as may happen to arise at the *Vest . If the West shall demand the expenditure of millions for artificial harbors on its lakes and for the improvement of all its navigable streams , the West will do as it pleases . If the West shall be of opinion that its interests will be promoted by a railway to Oregon , with a branch to Acapulco and another to Lake Athabasca , the West will have its own way . If the West shall burn with the spirit of conquest and annexation , now for a march to " fifty-four forty , " and now for a " revel in the halls of Montezuma , " such will be the spirit of the government , if the genius of the western mind , growing up where the wildness of nature has not yet been subdued , and trained to habits of exaggeration by familiarity with oceanlike prairies and rivers of incredible length and volume , shall have an irresistible propensity for gasconade , uttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or after the manner of Ancient Pistol ; then our Presidents will swagger in their inaugural orations , and our state pa* pers will be written with an air as of a man that " can whip his weight in wild cats . " How far that absolute and final preponderance of the West , which is so near , has already begun to af feet our public affairs , we need not // undertake to demonstrate . Few of our readers will ask for any proof that the preponderance begins to operate . Any intelligent man who will recollect the leading events of the last three years , will see that the perturbations of parties have been caused by the approach of a new center of gravitation . Coincident with this great increase of wealth and population at the West , and the consequent concentration of power in the hands of the new States , there is another influence which of ' itself is more powerful than superficial politicians have imagined . The changes which are taking place in the commercial system of Great Britain , and which must soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon American politics . The commercial system of the British empire . and the systems of all other civilized governments , were founded upon principles of political economy which the progress of science has shown to be absurd . However important it may be , in some peculiar circumstances , to promote the growth of some particular branch of industry by a temporary stimulus of bounties on production or of taxes upon competition-whatever may be demanded by considerations of public policy under a system which regards hostility towards all the world as the natural and normal condition of a prosperous people , and which therefore treats every interest as subordinate to the one great interest of making the country in the highest degree capable of defense or of aggression by making it al ) solutely independent of all the rest of the world ; nothing in political science is better established by deduction from first principles and by induction of facts , than that , in a civilized State , the freedom of every citizen to buy in the cheapest market wherever it may be , and to sell in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing , the freedom of capital , of labor and of ingenuity , to find their own employment , is the surest way to national wealth . When this simple but great idea was first announced , it was scouted by statesmen and all " practical men " a a mere crotchet of speculative philosophy . The Presbyterian divines in the Westminster Assembly did not reject the doctrine of absolute religious freedom more earnestly ; the cardinals and inquisitors under the pontificate of Urban VIII , did not reject the discoveries of Galileo more perem ptorily ; than the practical statesmen of Britain and the world rejected the idea that freedom is the vital element of industry , and that capital , labor and inventive genius , in a civilized State , are most productive of national wealth when left to the uncounteracted operation of those laws of trade which have their being in the constitution of man and of material nature . There is not at this day a pluralist or a bishop in " the Church of England bylaw established , " to whose mind the indispensableness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the indispensableness of restrictions and regulations to the prosperity of all kinds of industry , was to the minds of monopolists and legislators seventy years ago . But from that day to this , the leading doctrines of Political Economy , though everywhere disputed against , have been steadily making progress in the world . They have been finding their way into the systems of education , and are taught in the lecture-rooms of old conservative universities . They have been taking hold upon the minds of nations , and are beginning to be recognized by common men as principles of common sense . And now at last they are beginning to take effect upon laws , and in Britain they have become a guiding light to even tory legislation . The old commercial system of the British empire , a system that has been the slow growth // of centuries , has begun to be broken down by tory statesmen in obedience to the popular will . The repeal of the corn laws there was the commencement of a revolution which can never be turned backward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire industry of the world . The idea , of which that revolution is the expression , will spread over Europe . Sovereigns and lawgivers of every name , King , Kaiser , Sultan , Czar-statesmen of various functions , ministers of the interior and ministers of foreign affairs , ministers of finance and ministers of marine , ministers of culte and ministers of war-will be compelled to learn successively by one slow process and another , that the wealth of the State is produced by the industry of the people ; that industry rejoices and fi*urishes only in proportion as it is free ; and that the productive energies of the State are to be stimulated and guided , and its resources developed , not directly by the interference of . sovereign power , but indirectly by those moral influences that affect the character of the people , making them more diligent , more frugal , more intelligent and more enterprising . If the new legislation in Great Britain is likely to produce such effects upon Europe , what will be its effects upour own country ? The West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to be peopled . The prairies and forests of the West are to be converted into cultivated fields . Herds such as Job and Abraham never dreamed of , are to inhabit the haunts of the buffalo ; and flocks , more numerous than ever were tended on the sierras of Spain , are soon to yield their fleeces , where now the red hunter and the wolf are pursuing their prey . The mineral resources of the West-huge rocks of virgin copper , vast fields of lead and mountains of iron-are to be laid open to the world . The West has the power to control the policy of the Union ; and the interests of the West , demanding free access to all the markets of the world , that whatever it produces may be sold at the dearest rate , and that whatever it requires from abroad may be bought at the cheapest rate , will compel the legislation of Congress to adapt itself to the changes that are taking place in the commercial system of Great Britain and of Europe . How manifest is it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , in spite of their traditions , to give up their old restrictive systems founded upon the narrowest and blindest dogmas of national selfishness , and to enter into new relations toward each other . Just at the juncture when the first truths of political economy were beginning to be recognized as practical truths by British statesmen ,  - -  just at the moment when the popular demand for the abolition of the corn laws , once defeated , was renewing itself in a tone that could not be trifled with ,  --  just at that moment , in the arrangements of God 's fores*ht , there arose a cry of famine as from the dwellings of a city long besieged ; and the necessity of opening the ports of Britain for the harvests of the world became inevitable . The famine , resulting in part from causes that threaten to be permanent , is spreading over other European lands . Thousands of laborers - British , German , Scandinavian , Swiss-fleeing to this new wprld from the lingering death that awaits them on their native soil , and hastening along our great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of the West with a rapidity that grows continually more portentous . And in return the West , strengthened for production no less than for dominion by the presence of every new laborer that steps upon its soil , is pourjng its surplus harvests into the ports of famine-stricken nations , a1nd while enriching iwelf // by the new vah*e that is thus given to its soil and to its products , is enriching the East by the profits of so great a commerce . The old world having thus got a taste of the riches of America , and our own West having once found a vent for its surplus products in lands beyond the Atlantic , that commerce , we may be sure , will not be abolished either for the the benefit of British landlords , or for the sake of forcing the growth of manufactures here , till either Britain shall have forgotten the lessons of a dear exl ) erience , or the West shall have no power to sway the legislation of our Union . What effect this change in the systems of commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements of parties in the United States , it is hardly necessary for us to say . Let what is called " the tariff question " be once understood* in all quarters , to be finally disposed of ; and the political parties now existing can not but be resolved into their elements . And that the question will be finally disposed of whenever the people of the West shall come to know what is required by their interest as a great , industrious , agricultural community ,  --  who can doubt ? Our policy heretofore has been mischievous to industry rather by its fluctuations than by any more positive vices . And as long as our policy is swayed by southern statesmanship , it can . not but fluctuate . At the commencement of the federal government , the interests of the northern Atlantic States were essentially commercial ; and the measures of the two " old federalist " ad ministrations were designed for the protection and encouragement of commerce . So far were Hamilton and his party from holding the modern tariff doctrines , that they did not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While Washington was President , and Hamilton was Secre tary of the Treasury , the beginning was made of a system of internal taxation by an act imposing duties on distilled spirits and stills . Under the administration of the elder Adams , direct taxes were resorted to for revenue in time of peace . With Jefferson came the idea that all the ordinary expenses of the federal government were to be sustained by taxes upon commerce . The commercial States , as they then were , might have borne that burthen and gone on in an uninterrupted career of prosperity . In course of time , the growth of population and the accumulated profits of a commerce that encircled the world wotild have introduced the manufacturing arts , slowly and healthily , without the stimulus of duties for protection . But the shifting impulses of southern statesmanship ,  - -  ever restless because the South , with that paralysis of industry inseparable *fr'om slavery , never p*pspers-gave us embargo , non-interc*rse , war with Great Britain , and thus for a time the annihilation of commerce . In this way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - employments , and the people of New England , under southern ascendancy , became , against their own choice , a manufacturing people . Nor can the South be satisfied with any system even of its own framing ; for under any system -- if only it may stand till Yankee versatility shall have had time to adjust its arrangements accordingly , the North will be found prospering , and the South will be comparatively impoverished . But when the power shall have passed unequivocally and irretrievably into the hands of the great West , and when the West shall have once ascertained for itself what policy will most effectually promote the increase of its population and its wealth , that will be the established system of the country ; and against that policy , whatever it shall be , the States of the seaboard , northern or // southern , will find it vain to protest and vain to agitate . We are aware that what we are writing , particularly on this topic , may displease many of our New England readers ; but we beg them to take notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to please them as it is to express what we believe to be truth on this important subject . If they choose to be offended at our calling their attention to the great probabilities that are just before us , we can only regret that it is so . They may exclaim against us , if they please , and reject our " free trade notions " as the mere dreams of bookish men . They may pronounce the entire science of Political Economy a humbug which no " practical man " can believe in . We only ask them to look calmly at our prognostication of the future , and to judge whether that which we predict can in any way be avoided . Say not that we predict the ruin of New England and the North . No such thing . Disastrous as may be those sudden and frequent changes of national policy which tend to destroy the value of her investments , and to break down the spirit and impair the moral integrity of her people , New England has advantages , both physical and moral , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which will show their value when the period of those changes has gone by . These Atlantic States have before them a destiny which does not depend on protective tariffs . The commerce of the West , under any system , whether of free trade or of restriction , must be primarily with them . In proportion as that great central basin of the continent becomes the abode of industry , the products of that industry must find their way to the markets of the world through these Atlantic States . A commerce of which it is difficult , as yet , for any man to form an adequate conception  --  a commerce that will ultimately exceed in value the commerce of India and of China with all the world , must pass along our thoroughfares , must center in our ports , must be negotiated by our merchants . Such a commerce , but far inferior in amount , was that which passing overland from India towards Europe , through Palestine , by the rude vehicles of those ancient ages , gave to the reign of Solomon its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce which afterwards built up the gorgeousness of Tyre as the prophet saw it and described it , when by the word of the Lord he doomed it to destruction. # Such too , but of inferior value , was the commerce which made the Venice of the middle agesIn all these instances , commerce was determined to certain points by accidental and temporary causes . But the causes that must bring to our ports the commerce of the peopled and industrious West , are permanent . The time may come indeed , when some portion of the boundless production of what will then be not the western but the central States of our Union , will find its way through the gorges of the Rocky Mountains to the ports of Oregon and California , there to be exchanged for the teas of China , the silks and spices of India , the coffee of Java , and the silver of Peru . But so long as what we now call the West shall have any thing to sell which Europe or Western Asia or Northern or Western Africa can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those regions of the globe can sell , so long our cities must be the emporiums , and our merchants the carriers and negotiators of all that traffic . The position of these Atlantic States in relation to the West , together with the natural and artificial chan nels of communication between these States and that vast interior of the continent , is a divine // charter of prosperity , worth more than all the protective tariffs that ever were shaped into schedules . Such a traffic filling the cities and the country of our sea-coast with riches , will afford in all these States , a natural and healthy stimulus to every kind of productive industry . All the resources which nature has given us in our soil , in our rushing streams , in our mines and quarries , in the bright lakes which our winters congeal into massive crystal , will be converted into wealth . Every thing that Yankee ingenuity availing itself of incomparable advantages , and wielding the capital which commerce has accumulated-every thing that Yankee industry building its workshops at every waterfall and crowding its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the raw material cheaper than it can import the same thing from a distance of three thousand miles , will be fabricated in the manufactories of the Atlantic States , for consumption at home , and for consumption wherever an internal commerce reaching by so many arteries the deep interior of a populous continent , or a foreign commerce spreading its sails to the breezes of every sea , can find a market . But we are in danger of digressing too far from our argument . We only intended to point out the strong probability that the advancing revolution in the commercial systems of the civilized world , coincident as it is in time with the transfer of political power to the States beyond the Alleghanies , will ere long break down the existing arrangements of political parties . That the party which was defeated on the tariff question in the last presidential election ( not very fairly we admit , but yet effectually , as appears by the action of Congress ) will never be rallied again under the banner of protection for manufacturing indus . try , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not greatly mistaken the tendency of the causes which are acting to form the opinions of the American people , particularly in the great and growing - States of the West , the question of a protective system will in a few years at the farthest be quite out of date . There is another element , the disturbing influence of which upon party organizations , has been mani* fest in the divisions and changes of the twenty-ninth Congress . A crisis in the history of American slavery is not far distant . Our politics ever since the formation of the federal government , have been embarrassed or swayed by the influence of slavery in one relation or another ; and to a great extent the Southern States have had the government in their own hands . An indication of what has been , may be seen in one short statement . Sixty-eight years have passed since the organization of the government under the consti. tuiio* and during all that time , with brief exceptions , amounting in all to only twelve years and one month , the highest place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by citizens of slaveholding States . Who believes that all this will be so hereafter ? Who believes that the great democratic party of the North , strengthened by the accession and constant expansion of the mighty West , will hereafter consent to be led and controlled by the aristocracy of the South ? But we will not pur* sue the inquiry . It might lead us into details which , in the present discussion , we would rather avoid . The mere inquiry however will be suggestive in regard to the prospect of the permanency of existing par* ties . The crisis which we anticipate in the history of slavery , and which seems to " cast its shadow before , " as it approaches , shedding " disastrous twilight " over the field of party politics , and " with fear of change perplexing " - not monarchs indeed , // but sovereign democrats ,  --  is the crisis of the question whether slavery is to be permanent upon the soil of the American Union . Since the establishment of our independence as a nation , various influences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unnatural support to the existence of slavery in our Southern States , and to stimulate its growth . One State after another , at the North , abolished slavery within a few years after the revolution , generally by some gradual process . But long ago , the progress of liberty was stayed at the southern border of Pennsylvania , and that line ( " Mason and Dixon 's " ) has been regarded as a permanent limit between the slaveholding States and the free . Meanwhile the inventions of Arkwright in England and of Whitney in our own country , have wrought a change in commerce which has created a sudden and almost unlimited demand for the great staple of the Southern States . Half the world has been clothed in cotton raised upon American soil by the labor of negro slaves . No other country capable of producing cotton has been in circumstances to enter into competition with us in supplying the manufactories of ' Britain , France , and more recently of our own country . Thus American slaveholders having a monopoly of cottoa in the markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been lucrative far beyond what it could have been in any competition with the intelligent and voluntary industry of freemen . The lucrativeness of slave labor determines the value of the slave as a chattel to be bought and sold , and the high price of the slave inspires the master with an invincible prejudice against emancipation . While the new cotton lands of the far South , greatly extended by the acquisition of Louisiana , have been rapidly brought under cultivation , the demand for slaves in the markets there has kept April* tip the price of human flesh in States which , had there been no market for their negroes , would have abolished slavery , long ago , because of its utter unprofitableness . Slavery , all this while , has constituted a flrm* political bond among the States in which it has existed . By the efficacy of this bond of union , the federal government has been supplied with Presidents , Chief Justices , Heads of Departments , foreign Ambassadors , and a disproportionate number of army and navy officer&amp; from the slaveholding States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however they may have differed in opinion and sympathy on other subjects , have been careful to hold together for the great interest of slavery . In this spirit , they have carefully taken advantage of every insurrection or detected conspiracy , and still more of every anti.slavery movement at the North or in foreign countries , to stir up the fear and passions of the unthinking southern populace against the dreadful crime of abolitionism . To the slaveholding aristocracyfor it must be remembered that in every Southern State the actual proprietors of slaves are only a small minority of even the white population , and are truly an aristocracy both by virtue of their wealth in a community where wealth is most unequally distributed and where there is no wealth without slaves , and by virtue of their intelligence in a community where there are n* common schools and no general diffusion of knowledge  --  to that aristocracy , we say , it has been allimportant that there be kept up , throughout the South , a public sentiment against abolition , strong enough and hot enough to murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free inquiry about the relations of slavery to the public welfare or to the rule of right . To the permanence of their ascendancy it has been all-important that the The State of Political Parties . // dreadful vision of the lynch court , the tar-barrel , the cruel lash , and the hasty gibbet , should glare upon the mind inseparably from the first thought or impulse of hostility to slavery . Thus the people them . selves* at the South , have been made the unthinking instruments of their own continued subjugation . By the instinctive craft of their lordly demagogu es , they have long been kept in so much fi*ar of each other , that they have not dared to ask , even in the secrecy of their own hearts , whether the slavery that surrounds them is to them an advantage or a curse . Such , most obviously , are some of the causes to which the institution of slavery at the South has owed its stability , its rapid growth , and its concentrated and overben ring force as an element in our national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be not essentially permanent , but essentially transient . Already , if we do not deceive ourselves , their influence begins to show some signs of having spent itself . The time , we trust , is not far distant , in which it will become manifest that the bar . barous and unnatural order of things in the Southern States is not to be permanent . But we will explain ourselves more distinctly . That sudden , rapid , steady expansion of the demand for cotton , which has had so powerful an effect in maintaining slavery , and in stimulating the diffusion and growth of slavery , can notcontinue to act much longer in the same direction in which it has acted for the last half century - certainly not with any thing like the same force . The suJ ) ply must ultimately overtake the demand ; and then , as the culture becomes less and less profitable to the planter , the effect which this sudden and steadily increasing demand has had , in supporting and extending slavery , must cease . The world can easily produce more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucrative as the production of cotton now is at the South , it is already less lucrative than it once was ; and the progress of competition , by constantly reducing the price of the product , is constantly . It is not unknown that many thinking men in the extreme South were averse to the annexation of Texas , fearing that the cotton soon to be produced from the rich alluvial lands along the rivers of that country , might come into disastrous competition with the produce of their own plantations . But there are other countries from which the manufactories of England and of all Europe are even now receiving no insignificant portion of their supplies . The demand for cotton has begun to act upon Egypt and upon India , not to speak of Brazil ; and who can tell how soon it may be acting upon other countries in Asia and Africa as well as America ? The system of railways which the British are constructing in their Indian empire , bringing all parts of those realms of oriental wealth and population into the most facile communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capabilities , and apply the most legitimate and powerful impulse to the industry of a country , the inhabitants of which were clothed in fabrics of indigenous cotton , as long ago as when England , not yet invaded by Caesar , was inhabited by savages who wore no clothing but the skins of beasts . Those railways in India will have more effect on American slavery than a century of meetings in Exeter Hall . Just in proportion as the progress of cotton cultivation for the markets of the civilized world , shall outrun the progress of cotton manufacture ; just in that proportion-no matter what new domains may be acquired by conquest , or by any other process of annexation , for the extension of slavery-no matter // what new markets for human cattle may be opened beyond the Rio Grande or upon the shore of the Pacific  --  the value of slave labor , and therefore of slaves , will be diminished , and that which has so long been the sustenance and growth of slavery will be taken away . But our expectation of an approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must soon be felt with great effect in the party politics of the Union , does not depend exclusively on the remote and , as some may think , uncertain prospect of a revolution in commerce counteracting the revolution that has so enriched and strengthened the slaveholders in our Southern States . The South already contains within itself the elements of revolution . The slaveholding aristocracy there can not always hold the masses of their fellow-citizens in that manageable subjection in which they have held them heretofore . Notwithstand ing all the disadvantages inseparable from the existence of slavery , the free white laboring people of the slaveholding States are making progress . They are becoming more intelligent and more industrious and thrifty . They are gradually learning to think for themselves and to understand their own interests . They can not be kept in ignorance of the difference between their own condition and that of the people in the free States ; nor will they long be unable to discover the causes of the difference . In Kentucky , in Maryland , and in the Western parts of Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact that slavery , however convenient it may be for the few who hold the slaves , and however lucrative it may be to those who have their wealth by the craft of trading in slnves-*is a grinding and degrading burthen upon the people at large , drying up the springs of prosperity , smiting the very soil with barrenness , robbing labor of its legitimate dignity , and creating a class of lordlings to domineer in the name of democracy . Delaware-though the bill for the abolition of slavery which passed through one branch of her legislature , so lately , has been defeated for the present by aristocratic influence in the other-is already in effect a free State , as is shown by her votes in both houses of Congress . The god Terminus having stood so obstinately for half a century on Mason and Dixon 's line , has begun to move southward : that line is no longer to be the boundary between the slave States and the free . And when once inquiry and discussion shall fairly break out among the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back thousands from daring even to think , shall have been broken ; then it will suddenly be found that the interest of slavery , instead of being the universal interest of all the South , is the interest of an aristocratic class , and has its great str2ngth only in certain localities . It will be found that the interests of the slaveholders and those of the people at large , instead of being coincident , are hostile to each other ; and that there is an equal contrariety between the interests of certain districts where the slaves are chiefly concentrated , and those of certain other districts where the white population is far more numerous , where wealth is more eqLtally distributed , and where there isa more general diffusion of knowledge . Then the institution of slavery will no longer be the one great interest of all the slave States , which is to unite them all and control them all , and to which every other interest is to be sacrificed ; and the interest of slavery will forever cease to be , what it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union . We do not expect that the change of which we are now speaking , will manifest itself immediately and suddenly . The ascendancy of the // West is a fact , but the revolution at the South which we hope for , is only a probability . Yet we ask are there no indications , in the events of the last three years , that such a revolution is approaching ? We do not refer merely to the votes and declarations by which it has been demonsi rated that Delaware is henceforth identified with the free States . We place no very confident reliance on the fact that the introduction of the " Wilmot proviso " was the spontaneous movement of the Northern wing of that great party which has heretofore been most subservient to Southern dictation ; - for it must be admitted that the final vote on that subject affords no refutation of the suspicion , entertained all along in many sagacious minds , that there was treachery and collusion in the movement from the outset , or that at the most the attempt was no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer rather to what may come from the indications of a difference among leading Southern statesmen , as to the policy to be pursued respecting slavery ,  --  one crying out that slavery is in danger , as the English tories not long ago were wont to rally all their strength by the cry " the Church is in danger , " - another with far-reaching vision up the Mississippi and with golden dreams of votes to come from hunters and squatters beyond the Missouri , sneering at the " abstractions** of his rival , and seeming quite disposed to let slavery take care of itself . In this connection , we can not but refer for a moment to the war with Mexico , though we reserve the full consideration of that subject to another opportunity . The war in which we have been involved partly by the desperate attempt of Southern statesmanship to prevent the possibility of freedom in Texas , and partly by the wild impulses of the West when Southern prudence was trying to complete what it had begun without the alarming risk which war must bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun with no foresight , and carried on with a prodigality of expenditure which increases every day-  --  the war which has already sent up from fields of slaughter in Mexico , and from thou . sands of crushed and groaning hearts at home , voices that can not but be heard in heaven against its guilty authors -- is not only an effect of the causes we have already adverted to as acting upon the direction an5I constitution of parties , but is itself a cause which before it can exhaust its force , will have swept away all parties as now organized . On this point we are tempted to indulge in extended discussion ; but we will content ourselves with the mere suggestion of topics which to our thoughts are full of argunient . Reserving then all investigation of the dispute as to how the war was brought about , and all inquiry as to how it may be brought to a termination , we only ask , what will become of parties-whigs , democrats , or tertiurn quids-at the close of the war , even if it be admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day ? With a public debt of not less than one hundred and fifty millions , what will become of questions and agitations about protective duties ? When such a debt is to be paid , interest and principal , all duties must , perforce , be laid with an exclusive reference to revenue ; and the taxes thus laid upon commerce by the votes of free trade men will afford ample protection to manufacturing capital and industry for years to come . What will become of questions about giving away the public lands , when the price of every acre that can be sold shall be needed for the extinction of the public debt ? What will become of existing questions about banks and sub-treasuries , and of existing questions , if there are any , about currency and exchanges , when the inextricable con. // fusion produced in the public finances by the wastefulness of war , shall compel the very statesmen who have contended so long for an independent treasury , to swallow their constitutional scruples , to forget their arguments , to take the lead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital of the country , and so , to charter-perhaps under some new name not yet invented-another national bank larger by half than that Lernean hydra , the killing of which was the greatest achievement of the democratic Hercules . A national bank is doubtless a great evil , but it is better than national bankruptcy ; and if democracy will go to war it must take its choice which of these two evils to endure . But this is not all . The war has already precipitated upon the country a Missouri question and more than a Missouri question , descending upon the field of politics like an avalanche of fire , and illuminating the remotest point of vision *vitli its portentous glare . What will become of all other questions upon which parties are now marshalled , when that one question shall be found standing in the way of every party and every politician , as a question not to be evaded ? What will become of all existing parties , when the Union shall be shaken with the inquky , not whether the Wilmot proviso shall be attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether a treaty for the acquisition of territory shall be ratified without that proviso appended but simply and directly whether the glorious old ordinance of 1787 shall be incorporated as fundamental law in acts for the organization of territorial governments between the upper Rio Grande and the Pacific . That question , be it remembered , will not be a question of the abolition of slavery , but , for the first time since our independence , a question of the deliberate abolition of freedom by the sovereign legislation of the Union . For it can not be forgotten that in all those regions there is now no slave ; the fundamental law there is the law of freedom . That question , moreover , will not be whether a soil and climate that repel the free and hardy laboring emigrant , and invite the toil of negroes for the cultivation of cotton and the cane , shall be given up to the planters of the South , but it will be , whether a country created for the abode of freemen , where the winds sweep pure over rugged mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flocks and the valleys for corn , shall have slavery imposed upon it , by our legislation , as the memorial of our conquest . The voices from the North and from the West that will thunder the answer to that question , will be the utterance of no " third pany. "
