In December , 1818 , he was ordained Deacon at Oxford . In 1819 he settled at Laleham , where he remained for the next nine years , taking seven or eight young men as private pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elected head master of the school at Rugby . In 1841 , he was offered the Regius professorship of Modern History at Oxford , which he accepted , without resigning his place at Rugby , and in June , 1842 , he died , on the day that completed his 47th year . A stranger to the name and character of Dr. Arnold , would be surprised to learn that this brief outline comprises the most important external events of the life of one of the greatest and best men of the present century , a man who exerted a most important influence in his life-time , and who , in his pupils and by his character and writings , is likely to be felt for good for a long time to come . The republication of his life and of some of his more important works by the Appletons , the titles of which we have given , has suggested to us the duty of presenting to our readers a brief sketch of his character , and of illustrating some of the leading principles which made him what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a right to do , that most of our readers have heard of his name , and are more or less acquainted with his history and his influence-we proceed without preface , to offer some of the thoughts which have suggested themselves , by a review of his life and writings . Dr. Arnold was marked and peculiar , as a scholar , a historian , a teacher , a theologian , a controversialist and a man ; and it is in these several relations that we propose to consider him , by brief remarks under each of these heads . As a scholar , he was peculiar for his thorough early training , and for that command of his own mental powers , for that graceful harmony in the movements of his mind , as well as for that variety and fullness of knowledge , which nothing but such a training can ever supply . At the age of twelve , he entered at the Winchester school , where he spent four years previous to his admission at Oxford in his sixteenth year . Here he received that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That it was not without fruit in his case , is proved by the fact that he won his scholarship at Corpus Christi against several respectable candidates . At Oxford , in his own college he was thrown into the small circle of its members , who , from their very limited number , and the very free and familiar intercourse in which they lived , seem to have exerted on each other a most decided and highly stimulating influence . His favorite authors at this time were Aristotle and Thucydides , and for both of these writers he maintained a strong and decided attachment during his whole life . After his election as Fellow of Oriel College , he was thrown into the society of some of the most promising men of the University , most of whom have since fulfilled the signs of their early promise . Copleston , Davison , Whately , Keble , Hawkins and Hampden , were all fellows with him , and the mental activity and generous nature of such men must have been most inspiring to the wakeful and earnest spirit of Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him the golden time of his life , for during this period lie gave himself to the most thorough reading , especially in the classics and history . His mind at this time was finally developed - not prematurely , but at its proper season-his principles were confirmed , his habits were fixed and hardened-and his whole cha.racter was // firmly knit together . To an American student , these twelve years of student-life like that of Arnold , might seem irksome and unprofitable . The dry poring over ancient languages , the useless questions about verbal niceties , the dry routine of severe examinations , and the constant and ceaseless call to some imposed duty-and all these accompanied by the heavy and unrelaxed pressure of the iron hand of scholastic discipline during much of this period , would appear formidable enough . Our scholars rarely are so far advanced that they read one of the classics , except as a task , and scarce ever , with that facility , which sees in them living languages , leaping from the tongue , and flowing from the pen , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constructing in these languages they are unfrequently habituated in early life ; - though they may be tolerable readers , they are rarely tolerable writers even of Latin , and often have no comprehension of what is meant by the thing . As a consequence , familiarity with the classics maintained in professional life is a thing most rare ; or if Virgil or Cicero are read occasionally , it is mainly as furnishing exercises for construing or parsing , and to revive some reminiscences of the school-boy drill . What is most discouraging of all , is the fact , that the proficiency of which we speak is not only not attained , but it is very generally despised . Especially is it rejected , if it must be purchased at the cost of so long and tedious an apprenticeship . Accordingly we leap , even the majority of our best minds , from school into college halffitted , arid when in college , from one author to another , in a drudging spirit-then from theme to essay , from essay to dispute , from one lecture to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we are ready to begin . Arnold 's " golden time " began at about the age and at the point of attainment where our students are graduated-and could we but clip the wings of our aspirants after professional activity or matrimonial felicity ; - could we secure to their minds made eager to receive , a two years course even like his four , of hard reading and thinking , we should do much for the scholarship of the next generation . Should it be asked by any onecui bono ? What would be gained by such a course of study ? or what did Arnold gain above what leading minds among us who have had no such training do not possess ? We answer , first of all , he gained knowledge-clear , accurate and full knowledge , arising from actual study . Especially had he that minute and extensive acquaintance with the history of the past , and that general accuracy in all his knowing , which is so rare among ourselves . With us , there is no lack of intellectual vigor , there is no deficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence equal to any undertaking . But often the material is wanting with which to work ; the scholar does not know enough , to begin with , or he does not know enough to make him modest , or to teach him good taste . The knowledge of which we speak is not professional knowledge , for that is gained at the professional school , and is constantly acquired by the wakeful and practical spirit of the man . Nor is it practical skill , for this comes from actual experience . Nor is it general information , for this comes from current literature , from conversation and from the thousand sources from which an intelligent student with American tact can not but learn . But it is that kind of knowledge , which if gained at all , must be gained in the quiet of youth . ful studies , and which must be always ready to be used as if it were a part of our very selves . How many men are they who for want of this training , are found , on account of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude speculations and exaggerated and onesided conclusions . How many , with great sagacity , and much logical acumen , have not facts enough at their command , to be able to do their work thoroughly and well . Next to knowledge , Dr. Arnold had that power over the ancient languages , which made them his delight . ful companions and his ready instructors through life . Had teaching not been his profession , he would never have laid aside his Aristotle and his Thucydides , but he would have conversed with them all his life long ; and through this course , his powers would have been held tense and vigorous , and his style kept direct and manly . But most important of all , as the results of his golden time to Arnold , was the discipline that he acquired  --  the personal training that he brought away with him from this period of retired and close application . The clear perception , the judgment rapid yet reliable , the power to re-present his own thoughts in an orderly and effective method , and the ease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich harvest gathered from that patient sowing . They were seen in every look-they were heard in every word-they appeared in every conversation-they may be read in every one of the rich and varied letters of his most valuable correspol ) dence-they could be traced in his basty sermons , and in those mature works which were the crown of his life-they are inwroughteverywhere lendingstrength and beauty . The reader of Arnold 's life is again and again impressed with the amount of labor which he performed , and with the ease and rapidity with which he dispatched it . It seemed to be a slight matter for him to take in hand a new language , or to enter into a long and complicated research . At the time he was the head master of Rugby , he had the general supervision and the entire responsibility involved in the care of from two to three hundred boys . He was their preacher on the Sabbath , and was occupied each day several hours in direct instruction ; and yet with all these labors he prepared his History of Rome-was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sha . king all England , and in which he at times stood alone , against the University of Oxford and most of the high ecclesiastics . During all this interval , he carried on an extensive and varied correspondence , and lived a most intense life of human interest and affection , in his daily recreations and the endearments of his family . The question that continually presents itself is not , how could he accomplish so great an amount of labor , but it is , how could he accomplish so much of such labor , and do it so well . The only satisfactory answer to this question is , that he studied in his " golden time , " and hence the ease , the accuracy , the perfection , and the power of all his movements . If all this be so , then it is time that the subject of a longer and more perfect preparation for active life , should secure the attention of the guardians and officers of American colleges . Let the students too pause and bethink themselves , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cou rseof study before they enter the professional school , let them count it the investment of so much capital , and the gathering of so much strength , which is certain to be needed , and which can not but be felt in the strifes of actual life . The theory implied in the name resident graduates , ' should at once be realized by an organized system of instruction , with specified studies and devoted instructors . The scholarship of Dr. Arnold , it should here be observed , was not of that professional and cloistered character , // which these remarks might convey to one not intimately acquainted with his principles . On the contrary , from the first , in his judgments of the uses of scholarship , and in the direction of his own studies as well as of those of others , he was sternly utilitarian . This tendency was so prominent in the early part of his residence at Oxford , as to make his character somewhat hard and narrow , and to prevent him from giving a minute attention to matters which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste was afterwards elevated and softened , and he relaxed somewhat from the rigor with which he rejected the Greek tragedians as of secondary value , and attached no very high importance to skill in Latin versification . Still the application of knowledge and the uses of scholarship , were to the end of his life commanding considerations . His own character was too earnest , and life was in his view , too serious a business , to be employed in literary luxury , or to be wasted in literary trifling . Hence in discussing the question whether the classics ought to be used or to be abandoned for more practical studies , he asserts that a mere scholar can not successfully teach the classics , and that the classics can not be profitably studied except as the knowledge and principles which they contain , are made to cast light upon present interests and to illustrate modern literature . His efforts in his school were rigidly and perseveringly devoted to the great end of connecting the scholar 's life with the human life of the pupil , and of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power on the taste , the principles , and the character of the future man . He was too well informed and too enlarged in his views to fall into the mistake of supposing that the object of the school or university , was to acquire what is commonly called useful knowledge . He de July , spised the stupid cant , which would substitue the natural sciences , and the knowledge of facts , for the training which enables and disposes the mind to acquire and to manage facts in actual life . At the same time , he would include in his idea of training , the directing of the mind to apply the past to the present , and to make the critical study of the ancient , the best illustration of modern writers . Hence the many reforms which he introduced at Rugby . Hence the enlargement of the course in Modern History , and the introduction of the study of the German and French languages , as being in their place before the entrance upon university life ; hence the wakeful criticism with which his pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all , the noble spirit which so many of his scholars caught from him , and which became a kind of genius loci in every spot where he dwelt  --  the spirit of study in order to be nobly useful , and the desire to attain the highest perfection and grace of scholarship , that so they might escape the doom of the slothful servant , and make a full proof of their high calling as Christian scholars . That to which Arnold sought to train all his pupils , he sought more earnestly to realize for himself . He aimed to be a Christian scholar . His ideal of what was implied in this phrase was nobly peculiar , and it is only as we enter into this ideal , that we understand his character . As we stand with him upon this point of view , we can perfectly comprehend and reconcile all his peculiarities . First then , he would be none the less a scholar , because he was a scholar under Christ . The spirit of precise and accurate knowledge , of exhausting research ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disposition to despise or disesteem no branch of investigation , because it does not directly bear upon a visible and prac // 369 tical result , but to recognize all the sciences as having a common relationship , were all possessed by Dr. Arnold . The liberal spirit which is insensibly acquired from a converse , through books , with a vast variety of opposing opinions and diverse characters  --  the candor which gives to each fact its proper weight , and to each argument its due consideration-the fair and liberal spirit , which is the natural result of the review of all that is passionate and hasty in past controversies  --  the just harmony and tasteful movements which evince the nicest sense of propriety in all things-in a word , the air and bearing which is appropriate to the finished scholar , were esteemed by him with a scholar 's taste and enthusiasm . Lie had no narrow view of the proper limits of human thought and investigation , but held with the rigor of a scholar 's orthodoxy , that prime article of the scholar 's creed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no niggard views of time , as though it were misspent , or wasted , because months and even years are devoted to studies , which even tolerably educated men might think of little consequence ; for he held that the worst sin of which a scholar is likely to be guilty , is that he studies too litIle , and not that he studies too much . Scholarship was in his view one of the highest callings to which a man could be summoned , and to fulfill its duties with a sluggish spirit , or to be untrue to its peculiar services , through a desire to meddle with things productive of more direct results , which other men could do just as well a he , was to sin by putting duties that to him are primary in place of those which to him are secondary . The commonwealth of scholars was in his view a rank of men by themselves-essential , absolutely and in the highest sense essential , to the well-being of the state , and almost to its existence in any condition above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to the church , as the preserver of its sacred records , and of the lan*guages and skill by which these records can be truly and fully interpreted . To this commonwealth he would render the highest honor , as exerting an elevating and refining influence by its very existence , and as increasing in dignity and in power to be useful , just in proportion as its own members are exclusively and most ardently devoted to their appropriate duties . In a word he had all the principles , and the enthusiasm of the true scholar , who had enjoyed a finished training , an extensive acquaintance with the noblest spirits of his times , and to this had added what can be learned from the treasures of continental Europe and from foreign travel . But though he was thus entirely a scholar , he was a scholar under Christ . By this is not intended merely that he was an exemplary Christian as well as a devoted student . We do not imply simply nor mainly that in his personal character , in his family , his intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit and temper of his master were always visible and always controlling . That he was all this is true , and that he must have been all this to be more , is also true . But he was something more . Christ was with him in his studies , as being the light by which his studies were directed . It was not merely Christ , as the bright and pure example after which his own life was to be patterned ,  --  nor Christ the Redeemer , through whose cross his sins were to be pardoned ; but Christ the lawful King , whose dominion over the earth is now dispu* ted , but is hereafter to be establish* ed . It was Christ who meanwhile is conducting a bloodless but real warfare against the powers of evil , in which false principles , wicked feelings , and all the stupendous organization of evil in the shape of old or recent abuses , of debasing // customs , of corrupt institutions , of perverted wealth and power , are finally to be destroyed . Of the many agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , literature in all its departments is one of the most powerful . It forms the principles of the leading men of each generation . It hands down facts of history with honest tradition , or it distorts them by biased prejudices . It proceeds upon a sound philosophy , a just and practical ethics , and a true religion ,  --  or it implies and insinuates fatal and deadly error . It conducts the mind by fair inference on the right road to truth and to God , or with specious sophistry it leads him in the by-way to error and ruin . It clothes truth with the power and glory with which eloquence and poetry can invest her as with weapons from the armory of heaven , or it lends to error a bewitching and dangerous charm , to seduce and ensnare and destroy . It is often in the service of the enemy of all good , and then its power for evil can neither be measured nor computed . It may be made instinct with the spirit and principles of Christ , and accomplish noble results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of illustration in learning or of power in human scholarship is to he subjected . Science is to read over again the thoughts of him by whom all things were made , and through whom all things consist . History is to illustrate the past procedures of his providence . Literature , in philosophy , in eloquence and in song , is to be based on Christian principles , and to utter in words of charmed power Christian and only Christian feelings . Arnold did what lay in his power and his influence , to hasten this result . Hence he was not merely the great scholar , who was also a Christian ; but he was the Christian scholar , who as a scholar was swayed and elevated by the spirit of Christ . Hence was he shocked and grieved that a book of such learning and brilliancy as Gibbon 's Rome , should be so antiChristian in all those inferences which it made or insinuated , as well as in the tone and temper of its writer ; and felt the most earnest desire to conduct his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fall , " that he might meet and counteract this influence . His heartfelt and bitter complaint of much of the literature of his own day and of the past , was that it was either atheistic or anti-Christian . In all his own writings we see the constant effort to realize the opposite influence , and without either intrusion or bad taste , to make all study , all criticism and all literature , to be felt on the side of him , after whom the Christian scholar is named . We know that there are very few men who could realize this aim as Arnold did , and few who could attempt to realize it without making sad blunders . The majority of men who should undertake it , with all supposable honesty , would be certain to end in some incongruous mixture that would rather hinder than help the cause which they would serve . They might err in " loving Christianity better than the Truth , " and so through their desire to secure to Christ the highest possible honor , would be biased and narrow-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deem it their duty to " speak deceitfully for God . " Or they might narrow the sphere of human knowledge , and cramp the energies of the scholar , lest precious time should be wasted  --  and so be seen to have no adequate idea of the wideness of the field and extent of the labor required , and thus be despised as unworthy to stand in the highest seats of science . Or they might profess to some private and peculiar inspiration , to some special mission to which they were summoned by // the immediate call of God  --  and so perhaps cause their own sanity to be questioned . Or they might claim a special sanction to certain particular doctrinal opinions , and narrow down the will of Christ to their own form of words  --  and so he hard and unreasonable dogmatists . Or they might rest on certain prophetical interpretations as " the testimony of Jesus , " and prove themselves to be unreasonably swayed by fond fancies-and thus cut themselves off from the sympathies of the soberminded . In these ways , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overbear and to swallow up the scholar , and the zealous friend is in fact the worst foe to the cause which he seeks to serve . Better far than such ambitious and boastful attempts , with conclusions so impotent and ridiculous , were it to leave the cause of Christ to the care of its Master . lATould that all who would fain be Christian scholars , would remember that to be Christian scholars , they must first be scholars 1 Of Arnold as a historian we shall say but little . His own ideal of what history ought to be , and of the method in which it should be studied , is given in his own most instructive lectures on Modern History , which were pronounced as his first and only course of lectures after his election to the Professorship at Oxford . His realization of these principles is to be found in his History of Rome , which was broken off at near the close of the second Punic War , by the author 's untimely death ; besides a history of the later Roman Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the Encyclopredia Metropolitana . The History of Rome is undoubtedly the best history in the language , and can be read by no scholar and no man with any other than he highest interest . To its composition the author brought the very highest qualifications . There was first that very thorough reading of the classical writers , which makes the ancient world so familiar to the thorough English scholar in its events , dates and geography . There was superadded the discipline acquired in the repeated and accurate study of Thucydides , as prosecuted in the preparation of his valuable edition of the Greek historian . In the year 1825 , he became acquainted with Niebuhr 's Roman history , to read which work he mastered the German language . This opened to him the stores of the continental critics , and introduced him to a new world in the riches of their boundless erudition and the critical spirit with which they examine every question of fact and seek to separate the authentic from the legendary . The introduction to Niebuhr and the German historical writers formed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse that he thea received , that he was led to form the project of his own Roman 1-ustory . With characteristic zeal and boldness , as well as from his eager desire for truth where it could be found , he plunged into the sea of his . tone skepticism , and fought himself through with a teachable and truthloving , yet sagacious spirit . To introduce Niebuhr 's principles and method in a work written for the English mind , and to give a Christian direction tcr a history which is so intimately connected with the annals of the church , and which had been so sadly dishonored by Gibbon , were the two motives which decided him to write upon Rome rather than upon Athens . Besides these advantages which we have named , he possessed others that were quite peculiar . He was from his childhood remarkable for his fresh and tenacious memory of the past . Natural scenery too was distinctly impressed upon his mind . Hence all that power which is so necessary to the historian , of strongly conceiving of stirring scenes , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , was natural and entirely at his command . Besides he had visited in person , and more than once , Rome and its environs . He had crossed the Alps in the path of Hannibal , and had the rare facility of turning a good map of a country which he had never seen into a picture of its surface , and of making its mountains and valleys , its slopes and defiles , to be present to his imagination . He was also given to political speculation . He seemed to have been horn to be a statesman . It was his natural bent to study the rise and decay of nations , and the elements of prosperity and ruin in human society . Besides his principles were sound . His philosophy was natural and honest and Christian . He was a believer in God , and in God 's present agency . He saw God in history , and felt that righteousness exalts a nation , and that sin is not merely a reproach to a people , but that it introduces rottenness and decay into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of man , such as that with which Bancroft perpetually infects the course of his narration ; but with an intenser hatred of despotism and aristocracy than Bancroft was ever capable of feeling , there is if possible a still more intense dislike of that atheistic demagogueism of which Bancroft 's own history is a most notable specimen . But most of all , Arnold 's history of Rome is valuable from the fact , that the ancient is made to be a living and real world . It is not separated from the world in which we are now living by a broad and deep gulf , but it is perpetually brought into our world by constant references and illustration . Its great men are not viewed afar off , as vaguely exaggerated beings of a nature somewhat between that of gods and men , or rather that of the statues of gods and the flesh and blood of men ; but they are brought near * us , and are seen to be men in their weaknesses as well as in their strength , while the scenes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . The deified statues of Plutarch are made to descend from their pedestalstheir size is diminished-their muscles are relaxed-their limbs move , and their tongues speak to us in accents that betoken a human heart . The fresh and living interest which is now given to the history of the ancient world , chiefly by the spirit of modern criticism , was fitted to warm and excite a man of strong and earnest sympathies like Arnold ; and his history , as a history for English readers , will not be surpassed till another shall arise who shall combine in rarer perfection , the best features of the English and German historians . It was as a teacher , however , that Arnold was strikingly great . Teaching was the business of his life , and in instruction , his greatness was most conspicuous . His spirit was instinct with generous sympathy , and especially that sympathy which delights in contact with the freshness and ardor of youth . Lie made himself one with every truly aspiring mind that he met , and though each year presented its new generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and generous interest in their welfare . Then too he was an earnest man , a man standing manfully up against the shocks and struggles of life and doing vigorously the work appointed him by God* as if he were all the while conscious that the eye of his " great task-master " were fixed upon him alone . His earnestness too was not scattered and diverted by other interests away from his first and appropriate duties , but though it spread itself widely , and fastened itself with uncommon energy upon a multitude of objects , its fire was concentrated most directly and intensely upon his school . In this personal earnestness , there was a overmastering // 373 power on his pupils , oftentimes a terrible arid resistless force that swept all before itself . The very fact too , that he was so wakefully interested in the great controversies in politics and religion that were then going on , gave to his character a higher influence , as it showed him to his pupils as a man who was more than a mere book-worm and drill-master . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by imagination and hope , its own future lot in life , and sees itself beforehand , engaged in its eagerstrifes , and fulfilling some active and splendid part . When Arnold 's boys saw him thus eagerly alive to this real world into which they were soon to be ushered , and attaching to all its realities so high an importance , they gave more respectful heed to his counsels ; when he showed them how their daily studies , were all deciding their power to be great and useful in the future-they gave themselves to those studies with renewed diligence and zeal . He was a man too of ardent feelings and of imaginative temperament . This fitted him to kindle and excite his pupils , to lead them to appreciate high principles , noble thoughts and truly great men , whether recounted in history , imagined in literature , or illustrated in real life , and thus to give that ideal grace to character , and that noble enthusiasm in literary taste , which in the young scholar are beauty and strength combined . No great man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man under Arnold 's care , with a more glowing enthusiasm than it was by Arnold himself . tie would be the first to see and to appreciate , the high poetic merit of a thrilling passage in ancient or modern poetry , and to communicate his own feelings to others . And yet he was rigorous and unbending in his discipline , it was seen and felt that law must be obeyed and justice must have her rights . Ariaold 's administration was not a fiery resentment at a personal affront , or a gruff assertion of official dignity , but a single yet iron-hearted faithfulness to the trust committed to his care . It was in him justice and principle personified . With all this rigor , there was a disposition to confide in the truth and honor of young men , and a strong tendency to appeal to their better and more generous nature . If this confidence was disappointed and these appeals were slighted or abused , he would still trust on , for he knew that those who took advantage of his confidence , only illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their influence the more , while with the more noble spirit , however infected by that poisoned public opinion which always haunts a great institution , this confidence would sooner or later be appreciated . Arnold had also the spirit of patience and hope . He did not expect the stability and con. sistency of manhood in the way . wardness and caprice of youth , nor did he look for his perfect ideal of a Christian scholar in the unfinished characters of minds yet half matured , but he was patient in still applying the same plastic influences , and hoped on , even if he saw but the signs and seeds of future good . But that which bound all these various separate qualities together into one harmonious whole , was the simplicity of the man . Here was the charm , the power , the inspiration of Arnold , that what he appeared to be , was seen to be himself , that his excellencies were none of them so much the direct products of culture , as the natural growth of the soil . They were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they could not be put off , nor appear in any other than their natural proportions and grace . The eye of the student , always keen , would naturally search for a " joint in the harness " into which he might send a shaft of // his own sharp-sighted criticism , but he would search almost in vain . Or if he could find foibles and weaknesses , as he could without doubt , they all through Arnold 's downrightness of character , had a hue and aspect of virtue . As a teacher , Arnold was a friend to improvements ; nay , he was in spirit and in fact not a little of a reformer-It was predicted of him by Dr. Hawkins , his Co-fellow at Oriel , that if he were elected the headmaster of Rugby , " he would change the face of education all through the public schools of England . " At this time , a strong feeling of dissatisfaction was expressed by the various sections of the liberal party , in respect to the state of education in the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being narrow , scholastic and useless , and a strong disposition was manifested to abandon the classics , and to substitute other more useful studies in their place . With the real causes of complaint in the case , Arnold sympathized , and he was of all the teachers then living , the man to yield what was rightfully complained of , and to retain what was unreasonably or ignorantly attacked . A friend to real improvements , and sympathizing with the party of progress , and oftentimes earnestly and almost passionately arrayed against those who seemed to him the bigoted worshipers of the shade of the past , he was yet a true scholar , and having a scholar 's enthusiasm , he could speak with a scholar 's authority , to those who could , and to those who could not appreciate the force of his reasonings . He maintained on the one hand , that the most appropriate discipline for the mind of youth is the study of language , and that no languages are so perfectly adapted to all the purposes of discipline , as the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be proposed for them , which will so perfectly lead the mind through those countless processes of discriminating analysis , of reflection on forms of speech and shades of meaning ; while a graceful and simple habit of intellect and character are seen to come of their study The longer he lived , the more intelligent and earnest was his conviction , " that it was not knowledge , but the means of gaining knowledge , which he had to teach . " At the same time , he contended that every lesson in the classics ought also to be a lesson in English , and that all improvements in the modes of preparing and reciting the lessons which could be devised to secure this result , should be tried , and if successful , should be adopted . Besides all this , he asserted the positive value of the ancient writers , for their contents ; and illustrated this by the free and copious use which he made of their stores and the ready mastery with which these treasures were turned to a positive and popular use . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools to the historical , political and philosophical value of philology , and of the ancient writers , as distinguished from the mere verbal criticism and elegant scholarship of the last century . " # While therefore , Arnold did not relax from the severity of the old discipline , he furnished new and more grateful stimuli to excite to higher attainments . While the rigor of* the old requirements was maintained , it was enlivened by an intermixture of new elements . The literature of the past , was illustrated by that of the present ; while that of the present received light from the past . Miscellaneous reading was directed and encouraged ; the modern languages were introduced , and history was made an exciting study , and also furnished the vehicle for grave counsels and wise instruction . To his influence more than to that of any man , was it owing , that the // clamor against the classics , so violent in England , was abated , and at the same time real reforms were secured . It was as a Christian teacher , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The theory of every public school in England contemplates a Christian education . For this end there is arranged a system of religious observances , sufficiently particular and frequent , and a course of studies in the Scriptures , the catechism and the history of the church . If this theory was ever realized in any good measure , it certainly was not at the time when Arnold began at Rugby . At that time , however , " the absence of systematic attempts to give a more directly Christian character to what constituted the education of the whole English gentry , was becoming more and more a scandal in the eyes of religious men " The testimony of Dr. Moberly , once a scholar and now headmaster of Winchester , who had the amplest opportunities to receive correct information in respect to the state of things , as Arnold found it , and the very great change which was wrought by his influence , is as follows . " Possibly , other schools may have been less deep in these delinquencies than XVinchester ; I believe that in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to the University , that I was under disadvantages as compared with those who came from other places ; on the contrary , the tone of young men at the University , whether they came from Winchester , Eton , Rugby , Harrow , or Wherever else , was universally irreligious . A religious undergraduate was very rare , very much laughed at when he appeared ; and I think I may confidently say , hardly to be found among publicschool men ; or , if this be too strongly said , hardly to be found , except in cases where private and domestic training , or good dispositions , had prevailed over the school habits and tendencies . A most singular and striking change has come upon our public schools  --  a change too great for any person to appreciate adequately , who has not known them in both these times . This change is undoubtedly part of a general improvement of our generation in respect of piety and reverence , but I am sure that to Dr. Arnold 's personal earnest simplicity of purpose , strength of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever came near him could mistake or question , the carrying of this improvement into our schools is mainly attributable . It soon began to be matter of observation to us in the University , that his pupils brought quite a different character with them to Oxford than that which we knew elsewhere . I do not speak of opinions ; but his pupils were thoughtful , manly-minded , conscious of duty and obligation when they first came to college ; we regretted , indeed , that they were often deeply imbued with principles which we disapproved , but as cordially acknowledged the immense improvement in their characters in respect of their morality and personal piety , which ( for how many years I know not ) had been absolutely unknown to our public schools. *** How it was that this striking change was accomplished , it is well worth while to inquire . It arose first of all from the fact , that he was filled with the spirit of his office , and felt deeply the responsibility of this office . The relation which he held to his pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hallowed and sanctified by religion , and could not fail to be the vehicle of Christian feeling and of Christian influence . A school could be nothing less in his judgment than a Christian institution . " The business of a schoolmaster , " he used to say , " no less than that // of a parish minister , is the cure of souls . " And yet there was no intrusion of the religious upon unseasonable occasions ; there was no forced attempt to galvanize it into spasmodic life . Nor was there any affected prominence given to religious machinery , nor a studied air of religious sanctimony , nor a formal use of religious phraseology , such as is sure to be offensive to the right-minded , and often ends in the most disastrous consequences . There was no suspension of intellectual activity . Study was the great business of the place , and to study the pupils were urged by every excitement , as well as won by every lawful pleasure . It was no place in which to be idle , or negligent , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No pretext would be more certain to bring out the cutting and sharp reproof of the master , than such an excuse as this . It was not paraded in the newspaper , as a school where special religious privileges might he enjoyed , or one on which the especial blessing of Christ might be expected to rest . And yet the atmosphere of the place was soberly and earnestly Christian . Rugby was a Christian school , because in it , study was sternly held to be the first Christian duty of the pupil , as the best way of serving his Master in heaven , and of exhibiting the strength and fidelity of his principles . Intellectual activity , in the opinion of Arnold , was in the highest degree favorable to spiritual growth , and should furnish to the scholar his appropriate spiritual aliment . And yet intellectual activity and attainment were esteemed by him as of little worth , except as they were turned to this account , and were actually seen in forming the Christian character . On the other hand , moral and religious principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could accomplish , connected with a feebler capacity , or inferiGr advantages , were always honored as of the highDr . Thomas Arnold . July , est and sufficient worth . The principle of emulation was never lost sight of . Prizes and emoluments were devised and used ; for if in this great school of life they are constantly and sternly administered by the Great Teacher , why should they not also be copied in the humbler schools that man administers ? If in the discipline of life , they are needed and are salutary , why not in the discipline of the school ? Arnold had manlier views than to make all college honors to be equal , in order to satisfy the claims , or to still the complaints of aspirants of unequal merit ; but while he would distribute such rewards with even-handed justice , he would make success a discipline to Christian humility , and failure a discipline to Christian meekness . Rugby was a Christian school , because the master-spirit in it was an earnest Christian man . He stood out before his pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an essential requisite of his influence over students . Then he had those strong personal characteristics which were fitted to command respect , to excite ardor and to awaken sympathy . Then he was seen and felt to be personally and strongly controlled by religious principle , and warmed with Christian feeling , not merely to be a man who could make fine speeches about virtue and piety , but one who hated sin with as intense and concentrated a hatred as is possible for a good man to do , and whose spirit was warmed with affectionate and unfeigned reverence for Christ . Then he had the power to invest all study with a Christian interest , and to m*ike all literature illustrate Christian truth , and set forth in brighter relief , the moral glory of Christian principles , as contrasted with the highest perfection which could grow from those which are merely worldly . Besides this strong personal influence , which of itself gave a character to the place , there were two // methods of more direct religious address , of which Arnold availed himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English schools , provided for and presupposed direct instruction in the principles of the Christian faith . To all the forms from the lowest to the highest , exercises were allotted from the catechism and the Scriptures . To these Arnold attached a new importance and invested them with a new interest , and in the sixth or highest form , to which he gave personal attention , the lessons from the Greek Testament were no common-place or sermonizing exercise . It was taken for granted that the epistles and the gospels must of course be interesting to young men calling themselves Christians . As expounded by Arnold , they were certainly made to be interesting , for he criticised Paul or John as he would a human author , never forgetting the homage which he owed them , as the inspired revealers of the will of Christ . But in them he saw and heard , and he made his pupils see and hear , men of superior minds , expounding to their fellow men the faith which they held , giving the reason for that faith and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application to the personal , the social , and the civil relations of man . Why these writings should not thus be studied and expounded , in a spirit of searching yet reverent criticism in every institution in this land that calls itself Christian , is a question that is more naturally asked , than it can be satisfactorily answered . Why there should be reluctance on the part of teachers or their pupils , to study these sources of the Christian faith , looking at the study of them in no higher light than that of studying the prevailing religion of one 's country , may well excite our wonder . That there are practical difficulties in the way of success that are peculiar and embarrassing , we are well aware ; but these should not hinder us from proposing the ideal as a subject for grave and attentive cortsideration . We are quite certais that Arnold did much in this way to bind and hold his pupils to a respectful reverence for Christianity , as a subject worthy of every scholar 's study , as well as to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties . The other method of address of which Arnold availed himself , was still more effective . This was preaching in the chapel . Before 1831 , he had preached occasionally , but when the chaplaincy became vacant at this time , he solicited and secured the office for himself , and from that time he discharged its duties . The sermons , which he preached in the chapel , as they are read , are striking and effective . His audience was more youthful than is seen in the chapel of an American college , and the discourses were adapted to a youthful congregation . They were short , plain and direct . As elaborate intellectual composition , they have no great merit for weight or originality of matter , nor for finish or power of language , and yet they have this peculiar and striking characteristic , that they spoke to the thoughts and feelings of the auditors . They were written for young students , by one who lived and breathed in the atmosphere of students ; who knew their prejudices , and follies , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate Christian faithfulness , uncovered to them their own hearts , in the light of Christian truth and in the sacred presence of the house of God . He tells them of their dangers-not merely the external dangers to which they were exposed in temptations to sensuality and idleness ; but their inward exposures , to the pride which comes from an exclusive exercise of the intellect , and from a scholar 's separation from the sympathies and restraints of the fireside and of society at large . Not a word does he utter // which was not a blow at some real and prevalent evil , or the holding up of the appropriate remedy , or the sincere and fervent expression of a heart full of right principles , and overflowing with Christian feeling . He spoke with authority , for he spoke from his own experience , knowing in himself the trials to which the believing student is exposed , and speaking from his own experience of the fullness and satisfaction of the remedy . And he spoke with power . The pulpit was his moral throne , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which he appealed to the consciences and hearts of his charge . These short discourses of his were not soon forgotten . They invested his person with sacred authority , and they add . ed immensely to his power . Arnold , we own , had peculiar facilities in himself and in his place as the head master of an English public school , which gave to his sermons a peculiar power ; but the efficient manner in which he used the pulpit and made it an auxiliary so potent , is worthy of serious consideration . We can not take leave of Arnold at Rugby , without expressing the wish , that the important place which is occupied in England by the " Public Schools , " should in this country be filled by establishments which should perform the same office . It deserves to be tittered all over the land , and in the ear of every scholar in this country , that if the standard of classical education is to be permanently raised among ourselves , the beginning must be made before entrance into college . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation . To secure this preparation , schools must be established upon a more permanent basis , a more enlarged and fixed organization must be *ecured , the dignity of the teacher 's office in these schools must be elevated , and the scheme of classical education should be extended and elevated . We can not imagine a more important service that a citizen of Connecticut can perform , than to found a school , which should be what the best English schools were designed to be ; to provide for it amply , and to give it the high character which we contemplate . If no other result than the giving a new importance and a new character to these schools , were accomplished , by the publication of Dr. Arnold 's life , it would be ample and sufficient . We had proposed to write of Arnold as a theologian . In one sense of the word , however , he was very little of a theologian . He was not distinguished greatly in metaphysical or philosophical discussion , for to these subjects he gave but little attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an interpreter of the Scriptures , however , he exhibited singular and surpassing merits . For this his instinctive historic sense and his peculiar historic sagacity , furnished him peculiar qualifications , and it was as an historical interpreter of the Scriptures that he was most distinguished . In the judgment of many of his friends , this was the sphere for which he was most highly fitted to shine with eminent usefulness and reputation . This historic gift enabled him to transfer himself to the times when the several parts of the Scriptures were composed  --  to put himself in the place of both writer and reader , and freshly and distinctly to comprehend the first , that is , the true import of the words as they were originally spoken and heard . This gave him the power to appreciate the personal characteristics of the several writers , and to understand the point of view from which each one spoke , as well as the chosen trains of thought and modes of expression adopted by each . It gave him also a kind of personal and friendly interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate attachment . How readily // these characteristics would fit him to appreciate the methods and to esteem the commentaries of the best German schools , will be obvious to all who understand the subject . And yet he could not endure certain *of the German commentators , as for instance Kuinoel , who in this country is extensively consulted by orthodox divines ; on account of the incongruity so repulsive to his truth-loving spirit , between his theories and his facts , and the want of a consistent reverence for the book which he criticised . Strauss too he dispatches with a stroke of historic criticism . " It seems to me , " says he , " to show the ill effects of that division of labor which prevails so much among the learned men of Germany . Strauss writes about history and myths , without appearing to have studied the question ; but having heard that some pretended histories are mythical , he borrows this notion as an engine to help him out of Christianity . But the idea of men writing mythic histories between the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for realities ! " And yet Arnold was called a rationalist in England , by those Oxford divines who seem to use the word without knowing what it means , except that it is a good word to use ad invidiam . Some of his opinions on scriptural interpretation gave much offense and excited alarm . We have not seen the " Essay " and some of the sermons in which he formally propounds his principles . It is possible that they were incautiously expressed and not sufficiently qualified , though altogether more probable that they were not understood , for the lack of capacity on the part of his critics to enter into the difficulties of the subject . He held strongly the principle that the design of the Scriptures was not to teach scientific truth , even in regard to spiritual essences , but to present these realities in their practical rela tions . He had no very sharply cut theory of inspiration , as few men have . Perhaps he held that there is no evidence that either the Apostles themselves or their readers maintained such a theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him the word of God , in the highest sense , and that he opened its pages with the most reverential and teachable spirit . He saw in it one consistent scheme of truth , and one system of moral duty , differing never in its principles , but only in its application to changing circumstances , and , in its capacity thus to change , showing its divine original . Those strange and stale , and , as it seems to us , superficial objections to the spirit of the Jewish system , and to parts of the Old Testament , which are admitted without question and assumed without debate by our Boston friends , were easily disposed of by him . They were to him no objections , and presented no real difficulties . On the other hand , the very distinctness of his historic conceptions of Jesus and Paul , as living and speaking in that actual and real world which as an historian he was accustomed so vividly to realize , gave to his faith in God as revealed to man , a strength and assurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence we would almost say , we would rather have Arnold 's doubts , than the faith of many a man who would denounce him as latitudinarian , so freely and with such entireness of belief did he take to his soul the great fact , that Jesus is come in the flesh . We would also add , that the honesty of Arnold as a man , and his reputation as a true and honest critic in historical matters , secured for his faith as a Christian , the highest respect among men of letters and science . They knew that it could not be education , nor bigotry , nor weakness , nor servile fear , which led such a man to such conclusions . Of Arnold 's liberality and chari. // tableness , we can give no just description within our prescribed limits . He had , been himself a painful inquirer , and hence he sympathized personally with Thomas the Apostle . He knew how honest his own inquiries had been , and hence he was disposed to put the most favorable construction on the difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pertain to many questions , and though his own mind was satisfied , he could yet understand the doubts of others . He would despair of no man , who had not abandoned his faith in goodness and truth , which abandonment seemed to him little short of ' real madness , and to which , we should add , real insanity were to be preferred as a boon from heaven . And yet for the truth as he received it-for the great essentials of the Christian faith , he contended with an earnestness which to some men seemed bitter and ' passionate , because the truth was to him his food and his life . Arnold was a controversial writer of great ability and influence . It was as such a writer , that he was most generally known in his lifetime , and as such he was brought into conflict with large and influential parties in England . He was a man of war from his youth , and it seemed impossible from his temperament , that he should be otherwise . His earnestness led him to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of his very self . He could not live without asserting them , and endeavoring to spread them abroad . When they were attacked , he defended them as a man will fight for his life . His peculiar position as a scholar , as a teacher , as a theologian , and even as a writer of history , brought him into antagonism with hostile influences , and made his life a warfare . But it was not in these relations that his zeal and his ability as a controversialist were most signally , displayed . He was a reformer in church and state , and to reform he consecrated his most earnest zeal . No citizen of Sparta or Athens could identify himself more completely with the state , or take its interests to heart more entirely than did Arnold . " Upon his front engraven , Deliberation sat and public care . " His ideal of the church and state , or rather of a Christian state , was peculiar , and it is only as we vividly realize this , that we can see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so diverse from each other ; and how while all these parties were opposed to each other , they all failed to satisfy him . The state in Arnold 's view , was essential to man 's perfection , and almost to his being . It was founded in a necessity of his nature . As such it should concern itself with more than his material interests . It should care with the most earnest intensity for his higher interests , for those which relate to his intellectual , his moral and his religious wants . For each of these wants it is bound to care , just in proportion to the relative importance of each . Of course for the religious in man it is bound to provide with the most careful regard and the most intense solicitude . That view of the state which makes it recognize only his animal wants and his earthly relations , he rejected as sensual and atheistic . He would therefore well nigh absorb the church into the state-would make the various orders , ecclesiastical as well as civil , coöperate in each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would keep these orders in a state of improvement , open to all real progress , and availing themselves of all the means of true advancement . Of course Arnold was a friend of reform . He deemed it treason against the ordinances of providence , and the perpetual revelations of God 's administration , to suppose that there is noth // ing new to , be learned , and that that which is learned should not be applied to actual use . That stupid and willful adherence to the past , because it was the way of other generations , which makes so large a part of the character of John Bull , excited his contempt and ridicule , if not his wrath . He sympathized with the party of progress , and was called aliberal and a whig . He believed also that vast results of good might be accomplished by social reform , and were dependent upon it . No Associationist nor Fourierite of our own time had a more honest and deeply rooted conviction of the appalling evils and the gigantic inequalities which grow out of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results which might be hoped for , when the organized forces of society should all be used for a Christian end and with a Christian spirit for the good of each class and each individual . And yet he was distinguished from all these classes by differences which placed them as far as the poles asunder . The prime cause of these disorders , in his view , lay in the moral degeneracy of the individual man . It was this that laid the foundation for the tyranny and oppression of social inequalities , as it gave man the power and the disposition to do wrong to his fellow on a gigantic scale , and thus to garrison this wrong in the strongholds of knowledge and wealth and power-then to hand over these fortresses to privileged classes -- then to transmit them doubly guarded from one generation to another by hereditary succession and traditional privileges . Of course Arnold believed that the reform was to begin and go forward in the character of man . He believed a radical change in the character of man by Christian influences , was to be directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every social change . The present organization into families and separate interests and even privileged orders , was in his view well enough  --  or at least the present organization with such modifications as the legitimate applications of its appliances in an honest spirit would of itself secure . No change of organization without Christ , could be anything but the enginery of the devil ; while if the spirit of Christ were in the present system , its results would be an earthly heaven . This would be not merely because each individual would be Christ-like , but because all the power there is in man organized , would be used for a Christian purpose . That a man holding such views should be appalled and oppressed by the crushing abuses and the wicked neglect of the first duties of society , which he saw and felt every where in Christian England , is not surprising . That he should have lifted his voice against the moss-grown and hoary walls of these fortressed abuses , was natural and to be expected . He did lift that voice , and oftentimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testify against them , as with the blast of a war-trumpet . That this voice should have waked a thou . sand echoes of wrath in return , from each several interest assailed , and from every party which he attacked , was also to be expected . One of the earliest of his controversial pamphlets , was that on the Roman Catholic claims , written in 1829-concessions to which he urged on Christian grounds . In this pamphlet he excited against himself the displeasure of the Liberal Party for making it a religious question , and called out from the High Churchmen the accustomed sanctimonious " raving about idolatry . " The next year , the French revolution of July occurred , in which he felt the liveliest interest and the most enthusiastic sympathy . It seemed to him " a most blessed revolution , spotless beyond all example in history , and the most glorious instance of a royal rebellion against society promptly // and energetically repressed , that the world has yet seen . * * * It lays the crimes of the last revolution just in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people by its long iniquities , that they were like slaves broken loose when they first bestirred themselves . " Immediately after , he was distressed and almost overwhelmed at the fearful agitations and disturbances in England which preceded the passage of the Reform bill , and says of himself , " the paramount interest of public affairs outweighs with me even the school itself ; and I think not unreasonably , for school and all would go to the dogs , if the convulsion which I dread really comes to pass . I must write a pamphlet in the holidays , or I shall burst . No one seems to me to understand our dangers , or at least to speak them out manfully . One good man , who sent a letter to the Times the other day , recommends that the clergy should preach subordination and obedience . I seriously say , God forbid they should ; for if any earthly thing could ruin Christianity in England , it would be this . " " The truth is , that we are living amongst a population whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could treat slaves , whom we allow to be slaves in ignorance , without having them chained and watched to prevent them from hurting us . " The visitation of the cholera , with the other dark signs of the times , made him think a fearful crisis was at hand , a general breaking up of European society and a succession of terrible visitations from God . He was interested in the Reform bill , not so much because he attached great importance to its particular provisions , as because it betokened some sense of the real condition of things in England , and a disposition to regard it . Of that feudal spirit which is every where present in the higher classes of English society , and so concentrated in English Toryism , he expresses himself in this wise : " I confess that if I were calLed upon to name what spirit of evil predominantly deserved the name of Antichrist , I should name the spirit of chivalry  --  the more detestable for the very guise of ' archangel ruined , ' which has made it so seductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hateful , because it is in direct opposition to the impartial justice of the Gospel and its comprehensive feeling of equal brotherhood , and because it so fostered a sense of honor rather than a sense of duty . " Of the Birmingham Railway he said- " I rejoice to see it , and think that feudality is gone forever . " It might be easily inferred that he would , as he actually did , identify himself with every plan that had for its object the diffusion of knowledge or the elevation of the middling and lower classes . He had great hope from the establishment of " the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge , " and was cast down and discouraged to find after repeated proposals , that it was in vain to expect that they would allow of the infusion of a really Christian element . He took an active interest in the foundation of the London University , as an institution which would be truly liberal in the admission of students , without respect to their religious opinions ; and when he found that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the teaching of Christianity in any sense , his feelings were hurt and his spirit was grieved . Lie was warmed towards the dissenters and the " evangelicals " by their earnest religious activity , but was repelled by their narrow bigotry and their low appreciation of intellectual culture . He felt kindly towards the Unitarians of England and America , and was persuaded that their prejudices had been aggravated by the harsh spirit in which they had been treated , and the inconvenient and dogmatic ex // pressions in which the Trinity had been propounded . And yet he affectionately and earnestly believed , that " God manifest in the flesh " is the Truth of Christianity . He was interested in the prospects and progress of a better philosophy in France ; but the patronizing tone in which Cousin spoke of Jesus , seemed to him to differ but little from the " Hail ! Master , " of another soi disant disciple . The three great antagonist influences , against which he contended , and which grieved him the worst , were the proud and selfish spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal and reforming schools , and the priestly assumptions of the high church clergy ; and his reward was to be called by the liberals of the London University , a bigot , and by the Oxford men a latitudinarian . His controversy with the Oxford party , was the longest , the most painful and the most memorable of all the controversies of his life . The political agitations of 1832 , took the form of a cry for church reforms , and alarmed Arnold with the fear lest they should end in the destruction of the church altogether . To do what lay in his power to save the church which he loved so well , he published in 1833 , his pamphlet on " the Principles of Church Reform . " This included a defense of the establishment , a plan for comprehending the dissenters within the establishment , and various suggestions intended to increase its actual efficiency . The sensation which this publication occasioned was prodigious . It passed through several editions , but the result was , that a storm of jealousy and wrath broke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited against him from various causes , and for various reasons , were at this time let loose upon his devoted head . This opposition , painful to him often , as coming from individuals whom he esteemed and loved , led him to a more careful examination of his principles , and these were embodied in the watch-words , " Christianity without sectarianism , " and " comprehension without compromise , " and were developed at length in a letter " on the admission of dissenters to the universities , " in 1834 , and as a postscript to his pamphlet on church reform . But on a sudden his path was crossed by a new and unexpected phenomenon , the rise of the Oxford party , and the publication of the " Tracts for the Times. ** This was most unexpected to Arnold . In 1829 , he had referred to a sermon of Rev. W. F. Hook , on the apostolical succession , as a strange exception to the general tone of English clergymen . In 1833 , he spoke of " those extraordinary persons who gravely maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , are essentially the same . " But in 1834 , 5 , 6 , these principles , which he had thought were dead , arose , like the teeth of Cadmus , an exceedir*g great army . They came from Oxford too , his Alma Mater , reverenced and loved , and he mourned with no affected grief and mortification , that the place to him so sacred , should be so dishonored . He expressed himself with freedom in respect to this party , in his private letters and occasional publications , but did not deem himself called upon to attack them formally and at length . He speaks of these opinions as " the very errors which in studying moral and religious truth , I have continually had to observe and to eschew ; the very essence of one of the two great divisions of human falsehood , against which the wisdom of God and man has most earnestly combated-in which man s folly and wickedness has ever found its favorite nourishment . " " I have been looking through the Tracts , which are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idols are better than others , some being // indeed as very Truncus ficulnus , ' as ever the most degrading super . stition worshipped ; but as to Christianity , there is more of it in any one of Mrs. Sherwood 's or Mrs. Cameron 's , or indeed in any of the Tract Society 's books , than in all the two Oxford octavos . And these men would exclude John Bunyan , and Mrs. Fry , and John Howard , from Christ 's church , while they exalt the non-jurors into confessors and Laud into a martyr . " " It is clear to me that Newman and his party are idolaters ; they put Christ 's church , and Christ 's sacraments , and Christ 's ministry , in the place of Christ himself . " " I call all this , Judaizing and direct idolatry-it is exalting the church and the sacraments into the place of Christ , as others have exalted his mother , and others in the same spirit exalted circumcision . There is something almost ludicrous , if the matter were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Calvin , and the best and ablest of his followers , and some of the great living writers of Germany , whom he must know , as of men laboring under judicial blindness . " " It is vain to argue with such men only ; when they ascribe a judicial blindness to Zuingle , or to Tholuck , Nitzsch , and Bunsen , one can not but be reminded of those who , with lies made the heart of the righteous sad whom God had not made sad , ' or of those who denied St. Paul 's apostleship and spirituality , because he was not one of the original twelve apostles , and because he would not preach circumcision . " Lie was clearly of the opinion that the real contest was between Christianity and the church system , and that what were called the middle churchmen of the church of England , though shrinking from the consistent avowal of their opinions , did yet hold opinions , of which Newman and Pusey were only the consistent expositors . " Now that the two systems are set front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course is possible ; the priest is either Christ or anti-Christ ; he is either our mediator , or he is like the man of sin in God 's temple ; the " church system " is either our gospel , and St. John 's and St. Paul 's gospel is superseded by it , or it is a system of blasphemous falsehood , such as St. Paul foretold was to come , such as St. John saw to be already in the world . ' " He had the sagacity to see , and the honesty to say , that this Oxford movement had its origin , not in a spirit of faith , but in one of skepticism , which , not having confidence in the legitimate grounds of the truth , sought for those which are extrinsic and factitious . He prophesied also , that as it began in skepticism , so it would end in infidelity , and would do a grand yet fearful service in the cause of unbelief . It was in this way that Arnold was constantly expressing himself to his friends , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tracts were issued and the Oxford cause was gathering strength . In 1836 , he appeared before the public in a manner which will not soon be forgotten , and for which he will never be forgiven . In this year , Dr. Hampden , his early friend , previously the Professor of Moral Philosophy , received the appointment of Regius professorship of Divinity . Against him a factious conspiracy was immediately organized , because Dr. H. was not of the extreme Oxford school . Efforts irregular and desperate were made to secure his removal-of the irregular and desperate character which are common under like circumstances , on the ground of Rationalism . Phe indignant spirit of Arnold could not be restrained , and he gave utterance to his emotions , in an article in the Edinburgh Review , entitled " The Oxford Malignants and Dr. Hampden . " In this article he gave this ever memorable description of the high church // party in the church of England . We give it at length . " But on the character of no party does history throw so full and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church of England  --  the party of the Oxford conspirators . Unlike the political tories , who are only analogously like the tories of the Revolution , by being as much in the rear of the existing generation as the old tories were in the rear of theirs , these church tories have stirred neither actually nor relatively ; they are the very Nonjurors and high church clergy of King William s , and Anne 's , and George the First* s reign , reproduced , with scarcely a shade of difference . Now , as then , this party is made up of two elements ; of the Llophni and Pliinehas school , on the one hand  --  the mere low worldly clergy , careless and grossly ignorant ,  --  ministers not of the Gospel but of the aristocracy , who belong to Christianity only from the accident of its being established by Jaw ; and of the formalist Judaizing fanatics , on the other hand , who have ever been the peculiar disgrace of the Church of England ; for these high church fanatics have imbibed , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virulence . Other fanatics have persecuted , like the Romanists , in order to uphold a magnificent system , which , striking its roots deep , and stretching its branches wide , exercises a vast influence over the moral condition of man , and may almost excuse some extravagance of zeal in its behalf . Others again have been fanatics for freedom , and for what they deemed the due authority of God 's own word . They were violent against human ceremonies-they despised learning - they cast away the delicacies , arid almost the humanities of society , for the sake of asserting two great principles , noble even in their exaggeration ,  --  en tire freedom towards man , and entire devotion towards God . But the fanaticism of the English high churchman has been the fanaticism of mere foolery . A dress , a ritual , a name , a ceremony ; -a technical phraseology ;  --  the superstition of a priesthood , without its power ; the form of Episcopal government , without the substance ; a system imperfect and paralyzed , not independent , not sovereign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perpetually murmuring . Such are the objects of high church fanaticism ; objects so pitiful , that , if gained ever so completely , they would make no man the wiser or the better ; they would lead to no good , intellectual , moral , or spiritual ; to no effect , social or religious , except to the changing of sense into silliness , and holiness of heart and life into formality and hypocrisy . " Once , however , and once only , in the history of Christianity , do we find a heresy-for never was that term more justly applied-so degraded and low-principled as this . We must pass over the times of Romanists-we must go back to the very beginning of the Christian church , and there , in the Jews and Judaizers of the New Testament , we find the only exact resemblance to the high churchman of Oxford . In the zealots of circumcision and the ceremonies of the law ,  --  in the slanderers and persecutors of St. Paul-the doters upon old wives ' fables and endless genealogies  --  the men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary humility , ' all the time that they were calumniating and opposing the Gospel and its great apostle ; - in the malignant fanatics who , to the number of more than forty , formed a conspiracy to assassinate Paul , because he had denied the necessity of ceremonies to salvation- ' the men of mint , and anise , and cummin , ' who cared not for judgment , mercy , and truth  --  the enemies and revilers of the holiest names which earth reverences , and who are condemned , in the most emphatic language by that // authority which all Christians acknowledge as divine ; - in these , and in these alone , can the party which has headed the late Oxford conspiracy find their perfect prototyp . " Such was the testimony , and we give it without any comment . We are quite confident that nothing has ever been said in the New Englander more severe than this . We leave it , as the impassioned yet deliberate opinion of a competent and honest witness , whu had.the best of all opportunities to know the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his views of the Oxford party did not change till his death . It may well be supposed that an article of such a character could not be published without causing the most intense excitement . This excitement , though stormy and violent , at last died away , and left Arnold in possession of greater influence than before . His unpopularity gave place to higher respect and confidence from all parties . He gave himself with a calmer devotedness to his own appropriate duties , and must have been surprised and gratified , at receiving the appointment of Professor of History , at his beloved Oxford . If his appointment was most gratifying , his reception must have been still more so . His lecture room was thronged - his lectures were listened to with high enthusiasm , and he was moved to a cordial expression of kind feeling towards those from whom he differed as decidedly as ever . It would seem that the hot and exciting noon of his life had just been passed , and there was before him a long evening of calm yet zealous labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No wonder that multitudes of the xvise and good were heartbroken with grief . It will he seen from the sketch which we have given of Arnold 's opinions and his controversies , that he was in the church of England , yet not of it . His most cherished principle , that the state and the church should be essentially the same , was derived from the theory of the English church as controlled by the Parliament and headed by the crown . The attempt to graft on this theory a toleration of differences and a comprehension of dissenters , was Arnold 's love of truth and charity , striving against the inherent defects of his own theory and of the actual English church . His impatient ardor against the priestly element , was a vain struggle against an element which the English church had received from Rome , and against which neither his theory , his zeal , nor his love of scriptural truth could avail , as an effectual resistance . In these struggles in and against this strong and overmastering influence of this ancient church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Milton . " Now half appeased The tawny lion , pawing to get free His hinder parts , thesi springs as broke from bonds , And rampant shakes his brinded mane . " Arnold indeed , never broke from his bonds , and perhaps never realized what it was that thwarted and bindered his best endeavors . Towards the close of his life , however , he seems to have become sensible of the impotence of his efforts and of the hopelessness of any general reform , and to have thoughts of the American voluntary system , as furnishing perhaps the only provision for Christian simplicity , and freedom from the bondage of the priest 's dominion . Of Arnold as a man , we had designed to speak at length . it was Arnold the man , that gave such interest and power to all his principles and labors . It was this that enabled him to exert so extensive , so genial and so blessed an influence on minds of the highest order , and to leave behind him a memory so fragrant . It is*Arnold the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves so happy an impression on every one who reads his life , and that has excited so universal an interest from minds of the most opposite principles . The most intolerant churchman , relaxes from the severity of his exclusiveness , to do honor to Arnold , and the coldest and hardest infidel , is warmed by so lovely an exhibition of devout and Christian feeling . Our limits will allow us to speak of only two or three of his more prominent characteristics . He was a lover of truth . Reality , the actual truth in the world of being , in history and in character , was to him invested with a charm , such as no ideal beauty could ever give . Hence he strove for the truth with an earnest and never tiring ardor . And when he had found the truth , he uttered it with a lion 's fearlessness . His character was transparent . He not only had nothing to conceal , but he could conceal nothing . His attachments were of the strongest kind . He lived on the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . How rare is it , that a scholar has such a circle of truly liberal and noble minded friends , and how , rare that he loves them so well . How different the single-hearted and human affections , that warm his epistles , fraught as they are with intellectual riches , from those exhibited in the correspondence of the great mass of the learned . How different the attaohments of such a man as Arnold , and how different the expression of them , from the ordinary friendships of scholars , of which the cement so often is studied flattery , or cold civility , or profuse but heartless compliments . His domestic attachments were of the strongest and purest character . He loved his parents and cherished the remembrances of his youthful home ; his wife and children were parts of himself . He loved to mingle with the poor , and it shows the man of humble feelings yet strong sense , that he says some where in his sermons , that prayer and intercourse with the poor are absolutely essential , to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sharp controversialist , yet he was never harsh , never coarse , and never triumphed with savage ferocity in the dexterous skill with which he despatches an antagonist , but is lost and absorbed in the cause for which he contends . The spectacle of such a scholar , in these days of Pantheistic pride , of cold-blooded sentimentalism , of elegant self-seeking , and of heartless science , is most refreshing and delightful . To hold communion with such a mind , reconciles us to the world and to human nature . To the writings of Arnold we give our heartiest commendation . We know of no works , which we think are more worthy to be studied and read . They are each in their place most valuable , and we thank the publishers for having brought so many of them within the reach of the American public . We are well aware that some of our readers may think our commendations have come too late . Perhaps some of them may think them superfluous , after the number of honorable notices which have been made of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored with more costly and elaborate offerings , we could not resist the impulse to cast our own garland , though late and hastily woven , upon the tomb of a man so great and so good@@184069711.txt WE witness in our country , with one sad exception , a condition of social equality , of general competence , and of intellectual elevation , unknown in any other part of the world . This upward movement of our race had its origin in the abundant natural resources of the soil , and in the character of the first colonists . The design of Providence in the late discovery of this continent , and in its subsequent history , most manifestly was , to give a freer developrnent of society , under Christian influences , than was possible in the old world where the lower classes , embracing the body of the people , are held in a fixed condition of inferiority , and doomed to poverty and ignorance . With us , every man may be the owner of the soil that he cultivates , and of the house that he inhabits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and live to see them advanced to the first places of honor in the land . He may choose whatever calling in life is most agreeable to him , and exchange it for another whenever he deems it to be for his interest . He enjoys perfect religious freedom , and pays no taxes for the support of a church establishment . Whoever does not prosper under such a system of laws , in such a country , must charge his ill success either to his own idleness , improvidence or vice , unless indeed , he has been deprived of the power of self.support , by " visitation of God , " as in the case of idiots and cripples . All other persons may earn a subsistence , and , by industry , economy and prudent management , improve their condition . This is what might be . The reality is far different . What the Apostle Paul says of " the whole creation , groaning and travailing in pain , " whether intended to be a description of suffering humanity alone , or of some wider ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored country . The influx of foreign paupers , and the ruined constitutions and fortunes of multitudes of vicious men and women , together with the misfortunes incident to a state of mortality , involving many innocent sufferers , call loudly for relief from the hands of the affluent and prosperous . This call is heard b* many . The enviable condition of man in this broad land of liberty , is far from realizing the wishes and hopes of philanthropy . The progress already made in improving his condition , instead of satisfying the benevolence of the age , has served rather to inflame desire by inspiring hope ; and the inquiry now pervades society , to what extent can the elevation of mankind in knowledge , in virtue , in the material of subsistence and comfort , in all that sustains , ennobles and adorns the race , be reasonably anticipated . This inquiry receives one answer from every side ; from believers in those pr&amp;. dictions of holy writ that foretell a " golden age , " and from philosophers , Christian and infidel , who infer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the possibility of still greater advances . But another inquiry accompanies this , in respect to which there is no such unanimity of opinion . How is this golden age to be ushered in ? What precisely may we anticipate , and by what measures is it to be accomplished ? We hope to solve these interesting problems by a definite statement of our expectations and the grounds of them . The ur*iversal and permanent peace of nations is a chief characteristic of the age that we anticipate . Pacific principles are destined , we believe , to gain a , gradual though // it may be a slow ascendency in national councils , until relations of perfect reciprocity come to be esiablished , the conflicting interests of all to be scrupulously adjusted on equitable grounds , and questions of difficulty and doubt compromised with a spirit of liberal concession . National rights and liberties will no longer be invaded , and hence a resort to arms in their defense will cease to be necessary . As an indispensable condition of this state of peace , we expect the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life to be conducted with a regard to the rights of all parties , of the weak and poor , as well as of the powerful and rich . We expect the administration of justice and the practice of law to be reduced to simple questions of equity , and the determination of what is right to be sufficient to secure the doing of* right in most transactions between man and man . Then the power of conscience and the intolerable disgrace attached to all wrong doing , if in any case inadequate to enforce the decisions of the courts and of a virtuous public sentiment , will be sustained by a prompt and sure infliction of the penalty of the law . We do not suppose this age of peace and rectitude will be free from all crime ; much less from all unhappiness . Man is by nature a fallen being , and , in every age of the world , will be liable to grow up to manhood in sin , and to bring on himself and others the legitimate consequences of his wickedness . But while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sustained by a virtuous public sentiment , the occasional outbursts of human depravity , will easily be restrained , and a spirit of beneficence , with abundant means , will supply every urgent want , and impart con8olation to every grief . War , slavery , fraud , and every form of prevailing immorality , will disappear ; and all other sources of human woe , the compassionate hand of benevolence will seek to close . No one will then be harrassed with the fear of extreme want ; no famine will scourge the earth ; and poverty , in respect to the necessaries of life , will be known only to be relieved . The spirit of kindness which will thus minister to the wants of the unfortunate , with a generous haste , will encourage and put forward every social reform , and suppress effectually those vices which are the chief cause of the degradation and wretchedness of man , in this state of his existence . And that courtesy which treats with unaffected politeness the whole brotherhood of man , without any invidious distinctions , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be the crowning glory of this advanced state of society . That there will then be no sense of want , no unsatisfied desire , and no severe distress , must not be inferred from the glowing descriptions of prophecy . Such freedom from trial ought not indeed to be desired ; for this world is intended to be a place of discipline and trust . Man is here to be trained for a better life , not by teaching merely , but by conflict with privation , with hardship , with sickness , with injuries ; not with inward corruptions only , but with outward calamities . This would no longer be a fit place of discipline , if it were divested of all trials of patience , of all occasions of resignation , and of all opportunities of beneficence . The golden age of our hopes , is not exempt from infirmity and suffering , not sinless norce lestial , but simply a day of universal goodness , intelligence , peace and plenty . This is an epitome of what we may expect . This is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opinion as to the method and means of accomplishment . What these are we shall endeavor to show , after expo // sing the insufficiency and folly of some schemes , on which reliance has been placed . This happy period is not to be introduced by the abolition of private property , and the establishment of a community of goods . It will be distinguished by the same spirit which animated the bosoms of the early Christians who sold their possessions , and distributed them to their brethren , " as every man had need . " But the right of property will still be recognized , as it was in those primitive times . Property will still be sought , acquired and held , subject indeed to all the demands of charity ; not regarded as the supreme good , but valued for its legitimate uses , and employed with a generous liberality , for the relief of want and the good of society . The constitution of man ; the recognition of property by the sacred penmen ; the prohibition of theft ; the duty of almsgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , as the instrument of public improvements , and as a provision for seasons of scarcity ; are so many demonstrations of the folly of a community of goods . The idleness , the waste , the improvidence , that would prevail in such a state of things , would soon reduce the whole race to starvation . Nor is this age of prosperity conditioned upon the abolition of civil government . Nations will still exist as distinct societies maintaining the forms of law , and exercising authority in the determination of rights , and the equitable adjustment of claims , and consulting for the improvement of the social condition of the people . The supposition that there will be no place for law and penalty , after the hum*n race embrace unitedly and cordially the Gospel of Christ , takes no account of the errors of the human understanding , and the collisions of interest which may arise between men of strict integrity . It overlooks the whole field of political economy , and assumes that government exists solely for the prevention and punishment of crime , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It overlooks also the influence of civil government , of law and penalty , in defining the duties of the social state , and in restraining the self-love of man , from acts of injustice . The best state of society that will ever be attained by man , will be the best , not . without the control of human as well as of divine law , and , in part , because of that control . The nature of man will continue the same , in every age , and need , as a support of virtue , the reverential fear of the magistrate . The necessity of this support is no proof of the nonexistence of virtue . There is law and fear in heaven  --  the fear of offending . Nor would it be safe to trust either saint or angel , in the hour of temptation , if it were not for the foreseen consequences of transgression , the displeasure of the lawgiver . In the happy age that we anticipate , the arm of civil law will therefore be stretched out over men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a certainty hitherto unrealized on earth . Nor will this period be distinguished by the abrogation of the law of marriage , and the abolition of the family state . The divine constitution which manifestly provides for the education of each successive generation under the eye of parental love and watchfulness ; the jealousies and contentions that harrass the existence of the nearest kindred where a plurality of wives is tolerated ; and the sweet influences of home , the enraptured theme of every grateful heart ; all these assure us , that the promiscuous herding of the human race , without fathers , with abandoned mothers , can be no part of " the good time coming . " In that day , as in this , the foundation of all that is good , great and happy , in the wider cir // des of society , and in the broader fields of usefulness , will be laid in the family . Nor is this period to be introduced by " the organization of labor in the township , " or by any other scheme of association . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite one of the present day , the only one which is advocated with much ability . It is maintained by its advocates that there are radical faults in our social organization , such as must effectually counteract the efforts of philanthropy and the remedial influence of the Gospel , and perpetuate the wrongs and sufferings of the race , without any essential mitigation . They have , therefore , no time , no money , no talent to devote to any of the ordinary measures of benevolent action . They contribute nothing for the evangelization of the heathen , nothing for Bible and Tract distribution in destitute settlements , nothing for home missions . They have , they think , a sovereign panacea for the evils which we deploresovereign and indispensable-and they despair of achieving much for the race , until this remedy shall be applied . They propose to prevent the collisions of interest , the corroding cares , the forebodings of poverty , ' the actual destitution , the nakedness and hunger , the ignorance and vice , the excessive toil and waste of labor , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a species of joint stock company , to the common interests of which every member is to devote his time and energies . An able writer in one of our most widely circulated journals , thus sums up the conclusions of a series of articles in favor of the plan . " 1 . That man has a natural , Godgiven right to labor for his own subsistence and the good of others , and to a needful portion of the earth from which his physical sustenance is to be drawn . If this be a natural , essential right , it can not be justly suspended , as to any , upon the interest or caprice of others ; and that society in which a part of mankind are permitted or forbidden to labor , according to the need felt or fancied by others for their labor , is unjustly constituted and ought to be reformed . " 2 . That in a true social state , the right of every individual to such labor as he is able to perform , and to the fair and equal recompense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the thorough education of each child , physical , moral and intellectual , be regarded as the dictate of universal interest and imperative duty . " 3 . That such education for all , such opportunity to labor , such security to each of a just and fair recompense , are manifestly practicable only through the association of some two or three hundred families on the basis of united interests and efforts , ( after the similitude of a bank , railroad or whaleship , though with far more perfect arrangements for securing to each what is justly his ; ) inhabiting a common edifice , though with distinct and exclusive as well as common apartments , cultivating one common domain , and pursuing thereon various branches of mechanical and manufacturing as well as agricultural industry , and uniting in the support of education , in defraying the cost of chemical and philosophical apparatus , of frequent lectures , &amp;c. &amp;c. " 4 . That among the advantages of this organization would be immense economies in land , food , cooking , fuel , buildings , teams , implements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , a vastly increased efficiency would be given to the labor of each by concentration of effort and the devotion to productive industry of the great numbers now employed in unproductive avocations , or who are deemed too young , too unskilled or too inefficient to be set at work under our present industrial mechanism . // " 5 . That , thus associated and blended in interests , in daily intercourse , in early impressions , in cares , joys and aspirations , the rich and poor would become the brethren and mutual helpers for which their Creator designed them-that labor would be rendered attractive by well planned , lighted , warmdd and ventilated work-shops , by frequent alternations from the field to the shop as urgency , convenience , weariness or weather should suggest ; and that all being workers , all sharers in the same cares and recrealions , none doomed to endure existence in a cellar or hovel , the antagonism and envious discontent now prevalent would be banished , and general content , good-will and happiness prevail , while famine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. would be unknown . " These , hastily and imperfectly condensed , are my positions , my convictions . I believe that Christianity , social justice , intellectual and moral progress , universal well-being , imperatively require the adoption of such a reform ns is here roughly sketched . I do not expect that it will be immediately effected , nor that the approaches to it will not be signalized by failures , mistakes , disappointments . But the principle of association is one which has already done much for the improvement of the condition of our race ; we see it now actively making its way into general adoption , through odd-fellowship , protective unions , mutual fire , marine , and life insurance , and other forms of guarantyism . Already commodious edifices for the poor of cities are planned by benevolence , unsuspicious of the end to which it points ; already the removal of paupers from localities where they are a grievous burthen , to those where they can substantially support themselves , is the theme of general discussion . In all these and many like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' not for the destitute and hopeless only , but for the great mass of our fellow-men . In this faith I labor and live ; share it or scout it as you will . " We shall not attempt a minute criticism of these positions , but pass our judgment upon a few of them , and state our reasons for rejecting the main conclusion . We are not sure that we can assent to the assertion , that man has a natural right to " a. needful portion of the earth from which his physical sustenance is to be drawn . " The precise meaning of the . writer is not very obvious . That every man has a natural right to seize upon " a needful portion " of unapl ) roprinted land , has always been admitted ; - that the laborer is justly entitled to his hire , that is , to a share in the product of the land which he cultivates for his employer , we shall not dispute . But we are not prepared to assent to a possible meaning of this language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize upon the land of the rich , and partition it among themselves . Such a right would be inconsistent with any inequalities of wealth beyond a common supply of wants . The right of property would then extend only to the possession of " a needful portion , " and every larger proprietor would be bound to pare with his surplus on demand . All motives for industry anA economy , not necessary to subsistence in the ordinary style , would be wanting , and the accumulation of wealth , on which all progress is dependent , would be impracticable . The right of property is proved by the acquisitiveness of human nature , of which the phrenologist speaks ; and to restrict it to the possession of a bare competence , would paralize the industrial energies of the world . We do not , however , dissent from the opinion of this writer , if he means simply to assert the natural right of every man to pursue his own happi // ness ; to work for his own support , and to receive a fair remuneration for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He may prefer to follow the seas , or labor in a shop , or practice medicine or law ; and whatever service he may perform , his right to an equivalent from the person served , is as truly a natural right , as that of the tiller of the soil to the product of his industry . Nor can we assent to all that is expressed so positively in the third paragraph , viz. " that such education for all , such opportunity to labor , such security to each of a just and fair recompense , are manifestly practicable only through the association of some two or three hundred families on the basis of united interests and efforts . " The education of all is " manifestly practicable , " without any such expedient . The common school system of our country contemplates the education of all . The churches of the several denominations could easily adopt a system for the instruction of all the children of their respective congregations . An opportunity to labor is , we admit , sometimes wanting , in the present state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor . But by admitting this , we do not of course concur in the expediency of " the organization of labor in the township . " Some advantages may be secured , and some evils of the present order of things may be avoided , by such an organization , while on the whole , the change may be unfortunate . And we think it can be shown that the highest interests of man would not be promoted by securing to him a livelihood , without his own care and vigilance : for which opinion we shall soon give our reasons . How we view many of the other positions which this writer flatters himself he has established , will appear in the sequel , after we have pointed out our positive objections to the measure . The advocates of association overlook the probationary character of many of the trials of this life , and instead of aiming only at the removal of wickedness , and the relief of suffering , they seek to deliver man from the sphere and possibility of the necessary discipline of divine Providence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the morrow , " in a world of uncertainty and change , they would place him in a condition of perfect ex. emption from all the vicissitudes of life , and guaranty him a good livelihood and decent burial , and the care of his wife and children after him . This promise may fascinate men who have not learned to commit their interests to God in well doing as to a faithful Creator-men who shrink from personal responsibility ; and they may herd together for mutual defense and safety . But the Christian , when he reflects on his past history , will not wish to escape occasions of trust in a beneficent Providence , nor those trials of his confidence by which his faith has been strengthened . Instead of inculcating the duty of giving to the poor , the associationists would insure all their members in advance against the necessity of private acts of charity ; and they thus lose the moral discipline and happiness which grow out of the relations of rich and poor , of benefactor and beneficiary , in our social state . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not sent into the world to guaranty one another against the possibility of want , nor to escape the necessity of forecast and caution , nor to throw off upon the officers of a joint stock company , the whole care and management of their interests . They were placed here for discipline ; for the trial of their patience and fortitude ; for the exercise and development of their intellects ; for self-denial ; for disappointment ; for trust ; for benevolent action . Their liability to the // trials of life , in the present social state , is essential to their moral discipline ; and the struggle they must make in the business of life , is equally necessary to the full development of their faculties . We shall be sorry for the children of these townships , if they must be reared under this system of intellectual and moral enervation . In this connection , it is pertinent to allude to the extreme difficulty of maintaining a system of religious instruction and public worship in an association . Though we may incur the scorn of socialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the necessity of the Sabbath and Christian ministry to the highest state of social cultivation and happiness . With this conviction , we can not but regard the improbability of any adequate provision of this kind as fatal to their scheme . The diversities of belief which divide our communities into sects , are easily provided for by the establishment of distinct churches , supporting respectively their own ministers . But in association , the means of independent action are wanting , and the rancor of sectarian feeling will be apt to prevent a system of religious instruction and public worship . Divinity will fall out of the triad of learned professions , and pastoral labor will be dispensed with as no part of productive industry . The scheme of association is liable to another objection , absolutely fatal , its manifest impracticability ; it can never succeed . No arguments are sufficiently cogent to persuade the body of mankind to embark in such an experiment . Its wisdom must first be demonstrated by many successful trials , through a long period of years , before men of discretion will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound minds refuse to risk their fortunes , reputation , usefulness , domestic happiness , and all the interests of those dependent on them , in the experi ment , what chance is there of success ? Will associations of men and women , gathered from the ranks of discontent , disappointment , misanthropy , and sanguine temperaments ; gathered in the conviction that the ills which they desire to escape are all owing to the mal-organization of the social state , and not to their own misconduct and mistakes , and that a community of interests will make them all kings and priests with entailed estates , all laborers , all producers , yet all persons of easy leisure , all rich , all learned ; will such associations be successful ? Will not the judicious part of the community , who alone could rationally be expected to accomplish a work of so great difficulty , be repelled from embarking in it , by all the trials that are likely to be made ? We have no doubt of it . We think also that the very idea of sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this kind , is too repulsive to the unsophisticated heart of man , to be generally received . Men of ardent and misguided philanthropy , if they can obtain capital to sink in such a pool , may also find men and women of broken fortunes and broken spirits , who , weary of struggling with the waves of adversity , are prepared to catch at straws , that will go with them into association . But the sober world will still prefer a life of individual responsibility . Nor if it were otherwise , would the scheme be an adequate measure of relief from the prevalence of social wickedness and suffering . Were it universally adopted , it would doubtless turn the current of human depravity into new channels , but it would not dry it up , nor stay its destructive course . We have already adverted to the probability of collisions between the several towns , and the probability of internal dissensions is even greater . There would undoubtedly be rival interests among the leading members , who would foment difficulties // that would involve the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any where , in her love of personal independence and her jealousy of combinations . She is even careful to station her churches so far apart , that if one should take fire , no other would be in danger . Need we say that we here speak figuratively ? The churches of New England are to each other merely advisory bodies ; and it is worthy of consideration , whether their consequent harmony and freedom from the disturbing force of local difficulties , should not be taken as decisive evidence , that the more mankind are removed from subjection one to another , the less liable are they to discord . We think this opinion is corroborated by history . How few have been the successful experiments of socialism ! How frequently have such attempts been frustrated by internal dissensions , and by collisions with the world ! Even where the success has seemed to be the greatest , what has the general happiness gained ? Each association stands in the midst of society as a separate and antagonistical interest , and withdraws from the public service the wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better if the whole population were to he organized into townships on this plan . Then the several independent associations , like the warlike clans of other times , would be exposed to constant controversy far more serious and difficult of amicable adjustment , than in the intercourse of individuals . The association is formed , not as a missionary society for the benefit of the world , not as a railway corporation to construct a public convenience ; but for the private interest of the members , in which the rest of mankind have no part , and which may be a temptation to drive hard bargains with the surroundingcommunity . The members must either live in isolation from all other men , and consume only the products of their own labor , or , having commerce with the world , come into competition in the markets with other producers ; and we fear they will be found , in these transactions , like other corporations , without souls . Their towns would then become obnoxious to public indignation , and liable to be broken up , like ill-fated Nauvoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the improbable event of external harmony and a permanent existence , these fraternities can not , in our opinion , be expected to fulfil the predictions of their advocates . We have seen that they present no fair prospect of harmony . What too would be the fate of morality in a society so constructed , it is not difficult to foresee . It is well known , that mankind will do , in an associated capacity , deeds of dishonesty and meanness , which they would scorn to be guilty of as individuals . Relying on the popular sentiment of the body of which they are members , they will do without scruple for the common interest , what they would shrink from doing for their own private ends . Nor can we avoid the suspicion that the constant mingling of the population in their public apartments and daily occupations , will , in spite of every precaution , prove unfriendly to purity of heart and life . We should regret to be obliged to confide a youthful friend to this influence . The prospect of maintaining a truly Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to a possibility . The retirement in which the vast body of the people are now educated , away from the interruptions that must continually invade the private life of the associationist , lays the foundation of nearly all the virtue of mankind ; and , as it seems to us , is indispensable to eminent piety in Christians general ly . The exercise and cultivation of many of the dispositions which give symmetry to the character of man , // and spread a charm over his life , can have no place in a mutual insurance company . Parental responsibilities and filial obligations , are weakened ; and the charities of the beneficent , and the gratitude of the poor , are excluded by the very constitution of society . But the most signal failure of these schemes of social reform will be due , if we are not deceived , to the idleness and thriftlessness of the population . The enterprising , industrious members will find their number small , and the whole labor of supporting a herd of drones pressing upon them , until at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The a priori evidence of this , lies in the absence of any adequate motive to labor , and in the manifest impossibility of applying , under the system , any effectual stimulus to the sluggish nature of man . A strong religious delusion , as in the case of the Shakers , may induce men to associate together , under a despotic government of their own framing , which shall have sufficent strength to enforce order and industry . But such joint stock associations as we are contemplating , can never be governed by stringent rules , sustained by severe penalties ; and if we know anything of mankind , four members out of every five will indulge their indolence , to the utter ruin of every such establishment . What then becomes of the demand for a new organization of the social state , as a means of relief from the evils which we deplore ? We can not doubt that a praiseworthy philanthropy , a generous regard for the welfare of man , and a humane sympathy with suffering , animate the zeal of many in their advocacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to discountenance . The reader will see that the objection to their plan on which we have insisted at the greatest length , is its manifest impracticabili ty . We sympathize with them in an unfeigned abhorrence of the numerous wrongs that are inflicted on mankind by oppressive laws , as well as in the wretchedness produced by the lawless violence and vices of our race . But we do not see that they have discovered a remedy . The evils deplored will survive their talk and their experiments , unless some other more effectual influence shall prevent it . We have thus prepared the way for the exhibition of the grounds of our expectation of a golden age of the world , in which all that we have predicted shall be realized . We take the past as a pledge of the future . The advancement of mankind in intelligence , in science , in art , in virtue , in the means of subsistence and comfort , and the mitigation of human wretchedness , in all Christian nations , is a part of history . Something important has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no observer can doubt . It is Christianity that has wrought the wonderful change . It is Christianity that has transmuted the savage Briton into the accomplished Englishman ; and that has spread over wide territories , once full of the habitations of ferocious men , the dwellings of honest and peaceful industry . She has not done what she would , nor what she has promised . Will she be able to carry out all her plans of beneficence , without a fundamental alteration of the social state ? Those who think her unable , point , with an air of triumph , to the slow progress of man since the birth of Christ , and to the existence , even in Christian lands , of squalid poverty , of beastly drunkenness , of slavery and war ; and assert that an experiment of nearly two thousand years duration , is sufficient to extinguish all hope of a better age , unless an organic change of the social state shall first dry up the sources of human depravity and woe . We think differently . We // do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : " Where is the promise of his coming , for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning . " We do not forget that a thousand years are with the Lord as one day . He needs not be in haste to accomplish his purposes . We see also obstacles inherent in human nature sufficiently potent to account for the slow progress of man toward the highest point of social elevation and happiness . Whoever considers the natural proneness of the race to idleness and vice , and even to lose , by retrograde movements , the degrees of civilization that have been attained , and to relapse into barbarism , will rather admire the elevation and stability of modern society , than wonder at the remaining sum of crime , ignorance and wretchedness . We do not wonder ; we admire . The world becomes better and happier day by day . The footsteps of reform , to our eye , are now more rapid and secure than at any previous period . The improvements of the past are more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the freedom of the press , and the rising power of the productive classes , whose interest it specially is to promote the cause of social reform . All the gains of the future will be guarded with equal vigilance , and become stepping-stones to still farther achievements . The concessions made to liberty in the States of the Church , in Prussia and in furkey , are facts in confirmation of this opinion . They can not be recalled , and they can not fail to pave the way to the correction of abuses in church and state , until at length , in the lapse of years , nothing may remain to be corrected . So we believe . Our expectation rests far less on the aspects of the times and the history of the past , than on the BIBLE , which , as we think , announ ces plainly the coming of a better age , distinguished by all that purity , harmony , rectitude , and happiness of which we have spoken ; and at the same time , teaches us with sufficient clearness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our reachings after this " new earth , " but " helpers of our faith . " We take what has been gained through the benign influence of Christianity , as a pledge of the consummation of our hopes . We may now specify those auxiliaries of Christianity on which the chief reliance is placed for the accomplishment of this work . Science will have a principal share of the honor of introducing this happy era . It has hitherto contributed largely to the relief of suffering and to the augmentation of the conveniences , comforts and embellishments of life . The arts are , all of them , indebted to science for their perfection , if not for their existence* Even war has become less sanguinary and less frequent , since science and art have introduced the use of firearms . The more terrific and resistless the engines of destruction become , the less disposed are nations to try the fortunes of war . The discovery of the explosive power of gun-cotton may perhaps compel the despots of the world to relax the rigor of their tyranny , and rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their subjects constitutional governments , and maintain a paternal rule over all classes of the people . Every such invention or discovery of science , supplies to the oppressed of all nations , new weapons of successful resistance . Contributions to the arts of peace , illustrate , more strikingly still , the obligations of our race to science . The various uses of the steam-engine in facilitating the intercourse of men , making neighbors of remote nations , and conveying the products of every climate over the whole world in the space of a few // weeks , and multiplying at a cost far below the prices of former times , and in a more finished style , every article of clothing and convenient utensil , is an example of whatscience can do for the benefit of man . The more recent application ofgalvanisrn to the communication of intelligence in the twinkling of an eye , between points thousands of miles apart ; and the still more recent discovery of the lethean ether which renders the living body insensible to the knife of the surgeon , are other examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature to minister to the welfare of man . Is it irrational to expect , in view of what has thus been done to lighten the labors , to supply the wants , to relieve the sufferings , to augment the enjoyments of human life , and to diffuse these blessings through all ranks of society , that the benefits will ultimately reach the whole race , and that new inventions , discoveries , and applications of scientific principles to useful purposes , will confirm our most sanguine hopes ? Such improvements have been made , that already mankind begin to inquire whether it is possible that the forces of nature should be made to contribute more bountifully still to the arts of life . They seem to think that they have seen an end of perfection in the construction of labor-saving machines and the other numberless contributions of science to the service of man . But probably the course of discovery and invention has only just commenced , and another century may find the arts as far in advance of the present day , as we are in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of the useful and ornamental arts , will improve the condition of man . There will be a more abundant supply of material for his wardrobe and his table ; more efficient remedies for disease ; more leisure for mental cultivation ; better systems of instruction within the reach of all ; and ample provisions for the relief of honest poverty . The increase of cotton cultivation as a direct consequence of the invention of the cotton-gin , is an instance of the universal effect of those inventions which cheapen the production of useful articles . The result invariably is a more abundant production , and a special benefit to the poorer classes ; for it is they who are thereby put into possession of a new article of comfort or convenience . Legislation will be another prominent means of introducing the golden age of the world . In many countries a radical change in the fundamental law of the land , is necessary to the freedom of the people , the enjoyment of their natural rights , and their highest social prosperity and happiness . And no nation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In every country there are laws and institutions which are not only impolitic , but unjust and oppressive . These will gradually give place to a system of impartial laws extending over all classes , and securing to all the common rights and privileges of free citizens . It is manifest that all these reforms are within the reach of possibility ; that they may even be confidently anticipated , not only by the Christian who relies on the promises of God , but by the mere philanthropist who may see in the signs of the times , the pledge of a better age . Who does not expect the downfall of all despotisms , and the universal establishment of popular governments , civil and ecclesiastical ? Who does not expect that the legislation of the world , in the hands of the people , will be framed on the principle , that one man not convicted of crime , is equally entitled with every other to all the privileges of freemen ? A few examples may serve to show how ' much may be done by legislative reform for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , at the present moment , looking to the arm of the law to carry it forward , and establish it on a firm basis , by the suppression of the traffic in in. toxicating drinks . That incalculable good would result from the abandonment of the trade , except for use in the arts , no one can doubt . The only question , about which opinions may be divided , respects the choice of measures to accomplish the object ; whether it is wisest to prohibit the traffic absolutely , or to impose upon the trade the burden of all the pauperism and damage occasioned by it , and to punish the vender , as an accessory , for all crimes committed through the influence of his trade ; or else to adopt some other expedient to dry up this fountain of public corruption and misery . It is not our object to go into the consideration of such points . We think it evident that the friends of the cause will not rest until their work is consummated by making the sale of intoxicating drinks a penal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people as shall secure the execution of the law , and stamp with infamy every violation of it : or , at least , until the business becomes too hazardous to be followed by men who have any thing to lose . There is a loud demand for reform in the laws which relate to religion , not so much in our own country as in other parts of the world . The union of church and state is a grand impertinence , proceeding on the groundless pretense , that the state is the authorized head of the church and bound to provide by law for the instruction of the people in a prescribed religion . The history of this country has worked out no problem with more absolute demonstration , than that religion will flourish if left to the voluntary support of the people , rather than under the patronage of the state . There are other decisive ob jections to the union of church and state . It corrupts religion by tempting ambitious and worldly men to become ecclesiastics , for the sake of the distinctions and emoluments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cultivation of theological science , frowning on all departures from the prescribed forms and dogmas of the establishment . It may also impose on the people the support of what they regard to be a false system of doctrines , and what is so in fact . The grand error of the system is , that it robs the true faith of a most important advantage which she has in her conflict with error in the open field . A false religion can live and thrive for ages on ecclesiastical funds , when , if it were left to the sole resource of freewill offerings , it would not survive a generation . The votaries of error may devote their property to it , under the influence of superstition and party excitement ; but in the cool moments of life , they prefer their money to their idols . The truth , on the contrary , has an unfailing support in the steady devotion of sincere Christians . In every view of the subject therefore , whether we consider the injustice inflicted on dissenters by a state religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishments , we can not but conclude , that they ought to be abolished . Freedom of conscience should be secured to all . The Bible is the gift of God to man ; and every man has a right , conferred by his Maker , and founded on his personal responsibility , to interpret it for himself . No human government can lawfully prohibit him from worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience . This is a truism in our country , but unhappily it is practically denied by a large part of Christendom . Not only is religion with prescribed forms arid dogmas established and endowed , but dissent in some countries is visited with civil disabilities , // and even with the confiscation of goods and banishment . A greater wrong can not be inflicted on man . But we look with confidence to the universal recognition at no distant day , of the rights of conscience . The burning of heretics and the tortures of the Inquisition , no more certainly belong to the history of the past , than the perfect religious freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The entailment of estates is another subject for legislative reform , from the unhappy influence of which we were saved by the wisdom of the fathers of our country . In Europe it has consigned millions of acres to sterility or devoted them to the chase , while the peasantry are left to starve for want of bread . This whole subject of the tenure of property demands , as it seems to us , the corrective hand of legislation . The laws of every country should especially encourage the multiplication of small farmers , of men owning the soil they cultivate , and cultivating the soil they own . This gives them a fixed habitation , and a stake in the liberties , the governrnent , and all the interests of their country ; and tends to the equalization of wealth , to a population of uniform character , to social order , harmony , competence and contentment . We will refer for illustration to one other case in which the social interests of mankind may be promoted by appropriate legis ! ation . Although , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of a privileged order , is an evil of great magnitude , in those countries where it prevails , yet something needs to be done to render the condition of the people more equal and stable , to attach them to the soil , and give them a stake in the liberties , peace and welfare of their country . This perhaps may be done most effectually by extending to every family homestead , the principle by which the tools of the mechanic , the necessary articles of furniture , and other property , are now excepted from liability for debts ; not as an expost facto law , in. terfering with the rights of creditors , but against any obligations contracted subsequent to the act of exemption . Such a provision has already been introduced into the constitution of one of our states . Whether it will answer the end for which it is designed , we do not feel ourselves competent to predict with absolute certainty . The principle was known to Jewish law , and worked admirably as a part of the Mosaic institutes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort , with proper limitations , such as experience would suggest , could be devised , it would save a multitude of families , from being reduced to complete destitution by improvidence , vice or innocent misfortune . Nor as it seems to us would the measure embarrass the operations of business ; for no one would be trusted on the credit of unattachable property , while the possession of a small capital might enable a debtor to acquire the means of liquidating his obligations when otherwise it would not be in his power . There are other happy consequences that might possibly follow the enactment of such a law . Would it not tend powerfully to encourage industry , economy , and prudent management ? Would it not restrain young men from burdening themselves with families before they have provided permanent homes ? However these questions may be answered , we think it will not be disputed , that legal science may yet discover a remedy for those sudden fluctuations of fortune by which multitudes are every day plunged from affluence into penury ; and by some effectual means establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the possession of a frugal competence out of it . So much may certainly be done // as shall sensibly diminish the relative number of suffering families , and at the same time secure the interest of an independent yeomanry in the preservation of the peace and order of society . Leaving the consideration of the influence of science and law , we can only allude to popular education as another powerful auxiliary to the Gospel in the work of social reform and improvement . The instruction of youth in the rudiments of useful learning , opens to them the word of God , sharpens their intellects , and supplies them with the necessary instruments of investigation and progress . What is thus done very generally for the youth of our country , will yet be done for the whole civilized world , and for every nation that shall hereafter embrace Christianity . The reign of ignorance will then close . Mankind will know the truth , and the truth shall make them free . This brings us to the consideration of the direct agency of Christianity in this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences of which we have spoken , together with the constant inculcation of revealed truth , through the institutions of the Gospel , is our ground of reliance for the ultimate accomplishment of these predictions . Christianity is the fundamental influence ; that which supports all other means of ameliorating the condition of man ; that which is the source of modern science , law , art and education ; that which suggests and inspires all the movements of philanthropy ; and that alone which works a radical change in the character of man , subduing his natural selfishness , and subjecting him to the control of reason , conscience and love . No human wisdom can devise a successful plan for harmonizing the interests of the human race , so that wars and fightings will not come forth from their lusts , and bring them " into captivity to the law of sin which is in their members , " until " the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus " shall make them free . Oppression , violence , bloodshed , intemperance , licentiousness , crime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long and so far as the native character of man shall bear sway in the world . We look therefore to vital Christianity to be the harbinger of that age of order , peace and social happiness that the world is reaching after not in vain . The reconciliation of individuals will reconcile nations . Defensive war will cease with the cessation of offenses . No more innocent blood will stain the " new earth , " when man himself shall become a new creature " in Christ . Not only will the great fountains of human suffering-war , slavery , intemperance and licentiousness-be dried up , but righteousness and truth , beneficence and courtesy , reigning in human hearts , and shining in all human intercourse , will leave no right unregarded , no want unsupplied , and no suffering unrelieved . This is not a vision of enthusiasm , nor a dream of philosophy . Were it not for the testimony of divine revelation , we should entertain no such expectations . With this encouragement , we can anticipate all that we have delineated. - We can believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute , as handmaids of religion , an abundant supply for the temporal wants of man ; and that religion by its direct agency , will bring the race to the exercise of mutual forbearance and generosity . This is what is wanted , all that is wanted , and all that is consistent with a state of trial , and preparation for a responsible existence beyond the grave.
