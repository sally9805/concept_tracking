txt OUR readers will remember , that in the last number of the New Englander we gave them some account of the opinions of Theodore Parker as advanced in his " Discourse of Religion . " In the conclusion of our article we proposed to resume the discussion , and to inquire , what is the relation of his opinions to those commonly held by Unitarians , and what is his present position in the denomination . Our former discussion concerned Mr. Parker as a relio'ious philosopher . The present one relates to Mr. Parker as a Unitarian or liberal Christian . When a close and consistent thinker comes to unusual conclusions in respect either to religion or philosophy , it is always fair and often interesting to ask , " What was the process by which he was led to these results ? " The answer to such a question is always curious , and not unfrequently instructive . To detect and bring out the processes through which the individual mind has been led ,  --  to trace the workings of one or more master-principles of error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult task , is still not without its reward . In the present instance , the inquiry possesses more than usual interest . We see not here the movements of an individual , but also those of the public mind . We trace not the capricious windings of a streamlet , that has made its little channel for itself , but we mark the movement of a mighty stream , that has cut its way across the ordinary landmarks of opinion , and made the traces of its course both wide and deep , and seen from afar . Mr. Parker is not a solitary student , nor a recluse philosopher . He is known to the public as connected with an important movement among a distinguished sect of religionists . He is not alone . Though he may stand by himself , in the length to which he has pushed his speculations and the boldness with which he has avowed them , he is but one of many in the same school of philosophizing . Hence when he came before the public , he found listeners and admirers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only , as we are well advised , because as in the other Athens they would hear the last new thing , but because he struck , strong and sure , a chord of sympathy that was waiting to be played upon . Whence this preparation ? How happened it , that he was thus heard and admired ? How has it come to pass , that at this moment there are in New England hundreds and it may be thousands of minds who have gone far in the same directionwho , it may be , know not what to think and believe , but who yet , as far as they do think and believe , hold* with Mr. Parker in his conclusions ? These are questions which it is wise and profitable to think of . They are questions which we can not but attempt to answer , not , as we believe , with reference to the interests of any party or sect , but to gather profitable conclusions in respect to the interests of science , religion , and the social welfare . With many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , he is a Unitarian , and that is enough . " Those to whom the word Unitarian is a synonym for every thing that is bad , and Unitarianism is the fermenting chaos from which proceed " all monstrous , all prodigious things , " will not care to know the principles from which these results have grown , nor the processes by which they have issued forth . Such are not all , such are not any of our readers . At all events , we write for none such . // We care not to deserve the odium of adding reproach to a name by a name ; or of fastening upon a set of men the errors or caprices of one who happens to be found in their ranks . Besides , we have always found it a somewhat difficult matter to discover what Unitarianism s . We shrink from hastily associating any result with a cause so indefinite and vague , as alike unphilosophical and dishonest . Our concern is with principles , and with principles alone . Without farther preamble , we propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modes of thinking peculiar to liberal Christians , which have led to these conclusions by an obvious tendency ? We use the term liberal Christians rather than Unitarians because it is preferred by themselves , and because the principles which we propose to discuss , though they involve , do not directly concern the doctrine of the Trinity , or of the divinity of our Lord . Here we may be met by the plea , What do you mean hy the tendency to such conclusions as Mr. Parker 's ? Surely you must be aware that the mass of liberal Christians reject these conclusions with abhorrence . It is bad enough to condemn men for what they avow , without adding the reproach of constructive heresy . ' To this we reply , the inferences which are involved in principles , or which may be logically derived from them , are those to which they tend . These are always fair subjects of discussion . Nay , often they are the most important tests by which their truth or falsehood , their harm or usefulness , are most obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all to which they are entitled from their own avowals in respect to such inferences , if the inferences are logically made and truthfully derived , they illustrate the principles of their system . Those principles , also , which do not logically tend to given conclusions , but which practically justify them as indifferent or harmless , may be tested by their consequences . One word more of preamble , and we will proceed . The principles which we discuss , we suppose to be peculiarly and distinctively those held by liberal Christians , if they have any such . But we do not suppose that they are held by none beside . Some or all of them are held by those without their ranks , and they are the same principles wherever they are held , whether they are corrected and held back by others of better influence , or carried fearlessly out to all their legitimate conclusions . On the other hand , they are not the principles of all who are called liberal Christians . We know that some hold the contrary views with earnestness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are found in their ranks . First of all we notice the fundamental principle of liberal Christians , of opposition to creeds . In a few words it is this : No man and no number of men can be so certain in regard to any religious doctrine , as rightfully to hold their views of it as essential to orthodoxy . ' For themselves they may be entirely confident that God has revealed it to man , but for others , they have no right to make it the basis of Christian fellowship , or hold it essential to the Gospel . In accordance with these principles , they call themselves liberal Christians . They reject creeds both written and spoken , in form and substance of doctrine , as tests of piety or of soundness in the faith . In every form they regard them as invasions upon the right of private judgment , and the freedom of individual inquiry . On the broad basis of bondage to no creed , do they invite Christians of every name to meet in mutual charity in the name of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would // claim as distinctive and peculiar . By this would they be known as the only denomination which is truly liberal and Protestant . " Unitarians , " says Dr. Ware , " have always claimed the right of every individual to have his own creed . What they have sometimes had occasion to object to is , that any , whether an individual or a body of Christians , should insist on their creed being the creed of others , either as a title to the Christian name , or as the condition of their being admitted to the participation of any Christian privileges . " " We have now come to learn , " says Channing , " that Christianity is not a dogma , but a spirit ; that its essence is the spirit of its divine founder ; that it is of little consequence what church a maa belongs to , or what formula of doctrine he subscribes ; that nothing is important but the supreme love , choice , pursuit of moral perfection , shining forth in the life and teachings of Christ . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with feelings approaching contempt . When I bring them into contrast with the New Testament , into what insignificance do they sink . " " Christian truth is infinite . Who can think of shutPug it up in a few lines of an abstract creed ? You might as well compress the boundless atmosphere , the fire , the all-pervading light , the free winds of the universe , into separate parcels , and weigh and label them , as break up Christianity into a few propositions . Christianity is freer , more illimitable than the light or the winds . It is too mighty to be bound down by man 's puny hands It is a spirit rather than a rigid doctrine , the spirit of boundless love . Ii infinite can not he defined and measured out like a human manufacture . It can not be reduced to a system . It can not be comprehended in a set of precise ideas . It is to be felt rather than described . " Says Greenwood- " Exclusiveness is its utter aversion . Exclusive Christianity is its unspeakable wonder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an exclusive God . " If these statements mean any thing , it is this , that liberal Christians are opposed to creeds not from expediency , but from principle ; not because actual creeds may he and have been abused , which would only prove the need of those which are different ; but because they are wrong in theory . They do not reject them because they are too extended , or too metaphysical , but because they are creeds . The argument against them is not their perversion , but the principles involved in their use at all . These principles must be some or all of the followin' , . 1 . God has revealed himself so indistinctly , that no man can be so certain in regard to what he would say , as to hold his fellow man in the wrong . 2 . Man through moral deficiency is not to be trusted to interpret his will for others . 3 . Religion , or the possession of a right character , does not depend on what a man believes . 4 . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spirit of Christianity is enough , and is the most important thing to be secured . The opinions of Mr. Parker on this point are in no respect different from those of the liberal school . He has only sought to find for them a philosophical basis , in the proposition that " religion is one and the same . " lie would show that on this subject the conceptions of* men not only do differ , but must differ . He takes the somewhat indefinite language of Dr. Channing which we have quoted above , and crystallizes it into the following beautiful system , and attempts by arguments to show it true . The reason alone reveals and discerns God in his idea . This idea is inconceivable , yet seen and felt ; ineffable , yet known to all . But the conception // of God is and must be imperfect . It can never do justice to the truth . It must also continually change . With the enlargement of man 's knowledge and the elevation of his desires , so will his views of the Deity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more perfect . But however gross and debasing it may be , it will still represent the divine . " Religion in all its forms is one and the same . He that worships truly , by whatever form , worships the only God . He hears the prayer whether called Brahma , Jehovah , Pan , or Lord , or called by no name at all . " So far Mr. P. and his brethren are all one . If he had remained on the right side of historical Christianity , he would have been honored as not only truly liberal , but as having discovered a philosophical argument for the unity of all religions . But when Mr. Parker 's conceptions of the divine are so enlarged and elevated , that he discovers that Christianity in no sense depends on the facts recorded in the gospels , or on the belief that Jesus wrought miracles ,  --  when he teaches that this pertains to the transient , and has passed away , while the permanent , or its principles of absolute religion , is all that remains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be received as a Christian , they know not what to do . They are taken all aback . On the one hand , they are posed with the fact that there is a Christian teacher among them with whom the supernatural and miraculous Moses and Jesus are but the heroes of wondrous legends ; and the Bible , as a book of facts and history , is but little better than moonshine . On the other hand , they are driven to the wall , by the unquestioned fact that lie claims to preach a high and pure Christianity in its principles and spirit ; and the fact is unquestioned that his views of sin and holiness , of regeneration and spiritual influence , arc higher and better than those of many who would call him an infidel , did they dare to use a term so uncourteous . But yet to refuse him fellowship as a Christian would be to adopt a creed . Thus the religious community of Boston are agitated and brought to a stand . The question is gravely argued , and it is time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself a Christian ? " And with this inquiry the fellowship of liberal Christians is greatly moved . At last an anonymous note is addressed to Rev. Mr. Lothrop , requesting him " to define his position and opinions as to two points . First , as to the measure of faith that constitutes a man a Christian-that is , gives him a claim to the Christian name and privileges . Secondly , as to the principles of Christian liberty , What are they ? How to be applied ? " The answer of Mr. L. was given in a sermon , and is in substance as follows . He is a Christian " who receives the Gospel as historically true . " " This I conceive to be the broad and distinctive foundation of Christian faith . All who stand on this foundation I am ready to acknowledge as Christians . Let their creed be what it may , if they go to the teachings of Christ , to the New Testament as a record of facts for authority and proof to establish and sustain that creed , I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than this I am not disposed to demand ; less than this I dare not concede as sufficient . If a man merely bow to Christ as an extraordinary religious genius , whose character , though distinguished for its moral elevation and purity , was yet marked , he thinks , by some inconsistencies and imperfections , which , however , he is willing to overlook , as , considering the youth of the man , very venial errors , if he does not regard him as invested with any direct divine authority , as no more inspired than we may all be , if we will pay the price ; if this is the // extent of his faith and acknowledgments , I am not prepared to give such latitude to the appellation of Christian , so to destroy all meaning and force in it as to apply it to him . " " My brief answer to the question , what is Christian liberty ? is , it is liberty to be a Christian . It is liberty to go to the New Testament as a genuine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ , and according to the best lights of reason* history , and criticism , interpret that record , and gather and deduce from it such truths and doctrines as such interpretation seems to the individual to sustain and establish . " In these conclusions we suppose the general opinion of the denomination to be expressed . So at last liberal Christianity has a creed ; * rather short , indeed , but very good so far as it goes . In vain does Nir . Parker ask his teachers who gave them authority thus to fetter the soul of man ? In vain does he , as it were , retort upon them " You have permitted us to doubt and deny every thing beside . You have suffered us to plow , and sow , and reap , all within the enclosure , so long that it is a field outworn as a field for speculation and inquiry . XVhy stop us by this limit ? Why hinder from taking a loftier flight and rising to nobler results in reli * It will not he inferred that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies , whether clubs , debating societies , or churches ; for a late writer says on this point , " Great use has been made of the fact that no censure has ever beco passed upon Mr. Parker by any act of our whole body , or of the association of ministers to which he belongs . That this fact should have been turned to the discredit of Unitarianism by those whose difference from us in theological opinion seems to render them incapable of understanding the principles of our union , is what we were prepared to witness . " Of this we say , that the fact in the case has demonstrated the impropriety of such " principles of union . " It has enabled us and some Unitarians to understand them too well . gious speculation ? " He puts to them , as it were , the following inquiries based upon their common principles . 1 . If God has given us such a word , that a man in no sense can judge for his brother what that word contains , by what right do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has revealed himself by miracles ? 2 . If man may not be trusted to interpret this word for his brother , who committed to you the trust , of judging for me that God spoke from Sinai , or enabled Jesus to raise the dead ? 3 . If you object to creeds that they make the belief of a dogma , and not character a test , and if you yet believe me to be a good and pious man , why in this instance make belief a test , and that in a dry historical fact ; a test too , by which I may not assert the name of a Christian , and must be denied the tokens of Christian fellowship ? 4 . If a creed is not to be allowed lest the progress of man should be hindered , why do you limit that progress of free inquiry by making it essential to Christianity , to believe that Christ wrought miracles ? 5 . If the most important element in Christianity is its spirit rather than its doctrines , if its " love to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than its facts of history ; and I by your admission teach with energy and truth , the spirit and the life , why deserve not I the appellation of a Christian , when others receive it , who seem only to bow to the name of Jesus ? Their only reply to these inquiries is this . The very name Christianity shuts you out , and has always shut you out . You have religious liberty indeed , a liberty to be of what religion you please , but not liberty to call yourself a Christian . This is perfectly correct and obvious to us , but not so to Mr. Parker , who may at once retort , Who gave you liberty to define Christianity for me ? In doing it you abandon every argument urged against a creed , and used to sustain us in free inquiry . // 533 Thus might Mr. P. charge inconsistency upon his friends , in regard to that claimed as their chief peculiarity and proudest distinction . We can not see but that he drives his arguments home . Their force can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic is unbroken . The fact is , that our friends have by their incantations , raised a spirit which is too mighty for them , and they can not reverse the spell . The muttered words are still abroad in the air , and will raise new spirits , unless a new formula is invented to conjure them down . But this matter has to us no personal interest . The question concerns us only as a development and test of principles . The liberal principles of the liberal school , we regard as fully tested and carried out by Mr. P. , and found wanting . Experiinent has shown the falseness of the theory . Facts have proved the hypothesis to be hut a fine abstraction . We are not content to leave this question here . The principles on which the theory is based , are still retained , and they are too often coming up to be let entirely alone . We are aware that they are plausible . We see in them a mixture of truth with error . The first principle , respects the implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for we think that no man will hold it in so many words , as it must be held to make the theory good . **Ve reject it , we can not endure it , as casting dishonor on God , the giver of the word . To say we can have no common creed , is to say , that he has attempted to make himself known , but has not succeeded , or at least not so succeeded , that honest men can agree upon what he has said . On themes most important to man , he has professed to give light , but this light is darkness . A revelation from God to man ! What can it be , if not a revelation of principles , of truths ? How can it give light if not by truths ? How can it give instruction , if not the instruction of truths ? Let us take the lowest possible view of the Bible , consistent with its being a revelation at all . Still it must declare something or it is worthless ; and it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other language and become the property of science and literature in the form of certain principles . At least so do we think of other books , that are counted of value , and especially of permanent value ; and especially of permanent value on important subjects . Grant that the Bible is not inspired . Grant that the Old Testament is to be thrown aside as antique , and darkened by oriental and poetic phrase . Grant even that in the New , the gospels are an ordinary story of truth , and the epistles as an exposition of the system of Christ , are but as the exposition of that of Socrates or Cicero , by an intelligent disciple of either . Does it follow that it teaches nothing ? or that it teaches nothing on which men may agree ? Can we not learn , and do we not learn from the story and comments of Xenophon what Socrates taught , admitting that Xenophon is our true and only authority ? The argument against any creed , as far as it implies that the Bible is uncertain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creed . We do not say the argument against existing creeds , and on the ground that they have gone beyond the plain import of the word . The two arguments are very different things . The second principle implied , or which may be implied , is , that allowing the word to be clear and certain-it is interpreted by man weak in intellect and honesty , and therefore he may not be trusted to frame such a creed . This , to say nothing more , is inconsistent , as it comes from those who give to the reason of man so high authority , and speak in terms so flattering of the excellence of his heart . We acknowi // 534 Theodore Parker and Liberal Christianity . edge that man is ignorant and weak . We grant that his temptations at this point are great and peculiar-that the pride of intellect , and love of power , and fondness of opinion , all come up , and are potent in their influence to warp and bend the mind . There is danger that man will decide amiss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with a sectarian and superstitious fondness . Grant this , and say nothing of the power of influences to the contrary . We must yet have creeds , in fact or in form , or we can not have a Christian society . Christianity is a social concern , and a society without principles asserted and understood , is but a bag of marbles ; or a collection of sticks and stones and refuse , frozen into an icy mass . A society , to have the glow and action of life , and the energy of excited and vigorous action , must stand upon its principles. * From them must it derive its food and its inspiration . It must clearly see them . They are the law of its existence and the bond of its union . Let the risks be the greatest possible , we must encounter them . To have an earnest church , we must have a bond of union and discipline . The argument for the necessity of sects growing out of this very principle , is well stated by a writer in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of argument , which is more than implied by our friends , is that the great object of * It has always seemed strange to us that shrewd men accustomed to husiness , who would despise a hank , or insurance company , without principles and rules of action ; and jurists , who in their profession insist most strenuously on principles and facts and words to express them , with a discipline to carry them home , should love an indefinite and truthiess Christianity , and a church without rule or discipline . Surely it must be because they believe that in religion nothing is certain , or nothing is important . Christianity is character , not an assent to a dogma . Character therefore should be the sole bond of union and test of fellowship . It is in this form that liberal Christianity is fond of declaring her distinctive and peculiar liberality . We have seen how consistently she carried herself in respect to it in the case of Mr. Parker . It is spoken of by the writer we have just alluded to , in the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but claims that this principle is , and should be , the grand peculiarity of their own sect . " Now , we think , a yet more vital question is involved in our differences from the sects about us , namely , whether faith or character is the one thing needful . ' " " In the course of discussion we have penetrated beneath one after another of the forms under which a false principle has manifested its shape and bearing , ' and have now reached the principle itself ; which adopting as its symbol the scriptural phrase of justification by faith , ' uses this phrase in a sense widely different from that which was intended by Paul in his vindication of the claims of Christianity over ritual institutions . What is the ground of salvation ? Is it belief or obedience ? IDoes salvation come through the merits of Christ , ' or through righteousness which is the consequence of a hearty reception of his truth ? Is the sinner forgiven in virtue of his reliance on Christ , or in virtue of his submission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inmost , all-embracing , all-determining question of the controversy , which we are called , on behalf of a pure Gospel , and after the example of those honored men who have gone before us , to maintain with earnest and confident hearts . Never was the truth on a question of a deeper import trusted to men- Never has a question arisen in the Christian church which penetrated // farther into the very significance and worth of the Christian revelation . " " On every side the voice of instruction affirms as Christian doctrine , ( to borrow the pointed expression of another , ) that men are sinners by nature , and saints by faith . ' We maintain that it is character alone which can make men either sinners or saints , and therefore that it is character which Christianity regards as supremely important. *** Let us look at the issue . " The object of Christianity is character , not faith . Therefore character should be the only test of fellowship . " We accept the premise , but deny the conclusion . The motto of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by faith . Character is the great thing , but character is , in fact , produced by faith . It is alike a dictate of reason and the Scriptures , that a man 's belief in respect to things spiritual , will form and mould his character  --  and will change that character from wrong to right . It is revealed as distinctly , we think , that the Gospel of Christ , or certain truths in respect to Christ as a Redeemer , are so eminently fitted to transform the character of man , that they are fitly called " the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth . " These are called , by most Christians , the Gospel by eminence . They think that the Scriptures so call them . They think it therefore not merely needful for their union and moral life to have a creed , hut that these peculiar truths should be expressed in that creed , and be made prominent in it . Those who do not hold these truths , so fully and distinctly as we think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel , though they may be Christians , and as far as character is concerned satisfy the most rigid external tests , we rejoice in as 68 Christian brethren ; - we hold communion with them in prayer and praise , and the offices of Christian brotherhood . But we may not so surrender the Gospel , nor the power of the Gospel , as to lower our creed to suit the case of every supposable good man . It is better far , that such should be as they are , in respect to fellowship , than that these truths , instinct with power and life , should not hold high their place . It is only in this sense , that a good and wise man would use the very improper phrase , that " Unitarians are not Christians . " But our writer is inconsistent with himself . He himself admits that character is produced by faith . He speaks of " the righteousness which is produced by a hearty reception of his truth . " The issue between the liberals and the other sects which he makes so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , between character and faith-for both admit that character is produced by faith  --  but where lies the power of Christianity to affect character ? What is the Gospel ? Is it , or is it not , Christ as a Savior ? This is the issue that has always been made . This is the deep problem to be answered , and vain is the attempt to call things by new names . The fourth principle is , that provision must be made for human progress , and it is idle to restrict it by creeds which must soon change . On this point we will be brief . We believe in progress as truly , though not in the same sense , as do our liberal friends . As mental science advances , and the nature of man is more closely analyzed ,  --  as the laws of language are more distinctly evolved , and as the past slowly gives up the buried treasures of its history , so do we believe that progress will be made in theology and biblical interpretation . For this reason should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simple , free from the terms of science , and in* Christ . Exam . May , 1844. // cluding nothing that is not revealed in the Scriptures as fact . But as the human heart will not change in its wants , so will not Christianity in its provisions . Nor will God change in the facts of his government , any more than the face of nature , in her perpetual revolutions back upon herself . In respect to both , science may hring out and understand the laws of God 's acting in nature and in his moral king . dom . The language of science must form and change itself continually . But the facts by which the laws show themselves will change in neither ; nor will the language of common life that describes these facts . Hence the language of the Bible speaks to the heart of man now just as truly and just as forcibly , as when David uttered it forth to express the life of his own soul . Hence the New Testament does but complete the aspirations of the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never change . These we would embody in a creed . The truths of scientific theology may and will change . These we would neither petrify nor embalm . The last principle is this . The most important element of Christianity , is its spirit as shown in the life of its author . This is more important than its facts of history , and its facts of truth . This should he insisted on and nothing beside . ' We acknowledge the power of the life of Christ . To the man who believes nothing and is certain of nothing , whether in respect to the facts or the truths of the Bible , we know how to present it with power , and urge it home with the force of present obligation . We acknowledge the influence of that life in changing man . We rejoice in all the good fruit which it produces , even where his teachings and the import of his death are imperfectly understood . We hail his spirit as a badge of Christian brotherhood . But that life is best understood in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelations , is only fully set forth , as we see Christ die , and know for what he dies . It is a common saying , that we can know no man 's life till we have seen him die . How true is this of the life of Christ . But this is not all . Christianity as we shall yet show , rightly understood , is more than a spirit and a set of principles . It is a manifested God . It is facts that are in the highest and holiest sense symbols , while yet they would signify nothing , were they not also facts . These facts we can not sever from our creed , and yet think that we retain that which is peculiarly Christianity . We pass to another feature of liberal Christianity , in its view of the nature of religion . What is piety ? Who is a religious man ? These questions , we need not say , are in the highest sense fundamental and vital . How are they answered in the school in which Mr. Parker has learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . In another , very imperfectly and ill . In the pages of its best writers , we often meet with just descriptions of religious emotions , and glowing portraitures of a truly religious life . The good man Lives before us in the meek and earnest discharge of the duties he owes to his fellow ; and in a devout and humble spirit toward God . In the dealings of life he is just , in its benevolence generous , in prosperity he is meek and sober , in adversity resigned , in sickness patient , in death peaceful . These portraitures are often true and beautiful . They are useful and inspiring . So far as they give us the truly good man , we complain not that they are untrue to the life . The only defect which we see , is , that they have a cast too poetic and ethereal , to answer to living men and women . But when the good man is ana // 537 lyzed , which is too rarely attempted , and the elements which combine in this result are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperfection . The religious man is well enough described ; but what is it that makes a man good ? What is it by which he may be known to himself and others to be religious ? This may be so vaguely told , that no one is the wiser ; or so delusively expressed , that sad and fatal errors are sure to follow . It is here , that accurate views are demanded . It is here that defects and mistakes are possible and too easy . It is no difficult matter to know what a Christian ought to be , and to tell what a true Christian in the ideal is . Any man who has an honest conscience and an open eye , can do it . But to separate and analyze this character into its essential elements , to lay open and clearly say what is the vital element of all-what the thing is , which being present , the character is good , and which being absent , it is defective ; this is not so often done . The religious man is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his connection with man . He is governed by one commanding principle , the moral as supreme , or the principle of duty which acts itself out in the relations which bind him to each . The religious and moral can not he dis . connected . They are never apart , and they can not be opposed . It is one great principle which makes the religious to be moral , and the moral to be religious . It must be a commanding principle , the supreme thins with the man . Now the gre at defect of the liberal school is this , that their religion is not moral , and their morality is not religious . It is a defect in their principles-their theory . We do not say , that when they describe a religious man , they do not represent him as governed by the law of duty-nor again , that when they conceive of him as under the law of duty , they do not make him religious . But we do say , that when they reason about religion and morality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the defect of the liberal school is , that their religion is not moral . We mean not strongly and distinctively so . We know that none insist more earnestly than they , on a good life , and on the vanity of all religious pretension without it . We can imagine the serene smile which would play across the classic features of some of our Cambridge friends at so strange a charge . And yet we believe it strictly and strongly true . Religion in their view is a sentiment . Man is by nature religious . He has aspirations that connect him with the Deity ,  --  that are ethereal and divine . These capacities to feel religious obligation , and to exercise religious emotion , which make him a being capable of religion , they take as indications that he is a religious being , in the sense of fulfilling these capacities , so as to secure the favor of God . These capacities show themselves in all men . In every man who looks away to God , there springs up an instinctive awe , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he turns to that in the Most High which is fitted to call out each emotion . In some men these emotions are vivid and strong . In other men they are dim and weak . In all men they have a measure of strength and force , else would they not be capable of religion at all . The sensualist may have his better moments . He may pause from groveling pleasures to reflect on their unsatisfying nature , and to feel a conscious thirst for those which are higher and holier . If his temperament be warm , and his nature attuned to the finest issues , he may rise to lofty heights of no feigned emotion , and in his heaving bosom and glowing soul , nature // may utter her thirst for God . The ambitious man may stop in his hot career , he disgusted at his low and earthly aims , and in his own nobler aspirations read that he was made for a higher destiny . Even the worldling , shriveled and care-worn , may relax from his stern pursuit of gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bending , and grin with a ghastly smile , as he clutches at the golden crown and tender , and pure , and noble , awake and live in their hearts . All men have a sense of religion , which must show itself out in some mode of worship , or form of religious observance . All men have seasons of relenting , in which they will acknowledge the evil of which they are guilty , even though it be to prepare for a new convulsion which leads them with a more tremendous energy to the same indulgence . All men have some moments for prayer , even though prayer and blasphemies roll in quick succession from their tongues . Now it is a truth vital to all right distinctions , that these emotions of themselves are not religious , till duty to God becomes the law of the man , and a supreme and hearty reverence for the will of God is the reigning principle in his entire being . Then is it , that all these right emotions have scope and room enough to expand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soul . The passions that might take their place , or oppose their kindly influence , the *elflsh and malign , the dark and debasing , these are repressed and driven back to their dens to starve and die . Then it is , that the peace of the man is attained , and the prevailing current of right affections sets with a steady but peaceful swell toward the haven of his rest . The raging billows are stilled , that were raised by angry and conflicting tides , - " which now have quite forgot to rave , While birds of calm it brooding on the charmed wave . " This is peace , even " the peace of God which passeth all understanding . " Without this substratum of duty , mere emotions , however ardent and strong , as tests of character , are worthless , while in point of quality they want body , distinctness , satisfaction and permanency . They are vague , flashing , intoxicating and fleeting . But , penetrated and fed by this nobler life , they assume the better form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feelings without principle , that with proper qualifications , the change of the affections proves a change of the man . He is born anew . Now what we assert is this : that the distinction between the religious sentiments , as instinctive , natural and involuntary , and the same emotions , when controlled by duty , and so made virtuous and moral , is not asserted as it should be by liberal Christians . Many do not seem to insist on the existence of any feeling , certainly not on any strong feeling toward God , as a token of religion ; as if a man could be right in character toward such a being as his Father in heaven , and yet have no feeling ; and as if the want of such feeling , did not show him wholly wrong . More , however , are satisfied if there be emotion , and forsooth because nature will flash out a little from amid her embers that smother the divine , and show for what she was made , therefore man 's nature is religious . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its uses assert it , they do not assert and use it , as a prime principle which makes its mark , in their views of practical religion . They are indeed most largehearted and liberal ; so liberal , as to overlook the distinction between animal and necessary sentiment , and spiritual and virtuous emotion ; so liberal , as not to care for the difference // between a being capable of worship , and a being who knows the exalted rapture of actual worship . Hence if a man now and then shows some tokens of his higher nature , he is religious , for do you not see , he has religious feeling . If he respects religion , the charitable construction is that he reveres his God , and if his better moods are oft recurring , though with no powerful influence on his life , the religious element is largely developed . Hence religion of every kind is but the various language in which the same God is worshiped , and the same religious nature is uttered , and in its varied forms , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xviii out with her tendencies , though perverted , dishonored and abused , but the delightful variety under which she shows the same holy aspirations . In the same way , the morality of the liberal Christian is not religious . If there be a God , the relations which bind us to God are the most commanding of our nature . The emotions which lift us to him , surpass all the others in their right to be supreme . They must penetrate every other feeling . They must command and give a character to every other principle . Hence is it an instinct of nature , that duty to man must have a higher reference to the will of God , and that , unless this animates the whole life of our social morality , it must lack the most important element that can make it truly virtuous . Or in other words , it is alike the dictate of reason and revelation , that whatever we do , should be done to the glory of God . We do not see this distinction insisted on as we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see it urged home with the force and searching analysis which is due a distinction so important . A failure here is one most vital . It is in effect a failure everywhere . A vagueness and forcelessness here , will corrupt and destroy . We have no complaints here to urge against their views of social and external morality . Those which might suggest themselves to our thoughts , it falls not within our scope to name . We give them the highest praise for the estimate in which they hold the graceful amenities and the sweeter charities of social intercourse . We give them the highest praise for insisting on kindness to all , as the only spirit which a Christian should cherish ; courtesy , as the only external robe which he should wear ; and good works , as the only results that should follow in the path in which he treads . We admire the high spirit of honor , the delicate sense of propriety , the stern commercial integrity , which are fostered and exhibited by so many who are trained under the influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the vulgar gentility of mere wealth , which are diffused through many-not all-of its social circles ; the truthfulness to nature , in manners and in taste ; the high appreciation of intellectual and moral institutions ; the public spirit which so lavishly provides for them ; and , above all , the strict and careful conscientiousness which trains and moulds many an esteemed and honored friend , are virtues of no mean value , and are not the chance growth of nature . They show culture ; intellectual , social , moral , of the high . est order . But these in themselves are not religion , and , unless penetrated and animated by duty to God , are robbed of a soul that should animate so worthy a frame , and spoiled by wanting the highest life . We honor and admire these virtues . We would like to send hither to school many among ours* ives who profess to glow with reli *ious feeling , to learn how to act outthat feeling in its most appropriate and becoming manifestations . But , much as we admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Much as there is which fascinates us in man so cultivated , when we think of man so cultivated as he is , or would be , when elevated and subdued , when fired yet chastened by right views of God and spiritual things , we grieve that the highest life should not glow in so fair a form . It is a form " So coldly sweet , so deadly fair , We start , for soul is wanting there . " We repeat , then , that in our view , the great difficulty with their theory is , that their religion is not moral , and their morality is not religious . From this view do they fetch their strongest arguments against a mistaken and traditional notion of what others hold in respect to the character of man . Let them correct their own theory of the nature of religion , and they would find it easy to believe all that is worth believing , under the name of total depravity . We contend , at this point , that if the doctrines taught by liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that vague something , called liberal Christianity , were the exactest transcript of the truth , the failure to specify the character which the truth should form in man , and to do it by the sharpest analysis , would expose it to the gravest objections . Christian truth is of prime value , because it hears upon the destinies of man , and shapes and forms his character . The character which Christianity is fitted to form , must then be accurately conceived of and forcibly described , or how can we know what is the work which it has to do , or when it has done its work ? If our theory he here at fault or vaguely declared , it will lead to the grossest practical error . If it mistake sentiment for piety , and call a superficial social morality true religious principle , it can not but be sadly deficient . This error pervades the system of Mr. Parker . It is the basis of his argument . Give him this , and his system is complete , and his ar gument is conclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have given him his hold on himself , in framing that argument . Nothing but the feeling that those held it for whom he wrote , could have made him bold to utter the argument when framed . His argument is , that where there is worship there is religion . How totally does he fail to see what is required to make that worship moral ! how totally does he fail to understand that the kind of religion must have a tremendous influence in the morality of him who believes it , and that , of course , religion may be to man the brightest of the messengers of heaven , or the blackest of all the deputies of hell We turn to another point in which Mr. Parker is at one with the liberal school ; that is , the moral government of God . It is true they have here no formally established principles to which all subscribe . They give assent to no form of words . They own allegiance to no distinguished writer as their authorized expounder of the principles of God 's moral administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first truths , on which they fall back , are too often appealed to , or taken as granted , not to be distinctly known . They have diffused a spirit and style of reasoning . They have founded a school which speaks its own peculiarities . Its principles are uttered in a single phrase . Law is the opposite of love . He who governs by law can not govern by love . The one is stern , morose and tyrannical . It speaks by authority which is always forbidding . It constrains by wrath and reward . Its spirit is mercenary and slavish . It may be needed for untutored and barbarous men , whose dispositions are mercenary and debased , and whose natures are savage and perverse . Hence was God forced to reveal himself in a dispensation of law to the barbarous Jews , or rather // was forced to say that he did . But as soon as human nature was lifted to a higher point , he laid aside these terrors forever , and is now revealed as a Father . We know that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God ; that they argue from laws in nature to laws in morals ; that they insist , that as the one are enforced hy pain and disease , so will the other work out the pain and disease that is worse ,  --  the pain and disease of the soul . On this they reason beautifully and with force , though it is a too common fault to make nature more amiable than she is , and to soften the sternness of her moral movements , and the terror of their actual retribution . " This system , " says Mr. Parker , " allows no ultimate evil as a background of God , believes in no vindictive punishment . The woes of sin are hut its antidote . Suffering comes from wrong-doing , as we Il-being from virtue . If there be suffering in the next world , it is , as in this , hut the medicine of the sick soul . " They do not believe in a government properly so called . They do not hold that the eternal Creator must he a reigning Jehovah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of holiness , with all the energy which he has as a living person ; that to do this , he must threaten and punish sin , and command and reward holiness , and that only as he is and does all this , can he h& a God of love . They see not and feel not , at least they do not reason as if they saw and felt , the grandeur of the position which such a Being occupies in a universe of moral beings , free to stand and free to fall , to whom holiness is health , and life , and bliss , and sin is a living death . To him is entrusted their weal or woe , as he shall hold them fast in bonds of reverential yet joyful goodness , or as prcsuming on his careless good nature , they shall curse their own souls with the fatal indulgence , and open the sluices that shall flood them with internal fire . What a curse to such a universe were an easy and indulgent Jehovah ,  --  the Eternal , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and vice and subjective misery , hut who had no favor of his own to add , whose smile should he heaven , and no displeasure , whose frown should he hell ! What a fiend were a Jehovah capable of adding these powerful influences , who should yet withhold them , and thus give leave to a flood of subjective vice , compared with which the sufferings of those who would cast themselves upon his uttered curse , would he as nothing ! Would that the malignant character that is involved in the common conception of a God of love were fully developed . Would that the " reign of terror " that is implied , hy certain consequence , in such a moral administration , were fully realized . Then would men understand better the highest meaning of the often used but never threadworn sentiment , " Of law there can he no less acknowledged , than that her seat is the bosom of God , her voice the harmony of the world ; all things in heaven and earth do her homage. , the very least as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empted from her power . " It is easy to say that the spirit of such a system is slavish , that the grasp of law throttles the life of all generous affection , that it puts the strangling cord on the free course of spontaneous love and honor , and thus drives out of the universe the highest form of virtue . Love , it is said , to he worthy to he given or taken , must he free . He that drives me to my duty , can not have the best homage of a generous heart . Such is the influence of unhappy associations , produced by those of God 's ambassadors who have sadly mis-represented his will , that it is hard to reason against them . And yet we know that the son who gives an // earthly parent the manly tribute of filial confidence , and the daughter , who , in her maiden bloom , pours out of gushing fountains her ardent love , we know that neither of these love their father less , because they are sure that the eye which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with holiest indign ation against a treacherous son or a shameless daughter . Do not they rejoice in him the more , because they know and feel him to be such ? Their affection is more free , their love more generous , because they consent to such a guardianship as their own defense , and rejoice in it as the noblest trait that their father wears . It is more generous , because it is the homage of intelligent and consenting principle , and not the mere flash of animal sentiment , which is one moment all tenderness , and the next may be as cold or faithless . It is easy to call this influence selfish and mercenary ,  --  easy to attach to law in heaven the associations of being formal , clumsy and abstract , associations taken from the workings of law on earth . This can not be other than superficial , and it takes its hue and influence from those who administer it , and they are cunning and heartless men . But law on earth , sometimes , nay , often , rises to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human judgment not rarely beams with the awful radiance which is reflected from the throne of the Eternal . But this our liberal friends do not see . They reason as if it were not true , and the most fundamental of all truths . Hence their misconceptions , their false reasonings , their forceless and vague appeals , in respect to the retributions of the eternal state . They fill their minds with horrid fright , at the flames of hell ! kindled by the wrath of God ! They conjure up hideous visions of howling fiends , with ghastly and wailing spirits , and having filled the picture with all these heartrending accompaniments , they tell us that this is the hell of the Calvinist . They ask if a good being could build or threaten such a prison as that . They forget that it is not its inflicted pains , in all their variety of terror , that give it its meaning or its force ; but that it is , that they are the awful and expressive symbol of God displeased with sin . Their meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feelings of God against a thing so evil . They forget too , that there are two greater evils , even than that a God should punish , or rather two involved in one-the first , that God should not act himself out as displeased with sin , and the second , that sin should burst the mount of terror in which it is pent up by his hand , and desolate all that is fair and holy by its waves of rolling fire . Hence their reasonings in respect to those representations of God in the Scriptures , which make him command and threaten , and reward and punish . The stern and awful voice of God as he thunders upon Sinai , is no revelation of the living Jehovah , as he announces the eternal principles of his moral dominion , but the necessary and painful " Theophany , " of God as an oriental despot , to keep the Jews in order . The destruction of the cities of the plain is no perpetual symbol of Jehovah , in his strange work of punishment , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these times may have milder views of punishment , for God is " a Father . " How strange and inconsistent and evasive the reasoning , with which they soften and dilute and explain the earnest words of a reigning God . How strangely do they forget , that the mild and merciful Savior , spake familiarly of the worm that does not die , and the fire that is not quenched ,  --  that the lips which spake such words of winning mer // cy , as no mortal ever heard beside , could utter reproof and terror too , such as no mortal would choose to encounter . But most of all does this primal and pervading error , unfit them to understand the scene , around which is gathered our highest interest in God as revealed to man , and which we are taught , is to be the theme of the songs of heaven . Those who see not that God should reiga as a sovereign , or he can he no God of love , can not understand why Christ should die , that God may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as executed , see no love , see only a thirst for blood , a vindictive and cruel spirit , in the demand that God as forgiving , should not be untrue to God as reigning . They who see love only in that kindness which is alike easy with the evil and the good , feel neither the need , the nature , nor the reality of that work of atonement , in which reigning and forgiving love both mingle with an interest so sweet and awful , and the heart of the sinner is softened while he also fears the God who so forgives . We trace the influence of this error on a point so important , in every part of the liberal scheme . It robs it of earnestness . It strips it of its power over the conscience . It makes it untrue to man 's highest instincts ; to his most solemn and most honest fears . Shall we go farther and say all that we fear ? It is this *ro* *psii*5o* - this fatal misconception of love as opposed to law-assumed as true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgence ; and made plausible by clear but shallow reasonings , which has done no little mischief to the social welfare . They who oppose love to law in things divine , can not but do the same in the affairs of men . If it be wrong for God to punish , surely it must be wrong for man . The theologians who reason away the strong expressions by which God reveals himself as a sovereign and a judge , need not be surprised , if others take their arguments and use them to reason down the strong demands of man for human government . It is true , that the plain and obvious necessity for law here , exerts a strong conservative influence against mere abstractions . The interests of the purse , will hold a long siege against the artillery of words . Yet such is the charm of consistency , and such the power of principles , supported by ingenious reasoning , enforced by artful eloquence , and appealing to debauched desire , that it would be no surprising thing , if those theologians who have denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced to see and feel in scenes of horror which their own spells have raised , the need of a strong government on earth . It would be no surprising thing , if those who have refused to render deserved homage to law , as she sits upon the eternal throne , should see their error in her stern refusal to give them needed protection from violence and misrule . Stranger things have happened , than that God should find it needful to cure the relaxing influence of a false theology , by letting out on man its legitimate results ; in law dethroned and anarchy let loose . We more than suspect the influence of this style of reasoning in this regard . We fear it , as a sure though subtle poison , which slowly works in the body of human society , to macerate its bones , and leave in their place a weak and contemptible substitute , which can give it neither strength nor beauty . We trace to its influence the prevailing opposition to law as in any sense penal  --  the sentimentality that sympathizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sins  --  the disposition to fa // ther every crime upon the neglect or bad formation of society , ( the only sense of responsibility known to cut-throats and sentimental viilains , ) - and that depravation of moral and manly sentiment which will enact , but dares not execute wholesome law . This view of the government of God is closely connected with another , no less fundamental in respect to the character and guilt of man . He who lightly estimates the binding force of the sovereignty of the universe , will think but little of the sin which slights or scorns it . Lie who limits the extent of its requirements , must limit also the bounds of actual sin . It is by the length of the law , that we measure our deficiencies . It is by the earnestness of the law , that we know their damning ill desert . Let us see how the liberal Christian looks at man . What are his views of the law which measures his duty ? What of the heart , which it will have , or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly the truth , that in all his amiable impulses , his kind dispositions , and his useful deeds , there must pervade the high and commanding law of duty to God ? that without it there is wanting , not merely an important organ of a perfect being , but the life which should run through all the organs ? Does he see that this element is not present in any man as he is by nature ; and that in consequence , he is deficient and depraved in his whole being ? Does he see that as the moral is not supreme and every where present , he is wretched and guilty , let him go where he will , and be as good in other respects as he may be ? Does he measure the guilt of this perpetual sin , this constant self-murder , this sustained and voluntary depravity , as it is illustrated by being in face of the known will of the Eternal , and a living rebellion of the conscience and moral faculties against the solemn law of a reigning sovereign , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does he form a just idea of the perfection of man as he should be-of what a noble , what a glorious and godlike being man would be , in whom intellect , sensibility , and conscience , all in their finest perfections , were sustained and penetrated and enlivened , by a hearty and reverential allegiance to his lawful sovereign ? Does lie then place man as he is , by the side of man as he ought to be , and see his deficiencies and deplore his guilt ? No , he does none of these things . Now and then there is one , who reasons and preaches as if these were his views , but how blandly and coolly and amiably ; - with how little of the soul-stirring earnestness which becomes a man , who has the reasonableness of the claims of God to vindicate , and the guilty conscience of man to convict , and the soul in its deep and desperate wants , to lead to quench its thirst in the living God . Of these even , how few are they , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amiably do they judge of man . His high and noble aspirations , and his warm and active sympathies are appealed to , to demonstrate that he is a being not greatly fallen . As if these all , did not by their brightness flash a more fearful light on his ruin , by showing the end for which he was made ! As if they did not make the guilt more inexcusable , that can pervert capacities so exalted and sin against motives so affecting ! But the liberal teacher counts the good deeds of men and counts his evil ones , and finding even in a very bad man the balance in his favor , he can demonstrate by arithmetic that men can not be very sinful . As if the argument , that overlooks the character which the external acts out , must not of course be superficial and baseless ; and the // reasoning which if it proves any thing , would prove the greatest of criminals to be fit for heaven , did not prove itself worthless . The danger of man is far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is but little occasion for fear on the part of man . In a moral universe in which there is no law , there can be no rebellion , with its desperate hardihood and certain ruin . If man be a sinner , it is not so very great a thing  --  and then he has so many fine emotions and generous traits , that it is not a serious matter to spoil them all by treason to the Eternal . But God is a Father . As if an earthly father could be pleased with a son who is generous and noble to others , who should be any thing but generous or noble to himself . These imperfect views of God as holy , and of man as a sinner , by a necessary consequence , involve imperfect or false ideas of what is required for man 's recovery . If man will but repent , God has nothing to do but to pardon him . He has no law to vindicateno relations to his moral universe to make good . As man is not in character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be summoned to immediate repentance . As he does not reluctantly delay , there is no need of constraining influence to make him willing . His regeneration is an elevation of his higher sentiments , by appropriate culture , not their renewal by a turning of the man to God . As there is no disorder and depravity in all his being , there is no law of sin within his members to call for new resistance , and new strength from on high . In this school , has Mr. Parker been trained . These principles describe his views of the government of God , and of the wants of men . They have beca with him unquestioned principles , his admitted prem ises in all his reasonings , the truths on which he has fallen back as not to be debated . In all his writings , they are the principles , which he uses as first and familiar truths . " But what have these views to do with his conclusions ? What part do they bear in the argument for or against the historic truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve the charge , of having trained him to results abhorrent to their feelings , by giving him these views of the government of God ? " We shall see . To our mind , right views of the government of God and the guilt and wants of man , are the glory and power of the Christian system . With the facts furnished by revelation as adapted to these wants , they are the system itself . But right views concerning God and ourselves , are indispensable , to lead us to feel the worth of this revelation , as clearly uttering the instincts of nature and the monitions of conscience , and as furnishing to man a grand and wondrous remedy for his wants as a sinner condemned and lost . It is these truths , as living and powerful principles , as facts which are instinct with energy divine , that we value and believe in . These are to us Christianity , as having fitness in them when fully believed , to renew and change the man . It is the reception of them as truths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not consent to a dogma , or a traditional form of words , as our liberal friends so confidently affirm . It is not the preference of one creed to another , except as it better brings out these living realities . It is as the Bible utters these truths and meets these wants , that we love it and believe it . We do not care for the simple fact , that God has spoken by one man or another , or performed miracles by a hundred in ages past . What is that to us ? By itself it is a dry and naked fact , with no higher interest // than any other fact . But when we know what he has said by this or that prophet , and what he has confirmed by this or that wondrous work , we start up , and listen , and believe . It is the import of the Bible , that makes the argument concerning its truth or inspi. ration to be of any consequence , and in establishing these facts , forms a weighty and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant in the conscience , can all be urged without determining the question concerning the inspiration of a given part or even of any part of the Scriptures , and even without debating it . If there be a reigning God , man may be called upon to yield to him and love him , and in that view of the solemnities of a future state , even thoucvh the Bible be a lie . He may be urged to do this , because his conscience tells him he is bound to do it , and to do it without delay , and to do it , whether the Bible be inspired or not inspired , whether it be true or false . These duties are facts . The truths which make them binding live in man 's bosom . His conscience witnesses to their reality . So too , man may be summoned at once to be like the Lord Jesus Christ in spirit and in life ; and he knows he ought to be such a man , whether Jesus be divine or human only ; or even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glorious myth or an amplified legend . So true are these truths , and so self-evident to man . Nor is this all . It is of far higher consequence , that we should know nright what the truth is , than that in itself , we should know that the Bible is from God . Certainly it is of far higher consequence , that we know God and ourselves aright , than that we should be right in respect to the book through which these truths have wrought their saving work on man . If we could sever the one thing from the other , it would be worse to err , as Mr. Parker does , upon these principles in respect to God and man , than to err as he does , in respect to the Book which claims to be God 's revelation . We make these remarks to show how important it is , that we come to the argument in respect to the Bible , with right views on points so essential in making out the argument . If our views be wrong respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument will be slighted because it is of little consequence , and the argument fails in the most important element that will prove it true . XVith the liberal scheme of God and man , it is of little consequence whether or not the Bible be historically true-whether its miracles be wonders wrought by the hand of God , or wonders magnified by the eye of man . It is a matter of interest as a theme of speculative inquiry and of historic probability ; but it does not come home to the heart and hopes of man . Christianity is a scheme of philosophy . It reveals God as a Father . It makes known a future life . It sets before us the example of Christ . We have these principles . Of what great consequence is it how we have attained them ? If God is a Father , we know it . Of what great import is it , that we know precisely the way in which this truth was made known ? So too if we believe in a future life and take Christ as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks so or so , of the way in which the world has learned them ? We have got possession of them-they are incorporated into the mind of the race . We will lay the Bible on the shelf , or take it down now and then to speculate about its origin and history , as curious men debate whether one or twenty men composed the Iliad . How easy to go from this view of the importance of the argument // ment , into the conelusions of Par . ker , Strauss , and Heuvel ! But take the other view of the matter . God is holy , and man is a sinner . I know that there is a holy God ,  --  a future life of retribution . I am a sinner , condemned and lost . Can God forgive ? How shall man be just with God ? Wherewithal shall I come before God ? Does he care for me still ? May I trust myself to his mercy ? Is there a way by which I can be forgiven ? Is there help , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give me new strength ? How important these questions ! How interesting the argument as to the fact whether God has cast light upon them ! How overwhelming the conclusion , that he prepared the way to answer them by the slow and patient training of the world for the full revelation of himself as a pardoning God ! Hoxv intense the interest that gathers around the life and death of the Word , who was made flesh to bring us to God ! How important that we come to right conclusions in respect to the book which continues to ansxver these questions , as the soul feels new doubts , and the conscience is laden with new fears ! Is it true ? Is it reliable ? Does God speak in it ? Are its facts glorious realities , or are they but splendid fictions , built upon a meagre basis of truth ? Are its wonders the power of God , or did all the wonder about them lie in the credulous weakness of those who thought they saw them ? It is impossible that a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it as an indifferent thing how it is decided . This leads us insensibly to the influence of these different views on the argument itself . A man with the liberal scheme concerning God 's government and man 's necessities , with very low views of God 's earnestness and man 's wants , will at once see , that it is hardly reasonable to think that God would take all this pains about man , especially so many times over , as the Bible speaks of , simply to bring out two or three doctrines , of his paternal character and a future life . If he believes that he would perform one miracle , he can not believe that he would go through so lonc , a succession of mi* racles for so small an object , when fewer would answer the purpose . He accordingly is incredulous about the greater part of the story . He explains it away as far as possible , or rejects the whole as unreasonable . He believes that men are more likely to be imposed on , or tell a falsehood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is contrary to all experience that such wonders should have happened , but it is not contrary to all experience that men should be deceived or lie . This is the old sophism of Hume , and it is just as much alive now with the naturalists and neologists of Germany and England , as though it had not been said to be exploded . The fact is , it is true , if there is not a fit occasion for God to intervene , and a sufficient reason why he should work a wonder , it is true that it is far more reasonable to believe that men should be deceived , than that the miracle should have been wrought . Now the liberal scheme furnishes no such necessity . There is not a sufficient reason , in the character of God or the wants of man , and hence shrewd men will be slow to believe all this story of wonders . Now and then a consistent and thorough-going thinker , like Prof. Norton , will persuade himself that man can know nothing about God or a future state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so he will create a sufficient reason , by turning man in his moral nature to a mere negation . But even his sufficient reason is not large and broad enough to serve as a basis for the whole Bible , and so he rejects all the miraculous in it , except the fact that Moses and Jesus did work // some wonders . The other school , who exalt man , as did Dr. Channing , turn out a consistent thinker , like Mr. Parker , who finds no need of miracles , because man is already inspired , ; and then up again comes s maxim , in the form of the last type of German neology , that the stories are only magnified legends or symbolic myths . But the reason is , there is no sufficient reason to the mind of Mr. Parker for these miracles . His views of God and man are such , that he can not believe them real ; and all this he learned at the liberal school . But take the opposite view of God 's government , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it be digested into a regular and philosophical scheme , and lie mapped out before the eye of his intellect . Let a man take it as it lives in every honest conscience ,  --  the truths which Shakspeare , Sophocles , and every other true dramatist recognizes ,  --  the truths with which Paul , in his epistle to the Romans , prepares the mind to understand and receive the Gospel . Let him with this , the just view of God and himself , open the Bible . It is a history of wonders ,  --  of God interposin* , to turn aside the onward march of nature 's eternal round , and intermeddling with the paltry affairs of obscure men and women . The world is full of such stories , none like these , it is true , in dignity , consistency , simplicity and tenderness ; but yet , if there he no sufficient object for these , these too may be held in suspicion . But about all these there is gathered the tremendous interest of God speaking to the heart of roan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reason exalts God upon a holy throne , and upholds him there , even though the whole world shall be found guilty . Conscience smites in the breast of every man , with the knockings of acknowledged guilt . Eternity lifts up her awful voice of terror . Man cries out in the agony of his mingled guilt and fear , " foxy shall I be just with God ? " Nature hangs out her signals of mingled fear and hope , by which man is now lifted up with joyful confidence that God will forgive , and anon convulsed with anguish , lest forgiveness may not he for him . From out her dark and dim recesses , she utters mysterious responses to man 's agonized inquiries as to what God will do , and how God feels . At last he cries out , Oh that God would speak out for himself ! " Oh that I knew where I might find him , that I might come " near to him , " even to his seat ! " Let God declare himself by a messenger from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made manifest . Man too is weak , as well as condemned and fearful . He is prostrate upon the earth , entangled by the knotted chains of habits long indulged , and fixed and fastened to his own ruin by pleasant bonds that are ever growing from his living self , and that are terrible because they are a part of his own soul , and grow harder and harder by time . Of himself he can not and will not rise ; and he looks up with an imploring cry , " I have destroyed myself ! Whence cometh my help ? " Here is a sujil. cient reason for God to interpose . How thoughtfully and wisely must he do it ! for he has to do with a rude , and thoughtless , and perverse family . Here is a sufficient reason for him often to interpose . He must slowly establish himself as a one and holy God , and by often repeated lessons , that startle the senses , must he spell to the childish mind , letter by letter , the mysterious and ineffable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , as a Redeemer , by the slow preparation of miraculous dealings , and by the continuance of a sacrificial system , along which runs his supernatural agency , as the silent electric fire , which is ready at any moment to start out upon those who // trifle with its laws . At last , after its dim and broken dawn , up comes the day ; the sun shines forth , and Cod is fully made known to man . Befitting wonders add their imposing presence , and attest a God revealed . The application of all this to our argument is obvious . For all these wonders there is a sufficient reason . No objection can be brought against them that they are trivial . Jiow could God work a miracle upon man and for man , that is not as trivial as man himself ? No argument can be urged that they are adapted to untutored men , and come down to the apprehensions and prejudices of an ignorant and savage race . How could God speak at all , except in the language which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds , without stooping to do it ? There is a sufficient reason for the whole , for the wonders themselves , and the manner in which they are wrought , the time , the variety , the order , and the long succession . Look at the Bible from one point of view , and it becomes an incredible story of useless miracles , or a mixture of the true and false , or a splendid but factless mythology . Look at it from another , and it justifies itself , as credible , as it is worthy of God to give , and of man to receive . The one point of view is given in the liberal school , and accordingly we see what that school thinks of the Bible , and how different men in that school think of it , according as they have higher or lower views of man and of God . The other point is furnished by the truth , and it leads to far different views of the need and of the truth of its story of wonders . We might go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , but demands that it should be received as true . We might show how nature and conscience and reason all say , that God , in these awful exigencies , and with this uncompleted plan , not only might be expected to do as much , but could not do less ,  --  not only that we might think it natural that he should work these wonders for such a cause , but that he was bound to reveal himself so that man would hear . We might show that , in consequence , he who , from this point of view , rejects the story , may well tremble lest he sin as did they who put dishonor on works wrought by the finger of God , and received the terrible rebuke of the Son of God . We review our argument , to answer a possible objection ; an objection which has been entirely shut off by the principles already advanced , but which it may be well to answer in form . " You have said , " it might be urged , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or its views of God and man ; that you prefer a disbelief of the Bible as true or inspired , with a belief of these principles if it were a thing to be supposed , to a belief of a history of the Bible , with a rejection of this as its scheme of moral truths . Why then make the belief of the history a thing of consequence ? Why not be content that its principles should be received ? " This is our answer ,  --  the answer already given . This system of principles demands a revelation of God in facts . It requires and justifies actual miracles and a history of living realities . Take the principles , as far as we have them without fact . A holy God reigns over sinning man . Man is condemned , and will be lost , if God is true to himself . The darkest of all mysteries hangs over the gravest of all questions , " Will God forgive ? " To answer this , we must have more than a myth or a legend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how we have got it , but it is a fact , aprovisionmade ,  --  God made manifest , as able to forgive ,  --  - God commending to us his love . The Bible is wanted to manifest God , in re // spect to certain necessities of fact . If God has not in fact made himself known , it is not the thing we need . This is not all . A Bible of symbols , the half or the whole of it , will never move man . Nothing will do it hut a Bible of fact and of truth . No voice will break up his guilty slumbers , but the voice of aa earnest God . No truth will fill him with awful terror in view of his lost condition , but truth that comes warm and direct from the soul of God , as he says , with all the earnestness of a beseeching and commanding Redeemer , " Be thou reconciled to me ! " And it is more than God speaking by words , that man needs , burning words though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick and raise the dead . It is the act , the manifested God , the revealed divinity , the word made flesh , condescending , suffering , living , dying , to sustain the throne of the Eternal , and to pardon the guilty , to reconcile the two opposing demands of divine regard-love for the law , because it blesses the universe , and love for the sinner , because he longs to save him . These must be realities , or they are powerless and worthless things . They must be facts , or they can not be symbols or truths . The Bible too , the book which records these facts , and explains and sets them home , though written by man , must have , in some sense , the seal and stamp of God , or it loses its power and force . It is not philosophy , nor the excellency of man 's wisdom , that is required ; but it is the power of God . Man is sluggish , sensual , guilty , and the book must come to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to array him before the realities of the eternal scene , and to set him face to face with a present Jehovah . Make the Bible any thing short of this , and you strip it of its power over the race . The next peculiarity of the liberal school which we notice , is their view of the Scriptures , and their habits of biblical interpretation. - These bave had no slight influence in leading Mr. Parker to his conclusions . To us , with our views of the Scriptures , with the high estimate in which we hold them , for the truths which they teach and for the manner in which they teach them , it is a problem not easily solved , to account for the ease with which he sets them aside , and the barbarous and monstrous theories which he sets up , to dispose of their supernatural origin . We find it difficult to place ourselves upon the point of view from which he looks at the Bible . But as we study some of the most approved and influential interpreters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is removed . In our view , the Bible , whether inspired or uninspired , if it is to be taken in its obvious meaning , and dealt with like any other honest and reasonable book , reveals most distinctly the truths of which we have spoken , viz. God as a sovereign and Redeemer , and man as a sinner , with whom God is earnestly dealing . These principles the liberal Christian rejects , or but half receives . To interpret the Bible , and not to find these principles , or rather to work them out of the Bible , is his task as an interpreter , and a hard and heavy task it is . For ourselves , we know not what business in any or all of the departments of learning , sacred or profane , we would not sooner undertake , than to hold the Bible of divine origin , or even in any degree reasonably consistent and honest , and yet to find in it nothing more nor less than the doctrines of the extreme form of liberal Christianity . XVe hardly dare trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with the Bible . We prefer to give Mr. Parker 's own impressions of them . " It would believe nothing not reasonable , and yet all things scriptural ; so it will not look facts in the face , and say , // This is in the Bible , but out of reason none the less . So with perfect good faith it explains away ' what is offensive . This is not in the canon . That is a false interpretation . ' To such a proficiency has this art of explaining away been carried , that the Scripture is a piece of wax in the Unitarian hand , and takes any shape . The devil is an oriental figure of speech . Paul believed in him no more than Peter Bayle ; the miraculous birth of Jesus , the ascension in the body , the stories of Abraham , Jonah , Daniel , are true as symbols , not as facts ; ' Moses and Isaiah never speak of Jesus in the law and the prophets , yet Jesus is right when he says they did ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking only of himself ; but when Simon Peter quotes that psalm , the inspired king is predicting Jesus of Nazareth ! These things are notorious facts . If the Athanasian creed , the thirty-nine articles of the English church , and the Pope 's bull Unigenitus , ' could be found in a Greek manuscript , and proved the work of an inspired ' apostle , no doubt Unitarianism would in good faith explain all these , and deny they taught the doctrine of the trinity or the fall of man . The Unitarian doctrine of inspiration-can any one tell what it is ? " - Disc. pp. 474 , 475 . This explains at least Mr. Parker 's view of the matter . This tells us how he had learned to think of the Bible , and what was the authority of the Bible , before he landed upon his last conclusion , that , rather than hold it a hook from God , and treat it so , it were better to believe it was not from God at all . This statement of his shows how slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book of sense or honesty , and how low the barrier over which it remained for him to leap , in order to believe it of no authority at all . We care not to make extended references , to illustrate this point . That we may not , however , speak altogether at random and without authority , we refer to " The Statement of Reasons , " &amp;c. , by Prof. Norton , and to his more elaborate work recently issued , " On the Genuineness of the Gospels . " The truths taught by Moses and Jesus , and which were confirmed by miracles , are described by Mr. N. as follows : " Our belief in God , then , as the Father of men , and our belief in our own immortality , truths which may well seem too vast for human comprehension , if we were left to our unassisted powers , rest on our belief that their evidence is the testimony of God , through the mission of Jesus Christ . " * * * * " The fundamental truths of religion , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in other words , involve the truth , that we shall always be subject to the moral government of God ; to that government which connects happiness with the observance of those laws that are essential to the nature of every moral being , and suffering with their transgression . Under this aspect the practical bearing of religion appears . Thus , when assured of the truths which it teaches , we know all that is necessary for our virtue or happiness . With these truths settled in our minds , we may enter without anxiety on the examination of the many and opposite opinions , true and false , which different parties among Christians have connected with their faith in Christianity . In rejecting far the greater number of them as unfounded , an enlightened and well-informed man will perceive that he is merely arriving at conclusions to which the progress of the human mind in knowledge and correct modes of thinking has been gradually conducting us . " Or , in other words , this is all that it is essential for us to know . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we consent that these truths were attested by a mission from God , we are at liberty to believe any thing or nothing , as to what is the import or how great is the authority of the rest of the Bible , or whether it is of any or no authority . In respect to these points , Christianity is in no way responsible . The early Christians , such as Peter and John , may have thought that Christ taught more than this in regard to the authority of the Old Testament and the way of acceptance with God . Yet Christ was too wise a teacher to correct these mistakes . The opinions expressed by the Apostles , beyond the merest elements of religion , or in expansion and illustration of the system of Christian truth , are but their private opinions , which deserve but little credit , considering that in his lifetime they were so often mistaken ; 1844. 551 // or , in other words , the Christian 's creed concerning the Bible is this : The gospels are genuine , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were honest , but rather weak men . Moses was a divine messenger , who wrought wonders . But we are not sure that Christ said or did all that he is reported to have said or done , only something like it . Moses did not write the Pentateuch , and no sensible man can believe that God could have given the Jews that foolish and unworthy ritual and civil law , especially as the prophets and Jesus had such hard work to lower its influence in the Jews ' esteem . ' We know it will he asserted in reply , that Mr. Parker would never have rejected the divine authority of Moses and of Jesus ,  --  which we are now to understand is what is to make a man a Christian , and save the honor of the Bible ,  --  had it not been for his strange and uncouth metaphysics . We grant it may be so . He might have been , forever and aye , as good a believer as Mr. Norton , if he had but adopted Mr. Norton 's philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a revelation . But this is not the point of objection ; but it is this , that he had been trained to believe that the Bible was not such a hook ; that nothing more could be made of it than the merest elements of religious truth ; that as to the rest , history , miracle , prophecy and doctrine , it was mistake , exaggeration and imposture . It is that a school had existed and he had been trained in it , which had lost sight of the moral glory , the divine truth , the wondrous salvation of the Bible , and had been forced to sustain their argument to do injustice to the historic truth , the convincing honesty , and the consistent beauty , that makes it so worthy of admiration and honor . Indeed , were it not for Mr. Norton 's philosophical theory , we are persuaded that , with his logical and consistent mind , he could not go so far , without going farther . He could not put upon the Bible so violent a construction as he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , he would go the whole , and land in Mr. Parker 's more consistent conclusion . " The character of ' the record is such , that I see not how any stress can be laid on particular actions attributed to Jesus . That he lived a divine life , suffered a violent death , taught and lived a most beautiful religion , this seems the great fact about which a mass of truth and error has been collected , &amp;c . Nothing could save Prof. N. from this conclusion , but his unnatural philosophy . We do not charge Mr. Norton 's views of the Bible upon all of the liberal school. * We are happy in knowing , that many hold vastly higher views of the Bible , and that the current is setting with many strongly in the direction of reverence and of faith . We believe that through all the fluctuations of opinion in the liberal school , some of their teachers have reverenced the Bible as the book of God , and in the main , supernatural and inspired . We believe also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the word is more deserving of study and reverence . If we may judge from not a few papers in the Christian Examiner , within a few past years , the Scriptures are stud- * And yet we observe that the Christian Examiner , of March , 1844 , speaks thus gingerly of what it calls , " his original and acute hut somewhat startling criticism . " " Whatever may he thought of some of his conclusions , no one who attentively reads , will have cause to coinplain that his religious feelings have been wantonly attacked , or outraged by flippant remark or sarcasm . " " Mr. Norton cuts deep , many will say too deep . Yet he plants hiiaselg as we have seen , on the great fact that God made a direct revelation of his will through Moses ; and this fact saved , the rest may bc regarded as in comparison of little consequence , " &amp;c. // ied with a deeper reverence , and criticised with higher and better principles . But we may be allowed to say of this movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible is honored rather with a determined feeling that it must be reverenced , or every thing is gone , than by an actual application of its dicta to the forming of right opinions . It is reverenced in the general rather than in the detail-reverenced in view of the beauty and the necessity too , of having some faith , and not from knowing what to believe and believing it , bccause God hath said it . As interpreters , our friends of " the believing spirit , " if they will thrust so much truth out of the Bible , still labor under the sad necessity of thrusting out much more than they wish , and of losing the Bible itself . So long as the Bible does not teach to them a scheme of law and grace  --  the one consistent with the other , and demanding for the wants of man a divine mediator and eternal spirit-so long must that violence be done to the Bible , which , when carried consistently out , will lead them to the violent conclusions of Norton and Palfrey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the more wholesale though more religious unbelief of Mr. Parker . XVhile we say this , we say also , that we by no means believe that the Bible has as yet been exhausted as a study for the critic . We are by no means insensible to the difficulties which yet remain to be disposed of  --  to the higher laws of interpretation which are yet to be developed and vindicated  --  to the superstitious reverence with which old views are adhered to , as well as to the misapplications by which parts of the Scriptures are sadly perverted . A true and consistent theory of interpretation of the Bible as from men , and of its inspiration as from God , is yet greatly wanted , while the evidence is overwhelming as to what is the Christianity which such a theory would vindicate . We have one more inquiry to make and we have done . Where learned Mr. Parker his philosophical system ? Where did he discover that man of himself might be so inspired , that his God could give him no added inspiration ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in his bosom was already revealed the truth which the Bible declares , and that Jesus is only the model and realization of what any man may become ? while as to the truths which he taught , they are but the articulated utterances of the whisperings that float in every man 's own bosom ? Mr. Norton will start up with his accustomed promptness , and reply : " Not from me-not from me . I have always taught as I do now , that man could not know God , or a future state , or his own moral nature , except as truths concerning these points are attested and confirmed by miracles , and I told the transcendental school at the outset , that if they contended that man could and did know these truths of himself , and that the evidence for the Bible rested on its correspondence with their inward testimony , upon our scheme , there would be no farther use for the Bible , and I called them to account , as having adopted the latest form of infidelity . ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last importation from the dominion of tobacco smoke , and the taking up the last extravagance that has come from the addled head of some German professor , that has done the mischief . " Thus much might Prof. Norton say . But we are not quite certain that this is a complete and satisfactory account of the matter . We have some of us heard of Dr. Channing , and have known of his influence in shaping the principles and in forming the spirit of the // liberal school . Now none of Dr. Channing 's admirers ( and we would rank ourselves among them to a certain degree ) have ever thought him a metaphysician . No man will have the audacity to affirm , that he was often guilty of a syllogism , or that the barbarous technology of the Teutonic school was greatly to his taste . But all of us know his views of man as godlike and divine , as having an unction from above , and knowing all things . We all know the relation in which he was accustomed to place man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the Bible fulfill to his wants . These views of Channing have pervaded , if indeed they have not constituted , the atmosphere of liberal Christianity . They have been as the unseen and impalpable particles which are diffused through the fluid , as the elements of future crystals . There was only wanting the fragment of some German system to serve as a nucleus , and behold they are gathered and shoot out from it at once , and we have them polished and hardened in all the beauty and symmetry of a perfect philosophic system . In this controversy , if it may not be too harsh a name to give to any discussion among our friends , both sides were right and yet both were wrong . Mr. Norton was right in contending that man was in desperate need of a revelation , and that to a revelation , the race of man owes all its definite conceptions and powerful impressions which it has had of religious truth  --  and that to miraculous messengers must we ascribe all the impulse onward which it has in fact received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding that men are godlike and divine in their capacities , that he might know God and his duty if he would . But they are both wrong in not holding that man is wilfully and wickedly blind  --  and cheerfully ignorant and depraved-that he will not read his own thoughts and face his own conscience , and that in consequence , God must call up his nobler self , and wake the truths that he " holds in unrighteousness . " Had they both but believed that the Bible taught a little more sense and definite truth , and that Paul was a little more of a philosopher , they would have found the union of their apparently opposite positions in the first chapter of the epistle to the Romans . " Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them , for God hath shewed it unto them . For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead , so that they are without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness . " And it is because man is thus guilty and thus condemned , the Apostle argues , that man needs the gospel , and a gospel in which God should be revealed as the opposite of condemning , and this gospel should be the power of God unto salvation . We have however a good word to say for the spiritual school and their controversy with Prof. Norton . That school took its shape , if not its impulse , from Schleiermacher and the writers of his school , who have exerted an influence so powerful in Germany in turning back the course of rationalism . It of course adopted some of the peculiar doctrines of the German metaphysics . These doctrines , in their extreme form , were carried to their legitimate conclusions by Mr. Parker , as had been done before by some German reasoners , who if they have no other merit , have that of fearless and logical consistency , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of opinions worked out to their consistent results . Some of the other writers , are not to be identified with Mr. Parker . They seem not to have made their first principles so rigidly metaphysical . Certainly they have not carried them out as he did . They have rather dwelt in the sphere of the practical reason , and have used the moral rather than the intellectual arguments of their school . They contended , that the highest evidence for Christianity is its adaptation to the nature and wants of man , and that this is a higher evidence than that furnished by miracles . To this , Mr. Norton was of course opposed . According to him , all that revelation has to do is to establish to man by miracles , its meagre creed . Those who like him have leisure and libraries to study out the genuineness of the word , are to satisfy themselves that there is no mistake about the fact of their occurrence , and men are to hang on their testimony , their faith in God and immortality . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the " latest form of infidelity . " Against this view , the spiritualists have prosecuted their argument with manifest ability . Their great defect is in their views of Christianity itself and of the reason why men need it . It is the defect which is seen in every party of the liberal school , and which vitiates their whole theory of religion . We have considered it under several heads . We will now sum it up in a word . It is the religion of the sentiments rather thun the religion of the conscience . On the part of God , it is an administration to the sentiments . On the part of man , it is the culture of the sentiments . Christianity as a remedial system is the recovery of the sentiments , by addressing the sentiments rather than by re-forming the moral under-work , the responsible will . The arguments to prove Christianity from God , are derived from its adaptation to purify the sentiments , rather than from its Jitness to convert and sanctify and save a sinner . It is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this school . It is this which detracts from the promise and perfection of the highest . It is this which leads all forms to reject doctrines which we think plainly revealed , because they have no moral propriety , to them . It is this which has spoiled their interpretation of the Bible , and stripped that book of its authority . It is a religionism most grateful to human nature , especially in its happiest circumstances , when refined by culture , and elevated by taste , and rejoicing in the kindly affections  --  but which wants the courage to search out the malignancy and power of the disease within and to tear off the veil , that its wishes hang on the face of truth . It reasons clearly and conclusively , but to wrong conclusions , because it is wrong in one of its premises ; because it loses sight of the element in the case . It is too easy to do this-too easy to forget that we have to do with an earnest God ; an eternity to be revealed in its tremendous issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unwelcome truth , by softening words and pleasant argumentation . But the truth we must meet , and discussions about our theories of religion , carry our thoughts to the time , when we shall know whether our theory was like fact , and the character formed by it in ourselves or others shall stand or fall . Let our liberal friends put in the element which their theory lacks . Let the moral take its pla*ce in the government of God and the wants of man ; and we are assured , that we and they can go to the Scriptures side by side , and that with the present aids of science and principles of interpretation , we can not fail of a substantial agreement in our conclu // sions , and the establishment of them with a good degree of certainty . We offer no apology for speaking thus earnestly and freely of the distinctive features of the liberal theology . It is not worth while to speak at all on themes like these , except in earnestness . Least of all is it worth while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what principles are , and what is the end to which they lead . We have sought clearly to discern , what are the distinctive principles of liberal Christianity , and what are their natural and consistent results . We have seen that in using them , Mr. Parker is a consistent and logical thinker , and has carried them to no unnatural conclusions . XVe have spoken of principles , not of men , except incidentally and by the way . We have said freely , because we think it true , that not all who are called liberal Christians , hold nothing beside liberal principles . Many , we would hope very many , hold them with larger or smaller admixtures from a better system . Many seem hardly to know what they believe . They vaguely and half believe many things , and their faith is , not that they do , but that they are ready to believe every thing that is true . Others believe in perpetual progress in faith ; which if it mean the clearer apprehension of principles , and their wider application , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these principles are not and can not be fixed and clearly known , is dishonorable to God and disastrous to man . We are not prepared to review the history of the discussions which first developed and defined liberal Christianity , and divided the Congregational churches of New England . The time has not come to write that history . It is not yet time for a man candidly to see and freely to say , wherein the Unitarians or their opponents had the advantage in the argument , or wherein either party failed to do justice to the other . But the history of the past ought and need to have but little influence on the inquiries of the present , as to what is true and rational theology . Let it be granted that orthodoxy may to some minds , seem to have been largely seasoned with a mixture of sanctimony and craft . What has this to do with the question , What is the truth ? Let it be conceded , that the honesty of its iatentions and the beauty of its pious life have been marred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some of its professors and its zealots . These faults should be laid to the want of cultivation , and to this only . Let it be allowed that it has thought too little of the gentle spirit , the kind and graceful courtesies , and the social amenities , which are the appropriate garb and ornament of true religious feeling . This does not prove that it has thought too much of the character and the heart within . Let it be conceded , that orthodoxy has seemed to utter principles offensive to the moral sense , and confounding to the reason . What does this make against the truth , as it commends itself to the conscience , and takes captive the honest mind ? Let it be conceded also that its spirit may have been harsh , bitter and uncourteous . For this , let weak and imperfect man be held responsible , not the golden treasure which they bear and defend . Let it not he denied that it has been affected with the very bad and odious disease of cant . This is a too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we observe that our liberal friends are slightly given to it , not indeed , to cant of the inelegant and unsentimental species , but to one more refined and therefore more offensive and less excusable . Let it be granted again , that liberal Christians have been judged as wilful and wicked and hopeless unbelievers , rather than // reasoned with , as those whose difficulties were understood and whose doubts were respected . What should this avail in respect to those who treat them as scholars and as men ? earnestly hut not indecently . We make these remarks , hecause we ohserve even at this day , on the part of the liberal school , a disposition loosely to group together the views of all not numbered in their ranks , under the indefinite appellation of Calvinism , and often to make the most offensive and ultra form of Calvinism , the representation of the opinions of all hut themselves . They argue against and concerning it , as though we could hold nothing heside . Against it they direct all their artillery , as though it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of straw for theological striplings to shoot at . Or if they notice the fact , that these views are not held in precisely this form , they take it as an indication that there are some who are becoming liberal , and they condescendingly express the hope , that as their minds are enlarged hy additional culture and knowledge of the world , they will he ushered into the full glory of the liberal faith . Thus all those called orthodox are grouped hy them , as holding offensive and unreasonable dogmas on the one hand , and those who are hecoming " liberal " on the other . Now this may he a very convenient way of fostering an intensely sectarian spirit . It may cherish the feelings of prejudice and contempt toward all beside themselves , and give them a very flattering sense of their own superiority in all that elevates and dignifies man . " The orthodox " too may have furnished some very bad examples of this way of doing things , hut it is none the better for that , nor more excusable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We say it in all frankness , but we have observed in our friends a provincial not to say a narrow spirit , in their estimate of the other Christian sects , as well as a failure to appreciate the precise position of things in these denominations . Whether it is hecause Boston has so much literature , philosophy , and theology of its own , that it self-complacently thinks it has no occasion to look heyond its immediate circle , to satisfy all its wants , or whether because it lies so far away to the east , and is so often enveloped by its own fogs -- or whether their peculiar position of the liberal Christian with respect to the great forces of Protestantism , disinclines them from studying them closely  --  or whether it is , that it is more convenient to despise them ; whatever may be the cause , it has seemed to us to he a fact , that they have a little too much self.compla* cency to be exactly courteous , or betray it in ways too obvious to he altogether modest . We concede to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds of generous culture and intellectual acuteness and refinement ; but we are quite certain that their claims on this score would secure greater consideration , if they did not talk so freely of other denominations as altogether in the dark , and of themselves as dwelling so nearly in the centre of all light , both actual and possible . We have sometimes heard them bewail over Connecticut , as destitute of the blessings of liberal Christianity , in terms so doleful , that we could not but smile , and pray in the stanza of Burns : " Oh wad some power the giftie gie us , To see oursels as others see us , " and this not more for our own benefit than for theirs , that they might know how they appeared to a dweller in this land so dark with Calvinism . Connecticut men are duly and humbly sensible , we presume , of their bearings and distance from " the city of notions ; " but yet when they look at themselves " in the absolute , " they may be pardoned in // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of liberal and rational interpretation , and perhaps not of the methods of a sound philosophy . It is only when they hear reports of themselves from Boston , as the valley of of the shadow of death , over which broods the darkness of Calvinism and the stern rigor of religious dogmatism , that they suspect the sadness of their condition- They are not particularly sensitive however for themselves . They are somewhat so for their respected friends at the east . They would therefore respectfully entreat them , for their good name in Connecticut , that they would not be too hasty in crediting or heralding the reported progress of the liberal faith within her borders , lest perchance it may happen , that some miserable abortion from inflated ignorance , folly , and irreligion , may assume the name of liberal , to shine by its borrowed lustre-and the saying shall be brought to pass , that what smells rankly at home , becomes a perfume when scented from a distance . We speak with all due submission , but we can not but think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of the orthodox , and occasionally to read their Bibles from their point of view , to see how it would sound , when read with other views of God and of man . But whatever liberal Christians may think or say of the other sects , we are free to say of them , that , in their present position , they waken within us thoughts and feelings too many and too strong readily to be expressed . We can not think of them as inheriting and upholding so many of the religious and social institutions founded by their and our honored sires of the Pilgrim stock , without caring for them for the fathers ' sake . We honor for its own , a religious communion that embraces so much that is noble in cultivated intellect ; so much that is high and honorable in its noble spirit ; so much that is enlarged and generous in its social feelings . But we can not think , without painful feelings , of the many thoughtful minds within its enclosure , so earnestly engaged on themes so awful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so uncertain , so contradictory to each other , and so surprising to us . We withhold not the expression of our interest in Mr , Parker and those who sympathize with him in his audacious and fantastic conclusions . Their errors are the errors of noble minds . Their conclusions are the exaggerated or distorted perversions of lofty and important truths . Their aims seem to be in a degree religiously intended . They would elevate man to a high morality , make religion as perpetual as his being , and enrich him with high hopes concerning his existence and his destiny . Nor do we refuse a measure of honor to those of the other extreme in opinion . It is true we reject their entire scheme of religious philosophy , in the warp and woof , as untrue to reason , conscience and fact , with respect to man and God . We are struck dumb at the cool precision and intellectual hardihood with which they march it through the Bible , and make it bend or break to their service . We are astonished that their literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher and heartier praise , - that its miracles of truth and piety , and its greater miracles of sublime conceptions of God and eternity , awaken no more glowing enthusiasm , even if its miracles of history and fact must be scanned with so cool and determined a scepticism . But we give even to these , as reasoners , the praise of caution , acuteness , discrimination and logic . There is a still larger class than either of these , who have little sympathy with such extremes of opinion , and rather dwell apart from all discussion of doctrines as injurious or unprofitable . To these let all // honor be given , for elevated taste , for devotional sensibilities , and gentleness of disposition . We would not rudely assail their cherished convictions , or depreciate their acknowledged virtues . And yet , that their opinions should be so uncertain and shifting , that their tests of religious character should be so doubtfully and cautiously expressed , that such vagueness and impotence should pertain to all their views and doings on a subject which , if any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly that there is something greatly in the wrong . We acknowledge that they think and speak seriously of the power of an endless life ,  --  that the shadows of the unseen world seem to rest upon their spirits with an oppressive and saddening gloom . It seems to us that none have views of eternity and retribution so melancholy as they ; and all because they have not the energy to look them in the face , and go with whole-hearted confidence to Him " who bath brought life and immortality to light . " By seeming to shun a bold and earnest converse with death , and a stern probing to the bottom of man 's wants , they dwell in an obscure and unknown dread . We are not insensible to the warm affection and grateful tenderness with which they think of Jesus ,  --  that he is honored with no affected homage , and enshrined in their hearts by the sacredness of holy affections . But it would be weak in us , and unchristian , ever to be satisfied , till they shall see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their present interest in Christ shall be no more remembered , as it expands and kindles into the rapture and grateful praise which inspire the songs of the redeemed in heaven . But most of all do we think and speak with freedom of those who have openly expressed their dissatisfaction with the present condition of things , and ask for fife and en Vol . II . 71 ergy and zeal , in language not to be mistaken , and with an earnestness which is not to be suspected . We wait for the issue of their movement with some solicitude . We believe that they are earnest men . We trust that they are free and liberal thinkers ,  --  so free , that while they will boldly bring out from the Scriptures all which they teach , though it may seem strange and new ; so also none will be rejected because it is old and common , if it commends itself to the conscience and wants of man . And inasmuch as we believe that the gospel , as a system of truth and fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man are very obvious , we are content to see them candidly and earnestly discuss the Bible and the wants of men , the more earnestly if it be but fairly , the better . We only fear that the truth as truth will not be discussed enough , and its importance in the promotion of life will not be esteemed as it should be . We therefore add , that no zeal awakened because there must be life ; no properties or perfection in the manner of worship ; no wisdom gathered by piecemeal , as shreds and patches from the other sects ; no social devices or reformations ; no esprit du corps ; no fervent or pungent appeals from lay or clerical lips , can of themselves give life . Nothing but clear , grand , overwhelming views of truth concerning God and eternity , received as real , and with the whole-souled simplicity of a little child , has ever truly wakened the soul of man , or created life neath ribs of death . Nothing but energy imparted from the living and holy One , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We may never forget that " Religion is no philosophy of life , but a life or living process , " and that this comes not by speculating how it is to come , and trying one experiment after another , but by awaking to the world of truth about and within us.
