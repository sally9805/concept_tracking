txt struck on one cheek to present the other , and enjoining , on pain of the highest penalties , the forgiveness of offenders . They declare that drunkards and fornicators shall not enter heaven . They frown on pride and exalt humility ; and not only do they discountenance debt , but command the rich , as stewards of God , to give liberally to the poor . How many of the two Houses assent to these rules of life ? How many exhibit a practical subjection to their authority ? The morals of the Gospel , no less than its doctrines , have ever been folly to the world . Is it this " folly " which the majority of both Houses uphold ? But if the Legislature does not intend to promulgate evangelical doctrine , or to enforce Christian morality by its maintenance of the Union , they must have some other ends in view ; and it becomes Christians to consider seriously what they are . Let them , however , be what they will , the composition of the State is such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime and an absurdity . It is vain to argue that Governments ought , by all means in their power , to advance the cause of Christ . This may be very true , and yet their episcopate remain unscriptural , absurd , and mischievous . It is the duty of each member of Parliament , of each peer , of each minister of the Crown , and of the sovereign , to be a consistent Christian . Each ruler of the country is bound to acknowledge his guilt and ruin as a sinner who could only be saved by redemption /z/ through the blood of the Son of God , to trust wholly in the merit and mediation of Christ for pardon , for holiness , and for heaven . Rank , wealth , and power , only increase the obligation upon any one to obey the will of God declared in the bible , to set a Christian example , to be a member of a Christian church , to govern his family by Christian rules , to train up his children in the fear of God , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote Christian missions among the heathen , to aid the diffusion of evangelical instruction at home by liberal contributions , and in all other ways to honour religion . Each member of Parliament is no less bound to make the law of God the exclusive rule of his public conduct . Each public measure should be considered with reference to the divine will ; each vote should be given in the fear of God ; and every legislator is called to avow that he is governed in all things by the authority of Christ . Whoever neglects these duties is misusing the gifts of God , and must give account to his Maker for that misuse . The same principles should obviously govern the united action of all the members of the State . They must legislate and govern in the fear of God , according to scripture , for the glory of God and the good of the nation . Hence their laws must be neither antiChristian nor immoral , neither unjust nor oppressive : they ought to discourage all profanity and ungod- /z/ liness among themselves ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , sailors , and policemen , opportunities and means of religious improvement ; they should abolish all class legislation , create no unjust monopolies , protect the weak from oppression , ameliorate by all means in their power the condition of the poor , remove all artificial checks upon industry , make all the subjects equal in the eye of the law , admit as many as possible to all the privileges of the constitution , and generally make the happiness of all the object of their constant efforts . They are further called to protect Christians in their worship , to allow no public hindrance to the preaching of the Gospel , to secure the safety of Christian missionaries throughout the empire , to elevate the condition of the aborigines of our colonies , to be upright and fair in their diplomacy , to condemn and to abstain from war , and to aid rather than hinder the prosperity of other nations . Finally , while discharging these Christian duties , they no less owe it to their Lord and Redeemer to leave his churches free from ah 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impose no tax on the reluctant for the purposes of religion , and to use no coercion whatever of their subjects in any religious matters . Thus if the State were wholly Christian , it ought to abolish its Union with the churches . But is it Christian ? How many members of Parliament profess to trust wholly in Christ for their salvation from /z/ hell , and , therefore , make his word their exclusive rule of conduct ? If the majority are without this faith , they are unchristian and ungodly ; and the Union between the Church and State is the Union between the churches of Christ and a body of unconverted men it is the Union of the church with the world ; and since all who are not with Christ are against him , it is the union of his friends with his enemies . The effect of the Union does not depend upon what the State ought to be , but upon what it is ; and to advocate the Union because the State is bound to be evangelical , is the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustee of a property because he is bound to be honest ; or that the Lord 's Supper should be administered to a drunken profligate because he is bound to be virtuous and sober . The advocates of the Union constantly argue not from what the State is , but from what it ought to be ; and infer most erroneously the effect of the Union of the churches with the actual State from what they suppose would be the effect of their Union with the Utopian State . The actual State is irreligious , and the churches are bound to dissolve their Union with it . /z/ SECTION II . Tfie Union is condemned by the Parental Relation . Mr. Gladstone , as well as other advocates of the Union , has much insisted on the analogy between the nation and the family , between the functions of the State and those of the parent . 1 Hence , he adds , " I argue that the State when rightly constituted is eminently competent , by intrinsic as well as extrinsic attributes , to lead and to solicit the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , but yet real , of an instructor , and even of a parent . " 2 Bishop Wilson adds , " Though an Establishment is not essential to Christianity itself , it is essential to every Christian Government which desires to discharge its highest obligations towards the people committed to its care . A connexion between Christianity and the rulers of a Christian country is imperiously required to fulfil the duty of the PARENT OF THE STATE to his vast family . " 3 The doctrine grounded on this analogy is that , as a parent must provide Christian instruction for his family , so the State must provide Christian instruction for the nation . Both the analogy and the doctrine founded upon it are false . The State being composed of Queen , Lords , and Commons , among which three estates the House of 1 The State in its Relations , &c.; vol. i. pp. 72-76 , 85. z Ib. p. 282. /z/ Commons has now so much influence that its decided and permanent judgment determines ultimately every public question , we must consider that House as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if the House of Commons is the parent of the nation , the difference between the father of the nation and the father of the family is so considerable as to make their respective duties exceedingly distinct . 1 . Children being placed under the authority of their parents through their weakness and ignorance , without any choice of their own , the control of them by their father is natural and unavoidable ; but the House of Commons is chosen by the electors of the empire , and is , therefore , an elective father , an adopted parent , raised to that dignity by his adopting children , to whom alone he owes his position and his power . 2 . The father of the family has a permanent , and , within certain limits , an irresponsible control , so that he can determine the education of his children from infancy to manhood . But the national father is elected by his children , on certain terms and for certain ends , can claim no more power than they are pleased to concede , is responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced by them to resign it at the end of seven years , because they are afraid that he would assume too much authority ; and all his decisions may be revoked by the next elected /z/ national father , whose views may be totally opposed to his own . Since , then , the circumstances of the parent are so different from those of the State , it is obviously unsafe to argue from the duties of the one to the functions of the other ; but just so far as there is an analogy between them , that analogy condemns the control of the Church by the State as absurd : for when the children of any family grow up to manhood , they are invariably emancipated from parental control in matters of religion . What parent would think of dictating to his son at the age of thirty , the creed which he should profess , or the minister whom he should attend ? What son at that age would submit to such dictation ? At that epoch the authority of the father in religious matters has expired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious conduct , and can permit no one to interpose between his Maker and him . The son is then become religiously independent ; and all attempts to impose on him a creed or a religious teacher would be usurpation . The obligation of the parent to teach the children arising solely from their need of divine truth , from their incapacity to judge for themselves , the reason of this dictation ceases as soon as their faculties are mature , and from that time it would be criminal in them to permit its exercise . Not less imbecile and culpable is it in a nation to allow the State to dictate its creed : for the nation is /z/ full-grown . There have been times when a Government might with some plausibility assume towards a nation the tone of a parent to a child : but why should this nation be treated as a child now ? Myriads of men in this country can think for themselves on religion as well as the 658 members of the House of Commons can think for them . In every free nation the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself : and in this country every day makes it more manifest , that the members of the House of Commons are not pedagogues , but representatives of men , among whom are many who are as able as themselves to investigate every question both of politics and morals : and if the nation is composed of men , Parliament should cease to treat them as children . Indeed , in no other question are they treated as children . The State does not determine for us our lawyer , physician , or tradesman ; why should it appoint our pastor ? Why select for its dictation precisely the matter in which it is the least competent to dictate , and in which its blunders are the most injurious ? When the parent chooses the pastor for his children , he chooses also their physician and their tradesman ; if the State will play the parent with men , let it nominate our physicians and our tradesmen no less than our ministers . Either treat us wholly as children , or wholly as men . When a parent relinquishes all control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to /z/ manhood , he may yet be wiser than they , and is certainly more experienced . But what religious wisdom and experience has this elected national father who retains the control over the churches of Christ ? Here , in truth , the analogy between the relation of the State to the churches and the relation of the parent to his children is wholly reversed . In the churches of Christ is collected all the religious wisdom of the country : in the House of Commons there is little religious wisdom . If in political knowledge Parliament may resemble the parent and the nation be like the child , in spiritual knowledge Parliament is like the child while the churches have the wisdom of the parent : and to intrust Parliament with the creed , laws , and discipline of the churches , is to intrust the control of the parent to the child . But this is not the whole of the absurdity involved in the State episcopate . As no one can teach what he does not know , or will inculcate what he does not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . On the contrary , some ungodly parents have been known so systematically to vitiate the minds of their children , that the Court of Chancery has on this ground taken from them the custody of their own sons . The State is under the same incapacity . If the House of Commons be the national father , it is a father so irreligious , that the children should be withdrawn from his control . Six hundred members of Parliament , with no more religion than six hundred men taken at /z/ hazard from any city or town of Great Britain , whose theological opinions , including Romanism , HighChurchism , Socinianism , and a thousand other varieties , make up a perfect chaos of irreconcilable contradictions , are not entitled to control the creed and discipline of 12,000 Christian churches . To complete this view of the absurdity of the Union , we must add that , while the father of a family controls the education of his children because he pays for it , the members of the two Houses of Parliament , instead of paying themselves for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for it , distraining on the property of all who refuse to pay : just as if an ignorant and ungodly parent should force his children , when grown up to manhood , to receive a bad tutor from him , and should beat and fine them if they would not build a lecture-room , and pay the tutor 's salary themselves . It is astonishing that Mr. Gladstone and Bishop Wilson can build so lofty a fabric on a foundation so rotten ! SECTION III . The Union condemned by History . No truth is more prominent in the New Testament than that we are saved by faith in our Redeemer. 1 But faith , according to the doctrine of the 1 John , i. 12 ; iii . 14-16 , 36 ; Mark , xvi . 15 , 16 ; Acts , xiii . 39 ; xvi . 31 ; Rom. iii . 19-28 ; Gal . ii . 15 , 16 ; iii . 9 , 26 ; Eph.ii. 8 , &c.; &c.; &c.; /z/ same book , is not genuine , unless it leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , therefore , Christ required from all his disciples that they should openly confess him by baptism ; which , becoming the test of a true faith , was therefore connected with the remission of sins . 2 Thus , as the Lord Jesus Christ came into the world to bear witness to the truth , though it cost him his life , 3 so his disciples must bear witness to it . Since his doctrine has been preached men can no longer receive the creed of their fathers or of their country without investigation ; but each one is bound to search after truth , to receive it , to maintain it , and to promulgate it in the world , in opposition to all error , however venerable or popular . Our Lord predicted that this novel exercise of conscience in matters of religion , this independent inquiry and resolute profession , would disturb society every where to its very foundations . " Think not that I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send peace but a sword . For I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law : and a mans foes shall be they of his own household* . . . And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name 's sake . " 5 /z/ The Christian principle of individual inquiry , belief , and profession , was exactly the opposite of the pagan principle of unexamining conformity . The Gospel made conscience every thing , declaring , " Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind . . . Whatsoever is not of faith is sin . " Heathenism made it nothing . According to the Gospel , every one was bound to reject the religion of his country if false according to heathenism , every one was to conform to the religion of his country in all things . Christianity invited men to form a voluntary society , upon conviction as men ; heathenism herded them , by law , as animals , within the enclosure of a national ritual . The Greek legislators , wishing to secure for the republic the greatest military force by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the popular superstition . A man who disbelieved the power of fictitious and corrupt deities was thought to be a bad citizen , and was as such condemned . Draco punished dissent with death ; Plato would have it denounced to the magistrates as a crime ; Aristotle allowed but one established worship ; and Socrates was sentenced to death as a nonconformist . In the Greek republics the Union between the State and the religion was so complete that the rights of conscience were wholly disregarded . Men did not inquire what was true , but what was politic . The republic must /z/ be a great unity for attack or defence , and the religious independence which would break that unity must be exterminated . 1 Heathen princes had yet more powerful motives than republican magistrates to unite themselves strictly with the priesthood . Despotic rulers have ever sought to extort from their subjects all possible advantages for themselves , and for this end to retain them in the most complete servitude . They have chiefly depended on their armies ; but the fears and the hopes excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be largely employed . Wellpaid soldiers have been their first instrument of power ; their second has been a well-paid priesthood . Priests have lent to despots , in aid of their selfish designs , the portents and the predictions of superstition ; and despots have , in return , invested the superstition with splendour , and punished nonconformity with death . Heathenism presented no obstacle to this Union . The superstition being a corrupt invention offered nothing which was disagreeable to corrupt rulers ; and the vices of rulers were not uncongenial to an equally corrupt priesthood . Nebuchadnezzar exalted himself when he compelled his subjects of every creed to bow down to his golden idol ; Belshazzar , amidst his revels , felt no objection to " praise the gods of gold and silver ; " and it seemed to Darius excellent policy to establish a royal /z/ statute that no prayers should be offered to any god but himself for thirty days . 1 The infamous Tarquin could , without any inconvenient restraint upon his passions , build temples to Jupiter ; Caligula and Nero felt no remorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supreme pontiffs ; and , on the other hand , the Brahmins of India found nothing in their Vedas and Purannas which made them blush at the vices and the tyranny of the rajahs by whom they were enriched . By the aid of the superstition the despot fortified his tyranny , and by the aid of the despotism the priest gave currency to his falsehoods . Thus the Union of the State and the priesthood was an alliance of force and fraud . Neither party was strong enough to rule alone . But when the priest preached for the despot , and the despot governed for the priest , both the more easily kept their feet upon the necks of the people ; and made the universal degradation subservient to their greatness . When the churches began to be corrupted by the increasing wealth of their ministers , this pagan Union of the State with the priesthood was extended to them ; and emperors with the Christian name sought the aid of a corrupt Christian priesthood , as heathen emperors had sought the aid of augurs and of heathen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , can scarcely be supposed to have done so from religious feeling . The progress of /z/ Christianity had been very considerable . If , before this reign , the Christians did not amount to more than onetwentieth part of the population , as asserted by Gibbon , 1 still this number of avowed Christians , at a time when the profession of faith in Christ exposed them to martyrdom , indicates that a much larger number were secretly convinced of its truth . Licinius , the rival of Constantino , could not , by his heathen zeal , raise any popular enthusiasm in his support ; and if we had no other proof of the numerical extension of professed believers , we may infer it with certainty from the recorded habits of the clergy . " During the third century , " says Mosheim , " the bishops assumed in many places a princely authority ; they appropriated to their evangelical function the splendid ensigns of imperial majesty . A throne surrounded with ministers exalted above his equals the servant of the meek and humble Jesus ; and sumptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an ignorant veneration for their arrogated authority . The example of the bishops was ambitiously imitated by the presbyters , who , neglecting the sacred duties of their station , advanced themselves to the indolence and delicacy of an effeminate and luxurious life . The deacons beholding the presbyters deserting thus their functions boldly usurped their rights ; and the effects of a corrupt ambition were spread through every rank of the sacred order . " 2 /z/ The splendour and ambition of the clergy manifest clearly that the Christians were become a powerful body , whom Constantine would desire to attach to his cause , and their number renders it very probable that policy was the earliest ground of his Christian profession . " His conduct to the Christians was strictly in accordance with his interests ; and it is very probable that the protection with which he distinguished them may , in the first instance , have originated in his policy . " 1 But if it began in policy , political considerations would still more powerfully urge him to continue it . He had learned , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that neither himself nor the empire could enjoy a fixed state of tranquillity as long as the ancient superstitions subsisted ; and , therefore , from this period , he openly opposed the sacred rights of paganism as a religion detrimental to the interests of the State . 2 On the other hand , it is too plain that he was an irreligious man . It was in the year 313 that he published the edict of Milan , by which he proclaimed universal toleration , and secured to the Christians their civil and religious rights . 3 But , in the year 325 , he ordered his rival , Licinius , to be strangled ; 4 and the same year in which he convened the Council of Nice was polluted by the execution , or rather murder , of his eldest son . 5 1 Waddington , " History of the Church , " p. 79. 2 Mosheim , cent . iv . part i. chap . 1 , sect. 10. 3 Waddington , p. 77. 4 Mosheim , ut supra. /z/ " It is not disputed that his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition : and the general propriety of his moral conduct can not with any justice be maintained . " 1 After his conversion to Christianity he still continued , as supreme pontiff , to be the head of the religion of heathen Rome , and thus continued to be invested with more absolute authority over the religion he had deserted than over that which he professed. 2 But , as he had been the head of the heathen priesthood , it seemed to him right that he should make himself equally the head of the Christian priesthood . He , therefore , assumed a supreme jurisdiction over the clergy . 3 One of the earliest objects of his policy was to diminish the independence of the Church . For which purpose he received it into strict alliance with the State ; and combined in his own person the highest ecclesiastical with the highest civil authority . 4 The entire control of the external administration of the Church he assumed to himself . He regulated every thing respecting its outward discipline ; the final decision of religious controversies was subjected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council could be called except by his authority . 5 Though he permitted the Church to remain a body- /z/ politic distinct from that of the State , yet he assumed to himself the supreme power over this sacred body , and the right of modelling and of governing it in such a manner as should be most conducive to the public good . 1 Thus he exercised at once a supremacy over the heathen and the Christian priesthoods . He was the chief pontiff of heathenism , and the chief bishop of the Christian church . And this State episcopate he exercised many years before he was baptised , and long before he was a member of the church he was its summus episcopus , and only a few days before his death received from Eusebius , bishop of Nicomedia , the ceremony of baptism . 2 The consequence of this Union between an irreligious prince and the clergy , who were already much corrupted , was lamentable . At the conclusion of this century there remained no more than a mere shadow of the ancient government of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presbyters and people were usurped by the bishops ; and many of the rights which had been formerly vested in the Universal Church were transferred to the emperors and to subordinate magistrates . 3 The additions made by the emperors and others to the wealth , honours , and advantages of the clergy , were followed with a proportionable augmentation of vices and luxury , particularly amongst those of that sacred order /z/ who lived in great and opulent cities . The bishops , on the one hand , contended with each other in the most scandalous manner concerning the extent of their respective jurisdiction ; while , on the other , they trampled upon the rights of the people , violated the privileges of the inferior ministers , and emulated , in their conduct and in their manner of living , the arrogance , voluptuousness , and luxury of magistrates and princes . This pernicious example was soon followed by the several ecclesiastical orders . The presbyters , in many places , assumed an equality with the bishops in point of rank and authority . We find also many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 An enormous train of superstitions were gradually substituted for genuine piety . Frequent pilgrimages were undertaken to Palestine and to the tombs of martyrs . Absurd notions and idle ceremonies multiplied every day ; dust and earth brought from Palestine were sold and bought every where at enormous prices , as the most powerful remedies against the violence of wicked spirits . Pagan processions were adopted into Christian worship , and the virtues which had formerly been ascribed by the heathen to their temples , their lustrations , and the statues of their gods , were now attributed by the baptised to their churches , their holy water , and the images of saints . 2 Rumours were spread abroad of prodigies and miracles ; robbers were converted into martyrs : many of /z/ the monks dealt in fictitious relics , and ludicrous combats with evil spirits were exhibited . " A whole volume would be requisite to contain an enumeration of the various frauds which artful knaves practised with success to delude the ignorant , when true religion was almost superseded by horrid superstition . " 1 The number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to increase that examples of real piety became extremely rare . When the terrors of persecution were dispelled , when the churches enjoyed the sweets of prosperity , when most of the bishops exhibited to their flocks the contagious examples of arrogance , luxury , effeminacy , hatred , and strife , with other vices too numerous to mention , when the inferior clergy fell into sloth and vain wranglings , and when multitudes were drawn into the profession of Christianity , not by the power of argument , but by the prospect of gain and the fear of punishment , ' then it was , indeed , no wonder that the churches were contaminated with shoals of profligates , and that the virtuous few were overwhelmed with the numbers of the wicked and licentious. 2 The age was sinking daily from one degree of corruption to another ; and the churches were thus prepared for that fatal heresy which at one time seemed to threaten the extermination of evangelical doctrine throughout Christendom . After the death of Coustantine , his son Constan- /z/ tius succeeded to the government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole empire . And as he , his empress , and his whole court , were Arians , he forthwith used all his influence , as the head of the church , to exterminate , as far as possible , evangelical doctrine ; l and the whole world groaned and wondered , says St. Jerome , to find itself Arian. 2 The tyranny of Theodosius restored the orthodoxy of the churches , but could not revive their piety ; 3 and from that time , in union with the State , they continued to be so corrupt , that at length the profligacy , covetousness , fraud , and arrogance of the clergy generally , from the pope to the obscurest monk , so revolted the conscience and the common sense of Europe , that in the sixteenth century it burst from this oppressive and degrading yoke . The nature of the relation between the potentate and the priest during this period was frequently illustrated by incidents like the following . Pepin , who was mayor of the palace to Childeric III . king of France , having formed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realm , A.D. 751 , to whom he proposed that violent measure . They voted that the bishop of Rome must be consulted : ambassadors were , therefore , sent by Pepin to demand from Pope Zachary , " Whether the divine law did not allow a warlike people to dethrone a cowardly /z/ and indolent monarch and to substitute in his place one more worthy to rule ? " Zachary 's answer was favourable ; Childeric was deposed , and Pepin ascended his throne . Pope Stephen II . confirmed the decision of Zachary , and wanting the aid of Pepin against the Lombards paid him a visit A.D. 754 , when he released him from his oath of allegiance to Childeric , anointed him , and crowned him . l But it would have been happy had the Union between the secular and the ecclesiastical powers been productive only of such occasional specimens of villany on either side ; but alas ! for many centuries before the Reformation , it universally and constantly checked the promulgation of the Gospel . Had there been no such Union in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been protected in life and property , whatever their creed might have been ; disturbers of the peace would have been repressed ; pious and enlightened men might have preached Christ to their contemporaries without molestation ; and evangelical churches , formed through their ministry , might have prevented the spiritual slavery , superstition , and demoralisation , into which the churches so generally sank . But through the Union , each student of the bible , with any energy of character , was speedily arrested by the anathemas of the priesthood ; and the State was ever ready to give those anathemas effect . It was the church which /z/ condemned Lord Cobham in England , John Huss in Bohemia , and Savonarola at Florence ; but it was the State which consumed each of them in the flames . Had there been no Union , Cobham would still have led on the Lollards to new successes ; Huss would have still lived to confirm his disciples in the faith ; and Savonarola might have reformed Italy . Devout and resolute men might have defied the malice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dungeon and the thumb-screw , the rack and the stake , at their disposal . The Union , therefore , is responsible for the religious ignorance and the general degradation of manners which disgraced the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries . When the reformers of the sixteenth centurystruggled for the doctrines of the Gospel with the hierarchy and the priesthood , the Union was still their greatest enemy . Unchecked by the Governments of Europe , the Reformation would have been nearly universal . In Scotland the reform conquered the Government ; but in England the Union mutilated the reform ; and in France , in parts of Germany , in Spain , and in Italy , overcame and crushed it . The Union alone gave teeth and claws to the two Inquisitions of Spain and Italy ; and without its aid the powerful confraternity of Loyola would have been baffled . As the Union had previously corrupted the churches , so at the Reformation it prevented their restoration to purity of discipline and to spiritual life . /z/ Since that day superstition has maintained its hateful ascendancy in Europe through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roman Catholic Germany , Spain , Portugal , and Italy , might be pervaded in every direction by zealous evangelists . On the other hand , it has not been less disastrous in Protestant countries . The reformers , who had a gigantic foe to grapple with , were too happy to secure the aid of their rulers , by investing them with almost all the prerogatives of which they despoiled the pope . Misled by the evangelical zeal of some leading statesmen , they vainly hoped that Protestant Governments would , in successive generations , heartily promote the progress of the Gospel , and consented to a Union which has been productive of endless mischief . Ever since the Union of the Church of England with its imperious and profligate head , Henry VIII. , who burned alike the friends of the pope and the followers of Zuingle , because he would not endure that men should have any other religious opinions than his own , the State in England , with scarcely the exception of one brief interval , has been steadily opposed to evangelical religion . Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal head of the Church of England , and availed herself of the supremacy with which she was invested by the Union to crush the English Reformation . Her death afforded no unmixed benefit to the /z/ y 1 d &; &**_; Protestant cause , as the reader may judge by the following extracts from Hallam 's " Constitutional History . " The two statutes enacted in the first year of Elizabeth , commonly called the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity , are the main links of the Anglican Church with the temporal constitution , and establish the subordination and dependency of the former ; the first abrogating all jurisdiction and legislative power of ecclesiastical rulers , except under authority of the Crown ; and the second prohibiting all changes of rites and discipline without the approbation of Parliament . It was the constant policy of this queen to maintain her prerogative . 1 Elizabeth , though resolute against submitting to the papal supremacy , was not so averse to ah 1 the tenets abjured by Protestants . She reproved a divine who preached against the real presence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but her great struggle with the reformers was about images , and particularly the crucifix , which she retained with lighted tapers before it in her chapel . 2 To the marriage of the clergy she retained so great an aversion , that she would never consent to repeal the statute of her sister 's reign against it . 3 Except Archbishop Parker , and Cox , bishop of Ely , all the most eminent churchmen , such as Jewel , Grindal , Sandys , Nowell , were in favour of leaving /z/ off the surplice and what were called the popish ceremonies . The queen alone was the cause of retaining those observances. 1 On refusing to wear the customary habits , Sampson , dean of Christ Chnrch , was deprived of his deanery. 2 Parker obtained from the queen a proclamation peremptorily requiring conformity in the use of the clerical vestments and other matters of discipline . The London ministers , summoned before himself and their bishop , Grindal ; were called upon for a promise to comply with the legal ceremonies , which thirty-seven out of ninety-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended from their ministry . But these , unfortunately , as was the case in ah " this reign , were the most conspicuous both for their general character and for their talent in preaching . 3 The Puritan clergy , after being excluded from their benefices , might still claim from a just Government a peaceful toleration of their particular worship . This it was vain to expect from the queen 's arbitrary spirit , the imperious humours of Parker , and that total disregard of the rights of conscience which was common to all parties in the sixteenth century . The first instance of actual punishment inflicted on Protestant dissenters was in June 1567 , when a company of more than one hundred were seized during their religious exercises at Plummers ' Hall , and fourteen or fifteen of them were sent to prison . 4 The far /z/ greater part of the benefices of the church were supplied by conformists of very doubtful sincerity , who would resume their mass-books with more alacrity than they had cast them aside . 1 Burnet says , on the authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergymen , not more than about two hundred refused to conform ; and he proceeds , " If a prince of another religion had succeeded , they had probably turned about again as nimbly as they had done before in Queen Mary 's days . " A great part of the clergy in the first part of this reign are said to have been sunk in superstition and looseness of living . 2 Such a deficiency of Protestant clergy had been experienced at the queen 's accession , that for several years it was a common practice to appoint laymen , usually mechanics , to read the service in vacant churches . 3 Yet the archbishop continued to harass the Puritan ministers , suppressing their books , silencing them in churches , persecuting them in private meetings . Plain citizens , for listening to their sermons , were dragged before the high commission and imprisoned upon any refusal to conform . 4 The clergy in several dioceses set up , with encouragement from their superiors , a certain religious exercise called prophesyings . They met at appointed times to expound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a moderator ap- /z/ pointed by the bishop . The queen entirely disliked them , and directed Parker to put them down . Prophesyings were now put down . 1 Grindal , who succeeded Parker , wished to revive them . The queen , however , insisted both that the prophesyings should be discontinued and that fewer licenses for preaching should be granted . Grindal refusing to comply with this injunction , was sequestered from the exercise of his jurisdiction for about five years ; and the queen , by circular letters to the bishops , commanded them to put an end to the prophesyings , which were never afterwards renewed . 2 As soon as Whitgift succeeded to the primacy , he promulgated articles for the observance of discipline ; one of which prohibited all preaching , reading , or catechising in private houses , whereto any not of the same family should resort . But that which excited the loudest complaints was the subscription to three points the queen 's supremacy , the lawfulness of the common prayer , and the truth of the whole thirtynine articles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom resounded with the clamour of those who were suspended or deprived of their benefices , and of their numerous abettors . But , secure of the queen 's support , Whitgift relented not a jot of his resolution . 4 In 1583 , the High Commission Court was erected , consisting of forty - four commissioners , of whom twelve /z/ were bishops , several were privy-councillors , and the rest clergymen or civilians . Power was given to any three commissioners , of whom one must be a bishop , to punish all persons absent from church , to visit and reform heresies and schisms according to law , to deprive all beneficed persons holding any doctrine contrary to the thirty-nine articles , &c.; &c.; Master of such tremendous machinery , the archbishop proceeded to tender the oath ex officio to such of the */q/ clergy as were surmised to harbour a spirit of puritanical disaffection . This procedure consisted in a series of interrogations , so comprehensive as to embrace the whole scope of clerical uniformity , yet . so precise and minute as to leave no room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer upon oath . 1 Pamphlets , chiefly anonymous , were rapidly circulated throughout the kingdom , inveighing against the prelacy . Of these libels , the most famous went under the name of Martin Mar-prelate. 2 Strong suspicions having fallen on Penry , a young Welshman , he was tried for another pamphlet containing some sharp reflections on the queen herself , and was executed . 3 Udal , a Puritan minister , fell into the grasp of the same statute for an alleged libel on the bishops . His trial , like most other political trials of the age , disgraces the name of English justice . It consisted mainly in a pitiful attempt by the court to entrap him into a confession that the im- /z/ puted libel was of his writing , as to which their proof was deficient . He avoided the snare , but was convicted , and died of the effects of confinement . 1 Cartwright , with several of his sect , were summoned before the ecclesiastical commission , where , refusing to inculpate themselves by taking the oath ex officio , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the court of wards , having attacked the legality of this oath ex officio in the House of Commons , and brought in a bill to take it away , the queen put a stop to the proceeding ; and Morice lay some time in prison for his boldness. 3 In 1593 , the court procured an act which sentenced to imprisonment any person above the age of sixteen who should forbear for the space of a month to repair to some church , until he should make such open declaration of conformity as the act appoints . Those who refused to submit to these conditions were to abjure the realm ; and if they should return without the queen 's license , to suffer death as felons. 4 Multitudes fled to Holland from the rigour of the bishops in enforcing this statute . 5 Yet , after forty years of constantly aggravated molestation of the nonconforming clergy , their numbers were become greater , their popularity more deeply rooted , their enmity to the established order more irreconcilable. 6 On the other hand , the prelates of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , had not always cause to exult in their own condition . Cecil surrounded his mansion-house at Burleigh with estates once belonging to the see of Peterborough . Hatton built his house in Holborn on the bishop of Ely 's garden ; and Cox , on making resistance to this spoliation , received the following letter from the queen : " Proud prelate , you know what you were before I made you what you are . If you do not immediately comply with my request , by God I will unfrock you ! ELIZABETH . " After his death she kept the see vacant eighteen years . 1 She suspended Fletcher , bishop of London , of her own authority , only for marrying " a fine lady and a widow ; " and Aylmer having preached too vehemently against female vanity in dress , which came home to the queen 's conscience , she told her ladies that if the bishop held more discourse on such matters she would fit him for heaven , but he should walk thither without a staff , and leave his mantle behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing the session of 1584 , when many complaints against the rulers of the church had rung in her ears , she told the bishops that if they did not amend what was wrong , she meant to depose them . 2 This sketch is sufficient to show that throughout this reign the bishops and clergy were kept by the Union in a state of servile subjection to the Crown ; /z/ that the most pious persons in the nation were exposed by it to severe persecution , and that it steadily repressed evangelical religion . The accession of James I. to the supremacy , in virtue of the Union , brought no advantage to evangelical religion . On his way to London , the Puritan clergy presented to him a petition signed by 825 ministers from twenty-five counties , praying for the removal of certain abuses from the church . 1 The Puritans seem to have flattered themselves that he would favour their sect , on the credit of some strong assertions he had occasionally made of his adherence to the Scotch kirk . James , however , was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 He showed no disposition to treat these petitioners with favour . His measures towards the nonconformist party had evidently been resolved upon before he summoned a few of their divines to the famous conference at Hampton Court . In the accounts that we read of this meeting we are alternately struck with wonder at the indecent and partial behaviour of the king , and at the abject baseness of the bishops , mixed , according to the custom of servile natures , with insolence towards their opponents . 3 While Dr. Reynolds was speaking , the king broke out into a flame , " They were aiming , " he said , " at a Scots presbytery , which agrees with monarchy as well as God and the devil . Then Jack , and Tom , and Will , and /z/ Dick , shall meet , and at their pleasures censure both me and my council ; therefore , pray stay one seven years before you demand that of me , and if then you find me pursy and fat , and my windpipe stuffed , I will , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and I am sure I shall be kept in breath ; but till you find I grow lazy , pray let that alone . Well , Doctor , have you any thing else to offer ? " " No more , if it please your majesty . " " If this be all your party have to say , I will make them conform , or I will hurry them out of this land , or else worse . " 1 Bishop Bancroft fell on his knees and said , " I protest my heart melteth for joy that Almighty God of his singular mercy has given us such a king as since Christ 's time has not been . " " Never , " said Chancellor Egerton , " have I seen the king and the priest so fully united in one person . " 2 When the king said he approved of the wisdom of the law in making the oath ex officio , the archbishop was so transported as to cry out , " Undoubtedly your majesty speaks by the special assistance of God 's Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humbly prayed that the surplice and cross might not be urged on some godly ministers in Lancashire ; but the king replied with a stern countenance , " I will have none of this arguing , therefore let them conform , and that quickly too , or they shall hear of it . " 4 The king soon afterwards put ' Neal 's " History of the Puritans , " part ii . chap . i. 3 Ibid. p. 17. /z/ forth a proclamation requiring all ecclesiastical and civil officers to do their duty by enforcing conformity . 1 He had already strictly enjoined the bishops to proceed against all the clergy who did not observe the prescribed order , a command which Bancroft , who about this time followed Whitgift in the primacy , did not wait to have repeated . 2 But the most enormous outrage on the civil rights of these men was the commitment to prison of ten among those who had presented the millenary petition ; the judges having declared in the Star-chamber that it was an offence fineable at discretion , and very near to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute power beyond the law had become current with all who sought his favour , and especially with the high-church party . 4 The real aim of the clergy in thus enormously enhancing the pretensions of the Crown was to gain its sanction and support for their own . Schemes of ecclesiastical jurisdiction , hardly less extensive than had w T armed the imagination of Becket , now floated before the eyes of Bancroft. 5 Dr. Cowell , in a law-dictionary dedicated to Bancroft , said , under the title king , " He is above the law by his absolute power , and though for the better and equal course in making laws he do admit the three estates into council , yet this , in divers learned men 's opinion , is not of constraint , but by his own benignity , or by /z/ reason of the promise made upon oath at the time of his coronation . And though at his coronation he took an oath not to alter the laws of the land , yet , this oath notwithstanding , he may alter or suspend any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 Such monstrous positions from the mouth of a man of learning , who was surmised to have been instigated , as well as patronised , by the archbishop , and of whose book the king was reported to have spoken in terms of eulogy , gave very just scandal to the House of Commons . 2 Archbishop Bancroft now revived the persecution of the Puritans by enforcing the strict observance of the festivals of the church , reviving the use of copes , surplices , caps , hoods , &c.; By these methods of severity above three hundred Puritan ministers were silenced or deprived ; some of whom were excommunicated and cast into prison , others were forced to leave the country . 3 As another mode of insulting and harassing the evangelical clergy , the king published a declaration to be read in churches permitting all lawful recreations on Sunday after divine service , such as dancing , archery , May-games , morrice-dances , and other usual sports . 4 But this declaration was not enforced till the following reign . The court of James I. was incomparably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever witnessed , equal /z/ to that of Charles II . in the laxity of female virtue , and without any sort of parallel in some other respects . Gross drunkenness is imputed to some of the ladies who acted in the court pageants. 1 According to the " Pictorial History of England , " King James had as little real religion of any kind as Elizabeth herself . In the notion of both the one and the other the Church was an engine of State , and nothing else ; and in this feeling both were naturally much more inclined towards popery than puritanism . 2 By degrees he gave himself up to all kinds of licentiousness . His language was obscene , he was a profane swearer , and would often be drunk . He broke through all the laws of the land , and was as absolute a tyrant as his want of courage would admit : and was , in the opinion of Bishop Burnet , " the scorn of his age , a mere pedant , without judgment , courage , or steadiness , his reign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To such hands did the Union commit the government of the churches of Christ in this country . It was very unfortunate for Charles I. , the next head of the church , that the chosen friend and companion of his youth was one of the most profligate men of his day . The following is the account given of his friendship by Brodie . James I. , from his immoderate attachment to field-sports , spent much /z/ of his time at Newmarket . There he went to the theatre to see a farce called " Ignoramus , " in ridicule of the common law , for which he embraced every opportunity of expressing contempt , because it limited his prerogative ; it being part of his doctrine that " the king is to settle the law of God , and his judges to interpret the law of the king . " At the theatre he saw young George Villiers , who immediately becoming his favourite , was , in a short time , created a baron , a viscount , an earl , a marquis , lord high admiral of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master of the horse ; and disposed of ah 1 the offices of the kingdom without a rival . 1 It is humiliating to think that this minion 's heels were tracked with spaniel-like observance by the chief of the church and of the nobility , who were content to be called his creatures , professing an attachment bordering on adoration . 2 It is impossible to read Heylin 's " Life of Laud " and Laud 's Diary , &c.; &c.,; without insuperable loathing . 3 As neither talents nor virtue had raised Villiers , so he had little of either , though more of the first than the last ; and as his heart was daily corrupted , so was his judgment perverted by his situation . 4 To such a height of presumption was this minion grown , that he not only used language to Charles now only to be found in the lowest class of the community , but was once very near striking /z/ him . 1 Yet , to the general astonishment , he no sooner stooped to court his highness , than he acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship could not be favourable to the morals of Charles , and he is described by Milton to have been at this period of his life flagitiis omnibus coopertum , loaded with every vice . 3 This was a bad preparation for the supreme government of the churches of Christ in this country . The next step in his history was his union with Henrietta Maria , sister of Louis XIII. , then king of France , to whom he was married by proxy before his father was buried . She arrived at Dover June 13 , 1625 , and brought with her a long train of priests , for whose devotion a chapel was fitted up in the king 's house at St. James's. 4 The queen , by degrees , obtained a plenitude of power over the king . His majesty held her in perfect adoration , and would do nothing without her . 5 The king 's match with this lady was a greater judgment to the nation than the plague , which then raged in the land : for , considering the malignity of the popish religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the share she must needs have in the education of her children , it was easy to foresee it might prove very fatal to our English prince and people , and lay in a venge- /z/ ance to future generations . 1 Thus the education of Charles for the government of the churches of Christ , which was begun by a profligate favourite , was continued by a Roman Catholic wife . The clergy whom Charles most trusted were little likely to counteract these influences . The bishops were many of them gross sycophants of Buckingham . Mede says , " I am sorry to hear they ( the bishops ) are so habituated to flattery that they seem not to know of any other duty that belongs to them . " 8 Two sermons , by Sibthorp and Main waring , excited particular attention . These men , eager for preferment , which they knew the readiest method to attain , taught that the king might take the subjects ' money at his pleasure , and that no one might refuse his demand on penalty of damnation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contribute any right to the king , but for the more equal imposing and more easy exacting of that which unto kings doth appertain by natural and original law and justice as their proper inheritance annexed to their imperial crowns from their birth . " For refusing to license Sibthorp 's sermon , Archbishop Abbot was suspended from the exercise of his jurisdiction by the king , who gave Sibthorp some preferment ; and Mainwaring , who was impeached by the House of Commons , and condemned to pay a fine of 1000/. , and to be suspended for three years from his ministry , /z/ was almost immediately pardoned by the king , and afterwards made a bishop . 1 But the person who proved in a far more eminent degree than any other individual the evil genius of this unhappy sovereign was Laud . His talents seem to have been hardly above mediocrity . There can not be a more contemptible work than his Diary . But having courted the favour of Buckingham , he rose to the see of Canterbury on Abbot 's death in 1631. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , and next of the royal prerogative , as his end and aim in every action . " Though not destitute of religion , " says Hallarn , " it was so subordinate to worldly interest , and so blended with pride , that he became an intolerant persecutor of the Puritan clergy ; and being subject , as his friends call it , to some infirmities of temper , that is , choleric , vindictive , harsh , and even cruel , to a great degree , he not only took a prominent share in the severities of the Starchamber , but , as his correspondence shows , perpetually lamented that he was restrained from going further lengths . " 3 Even at college he was suspected of popery ; to such height did he carry the pretensions of the clergy , with all the tenets of the Romish religion , except the mere supremacy of the pope . The use of images , the tutelar protection of saints and angels , the invocation of saints , the adoration of the altar , the real presence , auricular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles . 1 In 1605 he filled the office of chaplain to the earl of Devonshire , who had induced Lady Rich to desert her husband and children . In these circumstances Laud was base enough to sanction the adultery by performing for them the marriage ceremony . 2 Placed at the head of the ecclesiastical and civil government , he betrayed all the insolence of a little mind intoxicated with undeserved prosperity . He assumed the state of a prince , and by the ridiculous haughtiness of his manners disgusted men of rank and influence . 3 He aggravated the invidiousness of his situation , and gave an astonishing proof of his influence by placing Juxon , bishop of London , a creature of his own , in the greatest of all posts , that of lord high-treasurer. 3 Church affairs were an early subject of consideration in Charles 's cabinet . Bishop Laud , who in the late king 's time had delivered to the duke a little book about doctrinal puritanism , now also gave him a schedule containing the names of ecclesiastics under the letters and P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that it might be shown to the king , and preferment , of course , confined to the former . Under the Puritan party were comprehended in the court register all who refused to subscribe to every doctrinal innovation of the king and the bishops ; together with those that were known merely as de- /z/ fenders of the political rights of the people . 1 But the Puritans were doomed throughout this reign to much worse evils than the loss of preferment . Leighton , a Scotch divine , having published an angry libel against the hierarchy , was sentenced to be publicly whipped at Westminster and set in the pillory , to have one side of his nose slit , one ear cut off , and one side of his cheek branded with a hot iron ; to have the whole of this repeated the next week at Cheapside , and to suffer perpetual imprisonment in the Fleet . Lilburne , for dispersing pamphlets against the bishops , was whipped from the Fleet prison to Westminster , then set in the pillory , and treated afterwards with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a zealous Puritan , had printed a bulky volume called " Histriomastix , " full of invectives against the theatre . This was construed to be seditious , and the Star-chamber adjudged him to stand twice in the pillory , to be branded in the forehead , to lose both his ears , to pay a fine of 5000/. , and to suffer perpetual imprisonment . The dogged Puritan employed the leisure of a gaol in writing a fresh libel against the hierarchy . For this , with two other delinquents of the same class , Burton , a divine , and Bast wick , a physician , he stood again at the bar of that terrible tribunal . Prynne lost the remainder of his ears in the pillory ; and the punishment was inflicted on them all with extreme and designed cruelty ; which /z/ they endured , as martyrs always endure suffering , so heroically as to excite a deep impression of sympathy and resentment in the assembled multitude . They were sentenced to perpetual confinement in distant prisons . 1 Besides reviving the prosecutions for nonconformity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vied with their primate , he most injudiciously not to say wickedly endeavoured , by innovations of his own and by exciting alarms in the susceptible consciences of pious men , to raise up new victims whom he might oppress . Those who made any difficulties about his novel ceremonies , or who preached on the Calvinistic side , were harassed by the High Commission Court as if they had been actual schismatics . The most obnoxious of these prosecutions were for refusing to read what was called the " Book of Sports , " a proclamation that a great variety of pastimes might be used on Sundays after evening service . 2 The precise clergy refused , in general , to comply with the requisition , and were suspended or deprived in consequence . Thirty of them were excommunicated in the diocese of Norwich . 3 The resolution so evidently taken by the court to admit of no half conformity , especially after Laud had obtained an unlimited sway over the king 's mind , convinced the Puritans that England could no longer afford them an asylum . Multitudes now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank than the /z/ first colonists , now become hopeless alike of the civil and religious liberties of England , men of capacious and commanding minds , formed to be the legislators and generals of an infant republic , the wise and cautious Lord Say , the brave , open , and enthusiastic Lord Brooke , Sir Arthur Haslerig , Hampden , ashamed of a country for whose rights he had fought alone , Cromwell , panting with energies that he could neither control nor explain , and whose unconquerable fire was still wrapped in smoke to every eye but that of his kinsman Hampden , were preparing to embark for America , when Laud , for his own and his master 's curse , procured an order of council to stop their departure . 1 The Church now made rapid progress towards Romanism . Pictures were set up or repaired ; the communion-table took the name and position of an altar ; it was sometimes made of stone ; obeisances were made to it ; the ortteifix was sometimes placed upon it ; the dress of the officiating priests became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pageantry . The doctrine of a real presence , distinguishable only by vagueness of definition from that of the Church of Rome , was generally held . Montague , bishop of Chichester , went a considerable length towards admitting the invocation of saints ; prayers for the dead were vindicated by many ; in fact , there was hardly any distinctive opinion of the Church of Rome which /z/ had not its abettors among the bishops , or those who wrote under their patronage ; 1 and we now know that the views of a party in the English Church went almost to an entire dereliction of the Protestant doctrine . 2 Thus the Union during the first three reigns after the Reformation led to the systematic persecution of the most zealous servants of Christ in the country , and conducted the churches within the Establishment under the regal episcopate far back into the slough of false doctrine , superstition , bigotry , and spiritual torpor , from which the reformers had nobly struggled to extricate them . Of the two sovereigns who , ( after Charles I. , successively exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need say very little . The character of the first and the religious opinions of the second made it certain that they must employ whatever influence they derived from the Union against vital religion . The Union had perceptibly corrupted the Presbyterian and Independent churches during the reign of the Protector ; but at his death its influence upon the churches became much more disastrous . The new Government assumed power only to persecute evangelical religion . " Then came those days , never to be recalled without a blush , the days of servitude without loyalty , and sensuality without love , of dwarfish talents and gigantic vices , the paradise of /z/ cold hearts and narrow minds , the golden age of the coward , the bigot , and the slave . The king cringed to his rival that he might trample on his people ; sunk into a viceroy of Prance , and pocketed , with complacent infamy , her degrading insults and her more degrading gold . The caresses of harlots and the jests of buffoons regulated the measures of a Government which had just ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The principles of liberty were the scoff of every grinning courtier , and the anathema inaranatha of every fawning dean . In every high place worship was paid to Charles and James , Belial and Moloch ; and England propitiated those obscene and cruel idols with the blood of her best and bravest children . Crime succeeded to crime , and disgrace to disgrace , till the race accursed of God and man was a second time driven forth to wander on the face of the earth , and to be a bye-word and a shaking of the head to the nations . " 1 The results of the Union between revengeful ecclesiastics and a profligate prince during the reign of Charles II . are such as can not be learned without indignation . In England , nearly two thousand of the best ministers in the country were driven from their parishes , and then pursued with merciless severity if they dared to exercise their ministry elsewhere . Peaceable and devoted men like Alleine and Plavel filled the prisons . Men like Baxter , who were quali- /z/ fied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulted and harassed by profligates like Judge Jeffreys , who were the personification of every vice . In England , Archbishop Sheldon tore nearly two thousand godly ministers from their congregations , to be hunted by Jeffreys and other hostile magistrates like wild beasts . In Scotland , Archbishop Sharp effected the expulsion of four hundred of the best ministers from their parishes ; and then Lauderdale , with his infamous agents , Turner , Dalziel , and Bannatyne , pursued them with so much cruelty , that the country rose in arms against the Government , and the archbishop was murdered by men whom his oppressions had goaded to madness . 1 While the king was sanctioning all this profligacy by his example , and this persecution of godliness by his authority , the churches of Christ united with the State still allowed him the right to superintend their doctrine and their discipline , and continued to style him in their prayers " our religious and gracious king ! " The next head which the churches received from the Union was a keen Roman Catholic , one whose efforts both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the re-establishment of Romanism on the ruins of the Protestant faith . Thus , with the exception of Edward VI. , who died when still a boy , all the sovereigns whom the Union placed over the churches , from Henry VIII . to
