txt THE hardest problem man has to deal with , is out of many to make one . But it is a problem nature is ever gloriously resolving ; for organization , which separates by an intelligible boundary the worlds of life and death , is her great mystery and work . The formation of a mass by the aggregation of particles , ( as many rocks have been composed , each of which is a confused , cemented heap , ) is quite a different thing from the production of a plant .. In the one case , there is mere acci dental juxta-position , an accumulation of chance-gaihered materials , without any principle of arrangement ; in the other , growth from a seed , which has life within itself , involving potentially all that is afterwards unfolded . When this seed is quickened , and germination takes place , there is a process of assimilation begun , in which the plant gathers its nourishment from the earth , and air , and light , and incorporates the foreign substance with itself as a living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of growth , many organs with distinct functions appear each admirably adapted to its specific purpose , and all co-working harmoniously towards the acconplishment of the end for which all exist . The root that abstracts nutriment from the earth by its delicate fibres , the sap vessels of the stem that convey this to every part , and the leaves , with their broad surfaces , for carrying on respiration , different as they are in structure , are all necessary to the final result , the ripening of the seed . We may see a beautiful illustration of this law of organization , as well as of the lower principle of outward and mechanical arrangement , ( of which crystallization is an example , ) in the divine record of the creation . The elements of all bodies were first brought forth , as naked elements , " without form and void , " " Outrageous as a sea , dark , wasteful , wild . " But , step by step , laws were impressed on the chaotic mass , and this goodly universe rose out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its seas , its solid land , and their unsummed wealth of vegetable and animal life . Phis world of ours is just an organized chaos . And that which we see in the lower spheres of creation , is typical of the higher ; for all nature prophesies of Him who is its lord , and sets forth the more glorious mystery of His being in its manifbld symbols . Physiologists tell us that the human body is the epitome of all organized bodies , while it far surpasses them all in the number of its parts , their close relation to a common center , and the powers of its various organs . A handful of shapeless dust , as worthless as that we tread on , became , through the organizing power of the principle of life in breathed by the Creator , the solid , bony frame , the network of nerves , the circula ting blood , the beating heart , the thinking brain , and all else that belongs to this temple of an immortal spirit , within which a thousand processes are continually going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without , and bears stamped upon its countenance the intellectual image of its Maker . It is thus that nature is ever solving the problem of national unity . But we see , also , amongst the inferior animals , a law of fellowship , by which they are grouped together in tribes , organized into commonwealths , made obedient to leadersin other words , a social unity-and we look to find something analogous to this in the structure of humanity . We can imagine men in a state of isolation , each the sole occupant of a planet ; but this would not be the highest form of human life . Man , existing in separateness and solitude , could not attain that position of dignity and blessedness , which he holds when he is associated with others under laws that bring him into new relations . The planets , which make up our solar system , might have been created entirely independent of each other , each with its own motion upon its axis ; but they subserve nobler uses , now that they revolve in harmony around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them new forces , and takes nothing away . L'he sun , encircled by tributaries , to which he imparts light , and warmth , and motion , holds a higher ) lace than if banished to a point from which no ray , or influence of attraction , could ever reach any part of the creation . So , to be a father , a giver of life , a defender and guide to other beings , is a higher and more blessed thing , than to be an isolated creature , sustaining no relations to others . Nor need union with others under a law , destroy individuality by absorbing the personal element into a mass . The stones which are set in the arch lose nothing of their // distinctive qualities , but acquire powers by the combination which they had not before . They remain the same in size , and shape , and properties ; but when so placed as to realize the idea in the mind of the architect , they become a new creation . They were a heap of stones lying confusedly together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing hs span across some mighty river , and strong to sustain the pressuic of thronging multitudes , while tall ships sail securely beneath - This may illustrate the possibility of uniting mankind under laws , which , without destroying the personality of the individual , shall elevate him into a higher region of existence . Man is not like a chemical element , which , in combination , may disappear altogether ; nor like an irresponsible animal , which is subjected to laws *vholly from without , and for the sole benefit of anoiher ; but he is a person , made in the image of God , a partaker of reason , possessed of a responsible will , and thus exists , in some sort , from himself , and for himself . The problem is how to organize these personal elements , while we recognize and secure their distinctness ; or how to place men under a common system , without crushing man , and making him the particle of a mass . The law of the nation can not be understood without reference to the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature . In the union of the first pair by the act of God , the household was established ; and every one that has since been born , has been born a member of it . Each one is brought into existence , not as an individual simply , a solitary , independent element , but as a child bound in the closest relationship to two parents , and placed under their rule . Their organization is begun , through a divine law , predetermining the place and the functions of each . In the household there is no mere juxtaposition of u , but a grouping of all around a central organ , from which they receive law and blessing . This was the beginning of the building up of society , and from this it is easy to trace the steps by which all politics have been formed . In the infancy of the world , when the law of primogeniture prevailed , the household naturally and speedily enlarged itself into the tribe , ( the patriarch ruling over his remote descendants , ) and its growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root themselves in the earth , and become , in turn , the parents of encircling groups , till a huge forest springs up around , all intertwined , and bound together by the law of an ever-circulating life . Hence we see the falsehood of that doctrine of the social compact , which teaches that men originally entered into society because of the inconveniences of living in solitude , and that it was a mere matter of voluntary agreement . Men never stood isolated and independent , as this theory represents them they were born into the household , and the household grew into the nation . It was never left to their choice , whether to associate themselves or not ; they were associated by a law coeval with their existence , and from which they could never be freed but by an act of rebellion . But ihough the household is the germ of the nation , there is a generic difference between them . The state is something more than an enlargement of the family . The one is for the training and government of children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an ordinance for the defense and nurture of that period of man 's life , in which his personal existence and self-sustaining energy is slowly evolving itself ; but , while admirably adapted to this end , it can not furnish a sphere wide enough for the developed powers of manhood . It is the nursery of man ; // but men do not always need to remain in the nursery . The young seedlings require for a time the sheltered enclosure and the gardener 's watchful care ; but if you leave them in their crowded ranks too long , you have a stinted growth . Transplant them , and give them room enough , and each becomes a wide-shadowing tree , whose roots clasp the earth in a strong embrace , and whose branches wrestle victoriously with the storm . So the discipline appointed for infancy , and most needful for it , would dwarf manhood . In those eastern monarchies , ( as China , ) where the state is nothing more than the household expanded , and the paternal character overshadows the regal in the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people remain children , overshadowed by an all-monopolizing power , which leaves them no room for growth , and keeps them in perpetual infancy . A nation may be defined with sufficient accuracy for our present purpose , a number of families , so great as to exceed the limits of a tribe , formed into a body politic , which has within itself the exclusive right of jurisdiction over the territory which it permanently occupies . The j ) hysical structure of the globe necessitates the existence of mankind in distinct and separate nations . Its seas , and gulfs , and lakes , its trackless deserts and lofty mountains , are natural barriers and boundaries , which may , indeed , be par . tinIly overcome by the stern amnbition of dominion , as when Rome marched steadily on to the conquest of the world , or the Asiatic chieftains swept over numberless lands ; but yet do hinder the formation of a universal monarchy . And if we compare the tribes of Greece with the overgrown monarchies of Asia , we shall see that many centers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . Within a narrow circumference , the relation of each part to the center is most close and strong . That it was the divine purpose to separate mankind into distinct nations , was early shown by a direct and supernatural interposition . When " the whole earth was of one la**guage and of one speech , " and men began to build a city and a tower to be the capital of a universal empire , he confounded their language , and so compelled them to go forth in separate families and tribes in search of new habitations . We believe that in that preternatural breaking up of society , the law of the household was honored and that the nations , which grew out of that convulsion , were not mixed multitudes , chance-gathered , like the motley wrecks which the tempest strews upon the shore , but racks of a common origin , bound together by the ties of kindred . It would be impossible to trace their history from that time , for emigration , wars , and the results of commerce , have changed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled together the great nations of antiquity , till their identity is almost lost . Nor does it fall within our purpose to show the origin of the nations of Christendom out of the ruins of the Roman Empire , mingled with the rude institutions of its northern conquerors , and to point out how , through the power of Christian faith , the rich and various products of European life were evolved out of the darkness and chaos of those convulsive times . Our design is simply to speak of National Unity as involved in the idea of a nation , and to show by what means alone a vital and permanent union can be given to many parts , and a territory be transformed into a country . There is a blind spirit of cosmopolitism , disguised under the fair name of universal philanthropy , which wars against national distinc // tions , and makes light of patriotism , as if it were a narrow and sectarian principle . It would break down all barriers , blend all differences , and amalgamate all races together , till all were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing short of the whole world is large enough for the embrace of this most expansive spirit , and playing the chemist , it would put all nations into its crucible , and melt them into undistinguishable uniformity . But we hold that the existence of the nation , as an independent , self-regulating polity , is indispensable in the education of the race ; and that love for one 's country , stronger than we bear to any other land , is a religious duty . We ought to exult in its greatness , to sorrow over its misfortunes , and be ready to pour out our blood in its defense . The state is something more than the people , ( as the arch is something more than the stones , ) and when they are organized into it , and penetrated by a national life , they are lifted at once into a higher , more beautiful , and more glorious existence . New feelings are awakened , new attachments called forth , new energies developed , new features of character made to start into the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majestic representation possible on earth , of the supreme government ; the best embodiment and realization of divine justice . It gives the most impressive and effectual testimony against transgression , in the stern sentences of judgment , and the pains and penalties of law ; thus re-echoing the voice of the everlasting King , and giving a pledge and foreshowing of the retributions of the world to come . It testifies , not in words only , as doth the church , but in stern and solemn acts , that man was born to be the subject of law ; and thus it prepares him , by the discipline of this lo*ver , earthly sphere , to yield to a higher , spiritual order , and to move in the harmonies of heaven . The state , we repeat it , is essential to the perfecting of man , and exalts and blesses every one who is a member of it . We have no sympathy with those that think lightly of national attachments , and we believe that the heart , which despises and repels them , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is a sickly sentimentality , which would sigh even over the carnage of a battle-field , on which the liberties of a country had been won , and which can see nothing glorious in the armed might of navies , when they form a bulwark of strength around one 's native shores . Great an evil as war unquestionably is , it is a far less one than the dull pulsations of the national heart , foreboding the dying out of the national life , for with that all greatness and goodness die , and nothing is left but the spawn of corruption that fatten on the carcass . But all life , in organized bodies , implies unity ; and when this is destroyed , dissolution goes on , and decomposition into the original elements is the issue . There can be no nation without unity , for it must act as one through its appropriate organs ; and when it ceases to do this , it falls abroad into disconnected parts . National unity , in its highest power , is such a combination of the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each for all , and their concentrated powers flow through common channels for the common blessing . The first means to this is , that there be a central power to which all the parts shall be subordinated . Unity supposes a center , by their common relation to which many become one . There must be in the state a central organ for the administration of the fundamental law , from which a controlling influence shall go forth to the remotest cxtremities . Nor is this constituted by the parts , but in the order of nature , exists before them , as the // branches do not give law to the tree , but the tree to the branches . The members of the household do not appoint its constitution ; they are born under it , or come under it by the law of marriage , and find them . selves subject to it , not it to them . The sum of the parts of any body is quite a different thing from their unity . The human frame can be torn asunder , limb by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , would form the sum of its members ; but their unity would stand in their living union in the body of living man . The one is a mere mechanical addition ; the other is possible only through a vital force which subordinates the parts to its own law of working . The materials of which a nation is composed may exist long before they were joined together by the power of a national life , as the stones exist before the arch , and the chemical elements before the plant . But when these materials become so united as to form a state , they become subjected to a higher law than is in themselves . The powers with which the state is clothed do not originate in its separate members , any more than the law of the arch originates in the stones that form it . In plainer words , the unity of a nation requires a central government , which , through its various organs , legislative , judicial , and executive , shall give law to the whole country , and exercise ultimate jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confederacy , but no nation . If the powers of the separate portions do transcend the powers of the whole , there is no true unity . Far back in the old Saxon time , the soil of England was occupied by many independent kingdoms struggling together for dominion , and the land was filled with confusion and strife . But the law of national life began to work among the chaotic elements , and , one by one , those petty states became subjected to its power . England arose , no mere confeder acy of the kingdoms of the Saxon heptarchy , no creature of an alliance between rival sovereignties , but a nation , in the unity of which they all had their place as subordinate parts , and received their lifeblood from one great central heart . Our history has been different . There has never been a true fusion of the states into one nation . There has been an alliance , but no fusion . The general government is claimed to be the mere creature of the members of the confederacy , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty than they . Its powers are a grant , a concession from parties to a compact , who watch the execution of them more in the spirit of superiors than subordinates . The allegiance of the people is challenged by the states as their own right . And the frequent threats of dissolving the union , and the continual allusions to such an event as an alternative to be preferred to some other ( whether the imposition of a protective tariff , or the continuance of domestic slavery ) , show how feebly we are bound together by the law of an organic life . Dissolve the Union ! If we were one nation in the innermost power of national unity , this would be more than the snapping of certain external bands , leaving the states unaffected in their internal relations : it would be the death-struggle of the land , the breaking up of all foundations , the dissolution of all law . It is a striking illustration of this that we have no national name , no name expressing such a union of the parts as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty rods by an external hand , we call them a bundle of rods , for they have no unity . But if a tree from one trunk sends forth as many branches , it does not cease to be one tree , for they are all one in the unity of a common life . So our eight and twenty states are truly United States , a bundle of states tied together by // the dead cords of a written constitution . America is not a name peculiar to us ; it belongs to the continent . The central power must , also , be a center for all the parts ; otherwise the unity of the nation is impaired . The government must be the organ of the states , not of a party . it must be the representative of the nation , and act for the blessing of the nation . If it be the mere instrument of a faction ; if it labor for the aggrandizement of the party which lifted it into power , and postpone national ends to this ; then is there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an end . It is a question deserving of most serious thought , whether the existence of organized parties in a state , separated by fundamental differences , and j ) ledged ( by the force of public sentiment at least ) to administer the government on party principles , is not subversive of the highest ends of a national polity . If an administration , which is the state in act , is to be , as a matter of course , systematically resisted and maligned by one half the people , and as systematically lauded and supported by the other half , it can never subserve the moral ends for which government was established . Nor will it grasp the national interests in one grand and harmonious scheme , because the force of partisan influences will be everdefiecting it from its true course . But there may be , and perchance here lies our safety , a deep undercurrent of national instincts and aims , bearing along in its mighty flow those party strifes which are mere eddyings upon its surface . A second condition of national unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that its chief enlaruement be by natural increase . This is the generic difference between a living body and a lifeless mass , that the one grows from a germ which contains the law of the plant or antmal , and increases through the vital process of assimilation ; while the other is a mere congeries , an accidental collection of particles like a sand-hill in the desert , which the fierce winds gather and dissipate at their pleasure . The healthy plant takes into itself no more foreign substances than it can thoroughly transmute into its own essence , and make component parts of itself ; and so it must be with a nation . We have seen that in the first ages of the world , and according to the divine constitution , the household was the germ of every large society , and grew into it . The life of the seed was continuously evolved , and the nation was fortned by a harmonious growth from within , not by an accidental and heterogeneous increase from without . Hence the Present was never severed from the Past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common language were secured . We lay it down as a fundamental principle , that when national life has begun to unfold itself , and a nation has truly begun to exist , its chief enlargement should be by birth and not by minigration . Otherwise , it will be with it as with the overlaid infant , which perishes under the burden it has no strength to bear ; or as with a structure that falls to pieces from too great accumulation of chance materials  --  and the seeds of a new existence must be planted amongst the ruins . For a nation , which is truly such , has a specific constitution or organic law , not written perhaps , but embodied in institutions , and ever acting as the shaping spirit of its character and course . Now as the law of growth in any living body forbids the receiving of nutriment which can not be assimilated , but must remain an alien thing ; so all who become members of the state , ought to be possessed by the spirit of the state , or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best secured by their being born within its bosom , and trained from infancy under its institutions . It is not the // qwq and lead her on in the career of the assaults of time . glory . We may be pointed to Rome as qwq alien stock . partakers of her life , and the sharThe history of Europe is an ex- ers of her power . qwq They were commanded to have one law for themselves and for the stranger within their gates , and were charged to remember that they were once strangers in the land of Egypt . Foreigners could also become incorporated into the state , and enjoy all the privileges of citizenship , if they desired it , and proved themselves worthy ; but such a step implied so much , it was such a breaking-away from all existing bonds of country and kindred and religion , and such an assumption of new responsibilities , that the number of adopted citizens always bore a small proportion to the lineal descendants of Abraham . Some tribes , possessed of an inveterate hostility to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third generation ; and in one instance , the exclusion was to be perpetual . The great principle on which these features of their polity were based , we believe to be a sound one , and essential to true national unity , viz. , that a nation should increase chiefly by the evolving of its own life , and that all additions to it from foreign sources should be made so slowly , and with such previous preparation , as to transfer no disturbing elements into the body politic . Our condition , in this respect , is unlike that of any other nation . Our vast unoccupied territory , and the freedom of our institutions act as continual temptations to the overcrowded multitudes in the Old World , where society is groaning under the accumulated corruptions of ages ; and hundreds of thousands  --  a motley mixture of races , languages , and religions-are annually finding a home on our shores . This is certainly an infelicity of our situation , for it hinders our proper national growth , by the introduction of new and strange elements , faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incorporated . And that part of our country suffers most from this evil , which will soon have the political preponderance , and by which our national destiny is to be decided . To our mind , the darkest feature in the condition of the West is the want of an organic principle , and the ab sence of an organizing process . There are materials gathered there and gathering , of all degrees of excellence ; but there is yet no vital union of the parts . There is increase , but no growth . The carcass swells , but there is no body . There is a. vast assemblage of men , but no commonwealth . The fusing power is wanting to blend many into one . We feel the evil less in the Atlantic states , because the tide of emigration passes by us , and has little effect to weaken the strong ties formed by our common origin , and the cementing influence of the common perils of the Revolution . We have our past in which our roots strike deep , and hence there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than can exist amidst the surging waves of the West . We are not complaining that multitudes of the poor and the oppressed flee to our land as an asylum , nor would we set up any barrier to exclude them , for the finger of an inevitable Providence is clearly in it ; and yet it acts most unfavorably on the developement of our national life . In tearing themselves away from their ancient homes , all ancient ties are weakened ; and the vital question is , What new ones are formed in place of them ? If the central forces of our system were of fiery intensity , these fast-gathe ring materials would soon be incorporated as homogeneous parts . But here is the secret of our weakness , and the source of our danger . The tendency of all things with us is not to combine , but to separate , to individualize , to isolate . Is not that the one law of our progress hitherto , the fundamental idea which seems to shape our course , and to determine our national acts ? The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , may be summed up in this one  --  to escape oppression . It was so with the Puritans , with the Huguenots , and with the Roman Catholics of Maryland ; and we believe it may safely be said of all , that the desire of a larger liberty and of a fairer field , influenced them to try their fortunes in the wilderness . To escape control in the church and the state , to vindicate the rights of conscience , and so to secure personal liberty , was the deep-rooted principle working secretly beneath , though it manifested itself under the most diverse forms . There were , at the first , many other elements mingled with this , of a more conservative and even aristocratical character , which retarded its developements , and tempered its workings ; but we much mistake if , from the beginning , this was not the differentia of our character and institutions , full of hidden life and power- Hence in due time came the breaking of our colonial bonds in the war of the Revolution ; and hence that movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sages and patriots of our land , seeks to destroy all exclusive privileges , and , of course , all corporations and organized bodies , and to individualize and equalize to the very uttermost . Our boast is that we have freedom , as no other nation has it . Liberty and equality are our watchwords . Phe peculiarity of our institutions is , that they proclaim and defend the integrity of man as a person , and do not suffer him to be absorbed into the mass and crushed there , as in the old world . But for that very reason they are deficient in constructive power . The individualizing principle is purely negative , seeking to remove restrictions , to break down superiority , and to place all men upon the same level of privileges . It is good , therefore , to destroy old and worn-out organizations , but it can not organize anew . It re duces all things to their simplest elements , but can not recompose them . It concerns itself not with men , but with man , with humanity in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all men which is alike , not that which differs ; and deals not with the father , the child , the husband , the wife , but with the human being . if this he the overmastering tendency , the len non scnipta , of our land , our l ) rogress is not towards unity . We need to do more than teach every man his standing as a man , and secure for him his freedom and personal rights ; otherwise , the multitudes hastening hither from other lands , that mistake lawlessness for liberty , will not learn from us a lesson of submission to order . It is not enough to knock off the old cement , and lay every stone by itself ; they must be arranged and compacted anew in the stately structure of society . It is not enough to loosen all false and galling bonds , if we strengthen not those eternally ordained of God . The truth seems , therefore , to be divided between those parties now contending about the respective rights of natives and foreigners . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , best understand the ideal of a nation ; while those who would obliterate all national differences , discern most clearly the spirit of the age , and act most in harmony with the law of our progress hitherto . It is , indeed , a monstrous doctrine , that there is nothing peculiarly sacred in a birthright , and that all the rights and privileges of citizenship should be thrown open , like an unfenced common , which every hoof treads down ; but it is quite too late to resist it . The ideal is not practicable , and the practicable is far enough from being the true ideal ; but all that is left us is to mould , as best we can , the alien materials that can never be excluded - // A third means of securing national unity , is by a well defined and permanent territory . By this we mean , that the nation should have fixed habitations , and within moderate limits , inasmuch as an overgrown territory and frequent changes of abode , are both unfavorable to the cementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a nation is planted , and in the absolute ownership of which its independence stands , becomes almost identified with it . There the life of the nation has unfolded itself , and made it the theater of the national labors , enterprises , and glories . Places become memorials of high exploits , links of union with the past , and incentives to noble deeds in all coming time . The peasant who crosses the field where Wallace conquered , the scholar who makes his pilgrimage to the house where Shakspeare was born , and the Christian who treads reverently in a ruined abbey where a holy choir ages ago chaunted the praises of God ,  --  each feels an influence reaching from the dead , and consecrating the soil on which he stands . Every spot becomes associated with memorable events , and acquires an intellectual and moral significancy . The dead earth is quickened with life , and vocal with melodies floating from mountain and lake and river , which speak to the hearts of men . How must they feel knit to each other , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , bearing engraven upon its face the story of their nation 's greatness or of its wrongs . Let us imagine the English nation to be removed in a body , queen , nobles and people , to some one of their possessions in the southern sea ; would not the result show not merely that English character , in its finer features , is indissolubly connected with English soil , but also that the bands which have bound them in so marvellous a unity , had been loosened , if not broken , by the shock ? They could scarcely be separated from their island-home with its rocky cliffs and resounding shores , from the Thames and the Severn , from the land which Alfred and Elizabeth governed , and which martyrs watered with their blood , without the entire breaking up of their social structure . No doubt the old Saxon energy would bring forth some noble fruit again , but England would never reappear . That form of national life which has been gradually developing itself for ages within the narrow mould of the British isle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory has much to do with the strength of national attachments . Concentration gives intensity . The life of the nation rolls back upon itself , and becomes fixed and deepened . As with the circles in the pool , which ever widening , do at last so spread themselves abroad , as to be blended with the watery mass and disappear , so is it with the enlargement of territory as bearing on national character . All sense of mutual connection , all unity of feeling and aim , is gradually lost ; and you have a collection of neighborhoods , instead of a country . The evil is of course aggravated , if this enlargement of national boundaries brings in foreign races . It would be an evil , even if the population remained homogeneous ; it is incalculably increased , when alien elements are thus introduced into the body politic . The course of things amongst ourselves in this respect , is of portentous aspect . The annexation of Texas , as affecting our nationality , was bad enough ; but the annexation of Mexico would well nigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that country as a conquered province , than in admitting it to an equality of political privileges . Such heterogeneous elements // can never combine . It is madness to think of comprehending in one country all that lies between the two oceans , and of bringing the who1*-of North America within the federal union . Far better than this , had the western base of the Alleghanies been washed by the waves of the Pacific . The spirit that desires such an enlargement of our territory , is not patriotism , but the lust of power , such as stirred up the French Jacobins to their frenzied crusade against all the ancient governments of Europe , that they might establish one vast republic on the ruins . The prospect is that as a nation , we shall soon have forsaken our ancient seats . The only part of our territory which has any strong historical interest , is the Atlantic states , the old thirteen . There the seeds of our national life were first planted , there were our birth-struggles , there the new-born nation first saw the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few years they will have been deserted by a numerical majority of the people . That which is now going on , is virtually a national emigration , for it is more than an enlargement of the extremities , the centre remaining the same ; power is going also ; and soon the nation will be found removed from the battle-grounds of their fathers , from the soil rich in glorious recollections , from the only links of union with the past , far away upon the prairies of the west , or the plains of Texas , with as little to remind them of the land from whence they sprung , as there is on the level ocean . A fourth means of national unity lies in oneness of religious faith and worship . The spiritual life of a people is their truest , innermost life ; and unity here is the true source of unity in all the outward spheres of their existence . From this central fountain flow forth the strongest influences to control and mould the whole being of man . For good or for evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the most active and the most mighty of all the agencies that have ever been working at the heart of society . The vast overshadowing systems of Pagan idolatry , which were indissolubly linked in with all the institutions of the state , and the history of Mahommedanism , which burst like a whirlwind upon the eastern world , but like the whirlwind did not pass away , show how political institutions have been shaped by religious principles . And so it must be . The earthly and fleeting elements of man 's life are connected with an encompassing eternity , and must be influenced by that which is higher and more enduring . No one can deny the power of faith ( the sphere of which is super-terrestrial ) in matters of which governments take cognizance . It made the Jew intractable and rebellious under the dominion of Rome ; it set the early Christians , meek and gentle though they were , in stern resistance to the idolatrous laws of the empire ; and , in every age , it has introduced a new and difficult element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest of all questions , they can not be one in the deepest unity of a national life . How much have differences in faith disturbed and vexed the world ! What strifes and commotions have they kindled And even where hostile parties have proceeded to no such extremities of violence , yet there can not be that inward union , that flowing together of affections , that . acknowledged community of interests , which are essential to the highest perfection of a nation . As the spiritual in man , when awakened , is the controlling part of ' his being , so Christianity has always exerted a mighty influence on the external life of nations . Unity in the church would both act as a harmonizing principle , and serve as a // model for the institutions of the state . A spiritual and ecclesiastical union would prepare the way for a political union . It was most happy for Europe , that , at the time its institutions were slowly forming , after the dissolution of the Roman Empire , the church was not broken up into conflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united , both in government and in doctrine . When society was in a chaotic state , the ecclesiastical element was all that was stable , and it formed a barrier against the breakings of aiiai*chy , and kept the principle and the example of order before the eyes of that lawless time . Men learned to go up to one altar in their holy worship , and to be subject to one system of spiritual discipline , before they were brought together into the unity of the state . And as the church was the nucleus around which European society crystallized , so , when it is broken up into factions , and the spiritual life of the people is deccmposed and dissipated , we see a sure forerunner of political ruptures and dissolution . The real weakness of England , ( under the appearance of amazing strength , ) and her chief difficulties of administration , grew out of her fierce reli ions quarrels . Ireland and the education question supply proofs enough of this . In this means of national unity we are deficient . Our land is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mortal conflict . The church neither exemplifies the law , nor conveys the influences of unity ; but her divisions introduce an element of discord into the state , and hinder the close cementing of the people in the bonds of a common life . The great religious denominations of our country are cracking and crumbling more and more , and these inner spiritual dissensions necessarily propagate themselves in the outer circles of social and political feelings and interests . The schism in one of the largest ecciesi astical bodies , growing out of the agitation of a great moral and political question-that touching domestic slavery-forebodes a more complete alienation of affection , a more radical loosening of common ties , between different sections of our union , than has yet been ; and it needs no sagacity to foretell that , if the bonds of a common Christianity are broken , none other will long be strong enough to hold us together. * In fine , this is our ideal of a nation . That it should have a central power , as the symbol and organ of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinated , and around which the national affections should clusteit ; that it should increase mainly from itself by the natural law of growth , and thus secure the inestimable benefits of a common ancestry , and a common language ; that it should occupy the same country , from age to age , with ever-strengthening local attachments ; and that , through oneness in faith and worship , it should have one spiritual life , as the true source and sustaining strength of all outward unity . Great as our shortcomings may be , when tried by this ideal , we have most hopeful feelings as to our ultimate destiny . The position assigned us , in the grand scheme of Providence , seems to forbid , for the present , the perfection of a national constitution . Our work has been to subdue the wilderness , and to people it with teeming life . Year by year the abodes of civilization are movtng swiftly towards the Pacific ; and the pioneers are already scaling the summits of the Rocky Mountains , or winding their way through its defiles towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent with materials to be worked up hereafter . But the lower forms of national existence * As the writer is neither a Roman Catholic , nor an Episcopalian , he can not he suspected of any party aims in the expression of the foregoing views . // will not always satisfy us . Already do we see a longing for a higher unity in those schemes of association which are becoming so rifeschemes unsound in principle , and utterly impracticable  --  but growing out of a feeling of desolateness , a sense of isolation . So loose are the ties which now bind men together . We have been seeking to build a sotar system with the centrifugal force alone . We need , and the need is beginning to be felt , another power that shall draw men towards a common center , and make them to move in harmonious orbs around it . The peculiarity of our institutions has lain too much in leaving men to 4hemselves , in giving them the lar gest liberty , in letting the glowing metal run at its own wild will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change will comenot , perhaps , till the evil has reached its consummation , the storm passed over the face of the land , and the shock of the earthquake opened the abyss beneath our feet . For the present seems to be the time throughout all lands , of the breaking up of the old foundations , and of the overflowing of the old land marks. * But the storm shall cease , and the floods abate , and the hills and the green earth appear ; and then shall the glorious destiny be accomplished for which we are reserved in the plans of an all-comprehending Providence.
