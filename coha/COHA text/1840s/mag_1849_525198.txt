txt THE merits of a political system depend upon the fitness of its ends , and the success of its arrangements for attaining them . Its ends ought always to be popular ; that is to say , they should embrace the liberty and welfare of the people at large , rather than of one or more classes of men in particular . So , at least , we judge in this country . The early State constitutions hold the doctrine in very strong language . But to make a government the blessing it ought to be to a whole people , it is necessary , in framing it , to resolve the benevolence of its general scope into two specific aims-one , the present care of men 's rights under it ; the other , its own preservation , as material to their future safety . The latter , be it borne in mind , is by far the most difficult part of the business . Antecedently to our national era , there were three forms of political organization , of which it was vulgarly supposed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and monarchy were two . But of these it is needless to say much , because their very ends were such as to unfit them for our use ; being designed essentially for the benefit of a few , and not of the many . Such polities belong to privileged orders , of which we have none . They are wont to be administered for the peculiar advantage of those orders . It is of their nature to be so administered . And whatever the people at large get from them in the way Gf benefits , is rather accidental than proper to their main purpose ; a kind of crumbs from the rich man 's table . But how as to the third or last variety of the classical forms ? Democracy , it must be owned , is popular enough , both in drift and composition . Why , then , did it not present itself to the patriarchal lawgivers as the very thing they wanted ? There was a difficulty of another sort . Those sages knew something of history , something of human nature , something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the technical sense of the term , is incapable of successful application to the use of a great country like ours . The people can not assemble to deliberate , in mass , upon public measures ; nor would it be well to do so if they could . The people at large are not wise enough for this ; they are not cool and dispassionate enough . Many of them are too dependent in condition , too low in character and standing , let me add , too poor in principle , to be safely intrusted with a voice in all State questions . The idea of doing everything by universal suffrage , and without the intervention of agencies , would be no better than a madhouse project in a land of such vast territories . It is not much better anywhere . That democracy means well , is nearly all the good you can say of it . And though you could say more , its career is seldom long enough to give a sure value to its attributes . In the very nature of things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a kind of polity , well intentioned if you please , but frail in structure , fickle , changeful , uneasy in the working , and doomed , under all possible circumstances , to an early grave . It can not be otherwise . There are no checks that can be relied on to curb such a government ; no balancewheels to regulate the waywardness ot its action . What have you to take hold on for any manner of conservative purpose ? No division of the sovereignty can take place . The men who administer the system are the very same persons who alone // are interested in the consequences . What appeal in such a case ? What power anywhere to interfere ? All concerned are on board the vehicle that is running away . And this vehicle is not a ship , with sails filled with one element while its rudder plays effectually in another ; but a balloon , that has absolutely nothing to steer by , and which is therefore incapable of keeping to any course but that of the wind itself , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitutional fathers to act ? Monarchy would n't answer their turn . Aristocracy would n't answer . These forms , if adopted , might last a long while , no doubt ; but then , the longer the worse , from the obliquity of their main ultimate design . Democracy was indeed sufficiently popular in its bearing , could it only be kept steady in its action . This , however , was quite hopeless . It would require a community of angels to carry on such a government successfully for a great length of time . The conclusion was , that neither democracy , aristocracy , nor monarchy would suit the occasions of the country ; and it was therefore necessary to contrive a scheme materially different from them all . Even mixtures would n't do ; for schemes made up by taking part from one of the old forms and part from another would involve a conflict of aims and tendencies hard , if not impossible , to harmonize . A government was wanted that should seek , not only in part , but altogether , the popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this out of systems in which the people made no figure , but where kings and princes and hereditary nobles had the disposal of everything by right of blood ? To be sure , the English government is itself a mixture , and the fathers had their eyes upon it as such . They saw in it , besides monarchy and aristocracy , a third ingredient , commonly but untechnically termed democratic . Could such a union of parts , especially as between the popular branch and the two others , be perfect ? Aristocracy and monarchy may find it politic to join hands , their ends not being wide apart ; but one would think democracy , or anything in the spirit of it , not only ungenial to those polities , but antagonistic , having an end of its own that is decidedly inconsistent with the exclusiveness of their pretensions . When privileged estates , whether royal or only noble in rank , are associated in a government system with the people or their representatives , there may be joint action for immediate purposes , but there can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy of design ; and it is odds but there will sometimes be open war in the political household , with more or less disturbance of the balance of power among its inmates . As a whole , the English government is by no means what it once was , or what it was for centuries after the people came to have a share in it . During the Tudor dynasty , the prerogative was uppermost , and the House of Commons under foot . Then came a struggle of four reigns , and the political machine was righted again . Since that period , the Commons have gradually got the better both of the monarchical and aristocratic estates , and are now higher in the ascendant than ever . Well for the kingdom that it is so ; well that in a system almost necessarily agitated by conflicting aims and policies , the people occupy , and are intrenched upon , the heights of the domestic battle-gronnd . But of the system itself what shall we say ? What can we say but this ? - God bless it to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! But suppose the popular part of the British constitution were taken for a nucleus , and the requisite complement of additions gathered around it on a corresponding plan , so as to give us an agency government throughout ; how would that answer ? The fathers could not but see that the House of Commons was an admirable contrivance , by itself considered . It was demooratic in* spirit ; yet without the ignorance , the haste , the caprice , the turbulence , the instability of governments technically so called . Why might not this suggest the capital thought of a fourth form of political organization , distinct and equidistantly remote from all the other three ? Such a form would be likely to work harmoniously in its various branches , and to keep the State at peace with itself . It would secure unity of design at home , and probably a due measure of respect abroad . Above all , by partitioning the // sovereignty between public agents and their principals  --  the people-an invaluable resource might be found in the electoral part for setting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative power , and thus , if such a thing can be , to perpetuate the career of liberty , by institutions safe from the contagion of democratic disease , while yet as truly free and popular as democracy itself could make them . The capital thought here mentioned did arise in those pure minds that had the framing of our polity , and they acted upon it ; establishing a government ( the States were all fashioned on one model ) that had no monarchy , no aristocracy , no democracy , in its composition ; not a particle of either . Semblances may be traced , just as you may find human profiles in the clouds . The offices of Governor and President , for instance , may be said to wear a semblance of monarchy . The Senates of the different Legislatures savor faintly of aristocratic ideas ; and there is an infusion of something easily mistaken for democratic liqueur throughout the whole contents of the political caldron . It has often been predicted that our system would develop into a one-man government . But ii believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terms , we are already a democracy . Foreign writers so speak of us. iDe Tocqueville seems everywhere to take it for granted ; and Lord Brougham not only states the fact to be so , but applies to our democracy the very epithet by which it is usual to distinguish the technical form of government known by that name. * This , however , is loose writing . The truth is otherwise . The fathers of the country never dreamed of such a thing ; and though we are not at present just what they meant us to be , we are still no democrats in the form and theory of our system At the polls , no doubt , and in the newspapers , an unscrupulous man will say anything to gain his purpose . In this way , democracy has become a word of cant among our own citizens ; and so would diabolism , if the people loved to hear it . I am for all the just freedom of the country , but I will never hoist a false flag to please anybody . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , possibly , as much as some who bend lower at their shrine ; but I have my own way of showing it , and decline to be a conniving spectator of the inroads that are making on the inheritance their glorious ancestors have left them . To call the government a democracy , is either to mistake or to slander it . To call the people democrats , or to profess , with fawning cant , to be democrats at their service , is to make them objects either of insult or cajolery . The truth appears to be , that to a very great extent the popular origin , bearing , and working of our institutions has involved men 's minds in a confusion of ideas as to the name and character of the economy they belong to . And as misapprehension here is mischievous , drawing practice after it , perverting the views of our too frequent constitutional conventions , and so putting everything at hazard ; the cloud must , if God permit , be dissipated , and the clear , benignant sky of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ask , is that fourth form of government , that new-invented form , so different from all others ? It is , as I have phrased it before , an agency government throughout , and technically a republic . Its peculiarity lies mainly in this , fhat the sovereignty being divided , public measures are all taken by means of delegated power ; while the people , or a very large proportion of them , are the appointed visitors of these ngency proceedings , and hold the residue of the sovereignty for that purpose ; employing it at discretion on the men of the government , as terms of office expire , but standing quite aloof from its acts ; content with a supremacy over these by influence only , through public opinion and the ballot-box . And if this be not*a peculiar form of government , unknown to the ancients , unmixed with any that they knew , I have entirely mistaken its character . It works entirely by agencies . It has no monarch , no privileged orders , no legislative popular assemblies . It does nothing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to them impossible . Agents , and popular agents are no new discovery ; but they were never thus combined before in a complete government mechanism . Steam and steam-engines were abundantly common before Fulton was born , and lakes and 478 May , // rivers were alive with water-craft , but there had been no combination like the one he made ; and here his merit lay-he was a true inventor . The hint that gave birth to our scheme of government may have been derived originally from the lower house of the British Parliament . Nothing more likely . There was popular agency in that body from very early times , and with it representative government ( which is more ) upon a partial scale . But the first use made of that hint , on our side of the water , was in the colonial period of the couatry . It was then tried , and tried again ; tried everywhere throughout the colonies , and the result was , that it answered well . The colonists were all agreed about it . They could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as their circumstances allowed . Provincial governors could not be popularly chosen : there was a royal master in the way . For the rest , however , the people governed themselves by their own agents ; that is , by delegated power . And when at length all shackles were broken and all barriers removed , the patriots of a freer , happier day went farther , and constructed their whole edifice in the agency style , giving us a government " every inch " a republic  --  a thing the stars had never looked down upon before . Yes , a republic ! Should not this new and beautiful creation have a name ? True , every form of government that looks broadly to the general good , as its constitutional object , is etymologically , and in vulgar parlance too , republican . I say , its constitutional object . Popularity of mere administration is not enough . We could not call a monarchy or pure aristocracy republican , even in an untechnical sense , though ever so liberal and catholic in its present tone of operation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of such governments to operate thus ; nor would it do to ascribe to them what arises only from the accidental temper , character , or policy of those in charge of them for the time being . Speaking descriptively , apart from technical ideas , democracy is called a republican polity ; being altogether popular , and making use of the general will to attain that will 's own ends . It is indeed a bubble . Bubble-like , however , it has a witchery of coloring about it , that all eyes are taken with . A popular bubble ! blown up , and then blown about , by the people , just to please themselves  --  the wide welkin ringing with their acelamations , as it sails along . Essentially , a popular gewgaw , from first to last ! No favored classes , no favored iadividuals , save the demagogue of the hour . It is , in short , the toy , the plaything of the commonwealth . And as no mildness or beneficence of administration can entitle one of the governments " made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a democracy to be refused this name , in common speech , because unfitted to make good in practice the promise of its import . But , after all , the word republic is , in technical strictness , applicable only to a kind of polity , in which the people govern themselves by representative agents . And why not ? In the first place , such a polity needs a technical name ; for it is widely different from the old forms , and is too iuuch spoken of withal , to admit of being tumbled about in endless circumlocution . Secondly , the vulgar meaning of the word republican is no obstacle to this appropriatioa of it , in a strict sense , any more than the vulgar meaning of the word dewocrary vitiates the use of that word , as a term of art , to designate a polity in which the people govern themselves without representative agents . And finally , the fathers have settled the business for us ; our peculiar institutions being what they chose to call a republic , emphatically and exclusively such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And for this fact I refer generally to the mass of our political literature of the first age . The reader will see for himself . As , however , we .. haVe so-called democrats among us , and not a few of them , it may be well to specify , for their particular behoof , a writer or two whom they profess to regard as a kind of ancestors in their own political genealogy , and whose statements they are themselves likely to hold in due respect . I begin with Mr. Jefferson , the hero of " a second revolution . " Look at his works , and see if he professed to be a democrat . Republic , republican , republicanism , are the burden-terms of his style . He never thinks of democracy . The word , if I re 1849. // member right , ( some years have come and gone since I perused the four volumes of his published " writings , " ) has scarce a place in his vocabulary . " The constitution , " says this gentleman , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be republican , according to every candid interpretation . " * This was written in 1800 , the great year of his life . And , what is not a little singular , he seems to have thought the actual state of the government , as it came to his hands from those of Washington and Adams , to be not quite popular enough for its republican pretensions . for he adds , immediately , " we have seen it so interpreted , " ( not administered merely , but interpreted , ) " as to be truly what the French have called it " -.  --   --  and what is that , do you think ? a democracy ? Oh , no ! his pendulum is in the other extremity of its arc ; the monster those French fingers are pointing at is " ? nOnarchie masqu4 " monarchy in a mask ! " f I am not responsible for the philosopherpresident 's wisdom or sagacity ; nor am I going to contend for the precision of his ideas as to what essentially constitutes a republic . His definition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A government by the citizens in mass , acting directly and personally , according to rules established by the majority . " * A definition , at first blush , of pure democracy ! But a moment 's refieclion brings relief . His meaning is not all expressed . Consider his subject in general : it is the constitution of the country in its actual state ; and he is writing about it in a letter of friendship , with nothing to put him upon studied accuracy of phrase . There is , therefore , an ellipsis . Ours is truly " a government by the citizens in mass , " ( the electoral portion of them , ) " acting directly and personally " - but upon what ? Is it men or measures that the people act upon ? Certainly not measures . At his day , especially , the direct action of the people was upon men only . It was electoral action . So that if he was supposed to mean , that the government of a republic like ours is administered " directly and personally " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of sound organization by them , for that pur * Jefferson 's Writings , iii , 443. j Ibid. j Thid. iv , 2 ' 75. pose , the definition would be plainly false , in matter of fact , and contrary to his own knowledge of the truth ; a thing , of course , not to be thought of . Let us be reasonable . It is as easy to supply the ellipsis by inserting the word men , as by inserting that of measures , after what is said of the direct personal action of the people . And so the enigma is cleared up . At all events , Mr. Madison , another idol of democratic veneration , and , as I think , a much clearer-headed politician , has told us , in a formal treatise on the subject , that a republic is " a government in which the scheme of representation takes place . " In other words , an agency government ; a government by delegated power . And what entitles Mr. Madison 's language to more particular attention is this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur , a deliberate contrast between republican and democratic institutions . In the latter , he says : " the citizens assemble and administer the government in person ; " * a mode of business which he looks upon as bad in the extreme , because " admitting of no cure for the mischiefs of faction . " Such , at least , is one of his reasons . And he presses the discrimination of the one polity from the other as alike marked in theory and momentous in practice ; summing up the matter , however , in a formal statement , not very logically constructed : " The two great points of difference , " he says , " between democracy and a republic are , first , the delegation of the government , in the latter , to a small number of citizens elected by the rest ; and secondly , the greater number of citizens , and greater sphere of country over which the latter may be extended . " f This concluding passage , though true and important , is inaccurately associated witii the other which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting agencies and delegated power is one of substance , and goes home . It is the grand distinction in the case ; giving us , on one hand , a scheme of things that acknowledges some men wiser , abler , honester than others , and confides in them accordingly ; while , on the democratic side of the question , we have a jealous , cburlish polity , that trusts nobody , respects nobody , and delegates nothing ; but insists the * Federalist , No. 10. t lb . May , // people at large shall do their own work , and huddles them confusedly together for the purpose , making every man , without regard to talents or qualities , a governor in chief for the whole ! In the 39th " Federalist , " the subject is resumed and further prosecuted , the writer there insisting strongly on the vitality of the question whether the constitution of the general government is truly of the nature he has previously ascribed to it ; and using this unqualified language , " that if the plan of the convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depart from the republican character , " ( as above explained , ) " its advocates must abandon it as indefensible . " Here , then , we have the very highest authority ( not only Madison , but his cornpeers , Jay and Hamilton ; not only the men , but their immortal work , which has been , from that day to this , in universal credit as our best political text-book , ) for two pregnant propositions : one , that our system is republican , as contradistinguished from democracy ; the other , that its whole value depends upon the certainty and precision of this truth . But here another topic of inquiry naturally starts into view . How was it known , how could it be known , by the first founders of our system , that a pure republic was so much better than a pure democracy , the experiment having never yet been fairly tried ? They had seen republican institutions mixed up with others of a different nature , but they had never seen them used for the entire fabric of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , in the long run . Who could tell ? Democracy was indeed sufficiently understood . It was notoriously a factious , fickle , mutable , short-lived thing ; a thing to be eschewed , at all events . The hope was , that a republic would work better and wear longer . But who could tell with certainty beforehand ? Might not a republic have its own infirmities-if not as threatening , yet as surely mortal in the end , as those of its elder sister ? Or , supposing remedies possible , how were the dangers of the case to be foreseen ? - how guarded against ? Let us pause a little here for reflection . By glancing at some of the difficulties with which the fathers had to struggle , we shall be the more able to comprehend the policy and appreciate the wisdom of their doings . As already intimated , republican and democratic governments are of one character in the popularity of their ends and general scope . Both forms are alike free , for in both the people govern themselves . It is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassing their ends , that each can be said to have a character of its own , in which the other does not participate . But here the difference between them is world-wide . For , while pure democracy is the very simplest of governments , despotism alone excepted ; a republic , from the fact that it does everything by agencies and trusts , is one of infinite complication . And what follows ? Why , that a republic is just the kind of government where most depends on structural con rivance . Checks , balances , braces are necessary ; a nice adjustment of machinery , part to part ; and a discreet accommodation of the whole system to the actual elements of society , such as it happens to be ; or at least , to the principal classes of those elements . It must be so . The greater the number and variety of ingredients , the more urgent the need of a skillful and workmanlike putting together . Moral influences are to be anticipated ; moral causes foreseen and countervailed . Every organic weakness must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon every point of probable exposure ; the force of every dangerous tendency must be measured and neutralized before events develope its existence . Can all this be done ? Let us not balk the truth ; free governments are prone to change ; nor can it be denied , to change for the worse . What a whole people have once acted on as sovereign lawgivers , ( common law institutions fare better , ) they seldom find in their hearts to let alone afterwards . And what they are forever dabbling at , they commonly spoil in the end . It is notorious that strong governments suffer less from innovation . Why ? Because they have already undergone the worsening process to a degree that defies it ? or have been too bad from the beginning to admit of danger on that score ? // governments takes care of their conservation . Tyrants rule for themselves ; and they are the keepers of the systems that uphold their sway . When , therefore , they have got these systems moulded to their wishes , they are too wise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it is because freedom is a principle of activity , progress , change , that tyrants hate freedom and free institutions . This is the secret of their aversion to all popular movements . No doubt the people have often much enjoyment , both of civil and political rights , under strong governments . A bad system may be so administered as to give the masses of the governed nearly all they can desire for a season . There have been instances of this . Yet freedom is none of the attributes of such a system , for want of a popular principle in it to secure a continuance of right management . Without a principle of this kind in the frame of the government , the people can neither be said to govern themselves , nor even to have any certain hold upon the future indulgence of their masters . In a mixed government like England , where the people have a regular share of control in public affairs , it is not by mere accident that their rights are cared for and their interests cherished . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution . And one is almost ready to rank such a government in the free class , from the predominance of freedom in its working character , as well as in its effects . But after all , it would be a mistake to do so . That government has not always worked as it does now . And notwithstanding the present lead of the Commons in the administration of it , we may not overlook the constitutional fact that it is still a government in part by prerogalive , and has an irresponsible peerage in its structure , and a stale-church . To be free , in round terms , a system must be popular throughout ; every department of power characterized by one common relation of dependence , service , responsibility , to the whole country . Whether England has not freedom enough in her composition to leave the great point of stability uncompromised , is another and far graver question . The crown and peerage certainly hold the Commons much in check even at this day , and exert thus a conservative influence against the tendency of popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparison lay between such a government , just as it is , and pure democracy , a choice were easily made . Liberty itself , if time be anything , is larger and better in the mixed monarchy . A pound of liberty in fee is worth twice the quantity at will or upon sufferance . Alas , for democracy ! It is a rich and glorious conception , but a poor reality-a thing not suited to this fallen world . It asks too much of us . It requires that a whole people , or at least the majority , shall be always virtuous , and wise , and thoughtful , and dispassionate , and vigilant , and far-sighted . What a demand ! and this , under pain of speedy death to their institutions if they fall materially short of the mark ! " The spirits of the just made perfect " would perhaps be equal to the task of carrying on such a government ; but no less gifted community can hope to do it for a length of time . I say it sorrowino ' there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to maintain a pure democracy for fifty years together , uncorrupted , unchanged . It never was , and neveTr will be done . Our republican institutions have been resorted to by way of escape from that desperate dilemma . It is well if we can govern ourselves permanently by delegated power , that is , by the use of agents . This is now the problem . Let us look to it . The great feature of a republican economy is this , that it divides the sovereign power into two parts , of which one is delegated to public agents for the purposes of ordinary government , and the other distributed more or less*xtensively among the people as a sovereignty of electoral oversight and conservation . The arrangement is peculiar . There is nothing like it elsewhere . In monarchical and aristocratic governments , so far as they are purely such , the men who rule are deemed proprietors of everything , and especially of the power they wield . Nor is this power regarded as a detached portion from a large stock ; it is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sovereigns ; claiming allegiance from // J .4* * all around , and owing it professedly to none . In like manner , where the people attend personally to their government affairs , the sovereignty is kept together in a mass ; there is no partition of it , because no agency-corps to be invested with a part . Now this great feature of our system must be thoroughly attended to in all its bearings . We suppose there are advantages in it . May there not be disadvantages in it ? Few things are good without abatement or mixture . May there not be evil tendencies and hazards as peculiar to republican polity as are some of its undoubted advantages ? Observe the state of facts resulting from the very frame of such a polity . It clothes public men with half the sovereignty of the nation ( so to speak ) on one hand ; while on the other , the electors , as such , hold the remaining half ; neither party to the division having the whole power , hut each a moiety only . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrusted with a limited political authority ( the most tempting of earthly things ) will not instinctively yearn for more ? - will not endeavor to enlarge his stock as opportunity offers ? His principles may restrain him if he he an honest man . His character may also help to hold him back . But the tendency of his corrupt nature will and must be to grasp - grasp- grasp . The thing is inevitable . Try it on the side of the officer . He has power , but the modicum is not sufficient . It leaves him still a deputy , a servant . There is a controlling power behind him . Can he be satisfied with the subordination , that cries fie ! continually to his " pride of place ? " For a time , it is probable , the electors will keep an eye upon his movements , provided they are of a grade to do so intelligently . But long vigils lead to weariness and slumber . And if the people find that all is seemingly well for the time being ; that to-day is as yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be likely to relax their vigilance , and suffer their minds to be insensibly drawn off into channels of private interests , to the neglect of their political duties . Then comes the day of ambitious enterprise for the functionary . Will he let it pass without improvement ? Office is indeed a name for duly , and implies a trust . But it is power too , and money , and distinction ; and this under limits that are sure to whet the appetite for an increase of these dainties . And when the office-holder feels himself secure , and can have everything his own way , what are we to expect ? What does history , observation , philosophy , warrant us in expecting ? Men 's integrity fails when hard-pressed by opportunity . Indeed their very judgment is apt to play truant under that temptation , and they often do wrong without conscious guilt . A tale which the teller of it knows to be false , will yet lull his own mind into credence by continual and applauded repetition . Long possession of land by another than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfishness , into a claim of property . Scarcely can a free servant grow old in his master 's house , ( the windows being closed against inspection from without , ) but he is in danger of being turned into a slave  --  and then a chattel . Might begets right ( that is , a conviction or presumption of right ) in almost every one 's conception . A man on horseback is a more considerable man in his own eyes than he was before he mounted ; and he is capable of a rudeness towards foot-travellers that he would not venture upon a one of them . Even a pedestrian , with a stick in his hand , carries his head higher , and is less cautious whom he jostles , than if supported by his legs alone . Such is human frailty . And when we see it thus displayed in private life , and by persons not intentionally wicked or brutal , it is fearful to think of its possible developments in other circumstances , where easy principles are planted in the hotbeds of political forcing-houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soil , unpruned , untrained , ui*watched , from year to year . In short , let public men alone , and trust and duty , as connected with their stations , will soon turn to " airy nothings " in the minds of many ; while power , sole survivor of the family of official ideas , will grow big and burly , as if it had eaten up the others , which indeed is likely to be true without a very violent metaphor . But then it may be said short terms and frequent elections give us a remedy for all this . Do they indeed ? And can they // be certainly relied on for the purpose ? Will they extinguish the thirst of halfpower for the whole ? Will they root out the self-aggrandizing instinct of a placeman 's nature . True , they are good and necessary things , and calculated to have very important conservative effects , provided the precise medium could be found between terms of office too long and too short ; between elections too frequent , and too few and far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When-where -- if at all ? The fathers thought one thing , their descendants think another ; who is right ? The probable aggregate of all sorts of official terms now is less than half its original mngnitude though some of the States maintained their position nearly as at first in this respect . Let us take the general case as it stands . Are the enticements of power neutralized by the necessity public men are now very generally under , of going back yearly to the polls to get their commissions renewed ? It would be nearer the truth to say , that this necessity only changes the direction of men 's efforts in pursuit of their political objects , while the objects themselves remain as they were , with attractions not sufficiently diminished to let go one votary in twenty of the captivated throng . The office-holder , now unable to give up his idol , and compelled at such short intervals to go back to the people for leave to retain it , becomes a general suitor at their doors , spends his time in saying pleasant things to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear , be it democrats , be it gods upon earth . In a word , he plays the demagogue . This is his line of action , his modus operandi for securing the very ends of his ambition ; especinlly in those parts of the country where the electoral will is forever grinding , and the true sentiment of respect and veneration for the dignity of office , consequently , at a low ebb ; so that instead of correcting entirely what is evil in the tendencies of the agency system , the expedidient of over-frequent elections , while doing some good , doubtless in the way intended , has incidentally contributed to stir up a prodigious amount of cajolery and misguidance in the prevailing treatment of the popular mind . At any rate , the point was a delicate one for settlement in the first instance . Whether the fathers or we have acted upon it with the greater wisdom , is not the present question . That it was a delicate and trying point to them in their circumstances , may be well affirmed . Indeed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , the electoral sovereignty itself was not an easy matter to dispose of . There , too , was power , under the provoking stimulus of felt incompleteness . Add to this , it was power in retirement ; shut out from the bustle and display of public life-another disquieting circumstance . And though the reins of empire would in fact be held by the electors , their supremacy could have no visible triumphs , nor make the kind of figure to put the vainglorious passions of men at ease . Was there no danger of discontent on this score ? And might not the goadings of such motives push the electors to an overreaching policy as regards the agents they were to be instrumental in advancing to public stations ? Was it not to be apprehended they might gradually trench upon the authority or liberty of these agents , and so plunge the commonwealth , sooner or later , into a modified democracy ; subjecting'not only men , but measures , to immediate popular dictation ? And then imagine the influence of a race of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men out of office striving to get in-imagine their influence brought to bear upon feeling already excited and misdirected in the public mind . What temptation on the part of candidates to sell or pawn the freedom of their future conduct in offi% for the patronage that has office to bestow . Will these mercenaries shrink from such a trade ? Will the people shrink from putting the seeming gains of it into their pockets ? It will indeed be losses and not gains in the end ; no doubt of that ; but will they see it so beforehand ? or seeing , will they have the magnanimity , the good sense , the wisdom , to forego a present gratification for the sake of a greater good at some distance of time ? Assuredly , the case for which the fathers had to legislate , was of a nature to put all their prudence in requisition . The framing of democracies , and aristocracies , 484 // and monarchies , would have been child 's play in comparison with their task . See what they had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast agency mechanism for ends of ordinary government . And things must be so managed as to bring into the service of the country a variety of personal qualities and talents . There must be men for making laws , men for seeing laws executed , men for judging in detail of common justice between party and party , men for all sorts of ministerial labor in aid of the more prominent functions of political life . In some of these walks of duty , great abilities were necessary , in some , professional skill ; a measure of undoubted character for principles , in all . How was the selection to be made . That was one point of difficulty . To some extent , the people might be supposed competent to choose their own agents . This was eminently true in reference to the legislative and chief executive functions ; invoking services , which though of vast importance , were not of a kind to call for much technical knowledge or specific preparation , so that the leading business of the government , and that upon which all else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the general liberty required , namely , by votes sufficiently numerous to express the popular sentiment of the country . Had it not been so , the republican scheme must have altogether failed as impracticable . But legislation was no mystery of art , and the people could not well be mistaken in the kind of evidence by which the fitness of a legislative agent should be indicated . High standino ' for integrity , good sense and acquirements , with some experience in affairs , was all they wanted . So also , the executive function ( apart from its judicial subdivision ) could be judged of in a general way by everybody . And these are the parts of the system where it vas especially momentous that the people should be as closely and sensibly present as possible . But in descending from hence to other branches of the public service , such as the courts , particular bureaus , &amp;c. , the case became harder for the common mind to manage . It was not enough that candidates for such places were well reported of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOL . III . ) I0 . V. N*W SERIF. * . to the offices , a fitness of artificial skill , concerning which the multitude were scarce capable of forming an intelligent opinion . It would , therefore , be safer as to stations of that sort , to entrust the appointing power with persons of eminence in the government , who from their position might be expected to exert it more cautiously and discreetly than the people could . And fortunately , there was nothing in the economy of the public liberty that was likely to take harm from such an arrangement . Still , beyond the question how far it was best to organize the public service by popular vote , how far by substituted agencies , ( no inconsiderable question by itself , ) ulterior matters were to be attended to . There was danger of bad men 's coming into office through ignorance or incaution on the people 's part , or by the arts of deceivers ; and there was danger of men s becoming bad under the perverting influence of o cc , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be guarded against ? One expedient was that of dividino public power into several parts , called jurisdictions , and setting these in counterpoise against each other . Hence the wellknown legislative , executive , and judicial departments of govern meat , each under separate charge , and fenced , as far as practicable , gains encroachment from the rest . The early constitutious lay great stress upon this . Another expedient was the territorial division of the country into states , counties , and townships ; or rather the making use of these divisions ( they existed already ) to distribute the dispatch of public business over a wide surface , and so to prevent a plethory of the central system , and keep down the fe*r of the head by drawing off as much as possible of the elements of active power into the extremities . Other securities of a personal nature were added to these ; such as age , residence , property , religion , and the like ; required partly in candidates for office , partly in electors , more or less in both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine that all the guards and cautions which the case admitted of , were not likely to be more than enough . 32  |p849.  485 // But , in the second place , the sovereignly of the polls was also to be looked after . And here the first inquiry would naturally be directed to the proper vesting of this all-important power . Who should have it ? From whom should it be withheld ? For observe , it belonged of right to nobody , save ns the constitution should give it , being a mere functionary power , to be held , not for the special emolument of individuals , but in trust for the commonwealth . Who , then , in matter of safety and prudence , should have it , and who not ? Women and children were of course out of the question . It is incompatible with female delicacy to join the scramble of an electoral contest . And as for children , they could not understand the thing at all ; their votes would be no better than a lottery . So that two-thirds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . Would it do to clothe fresh-landed aliens with a suffrage of this kind ? How much better than children could they understand the use of it ? Or what stake have they in the country that could he supposed to give them a proper sense of concern in the consequences ? Finally , are there not native citizens in abundance to whom such a franchise can not be prudently confided ? - men without virtue , without intelligence , without property , without patriotic attachment , without anything to bind them to the country , or fit them for a voice in its affairs ? It is difficult , you will say , to apply tests . It is , indeed . But it is harder still to preserve free institutions without them . Our antipathy to tests is apt to become morhid . In some forms they are odious things , but in some they are necessary . So , at least , the fathers thought ; nor has their judgment in the matter fallen yet in to quite universal disrepute . - I conclude , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to suit their measures to the social and civil elements of the land they were providing for . What were those elements ? Different classes of men , distinguished from each other , not in rank or privilege , but in education , refinement property , habits , and pursuits . Was there not something due to such peculiarities ?  --  to each and every of them in particular ? Would it do to frame the government with a view to the rich only , or the educated and refined ? Would it do to frame it in utter neglect of these portions of the general mass of citizens , as if their existence were unknown . Government is moral power in the hands of a few over the many . The balance of physical force is with the governed . Supposing , then , the people to be free , the political system must in prudence be so fashioned as to please them , lest their physical force should not be quiet under it . And how , as a whole , are they to be pleased and satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and condition , are all taken into view , and made something of in the economy of the constitution ? Let us illustrate in the article of wealth or property . Some men are very rich , some poor , and some in middle circumstances . Would it be wise to take no note of this in framing a government for all ? Would it be safe ? Suppose numbers disregarded , and wealth made a test of admissihility to every kind of office whatsoever ; is it likely the poor and middle orders of society would be satisfied ? Or if property were disregarded , on the other hand , and not only the right of suffrage , but office too , in all its grades and forms , thrown indiscriminately to the multitude , would this be satisfactory to the more opulent classes ? There might , in one case or the other , he no sudden outbreak of impatience , but there would certainly be a leaven of discontent in the body politic , calculated to put it in a ferment by and by . All this should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is easier than to make some oices accessible to all ranks , and confine others to men of good estates ? Or , if you wish a property qualification to be general and uniform , let it be adjusted to the notion of a medium between rich and poor . As regards the franchise , there is no convenient alternative but to try for such a medium . For , since the men who have nothing are always more numerous than the rich , and often compose a majority of the whole people ; if you make the suffrage universal , you annihilate the influence 486 // of property ; while , on the other hand , if you give the poorer classes no vote , you annihilate the influence of numbers . Now , you should do neither of these things . Take t'he world as it is . Let those who pay the taxes , and bear the chief burdens of the state , have an influence directly proportioned to their usefulness and merit as citizens . This is just , and you can not otherwise make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore politic too . Yet do not hurry off to the other extreme , and stifle utterly the voice of mere numbers . Men who have nothing , are yet men ; and not a few of them are citizens of high desert . Their poverty may be owing to other causes than sloth , intemperance , or dissipation . It is not always the lot of industry or enterprise , or both together , to make large acquisitions . In a free country , the voice of the poor man , as well as of the rich , must have its share of political weight . There will otherwise be a feeling of injury here also . How , then , are you to manage ? As to office , there may be something like an apportionment , by opening the doors of certain employments to the property classes only , while others are made accessible to all ; but in the matter of the franchise , where one uniform rule may be desirable , I see no better way than to mediate between the very rich and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intervening portion of society , which approaches both extremes , and is capable of feeling for the interests of both , so as to vote impartially , and with probable satisfaction to the whole community . At any rate , the founders of our government seem to have acted upon a policy of this kind . We do not enter practically into such refinements now-a-days . We are too busy , and prefer a more dashing style of politics . Constitution-making is become a humdrum business . " Nature 's journeymen " can do it , and with cigars in their mouths . It was not so at first . A republican state was then regarded as a piece of moral clock-work ; a complicated mechanism , full of parts requiring the most careful and precise adjustment . And there were three great topics of interest combined in the general subject . First , . government proper ; secondly , the vesting . and qualification of the franchise of election ; thirdly , ( not apart from the others , . but in close connection with them , ) theac-. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for ends of justice and of popular peace . These topics claimed and received attention , each on its own account , and with an . anxious regard to its own occasions . The result was an economy of peculiar and very decided character , which I propose to examine with some care.
