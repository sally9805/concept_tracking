txt Two reasons induced us to obtain and read this volume . Its author is Dr. Stone . Its subject is Bishop Griswold . We have read one work from the pen of ' Dr. Stone , and are confident that whatever he publishes is worth reading . We are confident also , that those who have read the work to which we refer , or our account of it in the New Englander , wilt desire to hear further from the author . We have long heard of Bishop Griswold as one of the most evangelical among the bishops of the Episcopal church . We used to hear in childhood-from one who knew him well-of his faithful and self-denying labors as rector of a small parish , and of the acceptableness of his preaching to members of other churches than the Episcopal . We knew that he had an important influence while Bishop , in forming the character of the Episcopal denomination in the states east and north of Connecticut . And we thought that his memoir could not fail to interest us . We have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work by Dr. * Memoir of ' the Life of ' the Rt . Rev. Alexander Viets Griswold , D.

We knew that he was qualified for it by long and intimate acquaintance with Bishop Griswold , and a knowledge of his labors and their results . He was , when a youth , a member of one of the churches under his episcopal charge , and received the rite of confirmation at his hands . He was for some time rector of a parish in the immediate vicinity of three contiguous parishes , which , for nearly ten years , were the scene of Bishop Griswold 's early ministry . He was also for several years rector of St. Paul 's church in Boston , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which position he had abundant opportunities of intimate and thorough acquaintance with him . Dr. Stone has moreover the not less essential qualification of sympathy with the Bishop in his evangelical opinions and religious feelings . In the execution of the work , the author has evidently drawn largely on the impressions made by his familiar acquaintance with the man and his life , but more largely , he assures us , on the impressions made by the writings which Bishop Griswold left behind him , and on the remembrances of his most intimate friends . As the result , the author has given us a living , and we doubt not a faithful portrait of the man and of his life . The volume is very large-620 octavo pages . Our first impression was , that it is unwisely large-too // large to be read . But that impression passed away when we found , on examination , that a large part of it is a history of the Eastern diocese of the Episcopal church . It might be entitled not inappropriately , " A Memoir of Bishop Griswold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations concerning Bishop Griswold been disappointed . They have been more than realized . Our estimate of his character , especially of its intellectual features , has been greatly and legitimately raised . The early life of Bishop Griswold is interesting and important ; since it exhibits the influences which formed his character . He was born April 22 , 1766 , in Simsbury , Hartford County , Conn.  --  the son of a respectable farmer , a member of the Episcopal church ; so that it can not be said of him as it has been in some quarters , of bishops not fully Oxfordized , that he had " Puritanism in his bones . " He had early a great thirst for knowledge , and improved every opportunity for gratifying it which his circumstances afforded . His parents designed to educate him at Yale College . But the storms of the revolutionary war and the embarrassments and fines to which his parents , who , in common with the great majority of Episcopalians , were opposed to that war , were subjected , prevented the accomplishment of that design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered equivalent , under the instruction and in the good library of his maternal uncle , who was rector of the Episcopal church in Simsbury . His religious impressions and hopeful religious character , may be traced to an early period in his life . In his brief autobiography he says ,  --  " I had an early experience of the corn . forts of religious hope : how well founded it is not necessary now to enquire . At the age of ahout ten years , I was reduced by distressing sickness to the verge of the grave , and for several hours was supposed April , to he dying . Never can I forget with what lively hope and joy unspeakahle , amidst great hodily sufferings , I looked forward to the hlessedness of the heavenly state . Should it please the Lord at the time , now near at hand , when I shall he at the point to die , to vouchsafe me the like peace and joy in helieving , how could 1 worthily magnify his name . - p. 39 . His early piety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularity , which were remarkable , are in a great degree attributable to the influence of an excellent mother . The following is another of the numerous and noble records of the beneficent influence of maternal piety and taithfulness , and will be interesting to those who remember with gratitude and tears , the same beneficent influence beaming on their early years . " My case so far resembled that of Timothy that my mother 's name was Eunice , and my grandmother 's , Lois ; and that from both of them I received much early religious instruction . By their teaching , from a child 1 have known the holy Scriptures , which were ahle ( had I rightly used the knowledge ) to make me wise unto salvation . ' To the care of my mother , especially , instilling into my tender mind sentiments of piety , with the knowledge of Christ and the duty of prayer , I was much indehted .

At the conclusion of the war , his uncle , with whom he had lived , and by whose tuition and library he had been educated , removed to the British dominions . Young Griswold was invited and urged by him to accompany him , and share his fortunes . This offer he desired to accept . But there was a difficulty in the way . He was betrothed and too young for prudent marriage ; being only nineteen . It was concluded , however , that he should marry and remove . But his wife 's parents , having subsequently heard an unfavorable account of the cliDr . Stone 's Memoir of Bishop Griswold. // mate of the country , whither he was about to remove , were unwilling that their daughter should go thither . Thus his plans of life were frustrated , and the cares of a family very early devolved upon him .

" The difficulties with which he struggled in the acquisition of knowledge , before and after his decision to preach the gospel , may be inferred from a single sentence , quoted from his son in law , ( Rev. Dr. Tyng . ) " The events of his life , had been a discipline in very narrow circumstances , and the influence of this , he carried tAirou*h the whole of his succeeding years . His early marriage and his condiOon as a working farmer , rendered his education a series of difficulties .

He was admitted a candidate for orders in June , 1794 , and soon after began to preach in Northfield , Plymouth , and Harwinton , three parishes forming an equilateral triangle , each being about eight miles from the others . His salary was $300 , or $100 from each parish . This inadequate means of support he increassad by teaching school and by the labor of his hands . The following testimony on this subject , was given y one of his parishioners . " The parson and myself , have often worked out together as hired men , in harvest time , at seventy-five cents per day . He was a hard worker ; among the best day-laborers in town ; and one of his day's-works was worth as much as that of two common men. **p. l*3 .

In would hardly be deemed necessary , or even in place , now , for a clergyman to stipulate , in a contract with his parish , for liberty to attend conventions and convocatl ( Jns of the clergy , and to obey the directions of his Bishop .

He was ordained Bishop the 29th of May , 1811. the following account of this ordination is quoted from his autobiography , written after he had become by the death of Bishop White , and the previous death of *isbop Hobart , the senior on the Episcopal bench . " My consecration was at New York in 1811 . Why the ordination of a bishop should be so called , more than that of a deacon or presbyter , I do not know . The Rev. Dr. Hobart was ordained at the same time . Though he was several years younger than myself , was elected nearly a year after toy election , and was chosen to be hot an assistant bishop , still he was registered as roy secior , and uniformly had the precedence . The purpose of this partiality was that he , rather than I , should , in the probable course of events , be the presiding bishop . I would to God it mi*ht so have been .

The whole business has been much blessed to me in the sobduin* of a proud heart-pp. 163,166 . The reason assigned by Bishop XVhite , for this strange act of giving precedence to Dr. Hobart in these circumstances , was that Mr. Hobart was a Doctor in Divinity , audI there . fore , according to English custom , should have precedence of Mr. Griswold , who was not . That Bishop White , ' Dr. Stone remarks , " with his familiar knowledge of English cost oms , and with his attachment to English precedents , should have given the assigned reason undue weight , it is easy to conceive : hot it is not easy to conceive that , under the very peculiar circumstances of the case , he would have given that reason agoverni g weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , felt the pressure of a strong feeling , in action about him , and moving him in the direction which the service of consecration took . " - p. 167 . Of the precise nature of this " pressure of a strong feeling in action about him , " Dr. Stone does not inform us . But we well know that it may be analyzed into two parts ,  --  ( 1 . ) The feeling that Mr. Griswold was too much like a Puritan , was too evangelical in sentiment , not sufficiently staunch in his churchmanship , not sufficiently a stickler for the distinctive principles of Episcopacy , to be presiding bishop . And ( 2 . ) A feeling founded on the opinion that Dr. Hobart was so far the intellectual superior of Mr. Griswold , that he would much more honor the presidency of the Episcopal bench . This opinion we deem entirely unfounded . In evangelical piety , in clear perception and statement of truth , in perspicuous and chaste style of writing , in every thing except a popular eloquence , so florid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Griswold was decidedly superior to Dr. Hobart . Bishop Griswold after his consecration still continued his pastoral care of the church in Bristol , to which he assiduously devoted himself , except when necessarily employed in the duties of his episcopate. rfhese duties were very arduous , for his diocese was composed of parishes scattered here and there through Rhode Island , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Vermont and Maine . In the year 1829 , he removed from Bristol , and took the pastoral charge of a church in Salem . Ia 1835 , standing on the verge of threescore and ten , he relinquished the charge of a parish , and devoted himself wholly to the care of his diocese ; having been a laborious parish minister for forty years , twenty-four of which were occupied with the double duties of the parish and the diocese . He im // mediately removed to Boston , where he spent the remainder of his days . In 1836 , by the decease of Bishop White , he became senior bishop and president of the house of bishops . In 1842 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bishop Griswold , elected an assistant bishop , Rev. Dr. Easthurn , who was consecrated on the 29th of December of that year . Though thus relieved greatly as to his anxieties and duties by the ordination of an assistant in the vigor of life , the aged Bishop did not cease from active labor . " His favorite scriptural motto , " says his biographer , " we will give ourselves continually to prayer and the ministry of the word ; ' together with his emphatic quotation from Jewel , A bishop shall die preaching , ' still governed his actions ; and he went about as usual , doing the work of an evangelist and strengthening the churches , insomuch that in little or nothing were his customary activities diminished . " The close of his life is thus appropriately and beautifully recorded . " In the closing incidents of his life , there was somethin * exceedingly peculiar . On Saturday , the 11th of Fcbruary , 1843 , the aged bishop closes his essays on the Reformation ; the last sentence of which contains these words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the testimony ; ' use the liberty wherewith Christ bath made you free ; Search the Scriptures , ' and pray God so to enlighten your minds , that you may truly understand them . " This done , he lays down his pen , and proceeds to a neighboring town to meet an official appointment . The morning of Wednesday , the 15th , however , finds him at home again , and girding himself for further work . At his usual early hour , he gathers his family around him , and reads the sacred page . The chapter in course is the first in the Epistle to the Philippians , - in which the following passage arrests a special attention : For me to live is Christ , and to die is gain . But , if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labor ; yet what I shall choose , I wot not ; for I am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart and to be with Christ , which is far better . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Closing the book , he now commends his household , in morning prayer , to their Father in heaven ; listens to the music of a favorite air , whose pensive strain is in harmony with his spirit ; and then enters on the customary duties of the day . As it wears towards its close , one of those duties calls him to the residence of Bishop Easthurn . Thither , therefore , he sets forth ; and , with his usual firm step , he approaches the house . Here , however , he finds himself , in an instant , amidst the scenes , which blend eternity with time . The last sand in the glass of his life drops . His step falters , and he falls ; - rises again , and reaches the door . It was the limit of his race . With his last step he bows his head to the threshold and-dies . In the presence of his son in the church , he rests at once from his labors ; and without a sigh or a groan , feels mortality swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And thus , long warned , yet at last unwarned ,  --  this faithful servaiit closed his toils and laid down his commission , yielded his ready spirit , and dropped his rich mantle , at the very feet of him , who had been sent to stand up in liii stead , to carry forward his work and to ripen into his graces-pp. 546 , 547 . Having given this summary account of the life of Bishop Griswold , we will dwell briefly on such features of his character as have interested us , and will probably interest our readers . Bishop Uriswold was truly evangelical in his theology and preaching . He fully believed that man is by nature a guilty being , and , as guilty , condemned of God , and beyond self-recovery lost , needing a propitiation for sin , and a radical change of character . He believed , that the only and sufficient ground of pardon is the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ ; that the condition of pardon is an entire change of moral character by repentance and faith in Christ ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Spirit , as the dispensation of the truth , chiefly as it is declared and enforced by the preaching of the Word . He believed in justification , not by sacraments , but by faith alone . His earlier ministrations , however , though never erroneous , were more full of the precepts than of the peculiar doctrines of the Gospel , from which those precepts derive their life . // " His early preaching , " says his biographer , " like that which generally prevailed in our church at that time , was rather moral than evangelical : that is , devoted more to the illustration and enforcement of the moral precepts and virtues of Christianity , than to the development and application of the spiritual truths and doctrines of the gospel . lie was , indeed , neither ignorant nor regardless of the latter ; still , his religious views had not then so clearly unfolded theniselves as to bring these latter out into unconcealable prominence , and make them seen every where , as the all-pervading , vital soul oftheformer . He never seems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to the humhliug doctiines of the cross , to have designedly and deliberately placed his dependence for making men better on the inculcation of mere morality ; hut , like many other good men before him in the English and American Episcopal churches , his whole body of divinity had been cast rather into that shape , which gave the morality of the gospel chief prominence , with a sort of occasional pointing inwards , or downwards , to something spiritual as its source , or its foundation ; than into that order which shows the spiritual truths and doctrines of the cross as the very fountainhead of pure and living morality , pouring forth incessant streams of virtue and godliness over all the life ; and as that divinely laid foundation in the soul , which , alone , can support a solid and an unfailing fabric of moral virtues in the character . In short , he , at that time , rather orerlooked than disliked what are termed " the doctrines of grace ; " he preached what was practical , though without prejudice against what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day against Galvinism , though without the slightest feeling of aversion of the gospel of the Caivinists. " - pp. 78 , 79 . But soon after leaving Connecticut , he adopted a more thoroughly evangelical mode of preaching . In his autobiography he remarks " I carried with me to Bristol too much of the prejudice and bigotry , which I had imbihed in Connecticut . There was still remaining among Episcopalians not a little of that proud contempt of the Puritans , and of what was termed fanaticism , which belonged to the so called Old School , ' whose origin may he said to date in the reign of the second Charles of England . Adopting the practice of my brethren , whom I thought wiser than myselg my preaching had been far too much on sectarian distinctions , and topics of controversy , especially against high Calvinism and schismatics and quite too frequently April , in defense of the distinctive principles of the Protestant Episcopal church , to the too great neglect of the essential doctrines of Christ , and of the necessary duties of Christians . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief among other denominations that churchmen , as we were then called , were hut formalists and bigots ; regarding the church more than religion , and the Prayer-hook more than the Bible ; departing from their own articles and homilies , and destitute of true piety and renovation of heart . And much mortified , grieved and humbled have I formerly been , that these things should be so much said , and I so little able to refute them . Pudet hiec opprobria nobis , Et dici potuisse , et non potuisse , refelli . ' To God 's praise , not ours , he it said , that at the present time a far better state of things among us prevails . " And not only are things in a better state now , but even then , this bigotry and sectarian spirit were , I have reason to believe , more prevalent in Connecticut than in other portions of our church . this was owing , no doubt , to their peculiar circumstances and trials , as well as to the character of a State formerly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found a materially different condinion of things . Those of my sermons , which , in Connecticut , had appeared to be most acceptable and were most applauded , gave offense in Bristol , Providence and Newport ; and I soon found that , by continuing the controversial style of preaching , some of the most pious of her members would be driven from the church . This was particularly true ofthose called Methodists . " - pp. 11i* , 120 . Dr. Stone adds " When he wrote the last extract , at the age of seventy-four , he was far from being , religiously , the same man as when he kept the Methodists from uniting urmder his ministry by a style of preaching , which has , no doubt , in numberless other instances , been the means of shutting out from our church her best materials for growth , and even of expelling from her veins some of her own best life-blood . Experience has , I apprehend , demonstrated that the best way of extending the institutions of our Episcopacy is not found in asserting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no church ; ' or in a course , which shows that there is more heart , more zeal , and more ability in preaching church government and church polity , than in preaching Jesus Christ and him crucified . " - pp. // type of Episcopacy in Connecticut , which seems to have had such an unfavorable influence on Mr. Griswold 's early ministrations , has not , we fear , improved very greatly since that time , if we may judge from such effusions as " The Errors of the Times , " and " Revivalism and the Church . " In a sermon which he delivered when Bishop elect , before the first Convention of the Eastern diocese in 1810 , he says " This then is the word which we are to preach ; that Jesus Christ is the Lord our righteousness , who died for our sins , and rose again for our justification , and that eternal salvation is to be obtained through faith in his merits . This was the subject of St. Paul 's preaching , who ' testified , both to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ . ' Such should be the theme of our discourses . Whatever we teach and however good in itself , which has no respect to the Redeemer , nor our salvation through him , is not his gospel , nor is it the word , in the Apostle 's sense . We must preach the doctrines of the Savior 's cross ; such as the sinful , fallen state of man ; the redemption , which is through his blood ; the necessity of a conversion from sin , and renovation of the heart , through the sanctifying influence of the Divine spirit , with the insufficiency of our best deeds and merit , and of our natural strength to attain acceptance with God and eternal life . We must preach repentance toward God , ' as the necessary preparation for his heavenly kingdom , and the comforts of the gospel . We must set forth faith toward our Lcrd Jesus Christ , ' as the condition of salvation through his blood ; as the element of Christianity ; as the life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge to the clergy of his diocese in 1814 , he thus addresses them : " It is certain , that thousands , and tens of thousands are led to believe , that we neglect the essentials of religion ; that we do not teach the depravity of human nature ; the necessity of conversion ; the renewal of the heart by the Holy Spirit ; and that we are justified , not by our works , but by our faith in the merits and sacrifice of Jesus Christ . Our articles , you.will say , may teach them the contrary . True : but they may not read our articles ; or they may think , that we do not reed them . Let us teach them the contrary . Let the true doctrines of our church , on these points , be clearly and often taught , according to their importance . Add line upon line , and precept upon precept , till prejudice shall give place to conviction , in teaching our flocks , let us carefully en ( leavor to lay the foundation of repentance , faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteousness , without this foundation , is like building a house upon the sand . " - p. 6t9 . The importance of preaching those essential truths of the Gospel which are the common faith of all evangelical Christians , and the danger of giving undue prominence to the peculiarities of Episcopacy , seemed to press upon his mind with great weight , and with increasing weight as his vision was more and more clarified by his nearness to the final goal and the light of heaven . In an annual address delivered in 1839 , towards the close of his life , we find this affecting sentence . " I am not without fears that I may have devoted too much of my time to preaching the Church rather than Christ . The doctrines of his cross are the most effectual in converting the heart and saving the soul . The fallen state of man , redemption by Jesus Christ , and justification through faith in his sacrifice for our sins , should be the main subjects of our public sermons , and of our teaching from house to house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alas ! if he had such fears of bestowing a disproportionate attentioi* upon the building , to the neglect of its living occupant , albeit the great burthen of his long ministry had been JesusChrist and him crucified ; ' what must be the sad retrospect of some , when , from a death-bed , or at the judgment day , they are called to review their ministerial lives , and to see with what heated toils they have all along been working on the church , and with what lack of zeal they have urged the gospel of Him , who is Lord of the church . " - p. 415 . The evangelical principles and spirit of Bishop Griswold are seen not only in his sermons and addresses , but in the measures which he adopted for the promotion of vital piety in the ministry and the 1845. 233 // churches . Those measures which were practiced with success by other denominations for this purpose , he fully adopted in his own denomination . In his autobiography he writes : *k.O far as I know , I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold eveneng lectures . Though this is now a thing so common , yet it was then by many of our good people exceedingly disliked . Our Bishop in Connecticut once observed in my hearing , night preaching and pulpit praying are two things which I abhor . ' * But other denoininationspracticed both ; and soon after my settlement in Bristol I found that many of my parishioners attended their meetings ; and it was , cit first . from fear of the result of their straying away among those , who appeared to have more zeal , that I proposed to our vestry , and with difficulty obtained their leave , to open my church for a third service on Sunday evenings . I have had reason to believe that this was the most fruitful part of my ministry , because more people attended at the third service , than at the other two , not a few of whom attended our service at no other time . I continued the practicu of three services every Sunday for thirty years ; so long indeed as I had a parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 122 . He also held evening meetings of a more familiar and social character . We quote the following account of one from Dr. Tyng , who was at the time referred to , a student of theology with the Bishop . " When I had been in Bristol about a week , the Bishop observed to me one day , I wish you to attend a meeting with nie in the country this evening , and I will call for you after tea . ' He came accordingly ; and we walked about a mile to a neighborhood , called The Neck ; ' where the rooms of a farm-house were entirely filled with people , waiting his arrival . He sat down among them at a little table , and , after singing and prayer , expounded to them a chapter in the Epistle to the Romans , in that familiar and simple manner , in which he so much excelled , and in which all , who listened to him , were deeply interested . I can not describe the impressions which this whole occasion made upon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarly walked out with a youth * Here we see again the tJonnecticut type of Episcopacy. like me ; the perfectly unassuming manner , in which he appeared among the rustic congregation , assembled to meet him ; the simplicity and tenderness of his discourse ; the tremulous sweetness of his voice , as he raised the tune in singing ; were all such new and striking facts to me , that I was surprised as well as delighted with the whole occasion . It immediately obviated all the objections , which I could have imagined against meetings of this kind ; while it interested my heart in them as an important means of spiritual good . The Bishop opened this service with a selection of prayers from the Liturgy , and closed it with an extemporaneous prayer , in which duty lie excelled almost all , whom I have ever heard . " - pp. 512 , 513 . His weekly meetings , Dr. Tyng informs us , were usually of this social and private character . Bishop Griswold also encouraged and zealously promoted meetings for social prayer , among his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond , " says Dr. Tyng , " of social religious meetings among his people , and had a high opinion of their value and influence . " His biographer informs us that these prayer-meetings originated as early as the year 1812 , and were the attendants or fruits of a remarkable revival of religion in the Bishop 's parish . But such a Puritan and unrubrical measure , though very primitive " and " apostolical * could not escape opposition . Some very sound churchmen , terrified at the danger with which these prayermeetings threatened sound churchmanship , attacked them and their patrons , in a sermon published in the Gospel Advocate , an Episcopal journal issued in Boston . The attack was kept up both by the editor and his correspondents . Bishop Griswold , though exceedingly averse to controversy , felt impelled , by a sense of duty , to prepare a series of articles in defense of prayer-meetings . But the paper which had contained the attack refused to publish the Bishop 's defense . Excluded thus from the columns of a journal issued in the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defer the publication of his defense of prayermeetings for two years , when it appeared in the Episcopal Register , a journal started at that time in Vermont . " The influence , " says Dr. Stone , " of ' this publication was powerfully felt , as well it might be ; for , it is believed , that no one , with a Christian spirit in his heart , whatever may have been his previous prejudices against Episcopal prayer-meetings , can rea ( l it without fcelin ' with its a ' author , that If , after due consideration , our sober and most candid judgment is unfavorable to these ' meetings , the safer way is to let them alone . We can not be too careful not to be found fighting against God . " The spirit , in which he defended the meetings and those who joined in them , may be judged from a sentence , which I find in the 5th chapter of the work . If it be admitted , ' he says , that the meetings are according to the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless those , who unite in fervent supplication , it must , according to the Scriptures , be expected that men will oppose them . They , who cry earnestly to their Savior for mercy and grace , may be rebuked that they should hold their peace ; but , in such case , they will do well , like some in the Gospel , to cry the more ; Have mercy on us , 0 Lord , thou son of David . ' " - pp. 331 , 332 . " The hook , " adds the biographer , " ought to be reprinted , and read by every member of our church . " We wish , but can hardly hope , that it may be . Let us now contrast with the course of Bishop Griswold respecting prayer-meetings , the course on the same subject of Bishop Hobart , who was preferred before him , not because he was before hitn , but because his churchmanship was larger in proportion to his Christianity . In a sermon published by Bishop Hobart in 1810 , he speaks thus : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devotions of her members assembled in the congregation , under their authorized ministers . Private associations for this purpose she dare not countenance . Among other communities of Christians , for aught she knows , they may be harmless ; they may prove edifying . But experience , raising a warning voice in the sad pages of her history , proves , that within her bosom , they have been the nurseries of ' enthusiasm and spiritual pride ; the engines by which ambition cloaked under the mantle of extraordinary sanctity , has excited against her sober order the rage of ignoraiit fanaticism , and whelmed in ruin her fairest forms .

Another , by his advice and influence , was formed in Massachusetts , though for a long time its formation was prevented , and its existence afterwards was troubled , by opposition from those of his clergy who were specially zealous for churebmanship . His biographer speaks of these associations as " the Bishop 's favorite measure for the increase of active piety and zeal throughout his diocese . Here , too , Bishop Griswold stands in honorable contrast with the man who was unjustly preferred before him . We have before us a pastoral letter addressed by Bishop Hobart to the clergy and laity of his diocese in people . Private associations for devotion site ( the church ) dare not countenance .

She seized a watch lying near her , and throwing it on the floor , exclaimed , in her anguish , I shall be lost , as sure as that watchglass is broken ! ' Her husband , taking up the watch , which happened not to be injured , said , in his truly unique manner , You go to hell ! Humph ! And what would you do there ?

Its author says , " Of the many harassing events of a trying episcopate of eighteen years , none has given me more pain than the one which , in my conscientious judgment , has rendered tiecessary this letter . " What was it that so harassed the Right Reverend prelate , and laid on his conscience the burden of this duty ? It was the formation of a " Protestant Episcopal Clerical Association , in the city of New York , for the promotion of the personal piety and the official usefulness of its members , by devotional exercises and by conversation on missionary and such other subjects as may conduce to mutual edification.

This would indeed have been the climax of iniquity . An association of educated ministers of Christ praying without " a well ordered prescribed form of devotion . " ! Horrible ! As bad as a praying people . The bare anticipation that some of his " inferior clergy " should be kindled into such fervor of pious feeling , in an association for the promotion of piety , as to fall to extempore praying , might well have " harassed " and // " pained " the Right Reverend Father and apostolic leader . Paul or Peter would doubtless have been exceedingly troubled by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their day . Thus , while Bishop Griswold was endeavoring to institute and prosper clerical meetings , for the increase of active piety , against the opposition of the **30;0;TOOLONG of his diocese , Bishop Hobart , in his diocese , was putting down such meetings , by the fulminations of Episcopal authority . We make these contrasts because it is due to Bishop Griswold to show against what influences he contended in his efforts to promote vital religion , and that he was foremost in his own denomination in the adoption of evangelical measures . We make them , that the relative justice , which , on account of his modesty and humility , was withheld from him when living , may be accorded to him when dead . We might also make these contrasts as an example of the unity of which the Church so loudly boasts . The evangelical character of Bishop Griswold was manifested also in his just appreciation and advocacy of revivals of religion . Soon after his ordination as bishop , there was a remarkable revival of religion in his parish , the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the year 1812 , there was in Bristol an awakened attention to the subject of religion , which was very wonderful , and the like of which I had never before witnessed . It commenced among the members of my parish , when no such thing was looked for , nor indeed thought of . No unusual efforts had been made with any view to such an excitement . My administering of confirmation in the parish a few months previously had not improbably some effect . My recent ordination to the episcopate was the means of awakening my own mind to more serious thoughts of duty as a minister of Christ ; and in consequence I had , no doubt , with more earnest zeal preached Jesus Christ and him crucified . ' The change , which I first noticed was the appearance of increased s*ousness in the congregation ; especially on leaving the church after service . 1 ' here was little orno laughing , or merry salutation among the people ; neither talking of worldly things . After the benediction , and a minute of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to express a religious concern respecting their spiritual state , and were anxious to know what they should do to be saved . ' " " In consequence of this awakened and increasing inquiry , I began to meet with them one or two evenings in the week , not only that we might unite in praying that they might be led into the way of truth , and enjoy the comforts of hope , and of peace in believing , but that I might save time to myself and them , by conversing at the same time with a number who were in the same state of mind . I soon found that the number of sticli inquirers had increased to about thirty ; and in a very short time the awakening was general through the town , and very wonderful . " - pp. 178 , 179 . The result was , that a hundred were added to his church . " These facts , " says Dr. Stone , " were among the best credentials which he ever received , that God had indeed commissioned him to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another extraordinary awakening occurred under his labors in the year 1820 . " An alarming declen sion from religious life was found spreading through his flock . The weekly evening meetings were thinly attended . And aged Christians were mourning over the manifest decay , and longing for the return of days when the Divine Spirit , in rich demonstrations of his power had been known to rest on the ministration of the word and ordinances of God 's house-p. 518 . The Bishop had been very anxious and depressed on this account , and had appointed for this reason an extra meeting . " So keenly did anxiety for his people pierce and wound his heart , that it evidently became , if not the sole , yet the aggravating cause of the calamity , which speedily befell him . On the succeeding Wednesday evening , his congregation assembled for a continuance of his new series of lectures . He went through the services as usual ; - but , in the midst of his discourse , he was suddenly seized // with an illness , which compelled him to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber , where for weeks his ife hung in imminent peril . " " The public services were of course closed , the moment he left his pulpit . But the congregation were deeply affected by the event , which had interrupted them . It proved the most powerful sermon that God ever sent them by his servant . The affliction , which they felt , and their consciousness that their own lukewarmness was aggravating the sufferings of their beloved pastor , were made the means of an immediate and extensive spiritual awakening . In various parts of the church , religious anxiety and alarm were instantly manifest . Little knots of people were seen gathered , here and there , round those who were before becoming interested in time subject of religion , and who were now awakened to mourn for sin . The voice of social prayer was heard among them ; especially that of aged Christians , who , after suitable conversation with them , were earnestly commending their case to God . It was a late hour before the people were content to retire ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind from that , in which they had assembled . Subsequent evidence showed that the awakening in the parish was universal , even among those , who did not attend the lecture that evening . " " From this time , for many weeks , the subject of religion , the salvation of their souls ,  --  engrossed the thoughts of all . " " As in the former case , in 1812 , the work was not confined to his own parish . The other congregations in the town were largely , perhaps equally , blessed . " - pp. 518-521 . Here too Bishop Griswold stands in honorable contrast with the man who , owing to " the pressure of a strong feeling " in the Episcopal community , was preferred before him . In a sermon at the consecration of Henry U. Onderdonk , D. D. , assistant bishop of Pennsylvania , in 1828 , entitled , " The Christian Bishop approving himself unto God , in reference to the present state of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States , " Bishop Hobart makes this declaration : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the term of revivals of religion ' is usually applied , that the bishop of our church must , in duty to the highest interests of rational and fervent piety , bear his testirno fly . " " Evils , sad evils nre they , bearing devastation and desolation in their course-in the spiritual world , sweeping before them the courtesies of society , the affections of domestic life , the fair forms of rational and sober piety , and leaving , at last , the waste of disorder , misrule and fanaticism , where the human passions riot , over which the friends of genuine religion tnourn , and the scoffer raises the laugh of scorn . " ! Had Bishop Hobart , instead of warning Bishop H. U. Onderdonk to avoid the " popular religious excitements termed revivals of religion , " exhorted him , by engaging in the temperance reformation , to avoid the excitement caused by drinking wine and brandy , that unhappy prelate might not have come to an end so disgracefttl to himself , and so mortifying to the Episcopal church . And had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official influence in his own diocese , " the popular religious excitements termed revivals of religion , " exerted that same influence in favoring the temperance reformation , and thus opposing the excitement of wine and brandy drinking , his successor , Bishop B. T. Onderdonk , might not have " swept before " him " the courtesies of society and the affections of domestic life , " and come to an end of official duty " over which the friends of genuine religion mourn , and the scoffer raises the laugh of scorn . " The evangelical character of Bishop Griswold is , moreover , illustrated by the fact , that he was the friend , and in the Episcopal church among the earliest friends of missions to the destitute at home and to the heathen . He lamented the comparative apathy which prevailed on this subject in the Episcopal church . In his charge in 1814 , he remarks : " In America , and in England , there are missionary societies , which have manifested a zeal for propagating the Gospel , becoming those who profess it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actuated by its heavenly principles . But the barvest is immensely great , and the laborers yet but very few . With sorrow too and with shame must we add , that our church has taken but little part in this good work-p. 609 . In the year 1815 , the Rev. Josiah Pratt , the secretary of " the Church Missionary Society " of London , addressed a circular letter to several of the leading members of the Episcopal church in the United States , with the design of awakening attention to the work of missions . This letter and its subject were noticed favorably and at length , in Bishop Griswold 's charge of that year . The letter was also answered by him with becoming Christian zeal . This answer was favorably noticed , and a considerable portion of his pastoral letter and charge pertaining to missions was published in the " Missionary Register " for 1816 , at which time his was the only answer to Mr. Pratt 's circular letter that had been received . Against much opposition , Bishop Griswold steadfastly endeavored to bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1818 he notices " his correspondence with the secretary of the Church Missionary Society in England ; the steps which had been taken to encourage the formation in this country of an Episcopal Foreign Missionary Society ; and the fact that its formation at that time had been deemed by our bishops and clergy inexpedient and even impracticable . " ' He also says , " another and more serious difficulty under which we labor , is the almost total want of missionary funds . It is to be feared , or rather it can not be denied , that no other body of Christians in the United States is so inattentive to this important thing as ourselves . " Having seen that Bishop Griswold was truly evangelical , we should expect to find that he was thoroughly Protestant . He was so . He held firmly the Protestant principle-the Bible the sole and sufficient rule of faith and practice . He never nullified that rule by the qualification , " as interpreted by the church during the Jirst two centuries . " He rejected altogether the dogma of Churchinterpretation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptures . " He believed that the Bible was to be interpreted by individuals , with the help of human learning indeed , but chiefly by its own light and the illumination and guidance of the Holy Spirit . His biographer remarks ,  --  " He was far from agreeing with those , who consider the ordination of a bishop as investing him , by a sort of miraculous or mysterious transmission , with the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost , or with the marvelous power of continuing an alleged perpetual incarnation of Christ in the visible body ofbis cburch. " - p. 16* . He was exceedingly averse to controversy . But when the great principles and doctrines of the Protestant reformation were endangered , he was firm and energetic . The following passage will illustrate the mode in which he rebuked the incipient developments of " Oxfordism " or semi-Romanism within his own diocese . Speaking on the subject of the construction of churches , and of a particular church in P- , he observes : " I was pained in noticing the uncouth and inconvenient arrangement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reminded of the absurdity of going back to the dark ages of Christianityfor the models ofour churches , or for the manner of worshiping in them ; or of adopting any of the fooleries of ignorance and superstition . God requires us to act as rational beings , not as idolatrous heathen . All the services sbould be performed in a place and manner the most commodious to the minister and the people . Whether be preaches , or prays , or administers the ordinances of Christ , be should be in the view of each and of all the congregation present . And in prayer , it is quite as fitting that he should face them , as that they should face him . To turn from them to the communion table , implies the supposition that God is particularly present there , and sanctions the abo*uinable doctrine of Transubstan* // tiation . God has promised to dwell in the hearts of His worshiping people ; and Christ has expressly declared that where a few of them are gathered together in his name , there he is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Christ is , hy his Spirit , among the people ; but we have no assurance that he is on the table more than in any other part of the church . Our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost . But God has no visible representation on the earth , and forbids our making any ; His likeness is to be formed in our hearts . " " More briefly , hut in the same tone , he noticed the peculiarities in the other of the two churches , to which I have referred . " " With sorrow I add , " ( after having noticed the pecuniary condition of the parish , ) " that I was pained and mortified at the strange derangement of the readingdesk and the communion-table , and at other exhibitions within the chancel , evidently corresponding with the idolatrous conceits ofChristians in those corrupt ages of the church , which some affect to call primitive . " * * " Let us not look back to Egypt , lest we perish intize wilderness . " - pp. 424-426 . The committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to the Bishop . His answer exhibits the practices and changes which he condemned , and his views of them . " There was then a very convenient reading-desk , and such a one is among the greatest conveniences in the perfiurmance of divine service . Since that time , I have observed that it is all torn away , and I believe cut to l ) ieces ; though this I will not affirm . Then , also , there was a communion-table , very suitable and in sight of the whole congregation . Since , I have seen instead an edifice , like a Popish altar , above a flight of many steps , very inconvenient for ministrations at the Lord 's table ; and there were too evidently indications of idolatrous reverence paid to it . I saw also a picture standing at the hack of the altar , such as the Papists avowedly and very much worship . Pictures were introduced into churches about the 7th and 8th centuries . The more pious Christians opposed it strenuously , and foretold , what soon happened , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what should be the communion-table , I saw flowers strewn ; - and there too stood candles in the daytime : whether they are ever lighted in the day-time , I did not inquire . These , too , are among the superstitious fooleries of the dark ages . ' " " Your minister wore such a dress as I had never before seen ; and some of the trappings and other parade , I have reason to believe , were omitted on that occasion . But I saw enough to justify , in my own mind , what I have said on the subject . " - pp. 443 , 444 . In his " thoughts on church matters , " he observes " It is often said that our articles are good and spiritual ; but that our people depart from them . Is there no ground for this reproach " It can not be denied that some of our people , our clergy especially , contend earnestly for things of little importance ; while they say little , or speak lightly of the articles , which are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that would judge him to be no churchman , who neglects to wear a surplice , or , in some mere ceremony , deviates from a rubric ; while yet they themselves receive the Articles with mental reservations , or construe them differently from their obvious sense , and evident meaning ; in the language of our blessed Savior , strain at a gnat , and swallow a camel . ' To be true and consistent friends of the church , we must maintain all its standards , and observe alt its institutions , and contend most earnestly for things of most importance : and nothing can be of more importance than the faith , by which alone we can hope to be justified , and the doctrines of eternal life , which we are to preach to mankind . " - pp. 573 , 574 . In the year 1826 , a proposal was made at the triennial meeting of the Episcopal General Convention , by some of the bishops , to introduce certain " alterations in the Book of Common Prayer , " " chiefly for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning service . " This proposal having been referred to the conventions of the several dioceses for their consideration , Bishop Griswold published a series of articles in the Episcopal Register , on the subject of an " improvement of the Liturgy , " in which he took ground against the proposed alterations because they were not sujjlciently thorough " He doubtless believed " says Dr. Stone , " the Liturgy susceptible of improvement , and would have been willing to see it really 240 April , // improved . But his object in this series of essays was in truth to prevent the specific alterations which had been proposed , by showing that if any thing were done , something more and other than had been recommended was desirable . In short , he would have the Liturgy either left untouched , or touched to better purpose than that which the convention had in view . " The italics in this quotation are ours . We should like to see this series of essays , and wish that the biographer had given some further account of the positions taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments , and from the fact that on account of those essays he was charged with " want of attachment to the Liturgy and the church , " that he wished such a reformation of the Liturgy as would conform it to evano*elical doc trine. a In the closing view of the Bishop 's character , Dr. Stone remarks : " After what has already been written , it is almost needless to add here , that Bishop Griswold was too thoroughly a Protestant to look , without growing apprehension , upon the theological tendencies of certain portions of our church , both in England and in America . He had been too good a student of the Bible , and , it may be added , of antiquity too , to feel a moment 's hesitation on the question , what stand he ought to take in a controversy so pregnant with influences on our future religious and ecclesiastical destiny ? He descried our coming dangers in this controversy more clearly than the mass of his own clergy and people ; or than the mass of our clergy and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as truly Catholic , it may be said he loved her most for that great principle , on which , under Protestant auspices , she based herself at the Reformation ; the sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures as the sole rule of faith , and the only infallible guide in practice , to every man that honestly and earnestly seeks for the salvation which is in Christ Jesus . " He often urged the study of the Bible upon every man , as being full of the Spirit of God ; as evincing their own sufficiency , through the teachings of that Spirit , to guide the inquiring mind to the Savior ; and as demonstrating thus its Divine Author 's intention , that it should be put , un sealed , into the hands of every one ,  --  His own rich , free gift to the world . He held that these inspired Scriptures were God 's storehouse of spiritual food for the life and health of the human family ; and , like our ordinary food , to be kept accessible to every human soul . He rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority with the written Word , necessary to the true interpretation of that Word , and of right binding its interpretation on the conscience of every member of the church . He did not , indeed , reject aids to the interpretation of the Bible , whether those aids were ancient or modern ; but , he did refuse to consider any thing necessary as its infallible interpreter , save its own self-interpreting light , and the teachings of that Holy One , by whom it was dictated . He taught that the Bible alone , of all things now accessible , is given by inspiration of God ; ' that its curses lie on every one , who adds to it , or takes from it ; and that , when read by the honest mind , with the prayer of a devout heart , it is , in itself and to the full of all human needs , profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction and for instruction in righteousness ; that the man of God , ' be he preacher , or be he reader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " Taking this view , as fundamental to the true system of theology , as going before all right views of particular doctrines , he held it at the opening of his niinistry , and on through all his subsequent ministrations . And yet , towards the close of his labors , he gave it even a marked prominence . When he saw the church of his affections , in this country as well as in England , drawn into peril by the labors of a school , who were avowedly seeking to un-protestantize her , by leading her ba *k , through the labyrinth of tradition , first , to sacramental justification ; then to the miracle-working powers of a sacrificing priesthood ; and finally , to other prodigies of a night of superstition : when he contemplated changes , like these , the effect of which , when reached , will be , to put Christ once more into awful distance , instead of keeping him near , the loved friend , the only , the uiassociated Savior of the lost ; and , at length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behind a dense cloud of saints canonized by man , of shrines glittering with the offerings of wealth , or of shows awful amidst the display of pomp : when he looked upon a system , which , in its fuller developments , does little more than make the church one of the kingdoms of this world ; while it leaves the sinner to perish in his blindness , hogging a delusion , yet thinking it salvation : when he saw the fruits of the Reformation put amidst the peril of are1845. 241 // turn even towards such a system as this , unsavory to his taste as was the work of controversy , he hesitated not to step forth in the service of our church , and , as one of her chief ministers , to do what he could for her safety . Though , when he begun the series of essays , to which I have referred , he had many other things in hand , yet , ere he finished it , it became his last work : and well did he achieve the task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in his own clear style , full of the light of the Bible , and evincing the yet undimmed powers of his mind , demonstrates irrefutably the necessity and the glory of the great Reformation ; and shows incontestably that our church can never recede from the stand , which at that period she assumed , without proving at once false to herself and faithless to her Savior. ' - pp. 454-457 . We are enabled also to add , that Bishop Griswold was , in the true sense of the word , Catholic. * He rejected the unchurching dogma which , alas ! many very inconststently adopt who are evangelical in preaching , ( i. e. they preach what are called the doctrines of grace , ) and are Protestant in opposition to " Oxfordisrn . " Dr. Stone remarks on this point as follows : " In the foregoing letters from Mr. Cornwall and Mr. Chase , so far as they express , or imply , apprehensions of danger from the growth and prevalence of Socinian errors in New England , the Bishop deeply sympathized ; but , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church to other bodies of New England Christians , it is not probable that they met with any very cordial response from him . The Bishop was every inch an Episcopalian ; but he never thought that the church of Christ can not , in any sense , exist without Episcopacy , any more than he thought that the human body ceases to be a body , when it has lostits right hand , but has still head and heart united in right relations , and both of them sound , healthy and active . He saw and felt the dangcrs , to which other denominations are exposed ; but he considexed them Christian churches , and rejoked in all the good , of which they were instruments . His feelings on this sub- We have been informed by a Congregational pastor , who once preached in the vicinity of Bristol , that Bishop Griswold and he often held prayer-meetings together , in which they united their de*otionai exercises and their exhortations. ject were , in his own peculiar way , expressed in connection with the following incident . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of his episcopal visitations , and in company , I believe , with Mr. Strong of Greenfield , he passed many houses of worship belonging to the orthodox Congregationalists , Baptists and Methodists ; but not one belonging to Episcopalians . The fact elicited remark , in the course of which the Bishop observed : As we have passed along , I have been thinking what the people of our State would do , if they could not find religion except by seeking it in our church ? ' " - p. 221 . In his " thoughts on church matters , " Bishop Griswold remarks : " Some are unwilling to distribute the Bible without the Prayer-book ; alleging as a reason , that the church of God should go with the word of God . This , however , implies that there is a church not to be found in the Bible-p. 577 . The following logical annihilation of Episcopal exclusiveness has often proceeded from non-Episcopal authors . We are happy to be able to quote it from an American Episcopal bishop . " Every person on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either baptized , or not baptized . If baptized , their baptism may have been more or less regular , and solemn ; and attended with prayers more or less appropriate . rliis , however , does not make them more or less really baptized . Furthermore ; every baptized person is a member of the church , and in covenant with God . Baptism znmteates into the church and into the covenant . Nothing else does , or can . If a person be not baptized , neither confirmation , nor the Lord 's Supper , nor yet holy orders , can initiate and make him a member of the church . On this point , then , to hold that none but Episcopal baptism is valid , or true ; that none but this admits into Christ 's church , is to take a position fatal to our church itself . There are multitudes , who have been coi*flrmed , and are communicants , and not a few who are , or have been , in holy orders , even among bishops ; but who are not members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptized . Besides , bishops thus situated have ordained inferior clergy , and probably , consecrated other bishops ; when they were not members of the church themselves , and could not , on this theory , make others members . Thus , our whole stream of office and membership has been corrupt-242 April , // 243 ed ; we know not how far , or in what direction , the taint may have spread ; and can never , without endless difficulty , ascertain who are , and who are not , members of the church . " - pp. 576,577 . A few words respecting Bishop Griswold 's intellectual character . There is , if we mistake not , a common impression that Bishop Griswold was a good man , but rather moderate in mental endowments and attainments . No one can read his writings , or his Memoir , and retain that impression . He had from childhood an ardent thirst for , and an uncommon power of acquiring knowledge He excelled in the talents of exactly ascertaining , and of accurately and luminously expressing the truth-talents which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a superior man . Had his religious principle permitted him , amid the many calls to pastoral and episcopal labors , to devote any considerable part of his time to literary and theological pursuits , he would have been eminent as a scholar . As it was , he went further in the walks of scholarship than do most professional men . An anecdote which his biographer relates , illustrates this remark . " The story ofthe Bishop 's buying and reading La Place 's Mecanique Celeste , I have every reason to believe , is strictly true . " Notwithstanding the remark of one of the reviews , that there were but few men in England , who read La Place 's book , Messrs . Wells and Lilly , at that time well known booksellers in Boston , had imported a copy of the work . For a time it laid on their counter with no other notice , save that nowand then a customer would take it up , look at it , and lay it down . One day , however , a venerable , white-headed man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appeared to become absorbed in its contents . At length , he asked the price of it , and , as the incident was related to me , bought it and quietly walked away . Mr. Wells , feeling a great curiosily to learn the name of the stranger , requested his clerk to follow him , and if possible ascertain who he was . His clerk did so , and soon saw him enter the house of Shubael Bell , Esq. , then one of our distinguished laymen of Boston , re siding in School Street . On inquiring at the door , he learned that the person , whom he had followed , was none other than Bishop Griswold . Some time afterwards , Judge M. of Boston , an intimate friend of the Bishop , asked him whether the account were true , and whether he read La Place ? - Yes , ' replied the Bishop , I have sometimes amused myself that way but of late , finding mathematics in danger of interfering with my other duties , I have laid them aside . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. himself-pp. 106 , 107 . We regret that we have not room to substantiate our opinion of Bishop Griswold 's mental character by quotations from the Memoir . We are free to say thut Bishop Griswold had no intellectual superior , if he had an equal , among his contemporaries or predecessors on the American Episcopal bench . But the crowning excellence of Bishop Griswold was his well balanced practical and eminent piety . No one can read his Memoir without the conviction that he was eminently a humble , prayerful , laborious , self-denying , spiritually minded Christian . On this point we should like to quote , but are compelled to omit the testimony of his biographer . We have thus endeavored to give a brief account , such as our limits permit , of one of those Episcopalians whom we delight to honor , and none the less because they are thorough Episcopalians . We make no apology for quoting so freely the language of Bishop Griswold , and of his biographer Dr. Stone . For it is doubtless better that they should speak on certain points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it gives our readers the opportunity of " private judgment " respecting them . And we wish also to place the sentiments which we have quoted from these authors within reach of our readers : since few of them we presume will expect to possess so extended a memoir . We hardly need say to the readers of the New Englander , that // 244 Bishop Southgate and Episcopal Missions . though we have risen from the perusal of this memoir , honoring Bishop Griswold and his biographer for their Protestant and Catholic spirit , and for their evangelical views , and for the ability and zeal with which they proclaim and defend them ; we have not fallen in love with " the distinctive principles of Episcopacy . " Indeed , this very volume contains ample materials wherewith to illustrate the inexpediency of the Episcopal form of church-government , and of a liturgical mode of worship . We might from its pages abundantly prove that the episcopal office is in that church an object of unhallowed ambition and party strife , dangerous to humility and fraternal unity and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from exercising a haughty and arbitrary lordship over God 's heritage ; and that a minister or bishop who is truly evangelical , and adopts the measures for the increase of piety to which his principles and his zeal prompt him , and is Catholic in his sentiments and feelings , is not only in " liturgical " and " rubrical " fetters , but also in the worse fetters of the suspicions and accusations of his brethren . The ambition , the plotting , the jealousies , the heart-burning , that are incident as we think to prelacy ; and the opposition to evangelical principles , zeal and measures , and the suspicions that over-cloud and withstand and oppress their advocates , which are incident as we think to a half reformed and half evangelical liturgy , very seriously restricted the usefulness , and afflicted the heart of the good Bishop Griswold- But we did not take up our pen for this purpose : and we are unwilling to diminish in the least the pleasant impression left from our , survey of the character of Bishop Griswold and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less agreeable themes . In conclusion , we express our ardent wish , that all the bishops of the Episcopal church may be like Bishop Griswold , and all her presbyters like Dr. Stone.
