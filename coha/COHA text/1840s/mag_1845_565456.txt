txt RELIGIOUS FREEDOM  --  the gift of Christ  --  the hope of earth ! Yet , on this subject , as on that of civil liberty , both in respect to its nature and its present condition and prospects , there is afloat much confusion of thought , and much vagueness of speech . Multitudes would seem to think that earth 's great battle on this subject has been fought , and it only remains to finish up the fragments and sing the peans of victory . Little do such understand of the full import of the thing itself and of its actual condition in the world at large ; and still less of the baptisms of blood that lie between it and universal conquest . We know not how to speak intelligently of its present prospects except in the light of its true nature and its real general condition . WHAT , IN THE TRUE IDEA OF IT , is RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ? Men are wont to speak of the divine and human governments as if they were not only separate and distinct , but might with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , and for different and even conflicting ends . No mistake is greater . In strictness of speech and of rightful existence and authority , there is but one government in the universe . All others are but parts of the one great whole that ruleth in and over all . Within assigned limits and for given ends , the subordinates may be distinct and separate from the superior , but even there they exist only by its allowance or direction , they are subject wholly to its authority and ends , and beyond or contrary to these they have no rightful existence , function , or authority . So far as they rightfully go , they serve merely its place and its offices , and so are but parts of itself ; and when , // by the wayward perversion of those desolation of suspended nature or who administer them , they cease to the play of maddened elements , be just this , or become antagonist thereto , the scourge of the Highest or the bolts that dash them like a potter 's vessel are their portion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to all worlds where sin is and is not hopelessly doomed , has , of necessity , three general departments-that of Instruction , to enlighten and guide its subjects ; that of Sacrifice or Atoneinent , to recover and save them ; and that of Justice , to maintain its own existence , authority , and usefulness , in the protection of the innocent and the punishment of the guilty . In each of these departments , God , the Supreme Administrator , is cympetent , if he think best , to carry out all , even the minutest and most temporary details of the administration in his own person , and by his own immediate and visible agency ; or , if he think otherwise , is equally competent to call in various intermediate agencies , whether of men or things , and commit such of the details as he chooses to them , he only maintaining such a supervision , support , and direction of the whole , as the particular cases and the general exigencies of his government may from time to time demand . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Accordingly , God ever has had , and with a single exception still has , a ministry of intermediate agencies on earth corresponding to each of the departments named . In all ages ,  --  in the works of his hand  --  the green earth and the shining heavens ; in the events of his providence-now speaking in mercy , and now in judgment ; in the teachings of chosen men-prophetic , instructive , encouraging and admonitory , there is no land or people but has heard the voice and seen the shape of God 's earthly Ministry of Instruction . In like manner , in the Vol . III . 50 and , since the flood at least , in the existence and action of civil government as a present avenger of slain or injured innocence , the world has had God 's earthly Ministry of Justice . And there was a time when , in the service and the sacrifices of a consecrated Priesthood , it also had an earthly Ministry of Sacrifice . But that ministry has done its work . In the coming of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , his entrance into the holy of holies in heaven , and his exaltation upon the mediatonal throne as a Prince and Savior , and ever-living Intercessor , all earthly priesthood and sacrifice are at an end ; and now , the Department of Sacrifice in the divine government lives only in Christ 's administration of it on high , in those memorials of it he has left on earth in legacy for his people , and those lessons of instruction respecting it which he has commissioned them , as his Ministry of Instruction , to bear to every creature . Now , as in the divine government itself , the Department of Instruction must be , in the order of nature , antecedent to and independent of , as well as distinct from that of justice , God has ever kept his earthly representative of it equally so . For , how can justice make out either innocence or guilt where instruction has not gone before freely and fully to make known obligation and duty ? Accordingly , in every age and dispensation the ministry of instruction in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ministries , knowing no s upremacy in its utterance of truth but that of God himself . Even under old economies , it was never competent for the sacrificial nor for the civil power to exercise supremacy in the way of direction over the instructive . Neither was at liberty to say to it what , or when , or how , it should teach , or to put any restric // tions , or hang up any penalties over it , so long as it kept strictly to its work of instruction . In the simple utterance of religious truth , God set it free and high above them all , and bid it speak for him . In the simple garb of prophet or other teacher it did so . It gave instruction touching the character , conduct , and choice of rulers . It descended to all the walks and business of ordinary life , and spoke God 's claims and God 's truth freely and fully there . No earthly power was at liberty in respect to any thing to strike it dumb . As occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corruptions of a degenerate priesthood , and told it that according to its iniquities God had made it contemptible and base before all the people ; or , it stepped into the halls of legislation , declaring that God would have no fellowship with him which frameth mischief by a law ; or it came into the presence of the judiciary , pronouncing woes on those that justified the wicked for a reward , and took away the judgment of the righteous ; or it drew near to proud and oppressing nobles , and exclaimed against them as wolves ravening the prey ; or it carried rebuke to the people , assuring them of the divine indignation , because they had used oppression , and exercised robbery , and vexed the poor and the needy ; or it stood in king 's palaces , and in the name of the Most High said to kingly offenders , " Thou art the man . " In a word , wherever , and to whatever , and to whomsoever , God 's authority extended , his ministry of instruction went with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges , princes , people , kings , in all the relations and acts of their respective lives , were the subjects of its attention and address . Now Christianity recognizes and perpetuates this same function of the instruetive power , and its same relatida to the civil . The civil is now , as ever , God 's earthly ministry of justice . As such its whole work is the protection of innocence and the avenging of wrong- " a praise to them that do ( not teach ) well ; a terror to them that do ( not teach ) ill . " It is no part of its rightful and appropriate work to be the instructor of its subjects-least of all to assume the direction of their religious instruction . This is devolved on another ministry-God 's ministry of instruction . As such , that holds its commission from the Lord Jesus . Its direction and work are to propagate his religion in the simplicity of its worship and the fullness of its instructions , to the ends of the earth ; and , in so doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things the entire supremacy of Christ ; to insist on the devotion of all hearts , the obedience of all lives , the subjection of all relations , employments , and interests-that every knee shall bow , and every tongue confess " that Ha is LORD , to the glory of God the Father . " No subject , man , officer , authority , relation , employment , or interest is to be exempt . Wherever Christ 's authority extends , there is the gospel of his instruction and worship to go . No man or combination of men is to draw a charmed circle here , and another there , and say , hitherto shalt thou come , and no farther ; least of all are they to draw that circle around men in their civil relations , whether acting as rulers or the ruled . No-the gospel of Christ , beginning with the individual , lays his individual will , life , and interest , at Christ 's feet ; and , going thence to the social and the civil man , demands the equal submission and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and interest . While to the one it comes with the mandate , " Whether ye eat or drink , or whatsoever ye do , do all to the glory of God , " it says to the other with like authority , " Be your conduct in civil relations ( iw. // * ( Tsl*scTi*6 ) worthy of the gospel of Christ . " All this is the appropriate work and sacred duty of Christ 's ministry of instruction , of whatever sort it he , hut peculiarly of all such as are officially set for the propagation and defense of the truth . No*v , religious freedom in the true idea of it , is the right of that ministry ( including in it , according to their various gifts , all of Christ 's people ) thus to give utterance to the whole of Christ 's claims and the whole of his instructions , and the equal right of all concerned to hear , receive , and obey the same , without let or license from any civil power on earth . It is , that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ion , in all the forms and ordinances of their worship , and all the applications and fullness of their instructions , there be an entire freedom from all prescriptions , and an entire exemption from all penalties of all civil powers . Such , in the only true import of it , is religious freedom ; and the struggle for this has been , is , and is to be , THE CONFLICT OF THE AGES . In all time the civil power has sought to control the religion of its subjects . As a pure and spiritual faith could never intelligently submit to such direction , the result has been its perse.cution to banishment or death , or its gradual seduction , in the proffer of temporal advantages into alliance with or subserviency to the state . " All these things will I give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship , " has ever been the proffer and the price ; and too often , . unlike her great Master , slow to detect the wiles of the arch enemy , and still slower to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith has yielded to the adulterous embrace , with temporary gratification and glory , it may be , but with the sad and certain loss of all virgin strength , life and beauty at the last . Hence , in all ages and lands , by the most natural and spontaneous affinities , degenerate and false religions have been and now are in alliance with or subserviency to the state . The terms of that alliance or subserviency are evermore , " Yield you supremacy and subserviency to me , and I will give support and defense to you ; be you my l ) *OP and tool , and I will be your bread and sword . " Accordingly the great conflict which the friends of the true religion have had to maintain in all the past has been the conflict with degenerate or false religions entrenched behind the civil power , and summoning it at the approach of danger with fetter , fire , and sword , to their defense . It was just here that a large portion of the long line of martyrs , named in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not worthy , periled and laid down their lives . It was this that was the conflict of Egypt . A false religion entrenched behind the civil power outlawed the true , wrung from its votaries the right to worship in the land ; flung their petition to go elsewhere to worship into their face with the contemptuous reply , " Who is Jehovah , that I should obey his voice to let Israel go ? I know not Jehovah , nor will I let Israel go ; " and finally unclenched its grasp of its victims only after its own gods had been abased before the power of the true , and a baptism of blood and wail of death had gone up into all the dwellings of the civil power that had sworn and assayed to defend it- " Yea ( Ex. xii , 12 ) against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment ; I ARt TIlE Loun . " It was the same conflict with the same elements that gave Hebrew fidelity in Babylon to hungry lions and hot flames . It was the like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil arm , that stoned them that were sent to it , and killed the prophets , and in its mad thirst for righteous blood , filled up the // measure of the fathers at the last , by the murder of its own true hope and real Lord . " I adjure thee , " said the high priest , " by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ , the Son of God . Jesus saith unto him , thou hast said I am . Verily , I say unto you , here . after ye shall see the Son of man on the right hund of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven - I am the Christ , and you shall yet see me , the Christ in humiliation , coming in the kingly estate of the Christ in glory . On that confession they condemned him , and hurried him to the civil power , and clamored for his death- " his blood be on us and on our children , " and stimulated the hesitating step of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man go , thou art not Cesar 's friend : whoever maketh himself a king , speaketh against Cesar . " The whole proceeding was Christ in conflict with a degenerate faith summoning the civil power to its aid , and obedient as the Son of man unto death , in the assertion and maintenance of his own supremacy as Son of God over all . And this conflict , in all its parts , Christ left in legacy for his disciples , when he sent them to all the world with his Gospel , giving them assurance not of his presence only , but that they should be as sheep among wolves , and should be delivered up to councils , and scourged in synagogues , and brought before governors and kings for his sake , for a testimony against them and the nations . Accordingly the commencement of their propagation of the Gospel was equally the commencement of this conflict in their persons . At once they were brought before councils and senates , and hurried to prisons . In the presence of all , they boldly questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers which forbade their speaking in the name of Christ- " Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God , judge ye ; for we can not but speak the things which we have seen and heard . " And when the angel of the Lord came and sanctioned their proceeding , and by miracle brought them out of prison , and gave them fresh charge to speak to the people , and they were again arrested , their calm and manly answer was , " We ought to obey God rather than men and straightway they preached Christ in his supremacy to the court itself ; and though not released till they were beaten and re-commanded not to speak in his name , they went thence rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer for him ; and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus as the Christ ; and hot persecution , scattering the disciples abroad , and going to distant cities with letters to seize men and women and drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conflict was in these at the beginning , it was in all the apostles and disciples in its continuance-in its nature always the same ; in its measure it was often more . Paul , in his maintenance of it , was in stripes above measure , in prisons frequent , in deaths oft ; and go where be might , the Holy Ghost witnessed in every city that bonds and afflictions awaited him ; and finally , he , and all but one of the other apostles , as is supposed , laid down their lives for the faith-all being made conformable in their death , as in the sufferings of their life , to their Lord . Of the manner in which they demeaned themselves in the maintenance of this conflict from time to time , we have on record many touching and sublime illustrations . One of these , as a specimen of others , was on this wise . Paul and Silas , having been commended by the brethren to the grace of God , took a circuit through Syria and Cilicia for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came to Troas. *h Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia , saying , " Come over and help * The result was a conviction that the Lord had called them to preach the Gospel there , and their early arrival at Philippi , the chief city of the province . Being a Roman colony , it was under the Roman civil law . By that law , while many and various religions were allowed and established , no new religion could be introduced except by express consent of the civil authority . Tertullian says , that no god could be consecrated-set up as an authorized deity , unless approved by the senate ; and Cicero adds , that no person could have or privately worship any new or separate gods , except they were thus publicly allowed . The result was , that the Roman civil power , though very liberal in regard to the number and kind of religions it was ready to allow and authorize , as is the French at this day , claimed , nevertheless , the right , in all cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction and worship of its subjects . To propagate any new faith , therefore , without its consent , was so far to deny its supremacy and set up another-it was to preach another king than Cesar . While at Philippi , Paul and Silas were assailed and annoyed in their labors by a certain maid , having the spirit of divination , or as the original is , the spirit of Python . This Python or Pythios was one of the names of Apollo , the Grecian god of the fine arts , supposed to be their inventor . He was also one of the gods , regularly recognized and authorized by the Roman law . He had an oracle at Delphi , which was , probably in higher repute and more generally resorted to than any other at that time in the world . His priestesses , of whom the maid spoken of was one , claimed that the god himself , in spirit , dwelt in and spoke through them ; and the belief of this was very general in all parts of the Roman empire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service and in honor of the god . The Apollo worship and the Apollo priestesses were , of all others , popular favorites-the admired and cherished of Grecian and Roman refinement , luxury and pride . To call such a worship and such priestesses in question , therefore , and to take the crown from such a god , as well as all gods like him , and put it on the head of Jesus , the Nazarene , as Paul surely did , was just to fly in the face of the strongest popular hate , and the intensest popular contempt . And who so likely to give the most insulting and annoying expressions of it , as a priestess herself ? Accordingly she dogged them from street to street , to the place of prayer , crying after them , with the keenest and bitterest significancy , " These men are the servants of the HIGHEST GOD , ( roi #k6u iou l5qitaTov ) ! which show unto US the way of salvation 1 " - as if our religion , with its splendid temples , and exalted god , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state recognition were all nothing , and theirs , the religion of the crucified , alone were true !  --  a complete laughing to scorn , of course , of the apostles and of their religion and its author . And this she did many days , till Paul 's spirit was stirred within him , and he saw the time and the occasion had come for testing the truth of the two religions , by testing the supremacy of their alleged authors or gods , when , turning to the maid , whose claim was that her god resided in and spoke through her , he said to the spirit , " I command thee in the name ( by the authority ) of Jesus Christ to come out of her : and he came out the same hour . " Just what happened to the maid , it is not important here to decide . It is enough to know that that hap- // 398 The Prospects of Religious Freedom . pened , which demonstrated in the sight of all , and beyond contradiction , the absolute supreniacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , and by consequence the falsehood of the one religion and the truth of the other . rp he Pythonitic oracle was dumb and the gains of her masters gone , before the power of Christ and at the bidding of his servants . The only resource left was to raise the question of the supremacy of the civil power over the new religion and its author or god . It was this that had installed the prostrate god and his religion among the authorized gods and religions of the state . To this , as the last resort , the question must next be taken . At once Paul and Silas were seized and dragged before the magistracy , and the charge was- " These men , being Je ws , do exceedingly trouble our city , and teach customs which are not laufid for us to receive , neither to observe , being Romans " - theirs is a religion and a god not authorized by the civil power ! The result was , without a trial or the forms of it , many stripes , a prison and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed ; God interposed marvelously ; the jailer and his household embraced the new religion , and when the day dawned , the magistrates , having had time for fuller information and some reflection , sent word , saying , " Let those men go . " No-said Paul , logo out thus would be to admit that we have done wrong . That we deny ; and as Roman citizens , " beaten openly uncondemned , " we demand a fair trial , or an honorable discharge . And the magistracy came bendinu , and brought them out , and begged their departure from the city . That was enough : the point was carried . The supremacy of Christ , as against all religious pretenses to the contrary , and all civil prescriptions enforcing them , had been fully and signally maintained ; and so , haying seen the brethren , and exhorted and encouraged them to persevere , come what might , Paul and his companions proceeded on their journey . The same conflict awaited them every where . It carried Paul in bonds , some years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were not even legal grounds for the original arrest and charges , it was still the conflict of a degenerate faith , calling the civil power to its aid and in it , in civil as well as other relations , Paul maintained the entire supremacy of Christ , and claimed , on his authority , as the highest of all authorities , the right to preach and propagate his religion , in the length and breadth of its worship and instructions , to every creature . And it was just this that he enjoined , with such sweet and winning emphasis , when he said to the Philippians- " Be your conduct citizenwise , worthy of the gospel of Christ ; standing fast in one spirit ; striving together , with one soul , for the faith of the gospel ; in nothing terrified by your adversaries ; having the same conflict which ye saw in me when I was with you , and now here to be in me at Rome ; having , still more , the same mind that was in Christ Jesus , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it no robbery to be equal with him , made himself of no reputation , took on him the form of a servant , and was made in the likeness of men , and now , by virtue of his obedience unto death , even the death of the cross , is highly exalted , God having given him an authority , which is above every authority , that at the authority of Jesus , every knee should bow , whether of authorities in heaven or in earth or under the earth , and that every tongue should confess to his supremacy- ' that HE is LORD , to the glory of God the Father . ' " The revival , prosecution and com* pletion of this conflict for Christ 's supremacy , the world over , are the // 399 high demand and great work of the present and coming ages . What at this hour is the grand obstruction to the free propagation and ready reception of the Gospel among the nations ? What hinders that it may not grapple at once , directly and in confidence of victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sterner formalisms and grosser idolatries of Mohammedan and Pagan lands ; and more than all , with the imbecile , debased , putrid and heathen animalisms of oppressed and enslaved millions in all lands , our own , though last , not least ? Is it that the Gospel is no longer a match for them in a free and fair encounter ? Is it that its healing efficacy is no longer equal to such hoary , complicated and inveterate maladies ? Is it that its resources are exhausted-that there is no longer balm in Gilead , nor a physician there ? no Prince and Savior on the throne , to lead captivity captive and give gifts to men ? No : it is that , exist where and as they may , these things are ever wedded to or hedged around by the civil powers of the god of this world , so that touch and disturb them when and where you will , the fetter of civil authority is upon your limb ; or its fines , tortures , dungeons and banishments are around your property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fagot are about your neck , heart and body . It is that in lands where a pure and spiritual Christianity once triumphed most , Mohammedan delusion , by the arm of civil power , holds the scimitar over its head , while Armenian bankerism and Greek patriarchism and Roman pontificacy shake their nest of scorpions in its face , and bid it do its work , if it dare . It is that farther west , Lutheran formalism , in state alliance , hurls confiscation and banishment at all dissent in Sweden , and banishes harmless visitants , or imprisons devoted pastors in Denmark and Germany ; while the formalism of Popish and Protestant and even Evangelical Nationalism calumniates , persecutes and fines all spiritual independency in France ; and that of Presbyterian and Episcopal state-churchism filches the pockets and lays civil disabilities on the persons of all honest dissent in " green Erin " and " the fast anchored isle " - refusing , in surpliced superciliousness and love of gold , to give a decent burial to sweet babes , not christened and feed " as the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the monopolizing exactions of the " King 's printer , as by law established ! " It is that yet farther west , even on our own free soil , so called , the civil power , emboldened by a formalism that silently acquiesces or openly justifies , and unawed by any spiritualism that has either faith or strength to stand in manly and apostolic resistance to it , locks the chain on prostrate millions , outlaws the Bible from them , and all religious as well as other instruction , except what it may prescribe or allow , and , with words of freedom on its lips , deals out on all assailants the stripes and personal indignities of Georgian , Tennessean , and even free-state lynch courts ; or the fines , imprisonment and tortures of Maryland , Missouri and Florida arrest and incarceration ; or the murders of Alton martyrdoms , with the fires and yells of St. Louis negro-burnings-all made duly legal by the voice of the people and the official decisions of Judge Lawless ! In a word , it is that now as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which " is born after the flesh , " persecutes and will persecute to the death , the freewoman church , which is " by promise , and after the Spirit ; " while , more than all , the children of her that is free have , almost no where , the faith to hear what the Scripture saith- " Cast out the bond-woman and her son ; for the son of the bond- // 400 The Prospects of Religious Freedom . woman shall not be heir with the son of the free.woman "  --  and much less the heart and strength to gird them to the work . But it shall not be always so . Earth must have and will have men who will not be ashamed nor afraid to suffer for Christ 's sake ; who will count it all joy to bear the loss of all things and esteem them as offal , that they may win Christ , and know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings , and fill up in their flesh what is behind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church 's sake .

Are not all alike an adultery of the church against her rightful and only Lord ? And will the blood of the saints ever cease to flow , and the church ever be clothed with her " clean " garments , ready for a full union with her Lord , until all such alliances , in every form , are at end ? the Lamb ; and Lie , her Lord , shall come forth to meet her , having on his vesture and on his thigh a name written-KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS .

Among others , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of the free-woman-are , at this day , coming to understand , in the light of actual experience , better than they have for centuries before , the true nature , extent , sacrifice and issue of the conflict awaiting them . The time has been , and not remote , when the spiritual and zealous of modern days fondly dreamed , that the world was ready for its Lord ; that his servants need only go to all lands and speak the word , and , forthwith , all crowns of all hearts and all authorities would be laid at his feet ; at all events , that to such as did this , religious freedom would be readily conceded as their undoubted and unquestioned birthright . Forty years ' experience of Christian effort , at home and abroad , has taught them quite another lesson-that this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting , ( or the bidding of the Lord himself , ) and the rending of its victims ; and that , in the conflict yet remaining , Christ 's true servants have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gird them for the fight , at the risk of a fellowship of sufl'ering with their Master , made conformable , if need be , to his death . Now , it is something , as a note of preparation and sign of promise , to have learned thus much  --  to know assuredly , that it is ours , in common with all " the goodly company of the martyrs , " to fill up what is behind of Christ 's afflictions for his church , and , through much tribulation , to find our way to conquest and to rest . It is true , flesh and blood shrink , and the heart of feeble faith quails , but " the promise of the Father " standeth sureBaptisms // of the Holy Ghost , of which those of primitive days were but the earnest ; such in kind as have always come when the church has leaned upon her Lord alone , and such in degree as earth has never seen , are yet to descend upon the Lord 's people , enduing them with the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling .

Preparatory to this , it is something to have learned , as the world has never learned before , that persecution can never die , and religious freedom never live , and the Gospel in its purity never go freely forth to every creature , so long and so far as religion of any kind or any form is in alliance with the state . It is the wont , in some quarters , to suppose that all religious persecution is the peculiarity of some one religious faith . No mistake can be greater . Romanisrn , in its state alliances , i-nay have been and may still he foremost and chief in the fiendish work , hut it is far from being alone .

It is God 's note of preparation and sign of promise for the grand outcry , coming on all the winds of heaven , " Cast out the bond-woman and her son ; for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman. " 3 . It is something more to have learned , by the same experience , that state alliance is only another name , not for spiritual degeneracy , delusion , or apostasy , alone , but with them , for all abominations and uncleanness . It were easy to expand this thought by a citation of facts in detail , or by a train of remark like the preceding ; but it is needless . If we would see added to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profligacies , indulgences , sensualities and pollutions , that make earth sick and heaven weep , be sure we will find them amid the formalisms and idolatries of every name and kind , in alliance with the state . No pen can describe , nor pencil paint , nor sight endure , the whole of the disgusting reality . it is a chamber of imagery from which inspired and prophetic vision starts back with horror . " Behold ! every form of creeping things and abominable beasts ! and all the idols of the house of Israel portrayed upon the wall round about ! " Now it is not a little , in the experience of the ages , to have learned this . Strip , then , all these forms of state-allied faith , of state support and state respectability ; set them forth upon their own resources and in their own loathsomeness , and let the gospel of a pure and simple faith , endued by fresh baptisms of the Holy Ghost with the power of the Highest , go forth to free and manly conflict with them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How long before the sick and heaving earth would spew them from her , and the loud acclaim be heard in heaven , " Alleluia ! Salvation , and glory , and honor , and power , unto the Lord our God : true and righteous are his judgments ; for he hath judged the great whore , which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand ? " 4 . It is still more , among our signs of promise , that the necessary and essential intolerance and corruptions of state alliance , and with them , such alliance itself , are everywhere becoming increasingly odious . To say nothing of the corruptions-if its intolerance torture and kill Jews in Persia ; or behead converted Mohammedans in Turkey ; or hang converted Catholics in Portugal ; or imprison a Protestant , Dr. Kalley , for " abetting apostasy and heresy " in Madeira ; or banish a spiritually minded Scott from Sweden ; or drive a Baptist , Dr. Hoby , from even a temporary visit to Copenhagen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptize , nor to administer the Lord 's supper , nor have any communication with the Baptists of the place , nor hold any conversation with any person on religious subjects ; " or , in the same place , imprison a Baptist pastor Mdnstcr , for // the fourth time within five years , with no liberty to write to or see any one except his wife , daughter , and professional adviser , while a church of three hundred members , and little kindred bands in other parts of the kingdom , are hungering for his ministrations . Or if , with insatiate grasp and general sweep , the same intolerance filch ? 1,200 the year from quiet Qua. kers , and millions more from the easy competence , and hard earnings , and pinching want of all honest dissent in England , Wales and Ireland , and in Scotland superadds upon a poor and pious peasantry the heavy hand of Sutherland oppressions ; or if , with sterner hand and a more harlot face , it rob weak islanders in the Pacific of their lawful crowns , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compel them by violence to renounce the faith of their fathers , and practice that of their exterminators ; - in all these , the world cries out , with one consent , " Shame ! shame , on the intolerance itself , and on the alliance that begets and inflicts it ! " Even those who are guilty of it , in one shape and measure , at one time and in one land , join in the general condemnation of it at and in another . If , for instance , in Boston , a Unitarian paperarraignsRomanism on the charge of intolerance , and , after quoting undoubted cases of it , seems most shocked and sure of its argument at the strange disrespect , which , though he might worship elsewhere in what dress he pleased , would not let a Rev. Unitarian Doctor go into the Pope 's own chapel with his " frock coat " on- ( much as the Editor would ask , though he might not require , a Quaker to take off his hat in his meeting , and deem it great rudeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic paper replies , that if the objector please , he may look on this picture of Protestant intolerance at his leisure , and then quotes him to England , where , to use the Catholic 's language , " all consciences are taxed to support the religion of a majority ; " to Sweden , where , " if a man changes his religion and becomes a Catholic , he and his heirs forfeit his estate forever , and he incurs the penalty of perpetual banishment ; " to Russia , where " Protestantism has butchered and bound down Catholic Poland , has banished the Jesuits from the dominion , and enjoins the practice of the Greek schism , under pain of imprisonment and exile ; " to Prussia , where " the venerable Archbishop of Cologne has been flung into prison , for denying the right of the king to instruct him in his administration of the sacrament of marriage ; " to Switzerland , where " the provision of toleration has been violated , abbeys sacked , Jesuits expelled , and the doctrine publicly proclaimed , that monks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Thus it is , in all Christendom . Each flings the charge of intolerance upon the other , condemning in him what in other circumstances he may himself be guilty of ; each , where his own intolerance can not be denied , expresses regret at its existence , and feels and is ashamed of its odiousness ; while all together make up the verdict of general condemnation , and help to swell the tides of disgust that are , ere long , to sweep it , and its adulterous mother , state alliance , from the groaning earth . 5 . It is still more a sign of promise , that every where state religious establishments are crumbling to pieces , or being materially modified , for the most part , for the better . In the pagan world , they seem to be falling of their own hoary corruptions and heavy weight , and in enlightened and Christian lands by the added vigorous assaults of free and spiritual faiths , aided often by the co-operation of a goaded but honest infidel hate . It is impossible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarcely twelve years since , to cite a late and single case , Presbyterianism , " as by law established " in Scotland , asked govern . meat to allow it to multiply its churches , taxing dissent in common with itself , for the necessary funds . At that time , Scotch dissent , led on by Scotch independency , set itself in opposition , and made its well-directed and vigorous onset , not upon the particular measure merely , but upon the whole subject of state alliance . Among other things , it charged the state church , by virtue of that alliance , with taking from Christ 's crown the right of absolute supremacy over his own house , and from Christ 's people the right , su*ject only to his authority , to choose their own pastors and teachers . " The Evangelicals , " so called , in the establishment , with Chalmers , Cunningham , Candlish , and the like , at their head , were foremost in the defense . They , then a minority , said the state church did no such thing-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were untouched of Cesar . Very soon they came to be a majority in the church , and then , as honest men , must make their words good . The occasion came  --  a plain people of a remote parish declared against the pastor , which the civil patron presented and the civil law enforced ; and the question was , shall the church , in her authorities , stand by Christ 's crown and the rights of his people , or yield to Cesar . The " Evangelicals " maintained their integrity-They refused to install the man presented and sought to be enforced by the civil arm on an unwilling people ; and the result was , on the one hand , a Scotch Free Church , with seven or eight hundred congregations , a praying membership , and a living ministry ; and on the other , a Scotch Establishment , deserted indeed , hut in her desertion , by ne* though late grants of power , having more of freedom from the civil arm than she had before- A living free church , with a divided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under God , of the onset of Scotch " Voluntaryism " on state alliance , scarcely twelve years ago . By a kindred spirit and movement , the Scotch Bible monopoly has been broken down , and the English seriously shaken . And now , the assault has begun in calm and measured earnestness upon the English establishment , with Irish and dissenting regium-donum pensionry . It is but yesterday , that more than six hundred delegates , representing dissent of every kind in all parts of the kingdom , abating only some elements of metropolitan aristocracy , met in conference , in London , and after several days of enthusiastic and harmonious deliberation , formed " THE BRITISH ANTI-STATE-CHURCH AssocIATIoN , " based upon the principle , " that in matters of religion man is responsible to God alone ; that all legislation hy secular governments in affairs of religion , is an encroachment upon the rights of man , and an invasion of the prerogatives of God ; and that the application by law of the resources of the state to the maintenance of any form or forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hostile to human liberty , and directly opposed to the word of God . " The object of the Society is , of course , " the liberation of religion from all governmental or legislative interference ; " and , placed under the guidance of a " Council of Five Hun . dred , " chosen men in all parts of England , Scotland , Wales , and Ireland , it has gone forth , with the strong heart and steady hand of " Christian willinghood " to do its work . Besides this , the conflict is begun also in Jamaica and British Guiana , against branches of the same establishment there It will go to all the British dominions . Who doubts the issue ? // 405 Moreover , in these United States , men , not Romanists , are asking , n serious and thoughtful mood , whether , when the state , assuming to be the instructor of its subjects , establishes schools and puts Protestant Bibles , or any other , or none , into them , by law , we have not , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or infidelity , by law established-whether , but for such establishment , citizens , native or foreign , could quarrel , much less shed each other 's blood , over the question of Protestant or Popish or no Bible in the public schools-and whether there be any other true and safe position , but that the state restrict itself to its proper work as a ministry of justice , leaving secular instruction where it does religious , to its own spontaneous resources and its own chosen ministry . To this complexion , we doubt not , it will come at last ; and thanks , we say , to Roman bigotry , that , by assaying to drive the Bible from the schools , is helping us to this result ; and , with equal reason , we give equal thanks to the equal bigotry of a liberal and deistical naturalism , that , under the plea of no sectarianism , is equally striving to banish from them all substantive evangelical teaching  --  and most of all , that of the saving righteousness and regal supremacy of Christ , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the subject of these remarks . Having given it some examinalion , he believes there is no subject at the present time , more deserving the profound attention and the deep solicitude of all Christian men . It will doubtless be thought strange to say , that the systems of public common school education now existing , and sought to be established throughout our country , may yet , while Christians sleep , become one of the greatest , if not the greatest antagonism in the land to all evangelical instruction and piety . But how long before they will be so , when they shall have once become the mere creatures of the state , and under the plea of no sectarianism , mere nateralisra shall be the substance of all the religious , and the basis of all the secular It is needless to say more . It is enough , that every where , as it has done for ages before , the human mind is waking to the specific and well apprehended question of no alliance between religion and the state-no copartnership of the religious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in many cases the same parties , which in other days and circumstances have loved and sought this alliance , are now spurning and rejecting it . It is extensively so with Presbyterianism in Scotland , and with many of all names in other parts of Great Britain , who have heretofore been most ready to stand upon the regium-donum pension list . But stranger still , it is so now with the 8,000,000 of Catholic Ireland , with their whole Catholic hierarchy at their head . Following the slaughters consequent on " the rising " of 1798 , Lord Castlereagh was authorized to make the preliminary inquiries and arrangements upon which some measure teaching which they shall give ? And let it not be forgotten , that strong currents of influence , in all parts of the country , chance concert , doino* acting in no are their utmost to bring about just this result . The evidence of this is within the reach ofsuch as choose to inquire diligently and observe carefully . It will doubtless reveal itself more and more , as time moves on . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infidelity of a few years since ? Where are its visible orgenizations and direct assaults upon Christianity and her institutions ? In what positions in life and what spheres of action are some of its former champions now prominent and active ? Is that infidelity dead ? Have its champions and friends yielded the contest and embraced the truth ? Or does it still live , and is it still valiant against the truth , having only changed its policy from the open and direct , to the secret and undermining , and its champions and friends having given themselves to the work of modeling the educational , penal , arid other arrangements of society on its basis , so endeavoring , at length , to bring the influence of social life and general education and state authority to bear against the truth ? If these hints stimulate inquiry and awaken observation , they will have served their end . // might be grounded for the endow. merit of the Irish Catholic clergy ; and so early as 1799 , he was able to lay before the British government a document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following effect " At a meeting of the Roman Catholic prelates , held in Dublin , the 17th , 18th and 19th of January , 1799 , to deliberate on a proposal from Government , for an independent provision for the Roman Catholic clergy of Ireland , under certain regulations not incompatible with their doctrines , discipline , or just influence ,  - -  it was admitted ,  --  " That a provision , through Government , for the Roman Catholic clergy of this kingdom , competent and secured , ought to be thankfully accepted . " That in the appointment of the prelates of the Roman Catholic religion to vacant sees , within the kingdom , such interference of Government as may enable it to be satisfied of the loyalty of the person appointed , is just and ought to be agreed to . ' The document then proceeded to specific regulations " to give this principle operation . " It is not important to note the motive or the time of the change . It is enough that " at a general meeting of the Archbishops and Bishops of Ireland " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That alarmed at the report that an attempt is likely to be made during the approaching session of Parliament , to make a STATE PROVI5ION for the Roman Catholic clergy of Ireland , we deem it our imperative duty not to separate without recording the expression of our strongest reprobation of any such attempt , arid of our unalterable determination to resist , by every means in our power , A MEA5URE 50 FP.AUOHT wiTH MI5CHLEF TO THE INDEPENDENCE AND PURITY OF THE CATuOLic RELIGION IN IRELAND . ' T he measure was spoken of in the " general meeting , " of 1841 , as " the odious and alarming scheme of a State provision ; " and at the same meeting of the same body , on the 15th of November , 1843 , it was " unanimously resolved : " - " That the preceding resolutions be now republished , in order to make known to our faithful clergy and people , and to all others concerned , that our firm determination on this subject remains un changed ; and that we unanimously pledge ourselves to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be made to make any State provision for the Catholic clergy , in whatever shape or form it may be offered .

These , therefore , are her testimony , given if you will , and therefore all the stronger , against long ages and broad lands of her past and present self , that religious freedom and purity , and state alliance and provision can not live together , and that to attempt the latter is an " odious and alarming scheme , " worthy only to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already then a voice is being heard from heaven , saying , " Come out of her my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues ; for her sins have reached unto heaven , and God hath remembered her in. iquities . " The notes of preparation are being struck , and the signs of promise are appearing . American Christians of every name ought to bear a great and manly part in the coming conflict . And among them , in the providence of God , American Baptists seem to have been called to lead the van . In the report on the subject of European missions , which was adopted at the last meeting of the General Convention , in Philadelphia , American Baptists have put this testimony on record " In Greece , the great practical value of our principle , to recognize no national // church , hut to build up churches of spiritual Christians , that shall be independent of the State , and independent of each other , has been early and signally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt national churches of the East , is , we believe , a FRUITLESS EFFORT .

' That is the American Baptists ' stand . Be it theirs to maintain it every where , in good faith and entire . In doing so , let them by prayer , sympathy and succor stand by their persecuted brethren in Germany and Denmark ; let them encourage and uphold their suffering brethren in France , and if " Protestant evangelists and colporteurs , " sustained , perchance , by American funds , make common cause with high-church " Nationals , " in multiplying their afflictions and upholding the doctrine of state alliance and control , let them tell the story , as in the last report of their Board of Missions , * to all the churches , and they will see that American Christians of other names will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond-woman to beget abortions , or to strangle at the birth the free babes of the free-woman ; just when her Lord , too , is saying , " Rejoice thou barren , that bearest not ; break forth and cry , thou that travailest not ; for the desolate hath many more children than she which bath an husband . " Let them , in the same spirit , bid their brethren in Greece , be of good courage and fear not , both to preach and to bap. * The fact here intimated in respect to some " Proiestant evangelists and colporteurs , is distinctly asserted in the report named . Whether any who thus conduct , are aided with funds , sent by the Foreign Evangelical Sociely , froni this country , is not said , and probably is not known .

Let it not be said that the general principles maintained in this discussion are wild and extreme , or that action upon them , at home and abroad , would only be rash and destructive of its own ends . Nothing can be farther from the truth . When Dr. Wisner , on behalf of the Prudential Committee of the American Board , gave instructions , in 1834 , to the present Dr. Parker , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , his language was " The Christian missionary is not to expect , and he is not to seek , the sanctions of heathen governments to his efforts to extend the Gospel ; but he is to go with its heavenly message directly to the people , wherever he can find them ; and he * The present law of Greece , allows all the free exercise of their own religion , whatever it be , but at the same time forbids any one " to proselyte " from the Greek church . Our Baptist brethren preach freely , as did the missionaries of our own Board while there . They reject the idea of seeking to refiirm those eastern comrnunions , on the principle of fraternization , and adopt the policy ofplanting distinct and independent churches of their own , and therein act on a different policy from our missionaries  --  a policy somewhat holder , and we believe more effective . But as it would be proselyting to baptize a convert from the Greek church , such converts , we learn , are wont to go to Corfu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their baptism , and then to return-an evasion of the law , which savors little , we fear , of the honest , open , primitive Christian courage . // The Prospects of Religious Freedom . is to proclaim its requirements arid sanctions to them as individuals having souls , for the salvation or loss of which they are themselves responsible , and who must hear and obey the Gospel each for himself , expecting that if the truth is ever to reach and influence the government under which he labors , it will be by its being first diffused through the community , extending its light and its reforming power through all ranks , till it rises to those who occupy the highest places in the State . And if he finds a people willing to receive him , he is to persevere in proclaiming to them the message of salvation , though laws and magistrates forbid , and even at the expense of liberty and of life .

' The probability is , altogether , that the government of China will sooner or later array itself against the propagation , within its dominions , of Protestant , as it has of Roman Catholic Christianity . . . . And if not from the government , it may come from popular superstition and prejudice , excited to struggle with desperation for their malignant empire over the souls of a third of the burrian race . But come how and when it will , the worthy erobassador of Jesus Christ will not be deterred from his work by persecution .

It is , we maintain , the only true and scriptural basis for the propagation and support of Christianity , either at home or abroadas applicable to South Carolina as to China ; to nominally Christian as to " heathen governments . " In the annunciation of it , on the occasion named , the wise and devoted Wisner " being dead , yet speaketh . " We believe , moreover , that just when and where the servants and church of God have most fully acted on this basis , making Christ and his promises proportionally their only strength and hope , they have always had , along with persecution , their highest and most substantial success . It was for fidelity in this direction and on this basis , that God gave Daniel a deliverance and a kingdom . It was here and on this ground , that a long line of Hebrew worthies " subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , realized promises , stopped the mouths of lions , quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens . " It was here and in this , that primitive Christianity had its persecutions , it is true , but equally its strength and victory . In fact , the great papal apostasy was but the full grown result of departure from this ground , and from that living faith of which this is the natural and appropriate expression . And when , after long ages of degeneracy and darkness , the Reformation broke upon the world , it had its highest confidence , spirituality and power , as well as persecutions and successes , in the same direction and standing on the same ground . And grateful as was the help received , and flattering as seemed the prospects opened and opening , when the civil power came to its aid and took it into alliance with itself , experience has proved that that was the hour of its real decline , and that the element of formalisms and corruptions , little better than those from which it broke away , and whose state-entrenched existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rationalistic unbelief , and left its own great work to be substantially done over again . So true is it , that whenever Christ 's people have stood and acted upon the ground now indicated , they have had , notwithstanding persecution , their highest success and glory . Thus it will always be . His people may be as sure of it , as that he is on the throne , and wields all power , 408 // and is as able , if they will trust him , to lead captivity captive and give gifts to mea as he ever was . Indeed , it was in this way that , by the agency of our own missionaries , and their supporters and friends , India was first opened to modern missions . When Flail and Nott landed in India , government  --  a British government , too-threw itself between them and the people to whom they bore the message of salvation .
