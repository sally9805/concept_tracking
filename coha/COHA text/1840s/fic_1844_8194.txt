Tuckerman , Henry T. ( Henry Theodore ) , 1813-1871 : THE APRIL BIRTHDAY . from The April birthday ( 1844 ) Dark clouds my natal morning overcast , And sullen lay each upland , grove , and field , The tender germs shrunk from the chilly blast , And on the swollen buds the mist congealed . But noontide came ,  --  and from their vapoury shroud Mountain and streamlet gloriously broke , The verdure freshened , radiant grew the cloud , And nature smiled as if her Maker spoke . Effulgent skies the landscape now unfold , To cheer each budding leaf and tendril pale , While blades of herbage pierce the clammy ground , And dead stalks rustle in the vernal gale . On the peach boughs how delicate a bloom With summer hopes the peasant 's heart beguiles ! While piny odours from his quiet room Lure the glad student to the forest aisles . And breezes warm the prisoned earth release , Bidding her throw her last cold chain aside , And won by April 's sweet and fond caprice , Deck her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omen of my future years ! As pleasant sunshine cometh after rain , Let smiles of hope yet triumph over tears , And love illume the gloominess of pain ! And as beneath the elemental strife The seed doth ripen into fruit mature , So may the shade and sunshine of my life Bring truth to guide , and wisdom to endure ! And when earth 's brooding clouds shall disappear , And all the mists of time are rolled away , May light eternal from a higher sphere Break on my vision like this April day !
