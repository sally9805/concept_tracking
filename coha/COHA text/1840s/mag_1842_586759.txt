txt MR . CARLYLE , in his rhapsodical but striking way , has given this passage : " Great is Journalism . Is not every able editor a ruler of the world , being a persuader of it : though self-elected , yet sanctioned by the sale of his numbers l Whom indeed the world has the readiest method of deposing , should need be ; that of merely doing nothing to him ; which ends in starvation . " Again , says the same original writer : " There is no church , sayest thou l The voice of prophecy has gone dumb ! This is even what I dispute ; but , in any case , hast thou not still preaching enough ? A preaching friar settles himself in every village : and builds a pulpit , which he calls newspaper . Therefrom he preaches what most momentous doctrine is in him , for man 's salvation ; and dost not thou listen and believe ** We cite these passages , because they recognise an important fact , the fact that Journalism is a distinct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the king over his subjects , or the preacher over his hearers . As much as has been said of the power of the I ) ress , it is a power that has never yet been measured . Let us , then , detain the reader with a remark or two upon the functions of editorship , and the place it holds among the moral agencies of the world . No man requires a larger ranger of intellect , more varied acquirements , or greater strength of character , than the conductor of a public journal . Of course , we allude to one who acts with a full sense of the dignity and worth of his calling , and in the conscientious desire to discharge its duties . Neither statesman , lawyer , nor divine , moves in a more extended sphere , or has more occasion for the use of the noblest faculties both of mind and heart . He stands in immediate contact with the public mind . He furnishes the intellectual alirnent of the people . He gives a tone to public sentiment ; is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide of public morals . Thousands of men , each morning and evening , listen to his voice , are moved by his persuasions , are corrected by his rebukes , or corrupted by his license . The characters of men are in some degree placed in his hands . He may elevate the bad , or traduce the good . Ite can stimuhde the worst passions of inflamed times , or give an impulse to wise and beneficent movements . This influence differs from that of others who operate upon the public mind , in that , while theirs is confined to particular and distant occasions , his acts incessantly . The orator agitates only while he is speaking ; the preacher is hemmed // in by the walls of his church and the limits of a Sabbath-day ; the statesman seldom steps out of his bureau ; the man of science is fixed among his retorts and crucibles ; and tbe teacher has an existence only in his school-room . But the editor is perpetually at work . As the mails carry his speculations from one city to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreads like the waves of a pool , in concentric circles , and before the last ripple has subsided , the waters at the centre are again disturbed . Even while he sleeps , his thoughts are awake , they are diffusing good or evil , they are entering other minds , to mould them to a better or worse condition . " They rest not , - stay not , - on , still on they wing Their fli , ht " - and whether benign or pestiferous , are producing their inevitable impressions . " Give me , " is a frequent saying , " the making of the songs of a people , and I will make their characters ; " can it not be said , with equal propriety , Give me the making of the newspapers of a nation , and I will make its minds . The newspaper is everywhere , in the counting-house and in the parlor , in the bar-room and in the bed-room , on board of the steamboat and in the student 's chamber . All subjects are discussed in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , to an extent , are affected by what it contains . Napoleon , with a sagacity which characterized nearly all the actions of his life , understood this power , when , as First Consul of France , be wished to add to the title of Chief Captain of the age , that of its leading journalist . Like Richelien , be felt that " in the hands of men , entirely great , the purse is mightier than the sword . " " To discharge fully the duties of a public journalist , " says one who was so near an illustration of his own remarks that our only regrct is , that he did not live long enough to complete it , " to discharge fully the duties of a public journalist , would be to elevate the vocation to the loftiest summit of human dignity and usefulness . A public journalist , animated with a due sense of the obligations of his responsible trust , and gifted with the faculties , intellectual and physical , for their adequate performance , would well deserve to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that in which it is understood . He should have a mind filled with a great variety of human learning , and a ready command of all its stores . He should have a bead cool , clear , and sagacious ; a heart warm and benevolent ; a nice sense of justice ; honesty that no temptation could corrupt ; intrepidity // that no danger could intimidate ; and independence superior to every consideration of mere interest , enmity , or friendship . He should possess the power of diligent application , and be capable of enduring great fatigue . He should have a temperament so happily mingled , that while he easily kindled at public error or injustice , his indignation should never transgress the bounds of judgment , but , in its strongest expression , show that smoothness and amenity which the language of choler always lacks . He should , in short , be such a man as a contemporary writer described that sturdy democrat , old Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun- ' a gentleman , steady in his principles ; of nice honor ; abundance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold as a lion ; a sure friend and irreconcileable enemy ; who would lose his life readily to serve his country , and would not do a base thing to save it . ' This is the beau ideal of a conductor of a public newspaper . " But it is an ideal that , like most of the ideals of men of ardent temperament , it will take a long time to realize . Whoever will east his eye over the newspaper-press , not of this country , but of Christendom , will find that not in a solitary instance has there a man arisen , who has arrived at the high character that pertains to the profession . The same remark , it is true , may be made of every other profession ; but it is particularly true in regard to editorship* There have been divines to whom Cowper 's beautiful description of St. Paul might well be applied ; there have been Fletchers , Halls , Brainards , and Channings ; there have been Mansfields , Romillys , and Marshalls , in law ; Garricks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there have been Boerhaves , Jenners , Goods , and Bells , in physic ; there have been Boyles , Newtons , and Bacons , in science ; and Cresars , Bonapartes , and Washingtons , in war ; in short , in all departments of intellectual exertion there have been crowds of notable men ; but nowhere on the lists of great or distinguished persons do we find the name of one whose celebrity has been acquired in the walk of the Journalist . Carrel has produced an impression in France , Fonblanque in England , and Leggett in the United States , but it has been an impression as fleeting as that of leaves driven by the wind . How are we to account for this extraordinary fact l Why is it that a vehicle so intimately connected with human happiness as the press , so powerful over social issues and human destinies , has so seldom been desired by men of the loftiest endowments l This is a great inquiry , and we shall reply to it briefly . First ; it is not that the sphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it isa sphere as wide as the // universe of intelligence , and as permanent as language . As a means of swaying the minds of men , which is the essence of power , as an instrument for elevating society , which is the object of goodness , as a vehicle for the expression and enforcement of thought , it is without an equal among all the constituted agencies of human utterance . No voice reaches so far as the voice of the press , no book arrests a wider attention , or penetrates a deeper retirement than the newspaper . Secondly , it is not because the subjects with which newspaper writing is mostly occupied , are temporary and incidental . That species of composition is not confined to chronicling events as they arise , to recording the incidents of the day , or to fighting the battles of transient parties . Higher objects often engage it . The instructing of society in the nature of government , the inculcating of great principles , the application of judicious criticism , the development and controlling of social tendencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters , the prosecution of grand moral reforms , and the correction of prevailing iniquities and frauds , are among its principal functions . The editor is stationed , as a sentinel upon the watch-towers of society , to warn it of the approach of dangers ; to summon it to battle , and to cheer it on to success . Thirdly , it is not because the organization of the press is such as to cripple its activity and arrest its influence . No better organization could be required for it than is established in this country . It is founded on a basis of perfect freedom . That liberty of action , which it is the aim of the democratic doctrine to introduce into all kinds of business , it has enjoyed from the beginning . Government has never dared to impose a restraint upon it : it has been open to every variety of ability : it has been exposed to the stimulus of competition : it has received favor by all political parties . Whoever may have conceived that he possessed talent enough to undertake a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he has had the opportunity of displaying all the enthusiasm and talent that he coul*d bring to the task . No censorship nor restraint , save those of public opinion , have tended to impede the full and free development of the energies of Journalism . We must look elsewhere for the causes of the singular ract to which we refer . We must look to journalists themselves , and es* pecially to the community in which they live . It is because so low a standard has been established in regard to the efforts of editors , that so few men of the strongest intellect and character have desired it ,  --  that they have sought distinction in other vocations , less influential , but supposed to be more honorable . It is because // society has not required more , that more has not beea done . Its treatment of journalists has been singularly unhappy . They are what it has made them ; they fall short of the lofty dignity of their station , because society has fallen short in its demands . Johnson , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must please to live . " This has unfortunately been the case with the press . It has been regarded as a mere agent for pleasing society , and therefore it has aspired to no higher function . It has failed to perceive its real nature ; it has failed in asserting its claims ; it has failed in discharging its duties as an instructer ; it has failed in becoming the moral power of tremendous force of which it is capable . But its conductors are n ot so much to blame for this , as its patrons , as they are called , the public . True , it has been courted by some , and feared by others-courted by the ambitious and feared by the timid : yet , while courted and feared , it has been neglected and despised . Very little discrimination has marked the public judgment of its character . So long as it could be made to administer to prevailing prejudices , so long as it could be turned to the purposes of party , so long as it lent itself to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it met with favor . Discerning , genuine , and hearty approbation for independence , integrity , and talent , it has seldom received . A sort of double and inconsistent conduct has been expected of editors . While they have been solicited to furnish aid to all kinds of partial schemes , they have been blamed for a want of fidelity to principle ; while the whole strength of immense parties is brought to bear upon them to secure their aid or crush their opposition , they have been derided for suppleness of purpose and pliancy of doctrine ; while every man who has an object to accomplish , besets them with seductions , aud promises of reward , they have been scorned for venality and time-serving . A high , unvarying moral test has never been applied to them . When a man of lofty faith and stern virtue has arisen among them , when he has manifested a disposition to discuss questions in the light of great principles* when he has refused to listen to the whispers or move at the beck of cliques and factions , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals , and sought to acquit himself of the duties of his calling , with a nice regard to truth and conscience , how has he been received by the community * As a worthy , noble , fearless man * As a patriot who deserved well of his country * As a Christian filled with a strong sense of the re. - sponaibilities of human existence * Far otherwise . Hostility and contempt often have been his sole rewards . His professed friends have dropped away from him ; his enemies have redoub // led and sharpened their abuse ; a strong public opinion is aroused against him ; and the end of it is , that he is compelled , from the want of support , to relinquish his pursuit , and seek in some other less congenial employment , the means of subsistence and profit . Can we forget the career of the lamented Leggett l There was a man , who , during one of the most excited and interesting periods of our political experience , pursued a line of determined and intrepid honesty . A course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and connived at by a large portion of the other , had fastened upon the people a system of finance and banking , which was fast destroying their liberties and morals . The firm old soldier-statesman , who was then the President , more sagacious than many of his supporters , more honest than any of his opponents , had given the first blow in a work of revolution . After a long and desperate contest , he succeeded . Yet it was only a partial success . Mr. Leggett , who had stood side by side with him in this most trying position of the fight , saw , even in the moment of victory , that the triumph was not completely achieved . The enemy , who had been overcome by the energies of the General Government , was acting in his strength under the protection of nearly all the individual States . That enemy , he conceived , was to be attacked in his strong-holds there ; instant to his convictions of duty , he began a vigorous assault ; neither timidity on one hand , nor persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponderous blows ; day after day , he aroused the public mind with discussions full of strong thought and eloquent invective . " I can not , " said he , " for the sake of a livelihood , trim my sails to suit the varying breeze of popular prejudice . " " With old Andrew Marvell , " he continued , " I prefer to scrape a bladebone of cold mutton in defence of truth , to faring sumptuously at the cost of principle . " And what was the result l Desertion and poverty for the time  --  to be followed , when he should be cold in his grave , with monumental honors and heartfelt eulogy . The fault , we repeat , is with the community . Not relishing a good king , they can not complain if Providence sends them the log or the stork . What they pray for , that they receive . If their praise and money are showered upon those who pander to a depraved taste , they must expect depraved and worthless writers . But if they recognise the claims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately arise . There can not be a demand , in this branch of political economy , without a supply . Let us then consider what should he the nature of that demand . 1 . The community should require that their editors be intellecVOL . X. , No . XLIII. -8 // tual men . By this is meant , that they should possess both power of thought and facility of expression . The first is needed because it is incumbent upon them to grapple with great questions ; the second , because they are to make those questions plain to minds of every cast . No persons are more frequently called upon than they to give an opinion on important topics . It is , indeed , impossible to fix limits to the range of subjects which they are compelled to investigate and discuss . All that interests men as members of a social and political body ,  --  the measures of parties , the relations of nations , the merits of laws , the pretensions of science , the schemes of projectors , the movements of reformers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , themes of newspaper controversy and remark . Politics , international and municipal law , political economy , moral and social science , and the art of reading individual character , must be understood by the editor , - and not only understood , but explained . He must have that clear insight into general principles , and that familiarity with details , which will enable him to speak of whatever he undertakes with clearness , originality , and decision . It is not enough that he have a skimming acquaintance with his subject , - that he be able to talk glibly of it , or that he can declaim with an infinity of sounding phrases and empty periods . Topics are often sprungupon him with the suddenness of a surprise - topics in which the happiness of immense numbers of people are involved . Many look to him for information and guidance . His faculties , fully prepared and rightly disciplined , must be at his command . He must stand ready , with argument , with illustration , with eloquence , to convince the doubting , to awaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to instruct and interest the more enlightened . Now , to do this effectually he must have been a patient thinker , a profound scholar , and a practised writer . He must have accomplished his mind by the observation of mankind , by the reading of books , and by habits of quick and felicitous expression . He must , above all , be penetrated by that deep Christian philosophy which estimates all questions in their bearing upon the most exalted and permanent interests of human nature . 2 . The community should require of their editors that they be firm and independent men . Force of will is no less necessary to them than greatness of thought . Few men have more temptations to fall into an expedient and vacillating course . Regarded by many , and often regarding themselves , as the mere hacks of party , or mere instruments of gratification to prevailing passions , they are not expected to exhibit a lofty or fervent zeal in // the prosecution of a great cause . Like advocates paid by a client to carry a particular point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have made the worse appear the better side . In many instances , if they have succeeded in embarrassing the adversary , if they have covered an opponent with the filth of abuse , if they have given a plausible aspect to a falsehood , if they have assisted a party in imposing upon credulous or ignorant people , if they have been faithful to the interes.ts of their employers , they are clapped upon the head as serviceable fellows , and rewarded with a double allowance of governmental or mercantile patronage . The notion that the press has a worthier destiny , seems hardly to cross their minds . That it should become a fountain of truth and moral influence ; that an editor should take his stand upon some high and good principle , which he should assert boldly , in the face of all opposition ; that he should strive to carry it out with the earnestness of a missionary , with the self-denial of a martyr , despising as well the bribes of those who would seduce him , as the threats of those who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice , impressed with the awful sanctity of his vocation , and willing to face danger and death in the discharge of its duties , - is an intrepidity which , we fear , to most of the managers of public journals , has seemed more like the wild dream of an enthusiast , than the practicable object of a sober , thinking man . Yet it is an end that has been , and may be attained . It is an end for which a solemn responsibility is laid upon them to strive . No less than this should society require them to be ; nothing less than this can render them worthy of the trust which is committed to their administration . Emancipating themselves from the aurea catena which binds them , they must act with the valor of freemen ; breaking away from the jesses which confine them basely and slavishly to earth , they must learn to soar in the pure , clear region of free and energetic thought . 3 . Journalists , again , must be required to imbue themselves with a just and Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the unkind feelings and low aims which characterize their intercourse and efforts . We do not speak only of those flagrant violations of propriety common to the most degraded portions of the press . We speak of the puerility , the violence , and the want of justice , which even the most respectable journals occasionally exhibit ; we speak of their proneness to distort and to exaggerate , their recklessness of fair-dealing , their want of candor , and their base subservience to particular classes . Indeed , *o frequent have been their offences , that their dishonesty has // almost passed into a proverb . " I only , " said Jefferson , " believe the advertisements of a newspaper ; " to which another distinguished man has added , " and he ought not to have believed them . " In this , no doubt , they magnified the deficiencies of the press , yet there was much ground for their remarks . He lies like a newspaper , ' would not be a far-fetched comparison . The instances of their departure from truthful fidelity are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of positive falsehood . We are aware that it is urged in extenuation , that much of their sbort-coming is to be ascribed to the circumstances of haste and confusion under which daily editors write ; we know it is alleged that in other pursuits , those of the law and merchandry for instance , the average honesty of those who follow them is not greater than that of journalists : but , with every wish to deal justly , we must say that a large amount of moral aberration remains against them which admits of no palliation or excuse . What , shall we be told , because a man writes in haste , that he must therefore write falsely l - that because lawyers and merchants fall below the standard of virtue , therefore editors should be allowed to do the same , - editors , whose influence is so much more extensive , whose duties are so much more importantl It is a shallow defence . Better that they relinquish their profession for ever , than sacrifice to it their integrity . Better that they drop the pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that they should wield the former only to sap and extinguish public morals ! No ! a more exalted morality should be required at their hands . When a man assumes a public station , to direct the opinions and form the characters of his contemporaries , when he voluntarily places himself in the attitude of a leader of the general mind , he should be compelled , by the force of public sentiment , to cherish habits of the strictest accuracy and honor . We demand of the preacher of the pulpit , that he should not degrade his office by inconsistencies of conduct ; can we demand less of the preacher of the press l Should a Channing , or a Ilawkes , or a Dewey , or a Hughes , act in a manner derogatory to their sacred calling , would society forgive them l If a magistrate on the bench pollute the ermine of justice , do we admit any apology for his venality or corruption * Should a Taney , or a Story , or a Baldwin , or the meanest functionary of a county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or be intimidated by popular clamor , swayed in his decisions by personal feeling , how could he avert degradation and disgrace l Could any circumstance of his position be pleaded in palliation of his crime l* Why , then , should we excuse similar defections in those who occupy similar places , and whose truth , consistency , // and justice , are even more necessary than theirs to the good order , virtue , and happiness of society l It is time that editors themselves , and that those who are accustomed to be affected by their counsels and judgments , should recognise the momentous responsibilities that hang upon their power . It is time that they perceive the elevation and might of their position . It is time that the former be prepared to throw aside the littleness and the baseness which they have too often indulged , and that the latter require a manlier and worthier performance than they have too often failed to exact . We can not conceive of a more desirable life , than that of a pure , high-minded , amiable Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and noble community , than one whose public agents shall reflect the unbending integrity , the spotless honors , and the wise benignity of their principals . Let us add a sentence or two in the conclusion of this matter . We have spoken freely of the present condition of the press : we have spoken with equal freedom of what it might become . It is with no spirit of uncharitableness that we have pointed to its failings : it is with a spirit of benevolence and hope that we have indicated its duty . We are sorry that some of our strictures are deserved , but we are glad to know that instances exist in which they are unjust . It gives us pleasure to acknowledge that within the last few years its character has greatly improved . Were it not invidious , we could show prints , which to the best of their ability have striven to realize the ideal which we have depicted . We could refer to a Bryant ,  --  whom as a man and a poet we revere ,  --  surrendering the applause that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and individual character , to become an example of the true , accomplished , unyielding editor ;  --  to a Brownson , who prefers the name of a candid , fearless writer , to the soft indulgences of clerical supremacy ; - and to some others , still young and obscure , to whom the emoluments and honors of professional and political distinction have no blandishments , in comparison with those of becoming , as journalists , upright advocates of all that is good . But our object is not personal . We have wished to rescue Journalism from its in fidelity to itself , and from the indifference and contempt of the public . We have wished to assert its claims , to vindicate its dignity , to exhort it to its duty . We rejoice to notice that young men of education and talent , who have been accustomed to crowd the professions of law , medicine , and theology , are many of them directing their energies to the business of editorship and popular instruction . One of the best signs of the times is the growing demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures . It is a sign that the love of knowledge is spreading through all classes ; that the treasures of philosophy and poetry are no longer to be shut up in rare caskets , to be the possession of the few ; that the general mind , too long satisfied with low and sensual delights , is seeking for higher aliment . The mass of men are availing themselves of the means of improvement which a condition of freedom furnishes , and call for an increased number of instructers and guides . Many who are competent to the task , are answering the call . Already they constitute a considerable body . They are marching forward to scatter the seeds of good or evil . It is important that their movement take a right direction . Momentous consequences hang upon their action . If they are true to the cause of liberty , refinement , and progress , they can accomplish a world of good . If they are animated by the right spirit , they can give a tremendous impulse to the onward march of society . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep and damning will be their guilt.
