txt THERE is something which we like well in the title of this unpretending work ; it is straightforward and expressive , suiting well with the character in which the writer presents himself to the world . One of our modern writers , who think it refinement to go as far as possible from the Saxon barbarism of former days , might have described it as views seen when he " was being " on foot in Europe ; but with all the evident grace of such forms of speech , which are now in high favor , we can not help thinking that the plain phrase sounds as well , and conveys the meaning better . We say better , because // it is more characteristic ; it conveys the idea of a directness of mind , such as does not let " I dare not " wait upon " I would " ; such as enables a man to form his purpose , and carry it forthright into action ; such as gives him , when he stands in presence of scenes and persons that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know clearly what his own impressions are , and to set them faithfully down ; in a word , such as gives the manly decision which this writer manifested in forming his plans for visiting Europe , when he doubtless had the cold comfort of finding it esteemed the most ridiculous enterprise in the world . He saw that the fulfilment of this bright hope of his early days was a possible thing ; and though it must be done with toil and trouble , with humility and self-denial , and with a brave contempt for those social obstacles which are harder to overcome than any which nature throws in the way , he felt that he had power to meet the labor and to make the sacrifice , confident that he should be overpaid for his efforts and privations by the satisfaction and improvement which the pilgrimage would bring . Most ancient men would say , that for a journeyman printer , without property , without friends , without encouragement , to undertake the tour of Europe , was the wildest of all human visions ; and we doubt not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy from those who knew his adventurous design . But those prudent and estimable persons were looking , all the while , to external advantages for the purpose , and making no account of inward resources ; when experience shows , that , whether to trudge through Europe , or to foot it through life , - for John Wesley says there is no carriage-road to heaven , - the strong mind and strong heart are more than a match for them all . And yet , in such a pilgrimage there must be a great deal to encounter ; for it is a familiar truth , though , when examined , a queer one , that when nature gave us hands and feet , with an evident intent that they should be employed , men should esteem those most respectable and fortunate whose condition is such that they never use them . The great object of social existence is for each to raise himself to a position where he can be as lazy and good for nothing as he pleases ; and when he has drawn that high prize in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homage , even though he cumber and curse the ground . The head may be as empty as // famine , but other heads will hend to it with graceful homage ; while , if the same vacuum be in the pocket , where nature abhors it less , and man considerably more , there are none to do it reverence . Should it be the poor man 's lot to travel , no full-orbed landlord smiles upon him ; the waiter passes coldly by ; he must almost scale the heavens to find his barren little upper chamber ; and at table the meats are cold as this world 's charity , before they are served to him . Those animals , assuming to be human because they go on their hind legs , who are insolent where they have the opportunity , welcome him as a mark for their scorn ; and if his comfort depends on the deference and attention of others , he will have but little to enjoy . If , however , he is sufficient to himself as a man , feeling that the humblest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if he can take the world as it is , and not expect to find icicles in August , nor flowers in the snow ; if he sets his own price upon himself , and does not submit to the appraisement of those who judge from without of what may be within , - he will find the misanthropy , which looking at the surface is apt to engender , giving place toa healthier feeling . He will no more be angry with boors high and low , than with " briers which prick and scratch , because they can do no other he will receive insult and unkindness , not as personal injuries , but as mere illustrations of human nature ; and he will be surprised to find how much better mankind appears to one who thus regards them . He will find favor and friendliness in quarters where he least expected them ; he will feel the affronts and injuries which afflicted him so much diminishing till they are few and small ; and at last he will begin to suspect , that something may depend upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watch for discourtesy is sure to find as much of it as he wants , and rather more , whoever meets men with an open hand and heart will perceive currents of feeling under the roughest ice of manner , and will carry a sunshjne with him that shall melt the ice and the coldness away . Without knowing any thing of Mr. Taylor except from his book , we apprehend that he has made this discovery ; or perhaps , as the Transcendentalists would say , he has it by revelation in his nature . He makes no complaint of insolence ; if he found others rough and churlish , he did not think it necessary to distress himself therefor . If they withheld // civilities and attentions , he treated it as their affair , not his . He received all kindnesses with manly gratitude , and though not gifted , like the Hebrews in the wilderness , with shoes and raiment that waxed not old , and sometimes obliged to bid the last shilling a sad and affec*tionate farewell , he managed to see as much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barings would have done in the same expedition , and for an expenditure , we imagine , considerably less than theirs would have been . Those potentates , we surmise , could hardly have kept their subsistence and recreation within the hounds of three shillings a day . But it is doubtful if either of them would have produced a better hook than Mr. Taylor , with his two years ' outlay of five hundred dollars , which appear to have learned of their owner to travel , so that they might jointly and severally have boasted that never dollars went farther than they . It may seem superfluous to raise the question , under what circumstances one can travel to most advantage . Using the word travel in its ordinary sense , that of passing through a foreign country where one has no time to stay , certain it is , that most men , if they had the power , would choose to go well provided with letters of credit , at least , if not with some show of rank and wealth , such as conveyances at leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle the question , for we often prefer what is not best for us . And the answer depends very much upon the objects which we have in view . If it is to see the country , with whatever scenes of interest it contains , they are about as much at the service of the poor as the rich . No one can rob him of the right of nature ; bricks and stones in their different circumstances and positions are not hidden from his eye ; his deliberate way of journeying enables him to see every thing to advantage ; and when it comes to ascending mountains , he has prospects before him which gouty toes and fashionable dresses would never undertake to reach . If his aim is to see those distinguished men whose names are fan*iliar to him , he may get a sight of Wordsworth , or hear a speech of Brougham , without money as well as with it . Few travellers find much advantage from their letters , which are given without heartiness , and received without much delight . Besides , a hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little idea of what he is or how he // appears ; men do not open their minds and hearts to a stranger . And this transient acquaintance is so apt to overset enthusiasm , and remove all its imaginative glories , that after we have had such opportunities , we often wish we could restore the old relation of unknowing and unknown . But if his object is to see man , - and everywhere humanity is the chief subject of interest to man , - he will not satisfy his curiosity , if it be intellectual , with the mere sight of crowns , trappings , and orders ; for the more refined and cultivated must be substantially alike in all countries . He will wish to go deeper , and explore beneath the surface ; for it is with the world of mankind as with the world of nature , where geology has unfolded a whole science of wonderful interest in the earth 's foundations , hidden , till of late years , from every human eye . So the study of man teaches the importance of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uncared for , and which might have remained so for centuries longer , had they not been upheaved by revolutions , like the primary rocks bursting up into mountain ridges , crushing and overwhelming all that was once above them . These sudden and sharp explosions have made it necessary , and somewhat interesting , to dig into these regions below and whoever takes his safety-lamp , and goes down into these human depths , is surprised at the mines of character , the riches of feeling , and the extent and grandeur of those formations , over which proud feet so carelessly tread . Now , the wealthy wayfarers have no idea of diving into tl ) ese caverns ; you will not persuade them to go mourning , without the sun , into the damps and darkness of those regions . But the pedestrian , having less reverend care for his raiment , wants nothing better than to see these pillars on which all social systems rest . He therefore goes among " the masses he walks and talks with them as an equal . They neither insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him who comes like one of themselves . He can study them at leisure ; be learns how climate , government , and sirnilar influences affect them ; he has full opportunity for investigating the great problems of humanity , of which the rich traveller knows as little as the graceful pennon at the masthead does of what is passing in the forecastle below . But all this depends very much on the purpose , and the outfit - we mean intellectual outfit , of course - with // which one travels . If he has ample resources of time and money , he will go forth like Adam and Eve , with the world before him , though not precisely with Providence for his guide , hut rather following the steerage of his own sweet will . He sets forth in gallant trim , like Gray 's gilded vessel , not doubting that he shall find brilliant and happy adventures , delightful sights and emotions , and that he shall return at last , laden with treasures of memory , to bless and cheer his days . But alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has touchingly said , " human hopes are rotten things . " The steamer is unsavory to the sense , and his comrades of the voyage pugnacious and vulgar . The angels of the storm have sea-sickness in their wings ; the agents of the customs are rude and unaccommodating ; he is stripped of the golden fleece at princely hotels ; if there is a landscape to he seen , the sky is darkened with a shower ; if he is to explore a romantic country , the almanac has " much rain about this time , " running down the whole length of its page . The parliament is indefinitely postponed , and the court in mourning . The weather brings such rain or drought , heat or cold , as was never heard of before . If he flies to the Continent , some servant shall take him in hand for his own special picking ; a vagrant prince shall appropriate the post-horses which he had contracted for ; by day he shall be browbeaten and lightened of his coin , and at night those small destroyers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeking whom to devour . In Switzerland , he shall be frozen almost beyond all chance of thaw . When he flies into sunny Italy , the arctic circle shall come to spend the same winter in Rome . When he wants moonlight for the Coliseum , that uncertain luminary shall be in her last quarter ; and so , like dark care behind the rider , vanity and vexation shall be the companions of his way . Many times shall he wonder at his own folly in leaving a comfortable home for such varieties of woe . He shall weep aloud at the units daily added to the sum-total of his unmerciful bills ; and often shall he swear in his wrath , that if he ever outlives these afflictions , no earthly inducement shall prevail upon him to take to the waves and highways again . Now , the difficulty is , not that Nature has suspended her usual business in order to vex these travellers , nor that their doom is very different from that which other poor mortals // bear . But in all cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increase in a geometrical ratio , while the gratifications observe a more lingering rate of advance ; the supply may be very fair , but the demands far exceed it ; as we see that wayfarers , who formerly thought nothing of the delay of a few hours in stages , are ready to put the conductor of the railway train to death if the cars are ten minutes behind their time . The wayfarer on foot takes all these things as matters of course ; he is glad when he escapes troubles , but he is not astonished when they come ; being in that condition to which much in the way of comfort and pleasure can be added , while not much can be taken away from it , he is really best situated for enjoying every thing as he goes . And so , no doubt , he does ; he is not oppressed with the weight of splendid chains ; and whether his cares are light or not , lie makes light of them , and so finds them easy to bear . But after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling is the personal improvement which it will bring . It is not necessary to observe for the sake of others ; and when one has the prospect of writing a book before his eyes , as we may see in the case of English tourists in this country , he is more apt to ask what is merchantable than what is just or true ; and surely the customers of Peter Pindar 's razorseller were as much beholden to that person , as readers are to those ladies and gentlemen who have undertaken to tell them what America is , and is to be . Neither is it necessary that a traveller should enjoy his peregrinations ; if he is happy in the prospect and the recollection , both of which joys he is sure of , let his experience be what it may , he secures the chief happiness which this strange world affords , though , while he is on the way , he may sometimes " distrusting ask , Can this be joy ? " While these things are of less importance , it is essential that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his expedition ; and this purpose can be most effectually answered by encountering difficulties and hardsl*ips , the more the better . ryhe great object is , to call out the energies of mind and heart . Prosperity lets them snore life away to their own lazy satisfaction ; adversity applies its rough voice , not to speak of its hands , to the sleeper 's ears , and lets him know that there is something for him to suffer , and to do . It is true , it is hut a pale sort of gratitude we feel to // those who wake us in the morning from any sort of slumber still , though rather thankless , the office is severely kind . And nothing renders more effectual service of this sort to the faculties , than travelling with resources at their last gasp , shoes that have almost finished their mortal pilgrimage , with wits which the fear of want sharpens like a whetstone , and a heart which , having nothing else to lean upon , grows brave and strong from the feeling that it depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem condensed and crowded into one , and when the effect of a gigantic struggle on the moral nature does more to strengthen it than the patient labor of years . XVe hear of instances in which a single night of agony has whitened the hair upon the head but this , if true , is only an outward presentment of the manner in which difficulties and dangers supply at short notice that experience and maturity which were before entirely wanting . Let any one who is particularly desirous to secure this advantage set forth , as Mr. Taylor did before him , with a preparation as sparing as that of the first apostles . Let him meet the troubles of wayfaring as manfully , and take the same intelligent pleasure in all that he sees . Let him as cheerfully postpone the wants and wishes of the body in favor of the higher interests ofthe mind ; and if he is not a wiser and happier man after thus buffeting the waves of the world , it must be , not because the effort is not improving , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiency which sometimes exists in those who travel , as well as in those who stay at home . We think that the community is under great obligation to Mr. laylor , not only for the pleasant story of his wanderings , but for proving to others that it is not necessary to be rich , in order to secure the benefit of travel ; and , lest they should be unwilling to take his word for it , showing them by his own example how the thing is done . It is not every one whose natural taste and temperament are so well suited to such an enterprise . There are many who , like Lord Anson , might go round the world without ever being in it . But we have many whose natural inclination turns to the Peripapetic school , and who , if they can not meet the expense of a college education , will be glad to take their degree in the university of the world , where the student must at least be active , and where he will meet // with a tolerable proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to supply . lIr . Taylor tells us , that he had , from his earliest recollection , this enthusiastic desire to visit foreign lands ; but his condition , as a printer 's apprentice , was far from affording facilities for the enterprise . There are some cases , however , in which difficulties answer just as well , if not better ; and in the beginning of 1844 , when his time of service was within two years of expiring , finding that a relative was soon to embark for Europe , he determined to realize his youthful dreams . But while the whereunto was settled , the wherewith was not so easy to be found . To raise the means , he published a small volume of poems , which is in general the way to sink the means that one happens to have , instead of gathering more . But he succeeded in giving an impression of his talent which made some editors of periodical works desirous to engage him as a writer of letters by the way ; and the sum thus in possession and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliance to meet the expense of his travels . Several of his poetical writings appear in this work ; but in the early effusions of poets it is not easy to determine whether the inspiration is that of talent or of taste . The mechanical structure of verse is now carried to an artist-like perfection of finish , never known before . Magazines , and other works of tl ) e kind , abound in pieces which , fugitive as they are , run away to oblivion with a graceful flow , compared with which the elegies of Cotton Mather , for example , move like a stage-coach without wheels . Nor can we always judge , till after considerable examination , whether the power comes from ambitious effort and sympathy , or whether there is really a spark within which may be kindled into a high and glorious flame . We are not sure that it is not the best way , instead of taking pains to fan it into a fire , to leave it to find its own most appropriate manifestation . Supposing that the young writer should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milton , " his imagination may give him a power of painting in language , and a glowing richness of description , of which we see traces here , and which will make a man eloquent as an orator , earnest and inspiring as a writer . If he should never find a voice or a pen , these will throw a living charm over all his intellectual nature , which will prevent his ever walking in darkness , even should he journey to the grave alone . // Mr. Taylor sailed in a packet-ship for Liverpool , in the summer of 1844 ; taking passage in the second cabin , which is not , like the Hebrew fancy of the second and third heaven , a decided improvement on the first ; but where he made himself as comfortable as the absence of light , air , repose , and sundry other blessings , would allow . Just after landing , he took a run into Ireland , to take a glance at that land of mirth and misery , and to get a hasty view of the Giant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part is but fifty feet above the water . This goes to confirm Johnson 's gracious remark , that it might be worth seeing , but not worth going to see , - a remark which the traveller finds to his sorrow will apply to many other things in this world . He appears to have left tbe Green Isle after a visit of a single day , and almost immediately we find him on Loch Lomond , in those scenes where human genius has lighted up the beauty of nature with an attraction that will never wear away . He shoots like an arrow to the top of Ben Lomond , to enjoy for an hour the glorious prospect , and then dashes over to Loch Katrine with equal expedition , taking the boat upon the waters , but on shore trusting to that conveyance which nature has so liberally supplied . At times , famished , drenched , and benuinbed with cold , as he went through the tangled forest and mountain paths , he must have been agreeably reminded of Fitz James 's tour in the same region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of gold and silver , than the monarch by his trusty steel . He was fortunate enough to have a bright , fine morning for his view of Loch Katrine ; and he then hurried on to attend the Burns festival on the banks of Doon , where a whole people were to pour out their enthusiasm for him who , without the charms of fiction , without the enchantment of romance , without the old glories of the past to aid the effect of his inspiration , but simply by his own mind and heart , brought a nation into sympathy with him , and established a fame which every generation is building up nearer to the skies . With all Burns 's infirmities and errors , none could deny that he was a man . It is more as a man than a poet , that he enchains the general confidence and regard ; or i'ather , his poetry was only the lantern which the bright light of his spirit shone through . The management of this celebra // tion did not exactly suit Mr. Taylor 's republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an inclosure round it ; on the stage were the sons and sister of . the poet , and those who were to make addresses . But none were admitted within the privileged circle , save those who paid fifteen shillings for a ticket to the dinner ; so that the Scottish peasantry could not enjoy the commemoration of one of their number , and the poet himself , had he come to life for the purpose , could not have been admitted to his own celebration . But there was little , too little , time to speculate on these things after a hasty view of Edinburgh and Abbotsford , the traveller took passage for London . We regret the necessity for this haste ; these were the very scenes for his painting , and there was no fear of being too minute in his narratives and descriptions . We do not care so much to know what he thought , or how he felt , in cities and crowded ways , as to know how these places , with their intellectual and romantic associations , affected his thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might he expected , has nothing peculiar in it ; writing it , as we suppose he did , for some newspaper or journal , not much was required save exact description of those sights of which readers are never weary , though they come to them by almost every steamer , and with little variety of form . But when he reaches the Continent , he is more himself ; there is a growing life and spirit in his narrative , and he gives us an animated interest in all that lie describes . Probably he was himself more deeply excited for he says , that surrounded with old buildings and their associations , " the fancy is busy reconciling the actual scene with the ideal ; but the want of a communication with the living world without walls up one with a sense of loneliness which he could not before have conceived . " Landing at Ostend , he passed hastily through Bruges , only remaining long enough to see the belfry , and hear its chimes , which will henceforth ring to American ears with pleasant associations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dripping like a Naiad from the rain which showered upon him in the open car . At Cologne , he saw for a moment the cathedral which all Germany is now boiling over with enthusiasm to complete according to the original design . But Heidelberg was his aim , and lie rested not till he reached that place , the name of which is now so familiar , where 42* // he proposed to learn the language , and make some considerable stay . And here , when he has time to take breath and collect his bewildered senses , which could not be done in the " holy and miraculous tavern , " however comfortable it might be , he first begins to convey that full and clear impression of himself , which every traveller , who wishes to interest readers , must contrive to give ; and which in this case is so favorable , that we are glad to halt and go over the ground with him more leisurely than the railroad whirl of his former movements would allow . It is an exceedingly pleasant impression which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is much in which a stranger can employ his time with satisfaction and advantage ; hut though there are many objects to remind one of Arminius , Luther , and the more peaceful masters of song , few things will be contemplated with more pleasure by the visiter from this country than an ancient arbor vihv , which was transplanted from America in 1618 , but which , he says , does not thrive well , probably because the soil is less damp than it requires . When he speaks of ascending the Heiligenberg , and visiting the Library , or pondering amidst the ruins , every thing seems bright and happy ; but unfortunately there is another side to the picture . The law requires one out of every hundred inhabitants to become a soldier , and he witnessed the selection of the conscripts , when , as may be supposed , intemperance was their baptism into the wretched life before them . And yet , is there any thing in this more sad than the business of volunteering , which is so much vaunted here ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that slavish existence by circumstances or oppression , than to find them , of their own free will , consenting to be military slaves ? In making excursions to some distance in the neighbourhood , he found himself followed , as a native of the New World , with afflicting curiosity . But this was not without its compensations ; as he stopped at a prune orchard to buy some fruit , an old man called from a tree , * They are Americans ; give them as many as they want , for nothing . " This is better than being insulted for the repudiation of some of our States , a compliment not unfrequently paid to Americans abroad ; where , as Lord Byron supposed that Washington in his childhood was lulled to sleep with the sound of // Niagara , most foreigners consider Massachusetts and Mississippi so near and intimate neighbours , that the Northern State must needs have indorsed all the paper of the other . He found that many of the Germans were undismayed by what was industriously told them of this country . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as pure as paradise before it was profaned by sin , and they were ready to take the risk of its evils , when no longer able to bear the hardships of their own . There are few things more pleasing than the mention of a Bavarian family of this description whom he met in the omnibus for Frankfort . The husband was sanguine and determined ; the wife seemed to mourn in silence the prospect of leaving her beautiful fatherland ; as night fell , the little girl drew near her father for his accustomed kiss , and then sunk to sleep in a corner of the wagon ; while the boy , in the artless confidence of childhood , laid his head upon the stranger 's breast . Mr. Taylor appears to have been edified with what he saw of the German students . There is , no doubt , a full flow of intellectual life and liberty among them ; hut we do not see clearly why a childish mummery should everywhere be associated with philanthropic and lofty objects ; and as to their duels , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compared with the paltry exhibition . On the contrary , nothing can be more pleasing than his description of the ceremonies with which Christmas and New Year 's eve are welcomed ; these are youthful , to be sure , but they are meant for the young , and they give older persons the blessed opportunity of renewing for an hour the lost and lamented childhood of their souls . The forests of evergreens that fill the streets , the blaze of lamps , and the sound of happy throngs in the public squares ; the mysterious preparation in arranging the presents , the Christmas-tree bright with gilded nuts , sweetmeats , and glittering tapers , and , more than all , the gladness in every face , which evidently shone through it from the heart , made him earnestly wish for a similar observance of the festival in his own distant land . And , Puritans though we are , we entirely agree with him in his feeling ; it was a great mistake in our fathers to sweep Christmas with all its associations away . The Thanksgiving which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as the pumpkin , which is its emblem , is entirely respectable in its way , // though less graceful and imaginative than some other fruits and esculents . If Christmas is not an honored festival , the best course is to make it so ; and we are glad to see a disposition to replace it in the general affection , to reunite the broken associations into the same bright chain which , in former years and other lands , has bound hearts together in happy and holy sympathy , resisting the tendency of the world 's influence to throw them apart from each other , and giving them the most delightful fancy and anticipation of a Father 's house on high . We can not follow Mr. Taylor in his travels through Germany , though they abound in pleasant description . He went forth to make the tour of that country on foot , with about thirty dollars in his pocket , hut nothing dismayed at the prospect of short commons and hard walking . He alludes to the observation which his appearance excited , and " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he happily terms it , which most men are conscious of when in a land of strangers . But he appears to have found acquaintance by the way , and the name of American almost everywhere insured him a welcome . Of Gdttingen he has no recollection so vivid as that of sickness , and the sympathatic consumption of the purse which it threatened ; but we soon find him manfully striding off among the Hartz mountains , with that resolution to get to the top of every thing which appears to have been his passion . Through Leipsic , Dresden , and Prague , he made his way to Vienna , a place which had the same attraction for him that it has for all other strangers , since with all that activity and bustle of cities which make a foreigner feel more lonely because he has no part in them , there is an unreserved and social manner in the public walks and gardens , which are universally frequented , such as is found in no other capital in the world . It has many objects of interest ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the pictures , a luxury in which our country is at present deplorably wanting . He mentions in a simple and manly , but enthusiastic manner , those which he liked the best . Of the celebrated Madonna in the Dresden gallery he has given an excellent description , entirely without that pretension to connoisseurship , which is so intolerable , and so easily detected ; since in case of that affectation , the author falls vigorously to work to paint his own emotions , which , all the while , we are tolerably sure he did not feel . Neither // is there any overweening confidence in his attempting these descriptions ; for we believe that what is best in the efforts of every art comes back to simpliciiy . Many things may be excellent for those who have acquired a taste for them , which will not be appreciated by others ; but we believe that in poetry , music , and painting , the last results of cultivation return to nature , arid therefore can be understood and valued by the intellectual and refined without any unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his residence in the capital of Austria , it suddenly occurred to him to examine his subtreasury , and he was agreeably entertained to find , that when his expenses there were paid , he should have four dollars left to sustain him back to Frankfort . To most men this discovery would have been alarming ; but it did not prevent his enjoying tl ) e summer climate and scenery of Lower Austria , which seemed to him the most beautiful in the world . It is really curious to hear him speak at one time of walking in the rain , and dining on a short allowance of bread and water , and , in the next sentence , of the delightful region he was passing through . But it teaches a lesson which it is well to know ; which is , that the power of enjoyment is often in an inverse proportion to the means , and many of our happiest recollections grow out of serious trials ; as it has been ascertained by experiment that the fairy-like creations of frost upon the morning window follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panes . Mr. Taylor went , of course , to Switzerland ; and without taking notice of his descriptions of that scenery which is served up to us by so many writers , - not , however , because his word-painting is not as good as theirs , - we are more engaged with his humanity , and the social interest which he took in the men whom he encountered . Though he had received a prejudice against the Swiss while in Germany , he was agreeably struck with a look and bearing of independence , which are not found among the lower classes of Germans . The children , too , seemed bright-eyed and beautiful , which he was disposed to ascribe not wholly to their bracing climate , but to their inheriting the birthright of the free . He says that nothing ever made him happier than a little child who ran up to him , clasped his hand in both of his tiny ones , and looked up to him so affectionately that be loved him at // once . The farmers everywhere spoke cheerfully to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this ; we felt that not a word of kindness is ever wasted , that a simple friendly glance may cheer the spirit and warm the lonely heart , and that the slightest deed , prompted by generous sympathy , becomes a living joy in the memory of the receiver , which blesses unceasingly him who bestowed it . " Many , unfortunately for themselves , travel all the way through life , without coming to an acquaintance with the truth which he here expresses ; a truth which , if admitted to the heart , and carried into action , would remove that ill-taste of existence , of which so many are ever complaining , would till with gladness the dry and vacant channels of feeling , and make glorious summer in xvintry and barren souls . He has less enjoyment in travelling in Italy , where the people are too apt to take vengeance on strangers for the oppression of their masters , after the fashion of other animals , as mentioned in the Pursuits of Literature , when " this dog smarts for what that dog has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear the imposition of landlords ; he therefore was indebted to them only for lodgings , and as he and his companion ate their simple meals by the road-side , and moreover were arrayed in long white blouses , he believed that they were taken for pilgrims ; at any rate , they excited a curiosity which was more inconvenient than gratifying . He had thus a fair chance for studying the Italian sky , and he allows , that , in the day , it deserves its reputation for depth and transparency , but maintains that the light of its setting suns does not compare with the rich western glory which he has often seen at home . We like the manner in which he speaks of works of art , - the Venus , for example ; he neither follows nor defies the common opinion , but simply gives his own . This is much better than making an inventory , as some travellers do , of emotions which they think it highly proper to feel , and would fain persuade others that they do . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all succeed ; but they impose to some extent on themselves , and that is the full reach of the delusion . He evidently cares more for pictures than statues , and more for nature than for either . Nothing can he better than his description , in few words , of the musical echo in Pisa , answering to the notes of the cicerone 's voice . " After a moment 's pause , // they were repeated aloft in the dome , but with a sound of divine sweetness , as clear and pure as the clang of a crystal bell . Another pause , - and we heard them again fainter and sweeter , followed by a dying note , as if they were fading far away into heaven . " The person who can write like this will soon find echoes in the literary world which will delight to answer to his voice .
