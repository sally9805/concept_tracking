Harry Barnwell Heigho , boys , Boston is confoundedly dull just now  --  there 's nothing going on at all  --  no horrid developments at the police  --  no distinguished musicians  --  no rival lecturers beating out each other 's brains  --  Dull ! intolerably dull ! Ned . Ned Mathews ' T is a melancholy truth .  --  Do n't speak of it , unless you have some remedy to propose , Doctor ! Harry . Harry Barnwell The Count has been here six weeks , and is now an old story . I wish to Heavens he would blow up and create a little excitement . Ned . Ned Mathews You suspect , then , that he wo n't last long , Harry ; that he 's something of an impostor . Harry . Harry Barnwell I can scarcely be said to suspect him , but I have a vague fancy that he will one day turn out no better than he should be . I reason from the career of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Harry . Harry Barnwell Ho , Willett , glad to see you here , man  --  Ned . Ned Mathews Where have you come from  --  when did you come to town  --  what brought you here ?  --  Tom . Tom Mathews " Brings't with thee airs from Heaven , or "  --  Willett . Nathan Willett Glad to see you all  --  came to town this morning  --  from my cell in the country  --  on the wings of a north easter  --  want to have some fun . Are you satisfied ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Decidedly !  --  a most capital and circumstantial account of yourself . Willett . Nathan Willett And what 's going on in town ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Well , nothing particularly remarkable .  --  Mrs. Fussy gave a great general crush the other night . The Polka does not flourish remarkably . On warm days the ladies begin to exhibit symptoms of shedding their coats . The eau Brocchieri is about to ruin the medical , or rather surgical profession . These , I believe , are all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not included Count Stromboli in your catalogue of novelties . Harry . Harry Barnwell True  --  I had forgotten we had a rustic here . Willett . Nathan Willett Count what ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Count Stromboli ! Willett . Nathan Willett Stromboli !  --  that accounts for a dream I had last night . I fancied that I entered Boston , and was forthwith swallowed up by an earthquake . But who is this titled gentleman ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Who he is I will not pretend to judge ; but he is a most accomplished man , with a creditable moustache and a most elaborately braided coat , and will curse you , Nathan , fluently as well as systematically , in any modern European language . He calls himself an Italian , yet speaks English so well , you would never suspect him to be a foreigner , until he is angry . Then his accent and idiom speak him a Frenchman . However , here he passes unchallenged for what he represents himself to be  --  a noble Italian exile . Willett . Nathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? lineally descended from Perkin Warbeck ? A count patent by authority of Baron Munchausen , sovereign of Central Africa . Harry . Harry Barnwell Very possible  --  nevertheless he is all the rage , and it is rank heresy to utter a word against him . Ned . Ned Mathews And who , think you , Willett , has this leviathan in tow ? Willett . Nathan Willett How should I know , man ? Ned . Ned Mathews Well , do n't you recollect a rather soft-headed little fellow at Cambridge , by name Experience Green ? Willett . Nathan Willett To be sure I do . We used to quiz him terribly ; he 's a sort of connection of mine , I believe . Ned . Ned Mathews The very same . He has been to Europe , and come home ten times more of a donkey , if possible , than when he left  --  High spiced with foreign affectations , and talks a mixed lingo , which you know amongst a certain variety of young ladies , is an irresistible language of Love . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nathan Willett Ay , ay , but the Count ! Ned . Ned Mathews Well , I fancy he picked him up in the street , with his French . At any rate he met him in Paris . You know what sort of society such Americans as Green get into at that place . The Count persuaded him that he moved in the highest circles , could introduce him at court , ( which of course he never did , )  --  in fine , initiated him into the mysteries of the city , Green paying the piper . Willett . Nathan Willett That 's a very fair presumption . But how came he here ? Ned . Ned Mathews In the suite of Green . When that distinguished youth announced his intention of returning home , the Count was taken with a sudden desire to visit this country . In gratitude , I presume , for that personage 's services abroad , and to reciprocate the obligation , Green takes him about here , as the Virginians say , and does the honors of the city . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereby hangs a tale . " Willett . Nathan Willett What ! mysteries already ? Ned . Ned Mathews Yes . Scarcely had he set foot on shore , when a noted French or Italian cook , or waiter , or something of the kind , who was expecting some relatives , rushed up to the Count with expressions of the greatest delight , and claimed his acquaintance in the most provoking manner . Willett . Nathan Willett And how did the Count receive his advances ? Ned . Ned Mathews With the most freezing contempt  --  in short he disavowed him altogether . This occurrence did not shake Green 's confidence a whit , and accordingly he brought him on here , and now chaperones him about with the greatest assiduity , the Count meanwhile meeting his attentions with an inimitably patronizing air , truly edifying to all beholders . Willett . Nathan Willett That 's a singular state of affairs . Harry . Harry Barnwell But it 's the most amusing thing , Nathan , to hear Green 's running commentaries on the Count 's text . Stromboli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures  --  ( you know what a memory Green always had )  --  and when the Count utters a sentence , Green will preach upon it by the half hour  --  But you 'll see him in operation before you leave town ; I suppose you will stay some time ? Ned . Ned Mathews By the way , Nathan , Green has raised a queer little amber-colored goatee , which answers no other earthly purpose than to betray the poverty of the soil on which it grows , with a very slight sprinkling of a milky moustache on his upper lip ! Willett . Nathan Willett Say no more  --  I am on tenter-hooks till I behold him . But in what style is he appareled  --  " Tout-a-fait l ' Anglais , " or entirely on the Parisian plan ? Ned . Ned Mathews Parisian , sir , Parisian ! Black as night from top to toe , his dress offering a pleasing contrast to his complexion !  --  with four yards of brocade cravat , and a pin , ( to speak within bounds , ) well nigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one in the Arabian Tales , as big as a roc 's egg . Willett . Nathan Willett Ay , you can tell at a glance whence an American who has been abroad last came . We are like chameleons , assuming the color of the place on which we stand . When shall we have absurdities of our own ? Ned . Ned Mathews Nay , but Willett , we Bostonians have the reputation of being Bostonians wherever we go , and no matter now long from home . Willett . Nathan Willett And what 's worse , I 'm afraid we deserve it . But that 's only on this continent  --  we only despise the rest of our countrymen . When we get abroad in Europe , we are ready enough to copy : not but that we do mingle a little Bostonianism in every style we assume  --  a little lead amidst all our feathers . Shade of Experience Green , I apologize to ye . Ned . Ned Mathews Bravo , Lord Chesterfield  --  Hints on manners  --  I 'm off ! Tom . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Willett . Nathan Willett And what are Tom and Ned about now ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Oh , they are about town , going to parties one night and moralizing like hermits the next . Their uncle set them both up in business . Ned soon went down  --  Tom has just wound up . This same old uncle of theirs died the other day , and left ' em each a sung little fortune . Willett . Nathan Willett Ah , pithy  --  concise  --  you 're imitating the Chinese Style . But Harry , what a great invention those rich old bachelor uncles are  --  if one could only get out a patent for them , eh ?  --  make your fortune in a jiffy . I 'll set some of the ingenious heads in my parts about it ; I dare say something can be invented to answer the purpose . Harry . Harry Barnwell Do n't speak of such a thing , Nathan . It would ruin the whole earth : nobody would work . Willett . Nathan Willett By the way , Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license to  --  to  --  you know . How do you come on ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Oh , I 've had my tin up in gilt letters for two months . I have had several cases , but no fees , with the exception of one cent which I extracted from a child 's gullet . Willett . Nathan Willett You have not many patients to occupy your time ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Not I !  --  though I wait with patience . Willett . Nathan Willett Then you may attend on me.  --  Come on ! and no more such shocking puns , I charge you . ( Exeunt together . ) SCENE III .  --  PARLOR IN MR . BRADLEY 'S HOUSE . Discovered Mrs. and Miss Bradley . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Well , Eleanor , I wonder if we shall have any visitors on this our first reception day ? For my part I do n't see why we should n't . There 's Mrs. Theophilus Brown 's house is crowded on Monday , and Mrs. Mathews ' on Tuesday ; so why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a ring . Eleanor , my dear , assume your most elegant position . ( Settles herself in her chair . ) So  --  so  --  now for dignity . Good Heavens ! another ring  --  how fortunate we are ! Enter Count and Green . Ah , Count Stromboli , ah , Mr. Green , I thank you for the honor of calling . Gentlemen , will you set down . Green . Experience Green Avec beaucoup de plaisir , Mrs. Bradley , the Count and I will avail ourselves of your invitation . Enter Willett and Harry . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Happy to see you to-day , Mr. Barnwell , and you , Mr.  --  Mr.  --  Willett . Nathan Willett Willett , madam . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Pardon me , Mr. Willett , it is so long since I have seen you . Harry . Harry Barnwell ( aside ) . A very ingenious affectation of ignorance , Mrs. Bradley  --  it does you credit . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Count Stromboli , allow me to make you acquainted with Mr. Willett.  --  ( Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willett , you are acquainted with all the rest of the company . ( Seats herself . ) A pretty sharp morning , Count . Count Count Stromboli  --  ( who has taken his seat near Miss B. ) Yes , Mrs. Bradley , yes  --  but when I was traveling in Russia , madam , the cold was so intense that the brandy froze in my ma  --  ma  --  ma  --  my traveling companion 's liquor case . Green . Experience Green Ay , vraiment , Mrs. Bradley , the Count had a most uncommon adventure and narrow escape in Russia . It appears that he became involved in a quarrel with one of the royal family , Prince Kickhimoff by name , and they were to have fought with sabres . But unfortunately the Emperor heard of the affair , had the Count arrested , and would have sent him to Siberia for life , had he been a subject of the Russian Empire . As it was , he narrowly escaped the knout . He was hurried off to the frontier in a dark coach , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was then set at liberty , after having been warned never again , on peril of his life , to enter the Russian territory . Willett Nathan Willett ( aside ) . Humph ! Likely ! Count . Count Stromboli The last time I was in Florence , however , Mrs. Bradley , the thermometer  --  Green . Experience Green By the way , aprops of Florence , a curious incident occurred to the Count there . He was walking along one day about dusk in the environs of the city , when suddenly as he was passing , absorbed in melancholy reflection , under the piazza of a magnificent palace , a bouquet of the most exquisite flowers dropped at his feet , and concealed therein , he at length detected a diminutive note , written in a delicate hand , containing these words : As you are a man of honor , meet me this night at twelve in the garden behind the palace . I love you . It was signed  --  The Princess Ditchioli . Willett . Nathan Willett And what was the upshot of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Count to reveal what took place that night , but he more than once has hinted something about assassins and a dangerous wound . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley What a dreadful mystery ! Willett . Nathan Willett Green , I give you credit for your story . You have told in half a dozen sentences , what I have seen hundreds of times spun out into as many pages . Count Count Stromboli ( aside to Miss B. ) Who is that vulgar young man ? Eleanor Eleanor Bradley ( aside to the Count ) . That is Mr. Nathan Willett ; he resides about a hundred miles from Boston , but comes in occasionally during the winter . Count . Count Stromboli Oh , a peasant , eh ? I thought so from his manners . Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley No , no , Count !  --  you mistake me . He lives with his mother and sisters on an old family estate . Count . Count Stromboli Is he rich ? ( Aside . ) Per bacco !  --  if he is , I 'll cultivate him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not so much in his confidence , nor so conversant with his affairs , as to speak positively . Harry . Harry Barnwell Have you heard , Mrs. Bradley , of the last grand fracas ? Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Bless me , no ! what do you allude to ? Harry . Harry Barnwell You have n't heard then  --  It 's a great story . You know Mr. Pippin  --  a fiery little man  --  we call him at the club , King Pepin ? Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Oh yes , I know him ; I 've seen him at parties , that is to say . Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley Do n't you recollect , mamma , he wanted one night to be introduced to me at Mrs. Mathews '  --  But go on , Mr. Barnwell  --  I 'm anxious to hear the story . Harry . Harry Barnwell Then you all know Mr. Bobadil Brobdignag , a large man , who wears fiery plaids , jewelry , and all that sort of thing ? Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley To be sure . Every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most prominent gentleman . Harry . Harry Barnwell Well , he and Pippin had a dispute about something or other , and Brobdignag fell upon poor King Pepin , and belabored him terribly . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley And will there be a duel ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Nothing of the sort . After having wreaked his vengeance on his adversary , by beating him to his satisfaction , Brobdignag goes off full tilt to the police officer , informs a magistrate of the whole affair , and has poor Pepin bound over to keep the peace . Willett . Nathan Willett But Brobdignag will be put in Coventry ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Not at all . We do n't mind these things now-a-days ; such affairs have become so common . I should say it would be rather a feather in his cap , than otherwise . It will at least give him notoriety for a while . Willett . Nathan Willett Of not a very enviable kind , I should say , however . Harry . Harry Barnwell Willett , my dear fellow , I am afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country has given you a great many strange notions . Count . Count Stromboli Talking of duels , when I was at Toulon  --  Harry . Harry Barnwell Toulon !  --  that 's where the galley-slaves are confined , is it not ? Count Count Stromboli ( indignantly ) . Yes , sir , and what of that ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Nothing , sir , nothing . Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley Heavens , Count , do n't look so fierce . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Now , Count , compose yourself . Will you try my salts ? Willett Nathan Willett ( aside ) . Suspicious ! Count . Count Stromboli No , I thank you , Mrs. Bradley  --  As I was saying , when I was at Toulon  --  Willett . Nathan Willett Forgive me the interruption , Count , but may I ask how long ago that was ? Count . Count Stromboli Just eight years and a half ago , sir . I was con  --  con  --  connected with the Polytechnic school  --  that is , I  --  I studied there for several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native language , for my family estates are situated near the French frontier . As I said before , I studied at Toulon ; and political disturbances , and the misfortunes of my family have since made it convenient for me to pass much time in France . Green . Experience Green Ah yes , Count , and that affair of the Countess Capricci  --  Count . Count Stromboli Hush , Mr. Green : not a word of that . Green . Experience Green Ah , Monsieur le Comte , pardonnez-moi . Count . Count Stromboli As I was saying , when I was at Toulon , I was walking along one morning through the most disreputable part of the city , ( I always had a passion for seeing such places , ) when three soldiers in undress uniform suddenly rushed out of a dirty little cabaret , and seizing me most unceremoniously , began , without a word of explanation , to drag me towards the door . I struggled desperately , fancying they intended to rob and murder me , but they assured me they only wanted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To this I consented , on condition that they should take their hands off me : they agreed , and in we went . Now the difficulty was this .  --  Two of the company had made a bet to the following purpose . A bets B that he can drink every drop of a certain large measure of wine , without drawing breath . The wager is accepted , and A finishes the measure at a draught and claims payment : B demurs on the ground , that there are several drops left in the mug . The question then arose , whether the expression " every drop " was to be taken in its literal and strict , or in its free and common acceptation . The company not being able to agree on this point , resolved to seize the first passer-by , and make him decide , giving him for his pains a cup of wine , which was accordingly presented to me . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Detestable stuff , I dare say it was . Did you drink it , Count ? Count . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very tolerable vin ordinaire . Well , the case to me appeared clear  --  A was certainly in the right ; but I declared to the company that the whole affair depended upon the light in which the parties interested had viewed the meaning of the expression . Harry . Harry Barnwell A most righteous , sage , and clear decision . Count . Count Stromboli But that would n't satisfy them . They insisted upon my settling the matter one way or the other . There could be no neutrality : So , notwithstanding some scruples of conscience , I determined to decide in favor of B , who appeared to be the most ferocious fellow . Harry . Harry Barnwell And what came of this legal and iniquitous sentence ? Count . Count Stromboli Why , up starts my man A , and swears I am a mean , ignorant , unjust scoundrel . I could not stand that , even from an inferior , and demanded an apology . It was refused  --  I insisted on revenge  --  our host produced an old pair of rusty foils  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went ! Eleanor Eleanor Bradley ( aside ) . How I tremble for the Count . Count . Count Stromboli I soon discovered that I had a most expert swordsman to deal with . We kept it up for fifteen minutes with only an occasional scratch , and I began to get the better of him , when unfortunately my foot slipt , and he ran me through  --  Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley The heart ? Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley The throat ? Harry . Harry Barnwell The viscera ? Count . Count Stromboli The left arm . At the same moment my weapon struck him on the knee pan . ' Foul ! foul ! ' cried half a dozen voices . " Accident ! " said I , as I coolly wiped my sword , bound up my arm with a handkerchief , and departed in quest of a surgeon . In six days I was myself again . Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley But what became of your adversary ? Count . Count Stromboli He died ten days afterwards of the lock-jaw ! Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley Horrible ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Count is . He never told me that before . Willett Nathan Willett ( aside ) . I dare say ' t is a true story of a drunken brawl . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley To change the subject , for it makes me melancholy , do you know that Mrs. Flourish has imported a new set of French furniture from Paris , and is to open her house for exhibition soon ? Harry . Harry Barnwell I 'll warrant , Mrs. Bradley , we shall see whatever she possesses . Why , she goes round her room like an auctioneer , praising all her wares  --  giving the history of that , and the price of this  --  a regular walking inventory of her goods and chattels . She was born for an upholsteress . Green . Experience Green The Count says , that in all his travels , he never saw houses better furnished than in Boston . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley And what do you think of Mrs. Flourish 's furniture , and the arrangement of her house , Count ? Green . Experience Green Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will you be so kind as to let me speak for myself once in a while . Green Experience Green ( shrinks back ) . Certainly , Count , I  --  I  --  I  --  beg your pardon . Count . Count Stromboli I ca n't say I admire Mrs. Flourish 's establishment particularly  --  there is a display , a newness about it , which strikes one as being rather vulgar  --  an affectation of state I do n't like . Harry Harry Barnwell ( aside to Willett ) . The Count has certainly attained to that degree of knowledge , that he knows on which side his bread is buttered  --  Mrs. Flourish has no rich daughters . Willett Nathan Willett ( aside to Harry ) . But she has prospective heiresses in the shape of certain gawky and affected nieces , to my own certain knowledge . But I suppose uncertainty do n't suit the Count . Green . Experience Green I agree with the Count most decidedly  --  most decidedly  --  oui , oui , certainement  --  pas de double . But if I might venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gave you the right , sir , to have an opinion ? Harry Harry Barnwell ( aside ) . Well , I swear it is too bad , to see poor Green playing the toady to such a ruffian as that . ( Count converses in a low tone with Mrs. Bradley , while Willett draws Green aside . ) Willett . Nathan Willett Look here , Green , I 'm your cousin . Confound it if I can stand by , and see such a blackguard  --  Green . Experience Green Blackguard ! Willett . Nathan Willett Such a blackguard , I say , as yonder Count Stromboli , speaking in that style to you . Green , you must insult him ! Green . Experience Green Insult him ! The Count ! Willett . Nathan Willett Yes . Tell him you can not stomach such insolence . Green . Experience Green But I do n't feel affronted  --  he means no offence  --  it 's only a way he has  --  ' t is the Count 's manner . Willett . Nathan Willett Oh !  --  if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you must say something at all events . Tell him at least that this is a free country . I insist upon it . If you decline , I 'll have to do it myself . Green . Experience Green Why , if you think he meant to insult me  --  Willett . Nathan Willett No , no , you need not make anything serious of it , but do something to redeem your honor . Green . Experience Green I will . ( Walks towards Count Stromboli . ) Look ye here , by the living Hookey , this is a free country , Count Stromboli . The expression of opinion is the privilege of every man . ( They all laugh , and the curtain drops . ) END OF ACT FIRST . ACT II . SCENE I.  --  MORNING .  --  PARLOR IN MRS .

But what was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diablillo !  --  that I picked up in Seville . It has a very good sound , indeed . Martha . Martha Mathews Diablillo !  --  very pretty , very pretty ! You must have traveled a great deal , Count ? Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews ( aside . ) Diablillo !  --  Dear patience , how he has poisoned her principles ! Count . Count Stromboli Yes ; with a life of leisure , easy circumstances , a passion for traveling , and the spirit of adventure , a man may accomplish much in a short time . ( Servant ushers in Mrs. Bradley and Eleanor . ) Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Good morning , Miss Martha , and you , Count . Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley Good morning , Martha . ( Bows to Count Stromboli . ) Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Where 's your mother to-day , Miss Martha . Martha . Martha Mathews That 's more than I know . I thought she was at home , but she can not be found . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Well , I shall establish myself here , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ? Martha . Martha Mathews No , I fancy not . She has not taken the carriage , and mamma is n't calculated for long excursions on foot . Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews ( aside . ) No , indeed ; I am almost dead with standing up here already . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley ( aside to Eleanor . ) Do you notice how dowdily Miss Martha is dressed to-day  --  she copies her mother exactly . Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews ( overhearing her  --  aside . ) Thank you , Mrs. Bradley , I 'll be even with you some of these days . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Here , Count , come over here : I want to speak to you . ( Whispers to Count , who seems to deny some charge . ) It is n't true then ? Count . Count Stromboli No , I assure you upon my honor , it is not .

Count Stromboli No , no . ( Makes his bow , and exit . ) Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley The Count is certainly a charming man  --  what a figure ! Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley What hair ! what mustaches ! what an imperial ! Martha . Martha Mathews And then such a manner as he has  --  the aristocratic grace  --  the true and only indication of high blood  --  the air noble ! Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley His linen is unexceptionable !

Eleanor Bradley Good-by , Martha , dear . ( Embraces her . ) ( Exeunt Mrs. Bradley and Eleanor . ) Martha . Martha Mathews Ha , Mrs. Bradley , good-by to you , with your sweet air , and patronizing condescensions , and your amiable fright of a daughter . You sat the Count out , did you ? You succeeded . Never mind , I shall be able to cut out Eleanor now without difficulty . Diavolo ! Diablillo ! The dear Count ! ( Exit Martha . ) Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews Again ?  --  The poor deluded thing ! I 'm glad I am not the heroine of a romance , for it would kill me to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear of betraying my presence  --  perspiring in a most indelicate and unlady-like manner the while . Ten minutes more , and I should have given up the ghost , I verily believe . Ah ! how my bones ache  --  I must go and lay down awhile to rest myself . I suppose I may safely venture out now  --  No ! voices again ! How unlucky ! ( Enter Ned and Tom Mathews . ) Ned . Ned Mathews So , Tom , I find the Count has been here again this morning . He is becoming unpleasantly intimate ; he pays his visits almost as regularly as the baker . Tom . Tom Mathews Oh , ay , he makes himself at home , with the most lordly indifference and self-possession . Ned . Ned Mathews To tell the truth , Tom , I fear he has made a serious impression upon Martha 's heart . Indeed , she confessed as much the other day , when I questioned her closely about it . My mother too seems to be strangely prepossessed in his favor . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught her what slippery characters these fellows always are . Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews ( aside . ) Age and experience , indeed ! There 's a pair of well-mannered sons for you , upon my word . Tom . Tom Mathews It is curious . They come over here without letters of introduction , and get into circulation like counterfeit coin , no honest man knows how . Ned . Ned Mathews And may his fate be the same ; to be thrown out at last . Indeed , I fancy it will be so , for I am more and more convinced every day , that he is a humbug . However , as mother , notwithstanding her knowledge of the world , seems to be persuaded to the contrary , we must get up some plot or other to undeceive her . As to expostulation , that has already been tried in vain . Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews ( aside . ) Never will I be driven or deceived thus into a bad opinion of the Count . No  --  henceforth , out of mere perversity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his most firm ally .  --  The deceitful boys ! To go about to confound their own mother ! Tom . Tom Mathews And Martha ? Ned . Ned Mathews We must show the Count in as unfavorable a light as possible , and bide our time to open her eyes . If all else fail , I have a plan which I will impart to you anon . Meanwhile , as there seems to be no one at home , let us go criticise the fashions in the streets . Tom . Tom Mathews I have nothing better to propose  --  so let 's depart . ( Exeunt Ned and Tom Mathews . ) Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews ( peeping out . ) Ha ! ha ! they are gone at length , the plotting youths . I will follow them at once , and make my escape from the room , for apart from the fatigue of standing , I have experienced the truth of the old proverb , that " Listeners hear no good of themselves . " Ah ! I shall be as stiff to-morrow as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pester me with affectionate inquiries about my rheumatism , or my lumbago , although they know full well that ladies of any fashion are never troubled with such vulgar complaints . ( Exit Mrs. Mathews . ) SCENE II .  --  A PUBLIC STREET . ( Enter Willett and Harry Barnwell from one side , and Experience Green from the other . ) Green . Experience Green Gentlemen , have you seen the Count this morning ? I ca n't imagine what has become of him . I have searched high and low , and he is not to be found . I feel very uneasy , very uneasy . Have you heard of him ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Why , Green , I thought you looked unusually thoughtful  --  as if you actually had something on your mind . Do n't trouble yourself , though : the Count will never be drowned or shot , I 'll warrant , though I 'll not vouch for his not disappearing mysteriously . Willett . Nathan Willett Why , how is this , Green ? I thought you and Count Stromboli were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that affair of yesterday has lost you his affection . Green . Experience Green No , no , I think there 's no danger of that . He borrowed five dollars of me last night to pay for a supper he treated me to . I ca n't believe he bears me any ill will . But excuse me , gentlemen , I must be off . Harry . Harry Barnwell Gad , friend Green , you look as much distressed as Van Amburgh might do if his best elephant were missing . Willett . Nathan Willett Or Boswell , when somebody else had the first hearing of one of the Doctor 's thundering witticisms . Harry . Harry Barnwell Or a hen that has had her nest-egg removed . Willett . Nathan Willett Or a cow whose calf had been driven away . Green . Experience Green Then you know nothing of the Count ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Not I  --  I do n't trouble my head about him . Stay  --  I think I saw the shadow of one of his mustaches on the dome of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it certainly looked very like it . Willett . Nathan Willett Have you read the police report for the morning ? Green . Experience Green No  --  why do you ask such a singular question ? Willett . Nathan Willett I thought you might find some indication of the Count 's whereabout 's , or mention of his movements there . Green . Experience Green Why , what can you mean ? Willett . Nathan Willett Nothing  --  nothing . Only a singular coincidence I noted . I saw it stated in the morning 's paper , that a certain personage , whose name was intimated by the letters C  --  t S  --  i , had been detected in picking the pocket of a particular friend of his , E. G. Green . Experience Green This is a very strange affair  --  very ! I must go to the police office , and see about it . C  --  t S  --  i ! Count Stromboli  --  E. G. !  --  Experience Green  --  very strange  --  very extraordinary  --  I do n't understand it . ( Exit Green . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , Green , if you find him not in Limbo , go to Mrs. Flurry 's . Do you hear me ? Green Experience Green ( returning ) . Eh ! what ! Mrs. Flurry ? Heavens ! ( Exit again in haste . ) Willett . Nathan Willett There goes Green , as much at a loss without the Count , as a miller with nothing to grind , or a turnspit out of employ . But who is Mrs. Flurry ? I do n't recollect that I ever heard of her before . Harry . Harry Barnwell You must have seen her , though , somewhere or other . She is one of those energetic enterprising ladies , who are eternally fishing at home , and at watering-places , for native and imported literary prodigies , for dukes ' youngest sons , and titled midshipmen from England , peers , knights , barons , &c.,; from the continent , distinguished and unheard-of generals , with whiskers and spurs from the Lord knows where , and all such like Gullivers among the Lilliputians . Willett . Nathan Willett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry . Harry Barnwell More especially , however , she affects the distinguished foreigner , banished for political offences : particularly if his beard and moustaches be correct . You will readily comprehend that the lady soon cast her eager eyes upon such a prize as the Count Stromboli . No spell , however , could reach him except through Green , who guards him with a jealous eye , and doles out his acquaintance like the spoils of office , to hungry applicants , as he listeth . Willett . Nathan Willett Happy man ! Fortunate possessor of the elixir of life ! Harry . Harry Barnwell Mrs. Flurry soon found out how the land lay , but nothing daunted , opened her batteries forthwith upon Green , determined to obtain access to the empire by subduing the frontier fortress ; and she carried on the siege vigorously , I assure you . I was present one day when she made a final demonstration upon Green , and carried him by storm . Willett . Nathan Willett Harry , Harry , you make my teeth chatter . May I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed . Harry . Harry Barnwell " Mr. Green , " said she , " you must positively bring that dear Count to see me to-morrow . Now , no refusal : I shall be mortally offended if you do n't . " Green capitulated on the spot , making , however , a great favor of it . Mrs. Flurry now is , or soon will be , a formidable rival to Green , in showing off the paces of the Count . Hence his agitation when I mentioned her name . Willett . Nathan Willett Pshaw ! Is n't it too bad to see people who ought to know better , thus playing the jackal to nameless vagabonds , or to speak more correctly , vagabonds with names ? Harry . Harry Barnwell Poh ! Willett , you 've grown crusty and cynical in the country . Take the world as it goes , and do n't quarrel with your bread and butter . But come , let 's move on . I protest , here have we been standing in the street , till , I dare say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all your fault  --  any one could tell you came from the shades of rural life . ( They begin to walk . ) But how came you to tell Green that story about the police report ? Willett . Nathan Willett Why it 's truth  --  that is , newspaper truth . To be sure , I gathered that C  --  t stood for Cornet , and I changed the final y into i ; yet you can not deny , that I repeated the story as closely as can reasonably be expected . Harry . Harry Barnwell Say no more  --  a most satisfactory vindication ! ( Exeunt . ) SCENE III .  --  PARLOR IN MR . BRADLEY 'S HOUSE . ( Discovered Mrs. B. and Eleanor . ) Mrs. B.

Mrs. Bradley Ah ! you are all humility , are you ? We will speak no more of this now , Mr. Bradley . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley ( aside . ) Why did I rush on my fate ? " Now , " she said ! Ominous word ! Horrible visions rise up before me , of curtain lectures yet to come , and three-legged stools now resting their weary limbs . " Now ! " Alas , I 'm in for it  --  Mrs. B.

Mrs. Bradley Now , Bradley , dear , I know you 're a good-hearted man at bottom , though you must acknowledge your temper might be a little more even . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley ( aside . ) And I 've endured her for twenty years ! Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley But in the main , I confess you 're a very good-natured man , ( for a husband . ) Now , Bradley , dear , you surely ca n't refuse the idol of your young affections  --  the wife of your happiest days ?

Mrs. Bradley Now , Bradley , dear , we must have a party , and invite the Count here , once at least before the winter is over . You know it is but proper and civil we should open our house once in a while . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley Aha ! you 're coming the affectionate over me , are you ?

Eleanor Bradley And you will let us have the Count , father ? Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley You know we have not given a regular jam since Eleanor came out . Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley And the Count is received in all the most fashionable houses . Mrs. B.

To the Count , however , I object . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley And why such absurd prejudices ? Do you doubt his authenticity ? Everybody of any style receives him . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley I 'll warrant it . Mere people of fashion are more easily deceived by such characters than any other class of mankind . For my part , I have seen in my day many of these peregrinating knights , barons , and counts of the Holy Roman Empire , these wandering comets which drag long tails behind them ; tales of political offences necessitating exile , and so on , and I can recall but one or two who have not turned out like the kings and emperors of a tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Count  --  Count Stromboli brought letters . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley I never saw them , nor anybody else , I fancy . Letters from whom ? From such small potentates as himself , I suppose : notorious gamblers in Paris , and so forth . Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley But he was introduced by Mr. Experience Green . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley I 've seen the gentleman . A youth whom a year 's residence or so abroad hath , singularly enough , enabled to forget his native language , and talk a sort of broken-candy gibberish ; who leads the Count about , and sings his praises in a hurdy-gurdy style , like a poor German boy and his monkey . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Faugh , Mr. Bradley , your allusions are too vulgar ! Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley But Mr. Green is of the best family . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley Ay , and a simple youth , just turned out of college on contract , with the degree of A. B. , and no superabundance of brains to support the character . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is sent to Europe , where , in one great capital or other , he falls in with some gentleman of the Count 's class , who plucks him well , but adroitly . Green carries the joke a little farther , and brings home his instructor for a puppet-show , as a mighty man of fashion . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Well , all I have to say is  --  No Count  --  no party ! Eleanor . Eleanor Bradley And so say I  --  No Count  --  no party ! Mr. B. Mr. Bradley So say the quack doctors :  --  " No cure  --  no pay ! " Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Ebenezer Bradley , beware ! Mr. B.

Harry Barnwell Hollo , Green , no Count yet ? No Stromboli  --  no tna  --  lava , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas ? Green . Experience Green I can find no traces of him . I feel quite melancholy . ( Aside . ) My five hundred dollars I lent him !  --  Gone ! Harry . Harry Barnwell Melancholy ? No wonder . All the fashionables will be melancholy if this Vesuvius go out . Never mind , Green ; you can play the volcano on a small scale  --  the artificial mine  --  sulphur and iron filings . Bah , man , you can turn yourself into a sort of solfaterra , and exhale some of the pestiferous vapors you have imbibed by constant intercourse with him . Pluck up ! Pluck up ! Green . Experience Green And you have seen nothing of him , either ? Strange ! Harry . Harry Barnwell Not I. But how was Stromboli dressed to-day ? Did you play the chamberlain this morning  --  assist at his toilet ? Which of his two immortal suits has he on to-day ? The white sack , blue cravat , standing shirt-collar , and liver-colored pantaloons ? or his amatory costume ,  --  the black pantaloons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest , like " the frog who would a-wooing go ?

Harry Barnwell I asked , because now I recollect I did catch a glimpse of a pasteboard-looking figure at a distance : but it might have been a man carrying a sign or a bundle of mats . No , no , I do n't think it could have been the Count . On second thought it could not have been the Count . Good-by , Green , I must be off ; but I wish you good luck in your search ; never fear , he 'll turn up again , mark me  --  you wo n't get rid of him so easily . He 's quiet now , but we shall soon have another eruption . Good-by . ( Exit Barnwell . ) Green . Experience Green " Wo n't get rid of him so easily ! " What does Barnwell mean ?

Count Stromboli Ca n't you see ?  --  Fried potatoes and sausages . Not to be sneezed at , I assure you . Green . Experience Green Saucissons ! How came you to obtain a knowledge of such things ?

Besides , one gets tired of souffles and turbot la crme , riz de veau piqu , and fricandeaux , and petits pois , and dindon aux truffes , and huitres de Cancale , and pats de Perigord , and all the delicacies we used to luxuriate in at Paris , and longs for vulgar meats . Green . Experience Green Count , you are a philosopher ,  --  you 're always right . But what drink have you there ? Hard cider  --  Ciel ! Count . Count Stromboli Ah , yes , your hard cider is capital stuff to give a tone to the stomach  --  very strengthening , indeed . Green .

Here , Green , have you a ninepence about you ,  --  I have no change  --  nothing less than five dollars  --  and pay this boy for his paper , will you ? Green . Experience Green Glad to accommodate you , Count : let 's be off out of this horrid place . It seems to me , however , that your presence here demands explanation . Count . Count Stromboli Mr. Green , do you mean to doubt my representations ? If you do , sir , our intimacy is at an end . Green . Experience Green No , no , no , no .

They talk about the shrewdness of these Yankees , but may I be degraded instantly again into a postillion 's boots , if they are n't very easily taken in . A little gold , plenty of brass , and an abundance of tinsel , and you 're made . I have been in many lands in my lifetime , but never in one which suited me so well as this .

Nathan Willett Why , Count , you are the most accomplished swearer that has existed since the time of Bob Acres . Where did you pick up so many strange oaths ? Count Count Stromboli ( perceiving the two ) . Ah , gentlemen , how are you ? As to my expressions , I answer , that in my extended travels , I have ever made the oaths of a people my peculiar study . I consider them as a sort of exponent of their religious faith and morals .

Willett . Nathan Willett Lord Nugent ? Through what part of the world did you travel with him ? Count . Count Stromboli In Egypt and Asia Minor . Very pleasant fellow he was too  --  delightful companion  --  capital fellow to travel with .

Nathan Willett I have often heard him speak of his eastern tour , where all he saw was old , worn out , and decaying , in contrast with his travels here , where everything was new and fresh . ( Musing . ) I have a vague remembrance , to be sure , of a strange character he told me of , who swore in every language under the sun  --  a valet , dragoman , or courier , or something of the kind . Jacques  --  Jacques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stromboli ( aside ) . Confound his memory ! That infernal propensity to display my learning and genius in swearing , will be the ruin of me yet . It faut que je coupe mon baton  --  cut my stick  --  comme disent ces btes Americains . ( Aloud . ) Ah , yes , yes  --  we had a queer sort of Jack-of-all-trades with us . Jacques  --  as you say , Jacques  --  really his surname has escaped my memory  --  however , he was , as you describe him , un homme bizarre  --  he imitated me . But , Mr. Willett , do you go to the opera to-night ? Ah ! opera divina , thou remindest me of my cloudless native skies  --  Italia ! Italia !

Nathan Willett Then , Count , if you have any idea of comparison , you would certainly call her mother a mer de glace . Green . Experience Green Bon , bon , bon . Very fair , Willett , very fair .

Martha Mathews Then he has such a very unfashionable healthy-looking cheek , and robust figure . Ned . Ned Mathews Mistaken again : he does not weigh as much as I do . But would you estimate a man 's value as an apothecary fixes the quality and price of magnesia by its weight and bulk ? Would you judge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the hydrometer ? Shall a man 's specific gravity be the criterion of his merit ? Why , there 's the Count himself , that model of a man , that Apollo , weighs twenty pounds more than Willett  --  ( Enter Count and Green. ) as he himself will tell you . Count , you come in good season . We were just speculating on your weight . Martha . Martha Mathews Fie upon you , brother ! Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews ( aside ) . What will not bad company do ? That Willett fellow is at the bottom of that speech . Count Count Stromboli ( smiling ) . Am I to be led to the shambles , that you inquire my weight ? Do you regard me as a slaughtered hog ?

Harry Barnwell Even the most fashionable men consider themselves honored by an invitation to their house when they choose to open it for the reception of company , for they are usually very quiet .

" Dear Green "  --  he 's going to ask a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask of you  --  a very awkward business  --  but you know my connections , standing , and all that sort of thing , in Europe . Green . Experience Green ( aside ) . Hanged if I do . ( Aloud . ) I have no doubt , Count , that they are very respectable . Count . Count Stromboli My remittances have not arrived as regularly as I expected , and to come to the point at once , I am becoming dreadfully short of funds . Green Experience Green ( aside ) . I knew it  --  he wants to borrow money  --  this is getting to be expensive . ( Aloud . ) In short , Count , you want to borrow  --  suppose I say  --  I  --  I  --  have no money to lend ? Count . Count Stromboli That would n't alter the case . You know you could easily borrow a couple of hundred dollars or so for me , or stand security for me , which is the same thing . Green . Experience Green And you would n't be offended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all  --  not at all . I know you would do everything in your power to oblige me . Green . Experience Green ( aside ) . Confound him , there 's no shaking him off in that way ; he wo n't take a hint , that 's clear . ( Aloud . ) But , Count , your remittances have been exceedingly irregular  --  excessively , strangely so , permit me to say . You promised to pay me last month faithfully , on the arrival of the steamer , the money I lent you when you first came over to this country . The steamer came , but  --  Count . Count Stromboli I know it , my dear fellow , I know it . Your kindness to me has been most exemplary . I need not tell you how deeply it has affected me  --  my eternal gratitude is yours already . I assure you , on my honor , it is with the utmost unwillingness I apply to you again . I have deferred till the last moment throwing myself on your good nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Green . Experience Green ( aside ) . Nor ever will , I fear . Count . Count Stromboli Instead , I am overwhelmed with bills , pressing for payment . Daily necessity demands money  --  the unsettled state of Italy makes my resources precarious  --  duns are harassing me , and where shall I find consolation and assistance but in my beloved Green ? In short , my dear friend , you must lend me two hundred and fifty dollars . Now no denial . You are one of the few men in this world I could borrow from , without a feeling of humiliation , degradation , pain . My friendship for you  --  Green . Experience Green ( aside . ) Oh , the devil take such friendship . Count . Count Stromboli My friendship for you , I say , goes even so far as that . Ah , my dear friend , I repeat it , you are the only man in this country I would take money from . Green . Experience Green ( aside ) . And confound such preferences I say  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lend him a copper , I 'll bet . Count . Count Stromboli Surely , Mr. Green , you can not hesitate at a paltry two hundred and fifty dollars ? You can not be so penurious . If you are , Mr. Green , our connection is severed at once and for ever . I thought better of myself , I must confess . Green . Experience Green ( hesitating ) . But Count , consider  --  this business of paying out money without any return  --  for nothing , as it were , is ruinous . Count . Count Stromboli Nothing ? Is the friendship of Torquato Count Stromboli nothing ? Green . Experience Green ( aside ) . It is an infernal nuisance , as I begin to perceive . Count . Count Stromboli I had never dreamt that that could be  --  but such is human friendship . That I should be weighed in the scale against two hundred and fifty dollars , and found wanting ! Diavolo ! Diavolo ! Green . Experience Green We-e-ll  --  Count  --  you promise to pay me punctually on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stromboli Ah ! Green , my priceless friend , I thought no less of your liberality . Pay you ? I swear it  --  with my very first remittances . Green . Experience Green ( aside ) . That assurance is n't quite as good as the bank , nevertheless . ( Aloud . ) By the first steamer , Count , you will be enabled to pay me ? Count . Count Stromboli No doubt of it . If my money is ever to arrive , I shall have it then . Green . Experience Green Count , on this understanding , you shall have the money . Count . Count Stromboli My generous friend ! After such an example of disinterested affection , I long for solitude ! ( Embraces Green , and exit . ) Green . Experience Green I feel very uneasy about that foreigner . ( Enter Nathan Willett . ) Willett . Nathan Willett Good morning , cousin of mine . Have you been hatching a conspiracy against the ruling authorities of Italy with the exiled Count , plotting against the liberties of America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the Count on the stairs going on like the clown in a pantomime . He seemed very much tickled at something or other . Green . Experience Green I have just promised to lend him two hundred and fifty dollars . Willett . Nathan Willett Hum ! And have you the most remote expectation of being repaid any time before Doomsday ? Green . Experience Green I confess I have some vague suspicious that I shall never see them again . I lent the Count money before , and have been waiting his convenience some time . Willett . Nathan Willett Green , you 're a fortunate fellow in this matter . inasmuch as you need not be tormented by suspense . I 'll warrant he never disgorges one copper .  --  Proved ! Green . Experience Green By Jingo , vous avez raison  --  C'est un vol , sons doute  --  a thief , a leech . Willett . Nathan Willett Yes , a genuine Mediterranean sponge . You say he borrowed of you : how long ago ? Green . Experience Green About two months . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willett And you let him bleed you again to day ? Green . Experience Green Why-y-y  --  y-e-s  --  I must confess that I did . I thought perhaps he might pay the whole together . Willett . Nathan Willett Oh , Green , Green , Experience Green , I fear you will be like the woman in the German story , who threw one cheese down the hill , because another had rolled there before . But let me not forget the object of my call  --  where shall I find the best gloves in the city ? You 're good authority in these matters . Green . Experience Green There is but one place  --  Madam Elegant 's , the next corner but one below here , on the other side of the street ; and Willett , come and dine with me to-morrow at five , and if you see Barnwell , ask him to join us , will you ? I have already invited the Count . Willett . Nathan Willett I will . ( Exit . ) Green . Experience Green What a singular connection there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes ! However , spite of appearances , I ca n't believe the Count to be actually a humbug . No , c'est impossible  --  ca n't be  --  ca n't be . SCENE III .  --  MR . BRADLEY ALONE IN A BEDROOM . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley Confound it , I thought I should purchase a little peace , by consenting to this horrid affair of a ball ! I hoped I should have a little comfort , while Mrs. Bradley was superintending the arrangements . But , woe is me , I have been ten times more miserable then ever . Everything is topsy-turvy , head over heels  --  the whole house is in an uproar  --  no place left for me to smoke in , or read the newspaper . Here 's one lubberly fellow , as I am carefully navigating along the hall , amidst snags , rafts , and sawyers of all patterns , gives me a dig under the ribs with the corner of an infernal mirror , ( and no reflection on it I hope , ) and Mrs. Bradley , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about where I 'm not wanted . Another cursed careless rascal drops a huge ox chain from a chandelier on my head , and laughs at me to boot . Scarce have I recovered my good humor , when an infernally impudent French cook , with a greasy apron and a paper cap , coolly orders me to fetch him a basin of hot water . It is too bad ! As for my wife , she is a perfect ubiquitous persecuting hag ; and it 's Mr. Bradley here , and Mr. Bradley there , and Mr. Bradley do this , and Mr. Bradley do that ; and Mr. Bradley , you 're eternally in the way ; and Mr. Bradley , what are you prying about here for ?  --  and so she fumes , and frets , and fusses , and worries , and scolds , till I am almost mad .  --  Finally , I am banished to this room in the third story to audit accounts , and be tapped on occasion , like a pipe of Golden sherry . ( Enter Mrs. Bradley . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are , sitting idle , while all the rest of the household are working their lives out , and slaving like so many negroes . Bestir yourself , and do something . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley But what shall I do ? You interfere in everything I attempt . Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Do ? Why , is n't the house chock full of strange workmen of all descriptions ? Watch ' em ! Mr. B. Mr. Bradley Do you want to turn me into a house dog , Mrs. Bradley ? Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Truly , it 's all you 're fit for , Mr. Bradley . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley My dear , I 'll sue for a divorce  --  I ca n't stand this any longer  --  human nature  --  Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Pshaw , Mr. Bradley , preserve your equanimity , or regain it , and hear me  --  I came here for some money . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley A nice demand , to assist one in recovering his equanimity . Ay , money !  --  that 's all I 'm good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked at and picked at , and quarried , and bored , and blasted , till I yield up my ore , and then to be deserted without more ado ! Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley And why was the order of husbands instituted , but to pay the debts of their wives ? Mr. B. Mr. Bradley Mrs. Bradley , this is beyond human endurance ! Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Nay , my dear , Christian resignation is the peculiar virtue of husbands , and no one can tell how much he can bear , till he is tried . But why am I wasting time here , preaching to the heathen ? Give me some money . Mr. B. Mr. Bradley I wo n't give you one cent , Mrs. Bradley . You must relinquish your expensive habits  --  But I 'll be divorced  --  I 'll petition the Legislature  --  I 'll give you an allowance  --  a separate maintenance . Five hundred dollars a year . We shall see  --  we shall see  --  Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley Now Bradley , dear , compose yourself  --  I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my chandelier ! Mr. B. Mr. Bradley My money ! Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley I feared it  --  I told the stupid fools it was not secured strongly enough  --  shattered to atoms , I 'm sure , my new crystal chandelier ! ( Exit Mrs. Bradley . ) Mr. B. Mr. Bradley ( following ) . Mrs. Bradley , preserve your equanimity  --  coolness under all circumstances , my dear  --  be composed . ( Exit Mr. Bradley . ) Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley ( from within ) . So you 're coming , are you , to rejoice , as usual , over my misfortunes  --  to gloat over my distresses ! Mr. B. Mr. Bradley Nay , my dear , I assure you  --  Mrs. B. Mrs. Bradley None of your pretended commiseration  --  I see through it all  --  you ca n't deceive me . Mercy upon us  --  not a particle of it left unbroken  --  what a wreck ! SCENE IV .  --  PARLOR IN MRS . MATHEWS ' HOUSE . ( Mrs. Mathews and Martha discovered . ) Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dress . I had no idea your waist could by any machinery short of a steam engine , be compressed into so small a compass . Martha . Martha Mathews Yes , mother , it is indeed astonishing . I fancy when I get it on , I look exceedingly like an hour-glass . I hope to Heavens nobody will commit any laughable blunder , or I shall undoubtedly go off like a roasted chestnut or a grain of popped corn , though secured with extra hooks and eyes . Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews Hush , my child ; do n't fancy such disagreeable accidents . Martha . Martha Mathews I tell you , mother , I even breathe at the peril of my outer casing , and if any one were to pass a knife down my back , as gardeners relieve a plethoric fruit-tree by slitting its bark , he would perform a charitable action . But never mind , I waltz with the Count to-night . ( Enter Ned and Tom Mathews . ) Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews Why Ned , why Tom , you look big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico ? Anything more of the halls of Montezuma ? Ned . Ned Mathews No  --  we have other matters to speak of  --  Count Stromboli , for instance . Martha . Martha Mathews Goody gracious , what of him ? I hope I 'm not to lose my galop . Ned . Ned Mathews Tom and I have made a discovery  --  unraveled a mystery . Martha . Martha Mathews A mystery ?  --  a secret ?  --  I am all ears . I have quite a fancy for mysteries , denouements , and all these fashionable troubles . Is it an elopement , a wedding , or an engagement broken off ? Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews ( aside ) . Alas ! this is the plot they have been contriving ! I see  --  I see . Ned . Ned Mathews In a word , we have discovered that the man who calls himself Count Stromboli , is a rascally impostor . He lodges in a miserable disreputable lane , where he passes under the name of Jovanny Vaganty , as his landlord calls him , ( or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intimacy with very questionable characters . Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews ( aside ) . Pshaw ! could n't they invent a better story than that ? Martha . Martha Mathews I do n't believe one word of it . What ! the Count !  --  He who has eaten with queens , dukes , princesses , Jews , heathens , patriarchs , Turks , Pagans ;  --  who has dived in the Dead Sea , and dabbled in the Geysers ;  --  who has roasted his eggs on strands of lava ;  --  the exiled noble  --  the victim of tyranny  --  the proscribed of faction  --  the polar star of European liberty  --  he named Jovanny Vaganty ?  --  Brother , the idea is preposterous ! Ned . Ned Mathews Mother , what say you ? Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews I confess the Count is somewhat dissipated and wicked , but I believe you are imposing on us now . A likely story , indeed !  --  such an elegant gentleman as he is ! Every one knows he lives at the Tremont House . Ned . Ned Mathews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom , I suppose we must bring up our friend Dix to testify in this case . Mrs. M. Mrs. Mathews ( aside ) . Dix ?  --  Some accomplice , I fancy . Martha . Martha Mathews Brother , if you were to produce all the disreputable characters in Boston ( your worthy acquaintances ) to blast the Count 's character , I would n't listen to them : so say no more . Such is ever the fate of exalted rank  --  Ned . Ned Mathews Exalted fudge ! Martha . Martha Mathews Calumny  --  suspicion  --  ill-report  --  envy  --  always pursue  --  Ned .

Boys , you see we are incredulous : no more of your ridiculous stories . Come , Martha . ( Exeunt Mrs. M. and Martha . ) Ned . Ned Mathews " Ridiculous stories ! " Phew  --  what an unaccountable world !  --  Tom , we must work upon the Count . Tom . Tom Mathews Ay , ay , horsewhip him , or something . I 'm with you . Ned . Ned Mathews And Tom , we will say no more of our discovery till we learn further particulars . The Count 's hour has not yet come , it seems . Tom . Tom Mathews Agreed  --  we 'll be the guardians of his reputation ! Ned . Ned Mathews Yes , for the present ; we will abstract the treasure , however , as soon as we conveniently can , after the example of numerous other veritable keepers of the public funds ! To carry out the simile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V.  --  COUNT ALONE IN HIS ROOM . ( Proceeds to tie his cravat before a fragment of a looking-glass . ) Count . Count Stromboli My last clean shirt , by Heavens . This washing comes devilish expensive , I swear .  --  Santa Maria , what starch !  --  as stiff as Mother Soapsuds ' charges !  --  Well , I wo n't complain , as I make it a point not to pay her . It 's dangerous to encourage these poor devils  --  they invariably become impudent and familiar . It 's a bad precedent , and should never be resorted to , except in extreme cases . Nobody can accuse me of indulging in such weaknesses , that 's a comfort  --  my conscience is clear on that score at least  --  ( smooths his collar. )  --  She 's getting very unaccommodating , lately , is old Mother Soapsuds . Very unaccountable conduct ! I have been remarkably civil and familiar with her .  --  Aha ! do n't I manage ' em well ?  --  Politeness with the vulgar , brusquerie with the lite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I confess I am a little afraid , ) and bully my fashionable acquaintances . But Mother Soapsuds is becoming restive : by Jove , I 'll discharge her . I must induce her , though , to wash some linen for me first . Let 's see ; it 's now the tenth  --  how many shirts will carry me through the month ? Six will do it , I think .  --  Yes , yes , I 'm very expert in taking in a reef . ( Attempts to button his shirt sleeve . ) What ! no buttons ?  --  Well , I can ply the needle so as to remedy that . Where 's my pocket-book ?  --  ( Takes out needle , &c.,; and begins to sew . ) What a great advantage it is to travel . Now I learned , when steward on board Captain my Lord Fitzbug 's ship  --  ( I never condescended to serve any but the captain )  --  I learned the art of wearing dirty shirts .

A great plan at any rate  --  original  --  ought to immortalize the inventor  --  great genius in those midshipmen  --  benefactors of the human race . Then , my travels in Turkey ( confound that needle ! ) divested me of an absurd prejudice , very prevalent in Europe , and this country  --  I mean of wearing clean under-clothes . What the devil 's the use of clean drawers , and flannel waistcoats ? Why , then , wear shirts over ' em ? It is a ridiculous practice , and every bachelor ought to discountenance it . The Turks now understand economy better , and wear their clothes to rags without washing  --  it saves a good deal of money . I have adopted their system  --  it works admirably .

There , now , a touch of Patchouli , and I 'm prepared for conquest . ( Sprinkles perfume on his handkerchief and coat . ) Wonderful scent , Patchouli  --  potent  --  indispensable for a man that perspires much  --  ca n't do without it , if you waltz ; are we all ready , Jacques , Robert , and Count Stromboli ? Have we the impudence and cunning of the one , the dignity and hair of the other ?
