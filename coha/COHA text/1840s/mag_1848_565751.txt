txt THE energy displayed by Great Britain during the latter years of the war with Napoleon , the number of men furnished to recruit her army and navy , and the sums of money raised to support her colonial establishment , were such as to excite the astonishment and admiration of the civilized world . And the attentive reader of history , when he remembers the extent and natural advantages of the island of Great Britain , compared with the resources of the dominions of Buonaparte and his dependent allies , which in the year 1812 embraced almost the whole European continent , when he calls to mind the genius and military power of the French emperor , and when he considers the progress and issue of the contest , will experience similar emotions in a still higher degree . No where does the political economist find presented for his investigation , matter which demands more serious and careful study . XVhere in the annals of authentic history , is recorded a parallel to the fact that in the years 1813 , 1814 and 1815 , Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by loans and taxes five hundred and ten million pounds sterling , or $2,448 , OOO , OOO. * * Porter 's Parliamentary Tables , quoted in Blackwood 's Magazine . The pound sterling is estimated at $4.80 , which is its average vatue . During the same period the industrial interests of the nation , if we may be permitted to make use of a word whose convenience has within a few years given it currency , were in a state of great activity and prosperity . Indeed this fact alone can explain how such exertions and such expenditures were possible . The commerce of continental Europe having been annihilated , and that of the United States having been fettered by our foolish embargo , the ships of England sailed through every sea without a rival or competitor . Her manufacturers supplied the world with their fabrics , obtaining profits unreduced by the competition of foreigners ; for the " continental system " of Napoleon was hardly more successful in excluding them from Germany and Russia , than was the broom of the venerable lady commemorated by Sidney Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domicil . The supplies of food required by the government for the army and navy , added to the usual wants of the country , enabled the farmer to obtain high prices for every thing he had to sell . All classes therefore were able to pay taxes , which were imposed , in the memorable language of Sydney Smith , " upon every article which enters into the mouth , or covers the back , or is placed under the footupon every thing which it is pleasant // to see , hear , feel , smell or taste - on every thing on earth , and the waters under the earth-on every thing that comes from abroad , or is grown at home-on the ermine which decorates the judge , and the rope which hangs the criminal-on the poor man 's salt , and the rich man 's spice-on the brass nails of the coffin , and the ribands of the bride . " Since the year 1815 , the population of the United Kingdom has increased more than thirty per cent. ; but it does not appear that her resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer , it has been evident for some years that the great interests of the country were less healthy than heretofore , and that many things which to a superficial eye seemed like vigorous growth , were in truth the result of diseased action . To most men this statement would have seemed , a year since , almost paradoxical ; at the present time no one , we believe , would hesitate to admit its truth . In our last number we suggested to our readers some thoughts respecting the causes of the financial crisis of England . That article being limited both by time and space , was less thorough and minute in the examination than we *vished . We propose at the present time to consider somewhat in detail , the situation of Great Britain in several respects , and particularly in respect to the great interests of agriculture , of manufactures , and-what has recently begun to rival these in importance-of railways* and to compare her situation and prospects as to these particulars , with those of our own country . The national debt of Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exerts too great influence upon her prosperity , not to demand careful examination in an enquiry of this nature . Were it due wholly to her own citizens , it might be regarded as neither increasing nor diminishing the national wealth ; since if it were annihilated by a simple act of repudiation , the amount of tai*gible actual property in the country would be precisely the same as at present . But this view would be exceedingly imperf*ct and superficial . The debt amounts to eight hundred million pounds sterling , and the annual interest is more than half the national income . It is impossible to say how many persons receive from this source a sufficient revenue to maintain their families without their own exertions ; but it is not improbable that there are nearly half a million ; and these with the landed aristocracy , the l ) ensioners of government , the army and navy , and a multitude of smaller divisions , constitute the class of non-producers ; - of those who contribute nothing by their industry to the national wealth , and who are supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every country , but with us it is so small as hardly to produce any perceptible effect upon our social organization ; in Great Britain it is very numerous and powerful , controllin0 the legislation of the country , and affecting every department of its industry . To support this class in idleness and luxury , all other members of the community are taxed to the extreme limit of endurance . In a time of general prosperity their numbers and influence attract comparatively little attention ; but now , when the pressure of every burden seems au*rnented tenfold , the most ignorant and unreflecting laborer can hardly fail to realize that were there not so many who eat but do not work , his own labor would secure for him a more adequate 5u1 ) pOrt ; and the political economist will riot hesitate to say , that the national debt of England is among the most efficient of the causes which have embarrassed the industry and impaired the prosperity of the people . // It is stated in a recent number of ' Blackwood 's Magazine , that the yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland , as ascertained by official documents , is ninety million pounds sterling , or four hundred and thirty-two million dollars and this at twenty-five years purchase , which we believe to be the usual estimate , gives the absolute value , ? * , 250,000,000 , or $10,800,000,000 . This vast amount , so far as it consists of land for cultivation , is almost without exception leased by the owner to the cultivator ; the exceptions , where the occupant is the owner of the land , being hardly more numerous , or more important in a general estimate , than are cases of an opposite character in our own country . We can not , perhaps , better present our vie'vs respecting the condition and prospects of the agricultural interests of Great Britain , than by contrasting them with those of the youngest member in our confederacy of states-Wisconsin . The island of Great Britain contains about eighty-five thousand s*uare miles , or almost fifty-five million acres XViseonsin is fout -- fifths as large . The soil of Wisconsin is naturally more fertile , and a larger portion of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in England and Scotland . These are the only particulars in which these countries can be compared in every other we shall contrast them . There are in England and Wales more than three hundi-ed inhabitants to the squat-e mile ; in Scotland , about ninety ; in vVisconsin , three . In the former countries every acre which promises a tolerable reward to industry , is cultivated with a degree of skill and care of which few of us form a conception ; in the latter , the traveler often passes ten or twenty miles , through prairies of unsurpassed fertility , without meeting an inhabitant , while the imperfect and careless manner in which the land is tilled , would excite extreme astonishment in an English farmer . In Engla nd , the average value of an acre of land may , we are informed , be roughly estimated at fifty pounds , or nearly two hundred and fifty dollars ; in Wisconsin , our President will sell for the same price two hundred acres . From this comparison we infer , and we believe that our readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the policy of the British government with respect to the admission of bread stuffs from foreign countries should be modified , the value of their land is destined to a steady and permanent decline . Previous to the recent change in the English corn laws , the " sliding scale " prevented the importation of wheat from abroad , except in times of scarcity and extreme high prices , and the price in the London market was rarely so low as a dollar and a half , and usually exceeded two dollars a bushel . The farmer in Wisconsin will be highly prosperous if he can sell his wheat at sixty cents a bushel , which is about equal to two dollars and fifty cents for a barrel of flour , and at times it can l ) e transported from Mil*vaukie to Liverpool for an equal amount . The British duty , after March 5 , 1849 , is , we believe , to be less than twelve cents a barrel for flour . How can the English farmer buy or hire land valued at two or three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor rates , which press so heavily upon the national industry , and compete successfully with his American rival . Nor can he cherish the hope that in equalization of prices , the value of land in Wisconsin will rise so as to meet him half way . Should this take place , he must sustain the competition of Nebraska , Minesota , and other districts stretching into the far west , which will in a few years become populous states . // We have in our own country an illustration of the manner in which the causes we have suggested operate . Soon after the completion of the Erie Canal , lands in Western New York began to increase in price , and rose steadily in value until they were sold in many cases at from sixty to one hundred dollars an acre . But as soon as Ohio and Michigan began to produce wheat in quantities greatly exceeding their own consumption , and were able to deliver in Buffalo several millions of bushels annually , the value of these lands began to decline . A year or two since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lands which some years before had been mortgaged for two-thirds or three-fourths of their value , would not at that time sell for the amount of the mortgage . The same thing is strikingly evinced by the fact , that the aggregate population of twenty-four counties in the State of New York , comprising some of the most fertile in the central and western parts of the state , was less in 1845 than in 1840 . Though it may appear to our readers a new and unwarranted view of the subject , it seems to us not impossible that an approxirnation may take place in the value of labor in the two countries , which would tend to the same result . It is universally known that in England there has for many years been so great a surplus of labor , that its wages barely sufficed to support life . In this country , and particularly in the new states , wages have , from the opposite reason , been high ; so high , that few of us can realize , what is nevertheless true , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of a century , when in the vicinity of New York , able-bodied men , in large numbers , have applied for work , asking no compensation except their food . If the emigration from Europe to this country should increase in the same ratio as for three years past , we shall during the next ten years receive in this manner an average accession to our population of more than half a million annually , most of whom will be young and middleaged . Whether so many of these will come from GreXtt Britain as in time to increase the rate of xvages by diminishing the comparative number of laborers , and whether so large an accession to our population will not lessen the prices of labor by occasioning an over supply , it is not safe to predict , but it certainly is by no means impossible . We do not wish to be understood as expressing an opinion that the change in the policy of Great Britain respecting her corn laws , was unwise . On that point we shall not enter , as we have neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . We shall only quote the view suggested to us by a very intelligent Englishman , when we stated to him some of the evils that might result from her present course . He told us that the English government were obliged to sacrifice in part the interests either of the farmer or of the manufacturer , and decided to protect the latter rather than the former . From the agriculture we will turn our attention to the manufactures of Great Britain . Previous to the peace which terminated the long and desolating wars with Napoleon , Great Britain was almost the only manufacturing nation in the civilized world . Our own manufactures were in their infancy , hardly extending beyond the coarsest fabrics , and the most common implements of agriculture . France and Germany produced some articles of prime necessity for the supply of their own wants , but with little skill and success ; and notwithstanding the continental system of Napoleon , the wants of those countries were principally supplied by British artisans . Immediately after // the close of ' the war , immense quantities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continent , while the British corn laws prevented the agricultural prod ucts of ' those countries from being received in payment . The consequent drain upon their resources was such , that the governments of France and Germany soon perceived that , unless some remedy were applied , their subjects would be reduced to ruin . They , therefore , by the imposition of heavy duties , discouraged the importation of many kinds of foreign goods , and thus promoted their manufacture at home . And as man ufactories of cotton and woolen goods , and hardware , were established , and flourished , the rate of duty on foreign goods was increased , and the importation of many descriptions virtually prohibited . In our own country the same result has been attained . The tariff of 1816 can be hardly said to have been framed for the protection of American manufactures , for these were then so insignificant in extent that they were scarcely deemed worthy of protection by our government . It is true that they had excited the jealousy of our English rivals , as is evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of our statesmen , among whom Henry Clay was preeminent , had even before this period deemed the establishment of a large manufactu ring interest essential to the full development of the resources of the country . But the attention of our citizens , and especially of those of New England , being directed to manufactures by the tariff of 1816 , the success of their efforts led to the imposition of higher duties in 1824 and 1828 : and though the policy of our country has since been fluctuating , our manufacturers have acquired such skill and capital , that in many branches they are independent of tariffs and the protection of government . To illus trate the rapidity and extent of the change , we would mention that fifteen years since about nine-tenths of the hardware goods sold in this country were imported , while we believe that at the present time about two-thirds are made at home . Owing to the gradual growth of the manufacturing interests of the continent and the United States , Great Britain has been deprived of the most wealthy and valuable customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe competition with respect to others , that her profits have been very seriously reduced . Nor has the evil stopped here . The German and Amei'ican manufacturer has not only supplied his fellow-citizens with the goods which they had been accustomed to import from England , but he has extended his operations , and carried his hardware and coarse cottons to Brazil , to the Levant , and to China . It is owing to this cause , in connection with some others , that the amount of cotton goods sent from England to the East Indies has so seriously diminished within the last three years . There are so many causes that affect differently the various branches of the manufacturing interest of Great Britain , and modify their pros . perity , that we can not present at a single view a correct description of their present condition . The manufacture of pig and bar iron has been for several years past extremely profitable , owing to the immense demand for the construction of railroads ; but at the present time , in consequence of many of those roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production . It was recently stated in the House of Commons , by Lord George Bentinck , that " cotton manufactured goods were exported cheaper than the raw material from which they were formed could be imported into the country . " Those who are acquainted with the prices at which // such goods have recently been sold in this country , will readily believe that the assertion is correct . It is very evident that manufacturers have experienced their full share of the disasters which have recently affected all classes in Great Britain . Many of them have become insolvent , and a much larger number have probably been brought to the verge of ruin . It is generally understood that the manufacturing establishments in this country have for the last five years been in a situation of great prosperity , and that the accumulation of wealth , resulting principally from this cause , has been larger than in any previous period in our national history . At the present time , owing to foreign competition , to the embarrassment of our national finances , resulting from the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several brunches of industry are embarrassed , and all are depressed ; we can not but hope that the depression will be temporary , and that the causes which have produced it will in a short time cease to operate . With respect to the future , we think that some of the causes which have depressed the manufacturers of Great Britain must continue for a long time to produce similar results . In competing with the manufacturers of Germany , they encounter labor at even lower prices than their own , with skill and cot-nmand of machinery which have for many years been steadily increasing , and with abundant capital at low prices . Nor is there any prospect that the governments of Europe or this country will cease to impose so high duties as very seriously to discourage the importation of foreign goods . And we think that the manufacturers of the United States will find in the superior intelligence and energy of the operattves , tn their ingenuity and skill in the invention of machinery , in their abundant and cheap water power , united to their large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference in the price of labor , and to enable them to compete successfully with their English rivals . The employment of associated capital in large amounts , and under such regulations that it is not exposed to many of the contingencies and embarrassments which attend individual enterprise , is , so far as we are aware , peculiar to this country , and at the present time is almost exclusively confined to New England . The manufactories of Lowell , employing nearly twelve millions of capital , are conducted in this manner , and are a favorable illustration of its advantages . It would be foreign from our purpose to discuss the merits of this system . it is sufficient to remark , that not being disturbed by the death or *vithdra*val of a partner , and usually cornmencing with funds more adequate to the business than can be furnished by individuals , such companies have commonly proved permanent and successful . The manufacturing systems of the two nations should be compared , not only with regard to their effects upon the national wealth , but likewise upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one which can not fail to awaken in an intelligent American , feelings of the highest satisfaction . The concurrent testimony of all writers on the subject , assures us , that the great mass of English operattves are profoundly ignorant , not only of the elements of education , and the first principles of religion , but of almost every thing else not immediately connected with their individual employments . Entering the manufactory at a very early age , and spending their whole lives in an employment which is varied only to suit their strength // and size , exhausted by working in a confined and unhealthy atmosphere to a degree often beyond their strength , with wages insufficient to procure sufficient food and comfortable clothes and dwellings , how can it be expected that the operatives of Manchester and Leeds should have the opportunity or wish to acquire knowledge . As to their moral character , we will mention a fact communicated to us by a highly respectable and intelligent manufacturer of Sheffield . He stated that the house with which he was connected employed five hundred workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as they required , if they worked steadily ; but that so much time was lost in consequence of prevailing habits of intemperance , that they were obliged to retain the number we have mentioned in their employ . That a very large proportion of the females emplayed in the cotton mills of Manchester arc licentious , is universally reported . Of course these remarks apply more to some branches of manufuctures than to others , and are true in the highest degree where the population is mostconcentrated . Werefer any of our readers who wish a more extended view of this subject , and who are willing to read details of oppression and suffering , to " Helen Fleetwood , " by the late Charlotte Elizabeth ; in which work that distinguished writer gives a vivid account of life in a manufacturing town ; also to the Rev. John Mitchell 's " Notes from Over Sea . " * The precarious tenure of employ- * That a very large proportion of the laboring classes are ignorant , immoral , and debased , with their physical wants very imperfectly supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly neglected , is so abundantly obvious , that we hardly need reflw to Parliamentary reports or to books of travels , for every British review and magazine asserts the fact in the most unqualified manner , and each of them proposes a different remedy . ment has a disastrous effect at times upon the character and condition of the operatives . It was recently stated by the police of Manchester , that of the whole number itt that city about one-fourth were wholly unemployed , one-fourth were working short time , and less than half were etnployed full time . As full employment will earn a meagre and itisufficient subsistence , it is evident that a large proportion of the workmen in that town were partially or wholly dependertt on the poor fund for support , and were greatly exposed to suffering and to crime . The system of " trades unions , " and " strikes , " to which we shall barely allude , exerts a most unfavorable influence upon the operatives , and is at times highly injurious to the national prosperity . Nor are the arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as requiring seven years apprenticeship before they are allowed to work at a particular trade , the prohibition of removtng from one place to another except on certain conditions , and many others which might be mentioned , less perniciotis . As most of our readers are acquainted with our own manufacturtug establishments , it is not necessary to compare them in detail with their English rivals , as to the particulars we have enumerated . In almost every respect there is a complete contrast . Our workmen are , as a body , well paid , well fed , industrious , healthy , and prosperous ; and are of course respectable and valuable members of the community . With respect to intelligertee , morality and religion , our manufactttring towns will compare favorably with the average of our population . To illustrate this by a single example , we would mention , that in Lowell no female is allowed to work in the manufactories who does not sustain a good moral character , that those employed in that town have in the aggregate about a million dol // Jars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are members of Christian churches than probably of the whole population of Massachusetts , and that most of them , after remaining there long enough to earn a fitting out ' for themselves , or to assist in supporting their parents , or educating their brothers , return home and become the wives of farmers . We do not hesitate to express the conviction that the manufacturing system of New England , and indeed of the whole Union , has been of decided benefit , not only in augmenting greatly the national wealth , but in elevating the tone of morals and religion . If our readers regard the views we have expressed as founded on truth , they will concur with us in the opinion that the radical defect in the social system of England is the depressed and degraded condition of the laboring classes of the community . In refinement of manners , in the cultivation of the intellect , in all the amenities which render home dear , and diffuse a charm over social intercourse , the middle and upper ranks of Great Britain are certainly unsurpassed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these classes from the agricultural and manufacturing operatives , is deep and wide . It has long appeared to us that the legislators of Great Britain fail to recognize the obligation resting on them to adopt such measures as would lead to the intellectual and moral elevation of the poor ; and that unless an entire change takes place in this respect , the days of her preeminent power and greatness are numbered . It is foreign from our present purpose to state in detail what measures we think they ought to adopt . That the church establishment should be so modified that dissenters should not be required to contribute to its support , and that a large part of its wealth should be applied to the service of the state ; that the system of taxation should be changed , so that the wealthier classes , and especially the nobility , should contribute far more to the support of government than they now do ; that the game laws should be abolished ; that official salaries and pensions should be very much reduced ; that many old and venerable abuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we can not entertain a doubt . We have already intimated that we regard with distrust the recent changes in the commercial policy of England , and still more those which appear to be contemplated . It is always unsafe to make radical and important changes in the policy of a nation , in times of general embarrassment and distress . Relief is so much wanted , that sufficient regard will not be given to the ultimate results of the measures by which it is sought . The producers of food , the colonies , and the shipping interest , have long been protected against the competition of foreigners . From two of these interests this protection has been suddenly and almost entirely withdrawn ; and the most recent intelligence gives us reason to believe that the ship owner will soon experience the same fate . We have already stated what we believe will be the result of the competition between the English farmer and his foreign rivals . From the East and West Indies we receive the most gloomy accounts of commercial embarrassment and depressed prices , and forebodings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern frontier , having their timber depreciated in value by the rivalry of the Baltic , and their provisions undersold by ourselves , are beginning to " calculate the value of the union , " and to inquire whether they would not be more prosperous and happy , if separated from the mother country , and left to their own // unassisted but unfettered energies . And if the navigation laws of England , that memorial of the statesmanship of Oliver Cromwell , are repealed , and the ships of Norway , of hamburg , and of the United States , are admitted to free competition with her own , we shall not be surprised to find that erelong the wooden walls of old England will begin to show signs of decay . And unless changes take place in the relative condition of Great Britain and our own land , which can not be now anticipated , we think it probable that while we increase in wealth and power with a rapidity hardly ever equaled in the history of nations , our mother country , if she does not like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least remain stationary . If we examine the railroads of England and compare them with our own , we shall arrive at results very similar to those which we have ascertained respecting the agriculture of the two nations . In this as in the former case , every thing in Great Britain is done in a manner very thorough and very expensive , in a manner appropriate to the situation of a nation of abundant resources and circumscribed territory . In our own country on the other hand , railroads are built at comparatively moderate cost , the engineer being commonly more desirous of accomplishing the work at the minimum expense , than of attaining the maximum power and speed , remembering that our wealth is limited , while almost the whole boundless continent is ours. * The first railroad in Great Britain was opened for the use of the public , only about twenty years ago , but they have been regarded with so much favor by the community , that last year there were in operation three thousand five hundred miles of railways , which had been constructed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOL VI . 37 dollars . And during the year 1847 , notwithstanding the unparalleled financial embarrassments , the calls ' for money to pay for roads in the process of construction amounted to about one hundred and ninety million dollars , in addition to more than thirty millions , furnished by British capital and expended in foreign countries . It will be seen from the above statement that the railroads already completed in Great Britain , have cost on an average more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a mile . *Ph immense amount has been expended in preliminary outlays , which in some cases , in consequence of the difficulty of procuring charters , owing to the vicious system of legislation , have amounted to half a million dollars ; - in the purchase of the necessary lands at enormous prices ; - in preparing the road bed , which is made with grades and curves more favorable , and of course more expensive , than are required in this country ; - in laying the superstructure , which is in all cases a double track , of very heavy iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in locomotives and cars for the equipment of the road ; and in incidental expenses , an item covering salaries and interest , together with many other things of which we have little knowledge from our own experience . To give a similar view of the railroads in the United States , we would remark that there are now in operation more than five thousand miles of railways , and that these have cost about a hundred and fifty million dollars , or about thirty thousand dollars per mile . A large majority of those built previous to 1846 , were built with flat rail and very imperfectly constructed ; but we are not aware that any road is now in the process of construction which has not a heavy rail , and is not built with suitable regard to safety and durability , while on many of the old roads the light rail has been or // will soon be replaced with heavy iron . With respect to the productiveness of railroads in the two countries , it is exceedingly difficult to present adequate and satisfactory statements . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in payment of debts or in extending and improving their roads , and there are many in distant parts of the Union , respecting which it is difficult to procure the necessary information . There are in this country and probably in Great Britain many ioads constructed several years since , which in consequence of the business being imperfectly understood , of bad management , of the high prices of materials and labor , or of other causes , have cost far more than would now he required to build them or than they are worth . The 1-lousatonic railroad for instance , and the road from New Haven to Hartford , could now be built for one half the sum they have actually cost . We doubt whether there are two roads in New England which have not during the last year earned seven per cent . on what it would now cost to build them ; and we believe that their aggregate income would give a dividend of ten per cent . on their cost if estimated in the same manner . Tha roads in Massachusetts have during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to eight per cent . on their cost . Of the roads out of New England a few have been very pro . ductive ; some of them , the Michigan Central road being one , have been probably more so than any of the New England roads . Many of the roads at the south and west , for some of the reasons which we have stated above , have yielded no income to their owners . It is stated that the aggregate income of the roads in Great britain , during the l ) ast year , was a little over four per cent . upon their cost . It should , however , be remembered that the year 1847 was in this country a 1 ) eriod of extraordinary prosperity , but in Great Britain , of unusual disaster , and that from this cause our roads have been more prosperous and theirs less so than ustial . If the views we have expressed respecting the prospects of the manufacturing and agricultural interests of the two nations are correct , it will he readily inferred that money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be received from British investments . Their railroads are built at very great expense , through an extremely populous and highly cultivated country , abounding with manufacturing establishments ; while many of ours pass through regions in which hardly one-tenth the resources for manufactures and agriculture are developed . Especially is this the case with some of the roads in the southern and western states . Of course , railroads will share in the prosperity of the countries through which they pass . Nor do we entertain a doubt , that the railroad mania which has prevailed in England for some time has led to the construction of many works which will be almost entirely unproductive , and that the amount expended upon them will have been so great as very seriously to diminish the average income of the whole system . And we are fully convinced that railroads judiciously constructed and well built , will be increasingly valuable , and that investn ) ents in them **ill be , on the whole , safer , than in most other descriptions of property , as they are less liable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arid less exposed to the fluctuations of business than manufactures or agriculture . It is evident that every railroad judiciously located is beneficial to the community , provided two conditions are observed ; that it shall not cost more than it is worth , and that it shall not withdraw money // from the ordinary pursuits of business which can not be spared without injury . But very many railroads have been built , both in this country and in Great Britain , in which one or both of those conditions have been violated . Disregard of the latter is universally regarded as one of the principal causes of the financial convulsions in England ; and our own expenditures , though comparatively very small , have combined with other causes in producing much embarrassment in the commercial business of this country . We hope that this embarrassment may have a favorable effect in checking what is in danger of becoming amo rig ourselves a railway mania , to illustrate and prove which danger we will state only two facts ; that railroads are now being built in the state of Vermont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more than sixty applications for railroad charters have been made to the legislature of Massachusetts at its present session . We ought , also , to remember that in Great Britain , no money is sent out of the country when a railroad is built , that the material and labor are wholly British , while in our own case , we often purchase English iron with American gold . But we shall take a very superficial view of the comparative benefits of railways to the two countries , if we do not consider the relative size , and previous advantages of the two nations . In England , owing to the excellent public roads , and to canals , every part of the coi.rntry was accessible at a moderate expense of time and money . The railway was therefore a convenience , not an article of prime necessity . In our own land , notwithstanding our rivers , canals and lakes , there are vast regions from which the expense of transporting produce to market greatly exceeds the cost of producing it , and where the traxTeler during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of two to four miles an hour. * We will refer , to show some of the benefits of railroads to a thinly settled country , to the Michigan Central road . Phis road is about two hundred miles long , extending from Detroit directly across the state . Before it was built , it was necessary for the farmer residing fifty or a hundred miles from that city , to carry his wheat or flour by wagons over very bad roads ; and as the soil of the central parts of the state , though productive , was riot exuberantly fertile like a great part of Illinois and Wisconsin , the tide of emigration seemed likely to be diverted from the state . By building the road , a belt of land a hundred and sixty miles long and forty broad , is brought within twenty miles of a market , and we do not consider it an extravagant estimate , to assume that this tract , embracing more than four million acres of land , will within ten years be worth on an average , two dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed . Similar calculations might be presented , respecting roads which are chartered or proposed , and which will traverse the immense prairies of the northwestern states or the cotton fields of the south . Whether the project for a road to the Pacific should be regarded as an object of serious consideration for the present generation , we will not say : we would remark , however , that it might have been built for a smaller amount than the Mexican war has cost . Regarding England as the home of Cromwell , and Shakspeare , and Milton , as the birth-place of our pilgrim fathers , as the bulwark for many generations of our holy Protestant religion , as the pioneer in the great work of subduing this re * In October tast , die wriler of this artide , passed fifteen hours in going forty mites in the nait stage , on the most important pubtic road in Iltinois. // volted world to the obedience of Christ ; we can not but contemplate her future prospects with deep and anxious interest .
