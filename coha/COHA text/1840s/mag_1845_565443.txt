txt " To this complexion must we come at last . " how irresistible is the tendency by which all ecclesiastical institutions and arrangements in this Congregational and dissenting ' country , are carried towards the euthanasia of democracy . Behold a bishop in undisputed succession from the Apostles , canonically accused and presented for trial by brother bishops-canonically tried by a court , including all the bishops of the Anglo-American Catholic church in conclave assembledcanonically found guilty , and formally sentenced . And what next ? All parties-as if perfectly conscious that the proceedings up to this point , are merely preliminary to the inquiry and decision upon which all * The Proceedings of the Court convened under the third canon of 1844 in the city of New York , on Tuesday , December 10 , 1844 , for the trial of the Right Rev.

Bishop Onderdonk himself , and his friends from Laicus. to the editor of the Evening Mirror , are agreed with the court of bishops , in appearing to plead before the tribunal against whose decision no sentence of any inferior court can have any validity . Mr. Trapier , Mr. Richmond , Bishop Meade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with the respondent and his friends , in getting the whole case intelligibly and exactly before the public . Here all are right . The proceeding is not only democratic , but at the same time truly catholic . " Tell it to church , " is a rule older and of b * ter authority than the decretals of Isidore , ' or the canons of the Apostles . ' What the decision of the public will be on this case , we have no doubt . We introduce the subject here , not because we suppose that it is particularly incumbent on us to pronounce that decision ; nor with the idep. that the decision of the tri // bunal to which the appeal has been made , will be affected materially by what we may say ; but only , as it were , to east in our ballot on the *uestioa of the respondent 's guilt , and then to " improve the occasion , " as preachers sometimes say , by expounding some of the lessons which it affords , whether for instruction or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respondent guilty of the matters affirmed against him by the court of bishops ? we answer , Tie is guilty . No other answer can be given , as the case now stands , without virtually renouncing all dependence upon human testimony . The whole matter , disconnected from the false issues raised by the ingenuity of professional advocates long exercised in the trade of defending criminals , lies in the narrowest compass . The testimony of the ladies , on whose testimony Bishop Onderdonk was condemned by his brethren , is a phenomenon which can be accounted for , only on one of three suppositions. ( 1 . ) It must be supposed that the witnesses committed downright perjury ; or ( 2 . ) It must be supposed that they were mistaken as to the facts which they asserted ; or ( 3 . ) Those facts are true . Which of these three explanations is the right pne ? ( 1 . ) Is it to be taken for granted , without one particle of evidence to that effect , that the four ladies , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing , who gave their testimony before that court of bishops , in the most embarrassing circumstances , and under the most rigid cross examination , so clearly and positively , - perjured themselves ? Did they declare under oath what they knew to be false ? We leave out of view the confirmation which the testimony of the two married ladies may be supposed to receive from the testimony of their husbands , and the confirmation which the testimony of one of them may be supposed to re ceive from the acknowledgment which Bishop Onderdonk himself made to her husband , in the presence of witnesses . Let all that go for nothing . Let the testimony of the four ladies stand alone , unsupported except as they support each other . The man who deliberately insists upon solving the difficulties of this case , and making Bishop Onderdonk an innocent and injured man , by taking it for granted that these four ladies , two of them the wives of Episcopalian clergymen , and the other two devoted members of the Episcopal church , have committed deliberate perjury against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of mankind as either a knave or a fool . No ; till perjury is proved upon these witnesses , no solution of the ease is admissible for a momentno defense of Bishop Onderdonk is less than impudent , which does not proceed upon the assumption that the testimony of these ladies represents their actual belief . ( 2 . ) Is it then to be taken for granted , without evidence , that these ladies were mistaken in their belief of the facts to which they testified ? Mistaken ! Is there any room for mistake in such a matter ? Is it possible for a lady to be mistaken in the belief that a man sitting at her side in a carriage or on a sofa , thrust his hand into her bosom , or committed some similar indecorum ? If it is possible that such a thing may have happened once since the foundation of the world , is it possible that four ladies , in the same diocese , have made the same mistake in regard to the same man , and that man the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He that can believe this , may believe in Jo Smith 's golden plates , or Peters ' History of Connecticut . Yet this is what the bishops , who voted to acquit their brother Onderdonk , professed to believe . ( 3 . ) There remains no possible supposition for the explanation of // the testimony , but the supposition that the things testified are true . The only mode of setting aside this conclusion , is boldly to assert that the perjury of the witnesses , or some hallucination by which their senses were deceived , is less incredible than the truth of their testimony . Accordingly , the great argument against the testimony in this case , is the a priori argument , based like flume 's argument against the Christian Scriptures , on the intrinsic incredibility of the things testified . This argument is twofold . First , we have an a priori argument from the editor of the Evening Mirror , whose journal may be regarded as representing the highest Trinity church bon ton , and whose opinion on some questions is as authoritative as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . It is impossible that any man in his senses should be guilty of such an assault upon the modesty of a truly virtuous woman ; therefore , we can not believe the testimony of these witnesses without believing that there is no virtue in them . ' Any man in his senses ! But who ' says that Bishop Onderdonk was in his senses ? Nay , is it not expressly charged upon him that , in one of the instances , he was just enough out of his senses to make all that he did perfectly natural ? What if it be supposed that for these fifteen years or more , the Bishop has been habitually so far under the excitement of wine , that a glass or two more than ordinary was enough to overcome his discretion in one particular , and to bring out the coarse sensuality of his nature ? How much can the argument drawn from what a man in his senses would be likely to do , prove in the case of a man of whom it is not known that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument as presented by the editor of the Churchman , who , in his particular line of learning , is about as much of an authority as the editor of the Evening Mirror is in his . This argument stated in plain terms is , that it is impossible for a bishop , a man who has been consecrated to the highest order of the hierarchy , a man who has received the Holy Ghost in a direct line of succession from the Apostles , to be guilty of any thing which he chooses to deny . The solemn declaration of a bishop whose succession is clear , is to outweigh the testimony of all the women in the diocese . The misfortune of this argument is , that it presupposes on the part of those who are to be influenced by it , a belief not only in apostolic succession , but in all the kindred fatuities held in connection with it by the disciples of the Oxford school ; while the question of the respondent 's guilt is to be decided , not by the votes of men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by nature , and whe professing themselves wise have become fools , such as spontaneous nature never produces ,  --  but by the common sense of Christendom , and first and chiefly by the common sense of the Christian people in these United States . We dare say there are other bishops beside this respondent , who would like right well to see such a doctrine recognized as law at the tribunal of public opinion ; ' but it so happens that they can not be accommodated . At the bar of public opinion , ' bishops have no special benefit of clergy . ' There the testimony that would condemn a priest or a deacon-nay , that which would condemn a mere Calvinistic pastor , or a Wesleyan itinerant , will suffice for the condemnation of the proudest prelate . Unfortunately for those who would assert this doctrine , and for those who need the protection it might afford them , the middle ages have gone by , at least so far as those nations are concerned , that speak our native English language . We have thus given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 287 of bishops and the respondent , simply because , the appeal having been made to the public , and the question being important , we regard it as a duty not to withhold our vote . Having thus discharged our duty on this point , we proceed to some of the other topics which the history of this trial brings up for consideration . First then , is Bishop Onderdonk a martyr to his principles as the head of the ultra Puseyite party in the American Episcopal communion . He and his friends claim for him this honor . We agree with them in part . Probably he would never have been condemned for his irregularities of life and manners , if he had not become so extensively odious on account of his principles . Let him be canonized as the first martyr to Puseyism . Or , if upon consideration , it shall appear that what he has suffered is not quite sufficient to bring his case within the Catholic definition of martyrdom , let the anniversary of that ride from Ithaca to Syracuse , ( 1 June , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 17 July , ) stand in red letters as sacred to the devout remembrance of " St. Benjamin of New-York , bishop and confessor . " There are worse names than that , we dare say , in the calendar . But how does it appear that the Bishop 's principles , andhis conduct in support of his pri ples , have any connection with his present affliction ? We answer , the Rev. Mr. Trapier has told in his pamphlet , an exceedingly plain and honest story , highly creditable to himself and to all the individuals concerned in the prosecution ; and from that pamphlet alone it appears to us , that though one and another of these indecencies on the part of Bishop 0 . had long been talked about with grief and shame among a 4ry few individuals , the hope of getting him convicted and condemned on account of them would not have been entertamed-the attempt to bring him to trial would not have been made , if he had not become extensively obnoxious in all parts of the country , on another account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point they can weaken the evidence of his guilt . How vain a hope ! All the dust they have raised upon this irrelevant issue , only shows the desperateness of their cause . We have referred to Mr. Trapier ' s pamphlet for proof , that Bishop Onderdonk 's presentment for trial , is to be ascribed in part to his position as the leader of a party . But even that reference is hardly necessary . The leading facts in the case , as known to every body , make this point clear enough . Who is Bishop Onderdonk ? What has been his history ? What is the known and undisputed history of this presentment and trial ? The Rev. Benjamin T. Onderdonk , one of the ministers of Trinity church in New-York , was elected in the year l830 , to the Episcopal chair , in the diocese of New-York , then vacant by the decease of Bishop Hobart . He has gone along with little trouble , in the performance of his functions , till a very recent period . We have had no personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . Ve have known him only by his public deeds , and by the common fame that has reported him to us , from time to time , as a good natured , jovial , easy Dutchman  --  a settled enemy of Calvinism , Puritanism , and the Temperance reformation  --  a decided favorite with the Trinity church aristocracy , as a living embodiment of that religion in quality and quantity , which is most acceptable to that sort of people-not particularly eminent for " ruling his own house well , and having his children in subjection with all gravity " - following the precept of Paul and the supposed example of the first bishop of Ephe. // 288 The Martyrdom of Bishop Onderdonk. sus , in eschewing the excessive use of water as a beverage , and taking a little wine , ' or what seemed to him a little , for his stomach 's sake ' - never failing to offer hot whiskey punch and such potations to his visitors on New Year 's day , with a true Knickerbocker zeal for the good old ways  --  but withal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much more than Roman Catholic austerity , as to make that an excuse for not joining with Bishop Hughes and the Irish in their annual jollification on St. Patrick 's day . That there was any dissatisfaction with him in his diocese , save perhaps on the part of a few individuals here and there , whose churchmanship was of a dubious quality-that he was regarded by any considerable party in the diocese , as deficient in respect to purity of morals or sanctity of manners , was never reported within the scope of our observation . In an evil hour for the fortunes of the Bishop , and for the repose ' of the diocese , he came under the influence of Dr. Samuel Seabury , the editor of the Churchman , and grandson of that Seabury , who in the infancy of the Anglo-American church was wont to subscribe himself , like a baron bishop of the old world , " Samuel Connecticut and Rhode Island . " Whether the ascendency of Dr. Seabury was occasioned , as some have said , by his having been called upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishop , ( a proceeding fully warranted by unrebuked precedent in the Anglican church , ) or whether it originated simply in the natural influence of an active and restless mind over a mind habitually indolent and inefficient , like the influence of the sub-prior Eustace over the abbot Boniface , or whether it was the result of both these influences cornbined ,  --  is not for us to determine . But whatever was the cause of Dr. Seabury 's ascendency , the conse consequences were unhappy for Bishop Onderdonk . Under the guidance of his fidus Achates , the Bishop , not satisfied with the position which he had always held as one of the old Arminian high church party  --  a position which , as Bishop Hobart 's immediate successor , he might have held unmolested till his death-fell in with the new extravagances and fooleries set forth at Oxford , and made himself a far more conspicuous and important personage than he would ever have become in any other way . He became , under Dr. Seabury 's tutelage , what his own talents and his own activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent individual in the movement to " unprotestantize " the Protestant Episcopal church . The unexpected energy with which he acted in respect to the ordination of Carey , together with the insolence of some subsequent proceedings of his , in the convention of his diocese in 1843 , fixed upon him the close attention of the entire Episcopal church from Maine to Florida ; and it became necessary for him as the acknowledged leader of a great ecclesiastical and religious movement , to have such a character as would bear a pretty rigid scrutiny . The question was naturally asked , What sort of a man is this Bishop of New York ? What sort of a man is this ordainer of men who agree with the council of'I*r*nt for substance ? What sort of a man is this bishop against whose official acts such ministers as Drs . Smith and Anthon , are constrained to make a formal protest in the presence of a worshiping assembly , and to the interruption of a solemn religious service ? What sort of a man is this dignitary who claims a divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly , without appeal ? When thousam*s of minds , in various places , and in all sorts of positions , are wide awake upon the same inquiry , some of them will strike upon something // that leads to a discovery . Thus it began to be understood among devout Episcopalians in distant parts of the country , that the great leader of the Catholicity movement in their church was somewhat defective in respect to personal sanctity . One instance of misconduct , and another , began to be spoken of . Individuals who had long carried in. their bosoms the painful knowledge of facts , which they could not reveal but under the certainty of being disgraced as calumniators of a bishop , began to find that other individuals were the depositaries of similar secrets . Thus the facts which form the basis of the recent proceedings , began to be developed , and the testimony by which those facts are proved , began to be accessible . None of those facts is of a later date than the memorable Carey ordination . All of them , buried before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light by the blaze of excitement and inquiry which that event occasioned throughout the Episcopal church . To us then it appears palpable , without any other evidence than that which is afforded by the first aspect of the proceedings , that if Dr. Seabury had not inoculated his bishop with his own rabid zeal for unprotestantizing the church and restoring the forms and principles of Medieval Christianity , the repose of the diocese would not have been so terribly disturbed as it has been by this trial , and the Bishop might have gone , on quietly in his functions till death had removed him from the scene , or at least till some such accident as befell his brother of Pennsylvania , had compelled him to resign on account of his health . In this sense , the suspended bishop may be pronounced a martyr to his principles . Of course it is not to be understocd that we believe one word , of all that is said in some of these pamphlets , about a conspiracy . Vol III . 37 That there have been consultations , inquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is admitted on all sides . Indeed , without such preliminary proceedings no offender ever could be prosecuted . Bishop Onderdonk 's complaints on this subject are not at all surprising . Let them go for what they are worth . Where is the culprit to be found , convicted , but refusing to acknowledge his guilt , who does not complain that he is the victim of a conspiracy ? If such arrangements and inquiries as were used in this instance for the development and ascertainment of the facts , are to be condemned as a wicked conspiracy , the idea of discipline in the church , or of punishment in the state , may be abandoned at once , for what crime is there which , under such conditions , must not go " unwhipped of justice ? " The dishonor which the fall of Bishop Onderdonk has brought upon religion , and the degree of that dishonor , is a legitimate topic of remark . In one view it can not be denied that the ofl*nses of this man , and the necessary exposure of his ofibases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not yet say was , a clergyman in a communion often spoken of as evangelical , and in some portions of which there is known to be a decided tone of evangelical piety . He is a dignitary in a church which , in its articles , professes for the most part the distinctive truths of spiritual Christianity . He occupies a most conspicuous station , a station too elevated in power and pomp for any man to occupy as a minister of the word of Christ . That station , that church , that work of the Christian ministry , he has exposed to the scoffs of the profane . Over the disgusting details of his misconduct , many an eye has gloated with inward satisfaction at the thought that this might be represent . ed , in the haunts of ribaldry , as a specimen of Christianity and of the // Christkin ministry . In all this we acknowledge a share in the grief of those who are most deeply grieved ; and we unite our prayers with theirs , that God would overrule this dishonor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the furtherance of his own glory . But there is another view of the case . The degree of dishonor brought upon religion in any instance of this kind , does not depend merely upon its notoriety , or upon the sectarian eminence of the individual , but rather upon the relations which the offender sustains to that which the prevalent belief and the conscience of the people recognizes as religion . When a Roman Catholic priest is charged with using the confessional as an auxiliary to the most brutal crime ; is it the common American feelin * , that religion is dishonored ? When a Universalist preacher carries his principles to their legitimate result by committing suicide , who feels that religion is to bear the scandal of that horror ? Suppose the offender in the present case had been the Roman Catholic instead of the Anglican Catholic Bishop of New York-we have too high an opinion of Dr .. Hughes ' selfrespect to imagine him guilty of conduct so contemptible-we only say , suppose that Dr. Onderdonk 's episcopal throne had been at the Cathedral of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have felt that religion was dishonored ? The fact is , that the kind of religiousness which consists in forms and phylacteries , in tithing mint , anise and cumin , in macnifying the traditions of the elders , in crossings and genufiections , in rubrics and manipulations , in the pompous observance of lent , ember-week and saints ' days , and in all the carnal ordinances of that judaized and heathenized Christianity against which the Reformation was a protest - is not what the understanding and moral sensibilities of the American people recognize as religion . Men of the Oxford way of thinking , say that there is no religion in New England . This is true enoughand long may it be true , in their sense of the word religion ; and on the other hand , in the American sense of the word , there is no religion in them . We say then , that religion is not dishonored in the fall of Bishop Onderdonk , as it would have been , had he been understood to be a professor of religion . Evangelical religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ the Redeemer and not by specific works of outward righteousness-the system which insists on regeneration by the Spirit and not by the priest  --  the system which demands of all who hope in it , some evidence of an inward spiritual conversion and of an immediate intercourse with God ,  --  is what the common parlance of the American people regards as religion ; and the man whose fall is now in question is identified , in the view of all who know any thing about him , not with tils system , but with the opposition to it . All this may be put in a still clearer light by a supposition of another kind . Suppose some similar offense were proved-we will not say , upon some conspicuous Presbyterian , or Con* , regational minister , but upon some other minister of the Episcopal church . Suppose it proved-pardon the violence of the supposition-upon some such minister as Dr. Milnor or Dr. Stone , or upon such a dignitary as Bi*hop Mcllvaine . How much more painful would be the shock upon the religious sensibilities of the publichow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dishonor done to the Gospel of Christ-how much more jubilant the exultation , and the feeling of diminished restraint , on the part of the ribald enemies of godliness . Why ? Not because such men are more conspicuous than this man , or would be // 291 more talked about than he has been , but because they are identified , as he is not , with what the people of this country think of as religion . We can not doubt that a very considerable portion of the members and ministers of the Episcopal church will be found perfectly ready to acknowledge the correctness of this view . We believe that they are in the habit of regarding one party in their church as the friends , and another party as the opposers of spiritual religion . How else are we to understand that phrase , the pious members of our church , ' which is sometimes used in their publications to denote those who are most opposed to Bishop Onderdonk 's way of thinking . Nor is the state of things which this significant fact discloses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since that reformation which was commenced by Henry VIII , and which was petrified by Elizabeth , has been like her of old to whom it was said , " Two nations are in thy womb ; " and the children have " struggled together within her . " From that time to this , whether in the British isles , or on this side of the Atlantic , Esan has regarded Jacob as a supplanter predestined to oust him of his birthright ; and Jacob has had occasion to tremble before the violence of Esau . Occasionally there is an appearance of reconciliation and amity between them ; but this rarely happens unless Jacob , overawed , bows himself to the ground seven times , until he comes near to his brother . ' At such a manifestation of submission , Esau , full of fraternal feeling , runs to meet him , and falls on his neck and kisses him ; and the bystanders , not to say the parties , are very likely to be imposed upon with an idea that the old family quarrel is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any farther , the Anglican church is a preposterous attempt to join together what God and the na ture of things will not permit to be united . Popery and Protestantismthe Christianity of tradition , and the Christianity of the Bible  --  the piety of forms and servitude , and the piety of the Spirit of adoption-the Gospel of justification by ceremoniOus observances under the direction and manipulations of the priest , and the Gospel of justification by faith in Christ alone-are antagonist principles ; and the Anglican church , in attempting to bring them together , and to hit the point of indifference between them , dooms itself to a bootless toil that never can be finished . The only legitimate point of indifference between these opposite principles , is the infidelity that cares for neither . The Anglican church , by attempting to amalgamate them , brings within herself the elements of perpetual conflict . She exists as the attempted union of two parties , each of which , if consistent with itself , must regard the other as the enemy of true religion . We throw out these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article will be read by some Episcopalians whose views in regard to Bishop Onderdonk and what he calls religion are the same with ours , and who feel that his fall dishonors religion only as it dishonors the church of which he is a minister . We put it to them , not by any means in the way of taunting them with an obvious defect in their chtirch , nor with the idea of bringing them over from their way of thinking abotit church order to ours , but only for the sake of calling their attention distinctly to a point which every conscientious Episcopalian ought to consider-is it consistent with the genius of Christianity that one and the same ecclesiastical or*anization should bind together in external unity , parties that can not regard each other as holding the same religion ? Do not the interests of truth and godliness require the abandonment of an attempt which for three hun- // 292 The Martyrdom of Bishop Onderdonk. dred years has wrought so much confusion ? Is that unity which consists in subscribing the same articles in opposite senses , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the same devotional forms with opposite theories of the way ofjustification before God , worth keeping ? Would it be schism , would it be in any sense a division of the body of Christ , if elements so essentially hostile were at last separated the one from the other ? We have alluded to the dishonor which the misconduct of Bishop Onderdonk has brought upon the Protestant Episcopal church . Has that dishonor been removed by the result of the trial ? This is a reasonable question , which the people are asking and answering on all sides-a question , which we ought not to pass by without some expression of our views . To this question we answer , reluctantly and sadly , No . But some will ask us , Why not ? 1-las he not been found guilty by a large majority of the court ? ' Yes . Has not the sentence of suspension been pronounced upon him ? ' Yes . But after all , he still holds up his head in unblushing impudence as Bishop of the diocese of New York . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had the court with one accord declared that such a man was entirely and forever unfit for such an office , that would have been a vindication of the honor of the church . But the discrepancy between the finding and the sentence , augments , instead of removing the stain . Will it be said that the sentence in this case was a sort of necessary compromise between those who voted for the acquittal of the offender and were determined to stand by him , and those * hose view of the case and of what would vindicate the honor of the church was substantially the same with ours ? But this consideration does not mend the matter . The question whether a man guilty of such acts should be continued in an office which all Episcopalians regard as an apostleshipan office identical with that of Paul and Peter and John-is a question on which compromise was if possible more disgraceful to the church than defeat . Those bishops who voted three times in succession to remove the offender from his office , did their part well towards removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upon the community in which he and they are chief pastors . Those who having solemnly declared him guilty , voted the first time , or the second time , or the third time , or every time , for his suspension-not with a design of affording him an opportunity to give evidence of repentance ( for nothing of that kind seems to have been thought of , ) but simply because deposition seemed to them too severe a penalty-seem to us to have betrayed an extraordinary stupidity ; and well do they deserve the stripes which they get from Laicus , and the Churchman , and other defenders of their suspended brother , as the reward of their long-eared tenderheartedness . Those who solemnly declared the respondent not guilty , and who , still insisting on his innocence , voted first for " the lightest admonition , " and afterwards for a suspension , which if the sentence is not decided to be void from the beginning , is absolute and irretrievablehave shown themselves wise in their generation . Doubtless there is somewhere to be found , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tomes of Escobar and Sanchez-a casuistry by which they could conscientiously give their voices to admonish or even to suspend the man whom in their consciences they believed to be so far from the desert of censure , that he ought rather to be honored as eminently pure , pious , and self-denying . But the glory of their achievement in this case is , that by voting at last for suspension , // they brought the court to a sentence the meaning and effect of which is a question upon which lawyers may grow rich  --  a sentence which , if it means any thing , leaves their friend still quartered upon the rich revenues of Trinity chur h , and in a condition to sell his *resignation at such price as he may choose to ask . Surely such a sentence , so procured , against a bishop found guilty of such misconduct , is not enough to vindicate the honor of the Protestant Episcopal church . In this connection , it will not be deemed impertinent for us to remark that , in another respect , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church which it ought to have vindicated . It discloses the fact , that nearly one third of the bishops of that church are ready to stand by a brother bishop of their party in the face of the most explicit testimony given by four independent and unimpeachable witnesses . This is not the least important of the developments brought about by the trial . Six bishops , out of the seventeen constituting the court , are steadfast and immovable in the belief that their brother Onderdonk is an innocent and injured man . They take their position upon the precept given by Paul to Timothy . " Against an elder receive not an accusation , but before ( or under , as in the margin ) two or three witnesses . " And when four ladies come into court and testify , each one for herself , that the accusation is true in her experience of the respondent 's hands thrust into her bosom , or placed upon her person still more offensively-these scrupulous prelates reply that the accusation of impurity is not sustained by " two or three witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lady was in the same carriage , with his back toward the seat on which the lady and the bishop were riding . Lie testifies , " I first noticed the Bishop 's arm about my wife 's waist ; I saw him draw her towards him in a manner that I thought indelicate ; I saw her gently remove his hand from behind from off her waist . A second time I saw his arm about her waist , again I saw that he was sitting without his arm about her waist . Looking again , I saw it again about her waist . My attention was then turned to the front part of the carriage . " He was sitting by the driver . " Looking around again , I saw my wife slightly raised , carrying the Bishop 's hand around to his knee . Then I heard her say that that hand was a sacred thing to her ; it had been laid upon the heads of many of her friends in confirmation , and was to be laid upon my h*ad tomorrow . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . She said she could not sit there , that she must come over with me . As she came over and sat in my lap , I asked her what had happened . She whispered to me " * * * " She was very much agitated and told me she would tell me at the next stopping-place more fully . " Some readers may be simple enough to think that the testimony of this lady and her husband is something very much like the testimony of two witnesses . No , says Bishop Ives of North Carolina , " the only witness to that part of the allegation which could possibly imply immorality and impurity , is the lady . " Because the lady 's sense of feeling was cognizant of something which her husband did not see , and something much worse than all that he did see , therefore , all that he saw goes for nothing ; and there is only one unsupported witness . How convenient a rule would this be in the administration of church discipline , or of civil justice . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of an ecclesiastic , would become , by the operation of Bishop Ives ' logic , incapable of proof . And the logic of the six is all alike . No matter how strong // may be the proof of all the circumstances leading to or resulting from the precise act in which the offense reaches its highest pitch-no matter for the agitation and the tears in which the insulted female made known the indignity at the earliest practicable moment to her husband , or to some female friend-no matter how many women come to tell the same story of the insults which they have severally experiencednothing is proved , for there is only one witness . Really we think it a sad dishonor to theEpiscopal church , that it has six bishops who are capable of reasoning in this way without a blush . Admitting that the letter of the rule given by Paul to Timothy is applicable to the proceedings of an ecclesiastical court in the trial of a charge which has been regularly presented by " two or three responsible accusers , the construction which Bishop Ives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outrage upon common sense . Since the publication of this trial , an incident has come to our knowledge , as testified by a single unsupported witness . The fact-we will not repeat it-involves the character of a clergyman of high rank in the Onderdonk party , the head of a not unpretending establishment for female education . A young lady , then some sixteen years old , was the subject upon whom , if there is no mistake about her story , he practiced an indignity which , if the story is indeed true , ought to break up his establishment and turn him out upon the world with an ineffaceable brand upon his brow . The young lady , frightened and confounded , never revealed the indignity , as we understand , till , after her marriage , she revealed it to her husband . From her husband , since these recent events have produced so much inquiry , the story came to us . Now in this instance we are willing to admit the applicability of the rule given by Paul to Timothy . Should this presbyter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial , and should it appear at first sight that the charge rests upon the unsupported testimony which this one witness gives after the lapse of years  --  the eburt might well disIniss the charge as unproved . But suppose it should appear that other witnesses saw all but the crowning act of insult . Suppose it should appear that the young lady after making her escape , rushed instantly to the apartment of a confidential friend , and in all the agitation and distress of the moment told the story as she tells it now . And then suppose that , instead of this one witness to one incident , there are half a dozen witnesses to as many different acts of the same kind at different times-all supported in the same way-who will tell us that in the judgment of the Holy Ghost and of the apostle Paul , the man against whom such things are testified by more than two or three witnesses , is fit to sustain the sacred and confidential relations involved in the office of a Christian pastor ? Who ! Why Bishop Ives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gadsden , and Bishop Whittingham , and Bishop DeLancey-not to say , in a word , all those bishops who did not vote at last for deposing the respondent in the trial now under review . There is something farther to be noticed respecting the six bishops who uphold the innocence of the respondent . Some of them distinctly , and others implicitly , maintain that a bishop may handle the ladies of his diocese as he pleases , in a free " paternal " way-may put his hands upon them here and there so freely and paternally , and in so fondling a style , that they shall be ready to swear to all that these ladies swore to , in the case before usand yet be an excellent bishop , not at all disqualified for the function of communicating the Holy Ghost . They alledge that their brother On .. // derdonk 's well known manners in society are so familiar , that a little extra sensitiveness on the part of these ladies , whether owing to a peculiar state of health , or to an education under Puritan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to misunderstand his " manipulations , " and to swear all that they have sworn against him , when he meant no mischief at all . Thus the Bishop of South Carolina says , " Familiar manners are peculiarly liable to misunderstanding by persons who may have adopted ascetic or blue law , or other overstrained notions of morality . " And the Bishop of New Jersey-lie of the cocked hat and the golden cross-discourses after this manner . " The respondent is a man of free and unsuspecting nature . The law of kindness overflows in him . He has indulged it always in acts of great familiarity . He has acquired a habit which might easily permit , in him , freedoms of posture and of gesture , which another , with less purity of heart , might carefully avoid . It has been manifest in all his intercourse . It is proverbial . Those who have known him well , think nothing of it . In every ten to whom it might occur , there might be nine to do so ; the tenth might view it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But there never seems to have been the thought of harm in it . ' * * * " He had been so extensively connected , as a a pastor and as a friend ; so many had grown up upon his knee , as with the present witness ; these acts of fondness had so insensibly stolen on , from infancy to childhood , to girlhood , to womanhood ; they had so shaped his whole demeanor , that they were done , when done , without a thought , and never thought of afterwards . In these ways a carelessness of manner was acquired , which rendered postures that might be mistaken , and motives that might he misunderstood , and gestures that might he misconceived , and contacts that were never intended , an easy thing ; and yet however liable to error in the judgment of the second person or the looker-on , in him without a thought of evil . It is so that 1 accotint for what must have occurred to give any semblance to the statements of the witness under this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 292 . This Bishop of New Jersey and others of the same sort make a great deal of argument to show that even admitting the truth of all that the witnesses say , it can not be certainly inferred that the respondent had a distinct intention to seduce these women , or to commit the crime against which the laws of the state provide , or ought to provide , a penalty . What if he had no such intention ? There is no necessity of proving such an intention , or of supposing it . What man or woman of ordinary human-not to speak of Christian-sensibilities , does not see that these free and paternal familiarities , embracing the waists and pawing the bosoms of young women-these maudlin " caresses " - these free and easy " postures , " and " gestures , " and " contacts , " which , in the ultra civilization of Trinity church society , are so kindly received , and so well understood , as having no ulterior intention , but which , when the Bishop gets out of that charmed circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or other overstrained notions of morality , " are so likely to be understood very differently-are of themselves , independent of any inference as to a specific design in this or that particular instance , indecent , impure , and in a Christian sense immoral , and are the very gist of the accusation upon which Bishop Onderdonk was tried . Here we apprehend is a difference , if not the difference , between the Ol ) pOsite views of this case . On the one hand , the six bishops , with all those whom the influence of the Trinity church civilization arrays in behalf of the suspended prelate , are of opinion that such manners , though perhaps to be regretted , as indiscreet , and liable to the censures of the illiberal " blue skin " sort of folks , are not inconsistent with the purity and holiness of a Christian pastor . On the other hand , the eleven bishops , and those who agree with them in the condemnation of Bishop Onderdonk , are of opinion , that the clergyman , // of whatever order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in a state of betweenity , ' ventures to use , in his intercourse with grown-up ladies , such familiarities as produce upon their minds the firm conviction that he actually thrusts his hands into their bosoms , and does other things yet worse than thatought to be dealt with as an offender , without waiting to determine , or even to inquire , whether in particular instances all this was designed as a first step to something else . Manners are morals ; and sometimes they can hardly be said to be the minor morals . " A portion of Christ 's sermon on the mount was evidently preached against such manners as these , which , it would seem , were considered venial by the phylacteried Puseyism of that age , as well as by the gold-cross Pharisaisrn of this . Strange as it may seem to the unthinking , the Pharisaism which teaches men how to be saved by their own works , is always more accommodating in its morals , than the Gospel which preaches salvation by faith through the blood that cleanseth from all sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fasts t*vice in the week , Wednesday and Friday , besides keeping Lent ; it says prayers at the canonical hours ; but it eschews the austere blue-law morality which would find fault with innocent freedoms and familiarities on the part of a clergyman towards the ladies of his charge ; and it counts all things of that sort innocent , in which there is not proved to he a distinctly formed intention to effect a breach of the seventh commandment , according to the old Pharisaic exposition of the decalogue . There was more philosophy than the author dreamed of , in the communication from an ingenious correspondent of the Churchman , who accounted for the verdict of the court of bishops , by the discovery that some of the majority were so lost to conscience and the obligations of godliness , as to dine with some of their friends in the course of " ember week , " and even on the Friday of that week . Men whose consciences were in such a state , must be expected , he thought , to judge wrong on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer , that if all the bishops had been Pharisaical enough to sit " with ashes on their heads , " because it was ember week , and to feed scrupulously and ceremoniously on fish , instead of eating what was set before them and ask . ing no questions for conscience* sake ; then Bishop Onderdonk might have been pronounced innocent without a dissenting voice And here we must notice also the manner in which the evidence bringing home to the respondent the allegation of improper excitement by intoxicating drink , was disposed of by those who found him not guilty . In one of the specifications of the presentment , it was alleged that , on a certain occasion , the respondent " was under the influence of , and improperly excited by , vinous or spirituous liquors drunk by him . " In support of this allegation , one witness , the lady who rode in the carriage with him on the same seat , testified , " I noticed immediately " - that is , immediately after receiving him into the carriage- " that his breath was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having spoken of the Bishop 's reading some letters which he had received before entering the carriage , the witness proceeds " When I first noticed that his breath was tainted by something he had been drinkin * , I was neither surprised nor pained by it , for I was aware that he habitually used wine and ardent spirits , but was not aware to what extent . After he had finished reading his letters , I found , with some alarm , that he became unusually talkative , and that he spoke so indistinctly that I could not always un // derstand him . " Another witness , a clergyman , the husband of this lady , was in the same carriage , on the front seat , directly before his wife , where , turning himself a little , he could carry on a frequently interrupted conversation with those who were behind him . In answer to the question , " Did or did not the Bishop appear to be excited by spirituous or vinous liquors ? " this witness says , " He did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement ? " he answers , " Very high spirits and thickness of speech , first noticed by me when he was reading a letter from Mr. Ten Broeck . " How shall this allegation* thus supported , he disposed of ? The Bishop of North Carolina says , " The indefiniteness of this allegation must necessarily render the proof indefinite , and hence the impression on the mind of the court altogether doubtful . It must be dismissed , therefore , as too vague in itself , and consequently as not of necessity implying guilt in the respondent , even were it sufficiently proved . " The Bishop of New Jersey says , that " by the very language used , a question of less or more is introduced , entirely inconsistent with the terms of a presentment . " He declares , that the allegation " is by no means proved . " He says , " The duties of the daya full morning service , and a sermon , with the holy communion ; a full evening service and a sermon , with confirmation , * and setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which such a charge required . It rests on the smell of the breath , on a talkative * That Bishop 0 . did all this reading and preaching himself , is not in the testimony , and we presume is not what Bishop Doane intended . We suppose he means that what his brother 0 . might be able to get down between , and after , these exercises , would be no more , at the most , than what a lord bishop might drink without being " improperly excited " - " a little for his stomach 's sake "  --  the whole question being one " of less or more . " disposition , on the supposed* thickness of the voice , and on sleeping heavily , all of which might have occurred without improper excitement . " The Bishop of Western New York regards the allegation as " disproved by incidental testimony " from the lady in relation to the driver of the carriage . The driver , it seems , was one of that sort of men who are " peculiarly sensitive to the improprieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately gone over to the Episcopal church . It does not appear that the driver had any suspicion that the Bishop whom he was conveying from a confirmation to an ordination , was " improperly excited " by drink ; inasmuch as it does appear that he afterwards continued to be an Episcopalian . Yet all the circumstances sworn to- " tainted breath , " " high spirits , " " thickness of speech , " and " talkativeness , " were as cognizable by the driver as by the lady and her husband.t In view of this " incidental testimony , " Bishop DeLancey proceeds : " To my mind the inference is plain , that the account of the condition of the respondent is exaggerated by the witnesses . The thickness of speech is explained by his having preached twice , instituted a clergyman , and held a confirmation , that very day , * Not so ,  --  the thickness of speech was not supposed , hut testified . I What an argument is this to disprove the positive testimony of two witnesses , by " incidental testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South America , and can give no testimony at all ! This driver may have been himself a regular drinker at every stopping-place. if so , his sensitiveness to the improprieties of professing Christians ' is easily accounted for ; and the " tainted breath " of his brotImer in opposition to ultra-temperance fariaticism , could not possibly come within the reach of his discernment . Furthermore , he was a stranger to the bishop , and for that reason could not tell whether the high spirits , thickness of articulation and great talkativeness , were any thing unusual . // before the ride cornmenced. * A single glass of wine would have produced the tainted breath . And the talkativeness and high spirits , somewhat inconsistent with thickness of speech , not at all inconsistent , are easily resolvable into the well known cheerful and courteous disposition of the respondent , and his meeting with the recently married son and daughter of his old friends . " The Bishop of Maryland says , that the testimony " deserves only to be characterized as absurd and self-confutatory . " He asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of vinous or spirituous liquors can be taken without producing some excitement . Is , therefore , all or any excitement improper , and presentable ? If not , where is the limit , within the line of intoxication ? " " A single glass of wine " he thinks would account for the Bishop 's tainted breath . " The much ' talking , for aught that appears , was the innocent indulgence of unsuspictous frankness ; the thick ' talking , perhaps , the imagination of those whose nice senses had detected the fumes ' of liquor , or , more likely , the somewhat affected articulation of organs fatigued by hard duty through the day . " It appears then that the bishops who voted for the acquittal of the respondent in respect to this specification , rest their verdict , primarily on the position that the fact alleged * Whether preaching twIce in a single iay can have any tendency to such an effect on the articulation , preachers out of the Episcopal church can judge-in the way of pri ate judgment-as well as those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any layman who ever heard two sermons on the same day from the same preacher , can judge on this point . What the effect of holding a confirmation may he on a bishop 's organs of articulation , and particularly on the nerves and muscles that move his tongue , is a question on which it might be well to take the opinion of the House of Bishops . Perhaps Bishop Southgate will be able to send home some testimony on that point from the bishops of the Oriental churches . was indefinite in its nature , introducing , as one of them said , a question " of less or more , " and therefore , as another said , " not of necessity implying guilt in the respondent , even if proved . " Another of them asks , as if he thought the question must be a poser , " What is undue or impi-oper excitement ? " Let us look at this . The allegation of undue or improper excitement involves , it . is said , a question of less or more , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not drunkenness admit of degrees ? If you charge a priest with being drunk at the altar , you may , as easily as in this case , raise the question of less drunk or more drunk . Improper excitement by vinous or spirituous liquors , says a right reverend father , does not of necessity imply guilt . Does drunkenness of necessity imply guilt ? It is not simple excitement which is alleged , but improper excitement . A man may be conceived of as drunk without guilt ; but if he is charged with being " under the influence of , and improperly excited by , vinous or spirituous liquors drunk by him , " he is charged with something quite as definite , and quite as certainly involving guilt , as if he had been charged with the " improper " use of intoxicating drink in some more vulgar phrase . But , says another , what is undue or improper excitement ? Any quantity of distilled or fermented drink causes some excitement ,  --  what precise degree of excitement is improper ? Where , within the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is proper and that which is improper and presentable ? We say that such questions are for the judges , not to ask , but to answer . And the answer which a judge shall give to such a question , may be a significant indication of his own habits and character . The question , When is a man drunk in the sense of the law ? - was once raised in a trial before a justice of the peace in Virginia ; // and the decision was-A man is drunk when he has taken so much that he can not lie on the ground without holding on. * We may be very sure , that justice of the peace was not guilty of the vulgarity of being what in modern parlance is called a tetotaler . Far be it from us to intimate , that these six bishops are all hard drinkers . It may be the case with some of them , or with all , that their manner of life is so studious and ascetic-so retired from all opportunities of observing the drinking customs and other current follies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distilled and fermented drinks upon the human frame-as to render their ignorance of what constitutes improper excitement by wine or alcohol , entirely unaffected , and entirely free from the suspicion of being caused by any habit of unsaintly or unapostolic indulgence on their part . We trust that the ignorance of these right reverend gentlemen as to what degree of excitement by wine or strong drink is improper , will be enlightened by the decision of that higher court- " the church diffused "  --  to which the case has now been carried . As having an humble seat in that higher court , we would say , for their information , that if a man is in such a state that , upon his coming into the presence of two individuals that have known him from their childhood , the first thing observed by them is the alcoholic vapor of his breath ; and the next is an unnatural elevation of spirits , manifested in an unusual flow of talk ; and the next is a thickness of articulation , as if the motor nerves communicating with the tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next is a maudlin demonstration of fondness towards a lady who happens to be sitting at his side , which is repeated , with increased offensiveness , after being interrupted by a pointed rebuke ; and next comes heavy sleep , while the carriage in which he is conveyed goes pitching and jolting along in the darkness , over the stumps and stones and steep declivities of a cross-road in Western New York ,  --  that is a case which , whether you place it on one side or the other of the line of intoxication , demonstrates from beginning to end what the common sense of common men regards as " undue and improper excitement . " Of course , the men who do not recognize in such an allegation , any thing sufficiently definite to be a subject of judicial inquiry , will not be expected to discover any weight in the testimony , by which the allegation is supported . Such was the fact with these six bishops . The testimony of the two witnesses , as to what they smelt , and saw , and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intoxication , which the facts testified demonstrate , is innocent in their view . Ought we not to regard these men as claiming for themselves as bishops of the Protestant Episcopal church , the right to drink , up to some " line of intoxi* cation " beyond all that the testimony of these unimpeachable witnesses proves upon Bishop Onderdonk ? Since then the result of the trial , as given to the world , not only leaves the culprit still a bishop , with an unlimited power of vexing and disgracing his diocese , but betrays the fact that six very eminent bishops are capable of taking such positions before the world , and defending their strange positions with arguments still more astounding ,  --  we can not see that the honor of the Protestant Episcopal church is adequately vindicated . Is there moral energy enough in that communion to put down this Dr. Onderdonk effectually and for ever ? Is there moral ener * The case we believe is not in the books . We give it traditionally as we bad it , many years ago , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // gy enough to shame the six bishops who have undertaken to bear him through , and to make them feel that they and their party are down . Is there moral energy enough-is there enough of the Christian spirit-is there enough of American manliness-to throw off the secularizing , Romanizing , demoralizing influence of the Trinity church corporation ? If that shall be the result of the present conflict , then will the honor of the Episcopal church be vindicated . There remains another topic which we regard as a proper sub . ject of discussion . It is the light which this whole matter throws upon the constitution and working of the Episcopal church , both in respect to its merits , and in respect to its defects and disadvantages . 1 . The records of this trial show , that in one most important and radical point , the Episcopal . church in this country is Protestant and not Catholic . If there is any test of Protestantism-nay , of ultra Protestantism , as opposed to organic Catholicity , the utter rejection of the whole body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration of independence  --  the salient point , as it may be called , of the separation between the Protestant and Catholic organizations-consisted in his solemnly committing to the flames at Wittemberg , Dec. 10 , 1520 , both the Pope 's decree of excornmumcation against him , and the volumes of the canon law . And though to this day the canon law is the basis of the ecclesiastical jurisprudence of Lutheran Germany , the Protestantism of Germany is maintained by the provision that the canon law is of no force , when it conflicts with Protestant principles . In the church of England , the canon law , excepting such parts of it as are repugnant to the prerogative of the crowit and the laws of the realm , is still in force , by act of Parliament , ( 25 Hen . VIII . ) The canon law then , even in England , has force , not as enacted by the councils , or established by the usages of the ancient church , but as enacted by King Henry VIII , and his obsequious Parliament ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church of England . The ultra Protestant communities  --  the Presbyterians , Congregationalists , Baptists and Methodists-in a word the Puritan churches , have nothing to do with the old canon law , except as they renounce it and pray to be delivered from the snare thereof . ' And how is it with the Episcopal church in the United States ? Does that body recognize the legislation and jurisprudence of the ancient church , down to the age of the Reformation , as of authority in the administration of discipline by American bishops , except so far as the old canons have been repealed or modified by some express enactment of its own ? Not at all . The Episcopal church renounces not only the papal decretals , but the entire body of the canon law , no matter by what councils it was enacted . It renounces , not only the canons of the so called universal councils which have been held since the great schism which separated the patriarch of Constantinople from the patriarch of Rome ; but also , the canons of the Catholic church as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in the Tale of a Tub , stripped away every rag of Lord Peter 's livery more completely than the American Episcopal church has denuded itself of every tatter of the Catholic canon law . The theory of Catholicity , as we understand it , is that the Catholic church is an organic body with a corporate power of legislation , and that this power of legislation , whether exercised directly , under the formalities of a universal council , or indirectly , in the form of universal usage or tradition , binds the whole Catholic church to the duty of conformity . But neither // the canons of the first six general councils , nor the canons of the first three-no , nor the yet older body of traditionary rules , known as the canons of the Apostles , have any force whatever , before the ecclesiastical tribunals of the American Episcopal church . It is in this respect an ultra Protestant church . Its only canons are those enacted by its own legislature , under a constitution framed by mutual compact . This is a serious obstacle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who would expel the Protestant element , and efface from its escutcheon the Protestant name . 2 . The records of this trial show that , under the system of the Episcopal church in its present stage of development , it is a very difficult matter to bring an offending bishop to account . the ecclesiastical system of American Episcopalianism bears in many respects , a very close analogy to Congregationalism , and particularly to the Congregationalism of Connecticut ,  --  the greatest differen es being such as are involved in the fact that the original and independent church of the one system is a diocese with a bishop over it , while the complete and independent church of the other system , is a congregation with its bishops and deacons . The relations of the several diocesan churches , in the one system , are like the relations of the several parochial churches of a district , in the other system . The house of bishops is like the association of pastors . The general convention of bishops and diocesan deputies , is like the consociation or council of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a church meeting regularly convened for business . The Episcopal bishop , like the Congregational pastor , is immediately responsible to his brethren of his own order within the limits of the confederation . Lie may be complained of , and regularly presented , either by his own dioce san convention , or by any three of his brother bishops ; just as the pastor of a Congregational church in Connecticut may be arraigned before a council , either by the action of his own church , or on a complaint to the association by two or three of his brethren in the ministry . The Episcopal prelate can not be regularly condemned but by the voices of his brother bishops ; and just so the parochial bishop under the Saybrook Platform , can not be tried till the association , upon inquiry , have found sufficient cause for trial ; nor can he be censured in the consociation without the votes of a majority of his brethren in office . The Congregational system works well as it respects the responsibility of pastors . Why thea should not the Episcopal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops ? A moment 's reflection is enough to show that there must be a difference . Think of the greatness of the dioceses and the consequent distance of the bishops from each other . One resides at Boston , another at Hartford , another at New York , another at Geneva , the next at Detroit ; how can these men exercise any such fraternal inspection over each other as is exercised by the pastors of a Congregational association ? Think of the unnatural loftiness of the position which a bishop occupies in relation to the clergy and laity of his own diocese , by virtue of that august dignity and those mysterious powers which are supposed to have descended to him from the Apostles . tIe has no brethren around him to watch him as a brother , or to speak to him in the freedorn of fraternal counsel and admonition . Who is there in the diocese that shall dare to move against him to bring him to account , unless his delinquency is such that the very stones are ready to cry out against him ? All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trial now under consideration . // It was asked again and again , by the friends of Bishop Onderdonk , in reference to clergymen who had been cognizant of his misconduct in some particulars , Why did they not go to their brother , and tell him his fault alone ? The proper answer is , He was not their brother in any such sense , as would make that measure reasonable on their part . There was no relation of parity between him and them , such as must be presupposed in taking a step of that kind . What kind of a figure would a young clergyman , the rector of a little country congregation , make , going to administer a private admonition to his own bishop , and that bishop the diocesan of New York ? The only remedy for this lies in the division of dioceses till the episcopacy shall approximate to the character of a parochial episcopacy . If a bishop were to have the superintendency of a few contiguous congregations , two , three , or haifa dozen , devoting his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this difficulty of bringing him to account would disappear . Let the system be thus developed ; and the bishop instead of being , either in his own estimation or in that of any body else , a great spiritual potentate , of the same sort with the bishop of Exeter , or of London , or of Rome , would be simply a minister of Christ , charged with the oversight of several congregations . Instead of being isolated by his rank , with no brother-no peer , nearer than fifty or a hundred miles in one direction , and two or three hundred in another , he would be surrounded by brethren , his equals in office , under whose constant oversight he would perform his work , whose watchfulness would guard him from temptation , and whose brotherly faithfulness would rebuke him promptly when he went astray . 3 . In connection with this consideration of the difficulty with which the discipline of the church is put in exercise against an offending bishop , we can not but notice , as illustrated by the present trial , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been trained in it . We know not how to define what we mean , better than by referring to instances . First , then , here is a young minister of the Gospel ; we can not doubt that he is a conscientious and truly pious man . All that appears on the record , and all that we have heard of him from any other quarter , constrains us to regard him with a sympathy which we have no disposition to disguise . Born and nurtured in the Episcopal church , in which his father was an honored minister , he looks upon the ministry of that church as an employment in which all his hopes and wishes in regard to this life can be filled , and in which , serving his Savior in the holiest labors , he can best train himself while training others , for the life to come . Having performed the usual probation in the lowest order of the ministry , and having obtained a settlement over a respectable congregation in a flourishing village of Western New York , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That ordination can be obtained , of course , only from the apostolic hands of the bishop of the diocese . The bishop is performing an official journey through that part of his jurisdiction . The candidate for orders has come therefore in person some fifty miles , for the sake of conveying the bishop to the place where the ordination is to be performed to-morrow , in the presence of his own parishioners . His young wife , two months married , is with him . She too has been trained in the Episcopal church , in which her own father , as well as her husband 's , is a minister . To both of them , the lesson of veneration for the functions and the person of the bishop , was among the earliest les // Sons of their childhood ; and it remains in their minds , blended with all their most sacred and devout associations . As they have been delayed by various causes , the return journey must be performed , a great part of it , in the night . At their setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a few moments , the shocking but irresistible conviction comes over them , that this authentic successor of the Apostles , whom they are conveying to the performance of the most mysterious and peculiar of all his awful functions , is more than half intoxicated . The husband is compelled to witness one annoying familiarity after another practiced upon his wife . An attempt is made to recall the Bishop to his senses , by a respectful and gentle rebuke , but in vain . What shall they do ? The twilight is fading ; and as the night deepens , the annoyances grow more offensive , till the frighted and agitated wife springs over the back of the seat on which her husband is sitting , puts herself into his arms , and , in a whisper , tells him that she can endure it no longer . What shall that husband do ? What does a just indignation prompt him to do ? What would he do , if the offender were any body else than his bishop ? Does he bid the carriage stop ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modesty by the collar ? Does he say to him , suiting the action to the word , Come out of my carriage ; I have done with you ; - now go about your own affairs and take care of yourself as you can ? ' No ; he is absolutely in a maze ; he knows not what to do . Lie waits till the carriage arrives at a stopping-place . There he consults with his wife , and learns from her lips the grossness of the insult . What shall be done ? In his indignation , he declares that he will not be ordained by such hands as those - that he will return to his home , and not carry such a bishop for such a service . His wife , with an instinctive discernment of the position in which such a course on the part of her husband would place both of them , does all she can to soothe him ; and after a little resting of the horses , their journey is continued . So they travel from one stopping place to another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for the State of New York , and the one appointed medium in all that empire State for the communication of the grace of God in confirmation and in ordinationsinking down into the heavy sleep in which nature seeks to regain its balance , after disturbance by improper alcoholic excitement . At last the distressing journey is ended ; and , at the appointed time , the ordination follows , the lady very properly absenting herself from a ceremony so shocking to all her religious sensibilities , But her unhappy husband-who does not pity him ? He can not escape . The man of whose character he has become cognizant , is none other than his bishop ; and he can find no other way of entrance into the ministry of Christ , but by submitting to the laying on of those lecherous hands . Who that has not been educated an Episcopalian can imagine the conflict of that hour in his mind ? Who can imagine the stunned and helpless feeling with which that candidate must have kneeled before that bishop  --  a feeling as if all the foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling as if he had suddenly discovered that The pillared firmament is rottenness , And earth 's base built on stubble . ' Proceed we to another illustration . We have now before us two young ladies , evidently educated under thoroughly Episcopalian influences , confirmed at a suitable age , diligent Sunday school teachers , active in promoting the interests of the church . It is a Sabbath in the month of June ; and in the church where these young // ladies are accustomed to worship , far towards the upper end of New York island , the Bishop , with whom they had heretofore had some acquaintance , is to officiate ; and after the morning service he is to dine at their brother 's house , which is their home . The younger sister is obliged to leave church and go home before the service of the morning is ended , on account of a nervous headache . Th elder , at the close of the service , rides home with the bishop in a carriage , of which the rector of the church is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parson is chiefly occupied with his functions as charioteer , the law of kindness in the Bishop , ' as described by his brother of New Jersey , overflows ' its banks ; and , in his familinr and paternal ' way , not having the fear of blue laws ' before his eyes , he insists on putting his arm around the lady 's neck , and taking some other liberties . The lady is tempted to leap from the carriage ; but she does not . It would be natural for her to utter some exclamation , but she is silent . Why ? The reason is plain enough . This is the Bishop ; and the thought that if she cries out the Bishop will be disgraced , and the church dishonored , awes her to silence . But as soon as she arrives at her brother 's house , she rushes to her chamber , and , there tells the story to her sister , between whom and herself there are no secrets . What then ? Do these young ladies determine to remain in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them has left the house ? No ; the Bishop  --  the Bishop must be treated with respect . The idea of treating the apostolical succession as embodied in their bishop , with any appearance of disrespect , shocks their devout sensibilities . The younger sister , therefore , though afraid , goes down immediately to entertain ' him , as the family were not yet prepared to do so ; the elder having promised to follow , as soon as she can sufficiently compose herself . No sooner does she enter the parlor , in the performance of this pious intention , than the Bishop begins to ' entertain ' himself by taking the same liberties which he had just been taking with her sister . She is afraid to scream , or even to reprove him , for her two brothers are in the hall , ' and the door is open . She is fearful for his personal safety , and does not expose him for the sake of the church . ' The coming in of other members of the family affords her a momentary relief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape . Her religious sentiment of reverence for the Bishop is so strong , that even after all this , she dares not treat him with diminished respect ; she dares not show him that she thinks him a villain ; it does not appear that she dares to admit such a thought into her own mind . Instead of avoiding him with a womanly dignity , she almost seems , if we may judge from her own story , to put herself in the way of additional insults , which he loses no opportunity of practicing , till the sisters go out to their afternoon classes in the Sunday school . Such is the veneration in which a bishop , as such , is held by a devout churchwoman . We have yet another illustration , bearing on a different point . A young clergyman in one of the little parishes on Long Island , has the honor of entertaining the Bishop under his own roof . His young wife , a few weeks married , is so unfortunate as to sit by the Bishop during a short ride from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , she tells her husband , who had come home some other way , that the Bishop 's manners are too familiar ; that he has put his arm around her in the carriage , pressing his hand upon her bosom ; and that she desires not to ride with him again . The husband , whose vener // ation for the episcopal office and for the person in whom it is embodied , is more ingrained than hers , and who has been from his childhood acquainted with the free and careless manners of this bishop-insists that his wife-whom we suspect to have been born and educated out of the atmosphere of Trinity church , if not under some of the blue law influences of New England-has misunderstood the matter . Accordingly in the evening , he does not hesitate to put his wife again by the side of the Bishop , in the carriage , while he himself and a nephew of his are on the front seat . He does not dream that any impropriety can committed in his presence ; even though his face is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management of the horse . Yet during that short ride , with the husband in the carriage , the Bishop , supposing , doubtless , that the familiarities of the morning had given no mortal offense , renewed his insults , and carried them to a degree of indignity which can not be described . In this case , the conduct of the husband , immediately afterwards , was as manly and as worthy of his Christian profession , as could have been expected . Though he said nothing to the Bishop himself-though he did not tell him , as in a similar case he would have told any minister who stood upon the footing of parity with him , to go out of the house , and never to darken those doors again , with his hateful presencethough he even took him in his carriage and conveyed him civilly to the place of his next appointmenthe lost no time before taking advice , confidentially , of men whose advice was not given without prayer . The consequence was that after a little consultation , the Bishop was waited upon by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been communicated , and at a second interview , in the presence of the offended husband , one of those cler gymen-an excellent and venerable man , more honored out of the Episcopal church than in it-betrayed his Presbyterian tendencies by giving the right reverend culprit a good round admonition . After this , as the Bishop , at the second interview , had shed some tears , and had made acknowledgments and promises which were understood , by some at least of those present , as including a distinct confession of the facts ,  - -  it was agreed by the company , at their parting from each other in the street , that the best way was to let the matter drop and say no more about it . But what is most striking in the sequel is , that this young clergyman , with his perfect knowledge of that bishop 's baseness ,  --  knowledge so painfully acquired , dare not let it be suspected , that he is not as much the Bishop 's friend as ever . The Bishop , it might be thought , is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's power . Let it be known that he is not the Bishop 's friend , and his prospects of advancement in his profession are blasted . Therefore , it is that he humbles himself to invite the Bishop to dine at his house , in the presence of several clerical guests , with that insulted wife of his presiding at the table . The honor of having the Bishop at his table is a matter too important to him , in his profession , to be foregone . Therefore it is that he humbles himself to apologize for taking the Protestant Churchman , lest it should be reported to the Bishop to his disadvantage . Therefore it is that he takes pains to speak of the Bishop in terms of friendliness and respect . Take now these illustrations of the position , which a bishop holds in the religious sensibilities of Episcopalians , and of the power which he thus has over his clergy , and carry them back to the point which we were last considering , the difficulty of bringing ecclesiastical discipline to bear upon a bishop when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where it now stands , is a prolonged illustration of that point . Who can wonder that the witnesses , when each instance of delinquency was supposed by those cognizant of it , to be a solitary one , were afraid to have the insults they had suffered brought to light ? What woman of whatever degree of respectability , and however supported by friends , would not have been crushed into infamy , if she had appeared against this bishop as a single witness to a solitary specification of misconduct . how hardly have these four escaped , with all the support which the testimony of each receives from thot of the others . How have they been abused , not only by the counsel for the respondent , for that was all in course , a regular business transaction ; ' not only by the pamphleteers and newspaper writers , in the interest of the now suspended prelate ; but by the bishops of the Onderdonk party , speaking in their judicial capacity . Those bishops may be ignorant on other subjects , but on one point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf . They know well enough , without being reminded of it , the power of an acknowledged bishop over a true churchman , or a true church-woman . They know well enough that the religious and reverent admiration in which a devout Episcopalian holds the person of the bishop , and the dependence of an Episcopalian clergyman upon his bishop for advancement in his profession , are abundantly sufficient to account for all in the conduct of these witnesses , that might else seem unaccountable . And yet they abuse these witnesses without stint , for acting in a manner , in which if they had not acted , they would not have been Episcopalians . Bishop Whittingham 's behavior in this respect , is particularly open to condemnation . His sneer at the lady " whose nice organs detected the fumes of liquor " in the breath of Bishop Onderdonk , together with the accompanying insinuation , that a person of such nice organs would imagine ' thick talking where there was none , is bad enough ; but it hardly begins to be a sample of the gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems as if he were determined to make them an example , in terrorem , of the temerity of bearing witness , in any case , against a bishop , before a court of bishops . The man who can take advantage of his position to treat such women in such a way , deserves no respectful treatment from men . But we have done . If we were to touch upon all the topics that crowd into the mind , in the consideration of this complicated and melancholy story , it would be necessary for us to publish a volume , instead of an article . We will only say in conclusion , that this case as we understand it , is a caution to be heeded by all those clergymen , of whatever church , or connection , who at this day , and in the face of all the considerations involved in a Christian or humane regard for the welfare of society , insist upon their Christian liberty of using wine as a drink for refreshment . He who , in the position and under the responsibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-denial as abstinence from intoxicating drinks , for the sake of others whom such an example on his part may peradventure save from present and eternal ruin ,  --  let him beware . The spirit which says in self-regard and self-reliance , I can drink and be safe , let others take care of themselves , ' is a spirit which the God of love will smite with his curse . " Pride goeth before destruction , and a haughty spirit before a fall . "
