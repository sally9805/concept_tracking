BOSTON AND CAMBRIDGE : JAMES MUNROE AND COMPANY . M DCCC XLIX . Acknowledgment Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1848 , By James Munroe and Company , in the Clerk 's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts . BOSTON : THURSTON , TORRY , AND COMPANY , 31 Devonshire Street . PREFACE . This Romance was written some years ago , and was afterwards thrown aside , as on the whole not likely to interest the general reader . The subject was first suggested to me by a friend ( far more capable of doing justice to it than myself ) , who had however entirely abandoned the ground . As , upon second thoughts , however , the epoch still seems to me to possess certain attractions , I submit , with great diffidence , the following pages to the public . The crepuscular period which immediately preceded the rise of the Massachusetts Colony , possesses more of the elements of romance than any subsequent epoch . After the arrival of Winthrop with the charter , the history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few previous years there are several characters flitting like phantoms through the chronicles of the time , about whose life and personal adventures , either at home or in the wilderness , but little is known . They differ entirely from the group of personages who succeeded them . Their appearance is in striking , wilful contrast to the general aspect of the place and the age . For the purposes of history , perhaps it is of no great consequence that the strict account of their lives has not been written , but the singularity of their appearance gives them a certain romantic interest . It was the brief presence of these pale and misty apparitions , vanishing in the cold , clear dawn of Massachusetts history , which first attracted me to the epoch . The charm of the subject lay in a wild improbability , which seemed to surround it , but which disappeared upon an examination of contemporary record . The gentle reader is assured , and the ferocious critic is warned , that the personages and scenes , which may appear to be out of keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An elephant hunt , for example , would hardly be more unexpected in Massachusetts than a hawking scene ; a Hetman of Cossacks as likely a personage to meet with as a Knight of the Sepulchre  --  and yet both the character and the adventure are literal verities . As the classics are growing unfashionable , Morton may perhaps appear more of a pedant than he would have done two centuries ago . The reader may very probably object to his quotations from Horace . If so , the quarrel must be not with me , but with Morton , who is hardly able to write a page of his autobiography without a classical allusion or extract . With regard to another point , it can hardly be necessary to disclaim any improper motive in describing the scenes in which the Liturgy and Church of England are degraded by their profane supporters . The spirit of the scenes is historical , and it is to the accidental presence and the mad follies of such ribalds , who affected to belong to the English church only to show their ill-will to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fathers of Massachusetts to the honored church , for which , upon leaving England , they expressly proclaimed their affection , may perhaps be traeed . So far as I know , the epoch has not been illustrated by writers of fiction , with a single exception . I am aware , that in one of the volumes of Mr. Hawthorne 's " Tales , " is a story called the " Maypole of Merry-Mount . " Although familiar with most of those masterpieces of exquisite delineation and subtle fancy , I was so fortunate as never to have read that particular story before writing these volumes , and I took care not to read it afterwards , feeling sure , if I did so , that my own pictures would be still more unsatisfactory to me . With this exception , the ground has not I believe been occupied . Every man will of course decide for himself where the line between history and romance should be drawn . As I have concluded not to use my materials for an article in the Massachusetts Historical Collections , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities , in all particulars . As for my sources , beyond those accessible to every reader , I do not care at present to indicate them . How certain portions of Sir Christopher Gardiner 's correspondence were discovered in the cellar of an old house at Squantum  --  how certain documents , relating to the Gorges family , were found wrapped about the Third Volume of Winthrop 's Journal , when it was discovered in the steeple of the Old South  --  how some workmen , in digging for the foundation of a new house in Blaxton 's six-acre lot , recently discovered an iron box , which to their disappointment was found to contain not doubloons , but documents relating to the private affairs of one William Blaxton , clerk of Shawmut  --  how these remarkable papers were all which escaped the destruction which befell his house and library , and all his effects , in Philip 's war  --  how they at last came into my possession ;  --  all this , and much more " of worthy memory , " I might have stated , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for certain reasons " perish in oblivion , and the curious public return uninstructed to its grave . " Another word  --  for like the bellows-mender of Athens , an author sometimes likes to explain his roaring . The timorous reader may fear , from the epoch , to find this an Indian story . The fear would be natural , for it must be admitted that in fiction there is " no more dangerous wild-fowl " than your Indian , not even " your lion . " But it is not an Indian story . The savages are left in the back-ground , although it would have been difficult and impolite to turn them altogether out of their country at that early period . I will only observe , in conclusion , that if the epoch sometimes seems dreary , and the story dull , the dulness is intentional , and must be imputed entirely to the didactic nature of the subject . As somebody says in the Spectator , " Whenever I am dull , the reader may be sure I have a design in it . " CONTENTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE LORD OF MERRY-MOUNT 10 CHAPTER III .

A tempest , which had for many days been sweeping over land and sea , had at last subsided . The ocean was still tossing in stormy surges beyond the two external pillars of the Massachusetts Bay ; and even within its beautiful archipelago of tufted islands , where the tempest 's rage was comparatively powerless , the dark and foaming waves broke violently against the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as silent and dreary as itself . The storm , as it careered over the ocean , had found hardly a wilder or more savage solitude than when it swept over those silent , western deserts . As the boundless waste of waters , rolling unchanged through ages , even so expanded that ancient wilderness , unmarked and stern as on creation 's morning . It was the year 1628 . A bright April morning had at last dawned upon the Massachusetts Bay ; by which designation was at that epoch understood all the land and water , with the scattered islands , shut up within the two opposite headlands or gateposts of Nahant and Nantasco . Near a jutting promontory , within a deep indentation of the coast stood at that day a solitary cottage . It was in a secluded cove , with the bay in front , the threeheaded hill of Shawmut in the distance , and the primeval forest stretching out , in unfathomable shade , behind and all around . On the right hand , the headland of the cove was continued far into the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been baptized by the Puritans with the name of their faithful friend , Tisquantum ; on the left , the forest retreated a few hundred yards , leaving an open glade between the pebbly beach and the wood crowned and rolling country beyond . The cottage was simple and rude , but picturesque in its effects . It was built of logs , which still retained their dark and mossy bark . It covered a considerable extent of ground ; the thatched roof was low browed , with steep gables at the end , and two or three windows were furnished with small diamond panes of glass , a luxury which was at that day by no means common even in England . Over the door , which opened on the outside with a wooden latch , stood a pair of moose antlers , and on the ends of the projecting rafters , under the eves , were suspended the feet of wolves , the tails of foxes , raccoons , and panthers , and other trophies of the chase . On the sward of wild grass around the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ,  --  pied brant-geese , blue and green winged teal , two or three long-necked , long-billed cranes , with a rabble rout of plump , slate colored pigeons , lay promiscuously with striped bass , dappled sea trout and other fish . It was evident that , although the sporting season had nearly reached its termination , there was yet no danger of starvation . A fowling piece and shot pouch lay in the neighborhood , accompanied , singularly enough , by a musical instrument resembling the modern guitar . A fair faced youth , apparently of some eighteen or nineteen years of age , sat by himself , near the closed door of the cottage , mending a fishing net , two or three of which lay stretched upon the beach to dry , while ever and anon he seemed to relapse into a profound reverie , singing to himself the while , in a low , musical , but rather melancholy tone . The appearance of the youth was striking . A few raven locks escaped from a slouched hat of brown felt , around a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deep violet eyes . A loose , dark jerkin , buttoned to the throat , and confined around his slender waist with a gay colored shawl , with nether garments of the same sombre hue , completed his equipment . He seemed to be mechanically pursuing his task , interrupting his plaintive song occasionally to gaze with an air of abstraction upon the scene around him . It was a lovely solitude . That iced sirocco , the north-east wind , had paused , and the vast , skeleton trees showed throughout their leafless tracery the influence of the genial warmth . The red flowering maples blushed with blossoms , the birches were decked in their fragrant tassels , and even from the sullen giants of the forest , the white and black oaks , swung the small pendulous crimson flowers . The youth looked wistfully out upon the ocean , when he was suddenly startled by the report of a gun . He sprang to his feet , threw down his net , and grasped eagerly the firearm which lay near him upon the ground . The clumsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , seemed altogether too unwieldy for the slender boy , but he handled it with adroitness , and his dark blue eye flashed in rapid glances to every side of the forest , and then out upon the bay , in quest of apprehended danger . The sound seemed to have proceeded from the deep thickets on the edge of the promontory of Tisquantum , and presently there was another report seeming to come from the island opposite , at that time the abode of the Scotchman , David Thompson , from whom it derives its name . The boy ran down to the beach , and strained his eyes eagerly out upon the ocean . At last he saw very plainly the white sail of a small boat between the island and the main , approaching rapidly towards him . A dark object rose and fell upon the surface of the water some hundred yards in front of the skiff , and as they drew nearer the boy relaxed his grasp of the musket , and leaned leisurely upon it , while he contemplated the scene . A large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but hotly pursued by the boat . It was obvious that the first shot which the youth had heard , had been fired from the thicket , and that the animal having been near the edge of the promontory , had taken to the water with the intention of gaining the opposite island . He had evidently been received , as he approached the shore , by another enemy , who had fired unsuccessfully , but caused him to relinquish his attempt at landing . He was now making directly for the cove , and was gaining perceptibly upon the boat , which contained four persons . It would have been easy for the lad , hidden as he was , to have destroyed him as he approached , but the gentle youth seemed to be no sportsman , and on the contrary , to be gazing with an intense interest upon the animal 's struggles for life . The magnificent creature renewed his efforts , the crest of the waves broken already as the water grew shoaler , dashed in his large face and over his splendid antlers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few rapid bounds , and his foot would touch the beach . Nearer and nearer he struggled , when suddenly , with an inexplicable impulse , he doubled upon his pursuers . The cause was explained in a moment , as a second sail floated round the other headland . Still unhurt , but bewildered , he turned madly round , and dashed straight as an arrow at the first boat . The sportsman , calm as a clock , took aim at the animal 's head . The deer dashed onward , rushing desperately upon his fate , when , instead of the expected report , a light click of the lock told that at the critical moment the firearm , wet with spray , had hung its fire . The moose struggled slowly by , fairly worried and exhausted by the chase , while the boatmen threw a cord rapidly around his antlers , and in spite of his furious struggles at last captured him alive . Both the little skiffs were now near the cove . The youth had returned to his seat near the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase , and had listlessly resumed his occupation . In a few moments the keel of the first boat grated upon the pebbly beach , and the commander sprang on shore . " Well shot , " cried he , turning to the solitary occupant of the second , who had already furled his sail and was making fast his little cable to the gnarled trunk of an ancient oak . " Well shot , jolly smith of Mishawum , " cried he , " for I should have been sorry had you taken better aim , and deprived me of my lawful honors . Say what you will , ' t is no easy matter to hit a plunging devil of a moose , with nothing better than the top of a wave for your rest . " The moose had in the mean time been dragged upon the beach by two savages and an Englishman , all of whom appeared to be subordinates of the speaker . The animal , which was of gigantic stature , more than twenty hands high , with a short body , long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , adorned with magnificent antlers , struggled but faintly with his captors , and , exhausted with his exertions , submitted to be thrown very summarily upon the ground with his legs tied together , while his large , pathetic eye seemed mutely to deprecate his fate . Robert Bootefish was a short , squat looking individual of fifty , with a pudding face , in which a pair of twinkling eyes were almost extinguished by his shaggy brows , while a copper-colored nose , pierced like a flaming beacon , through a fog of greyish yellow beard , which smothered all the other glories of his physiognomy . He was attired in a coarse doublet and hose of bright crimson , which , with his long crooked arms , and short legs , gave him something of the look of a boiled lobster . This worthy seated himself upon a stone , at the head of the prostrate prisoner , amusing himself in an infantine and guileless manner by tickling the victim 's nose with the point of his long hunting knife . His master , in the mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just stepped upon the beach . " Well , Master Walford , " he cried , " a sight of you is as rare as the sight of the sun in this perverse New England April . What brought you to the cove ? " " My skiff , " returned the other , sententiously . " See what it is to live by oneself in the forest . Your skiff brought your tongue , as well as yourself , I suppose ; or is it still frozen up , like a dead reindeer 's , with the rest of your winter provisions , at Mishawum ? " " To say the truth , Master Morton , " said the smith , " I only floated down with the tide to look in upon Sir Christopher , this morning , to see if he had returned from his expedition to the psalm singers . If I had not met you and your moose by the way , perhaps I should have extended my voyage as far as the Merry Mountain , as you call it . " " Come when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried the other ; " with your tongue , or without it  --  you shall always be welcome . We will rub off the rust from it I warrant you . You shall find it run more glibly when oiled with a drop of right rosa solis . And that reminds me , " said he , interrupting himself , while he filled a little tin can from a hunting flask in his pouch , and presented it to his companion  --  " Drink a drop of his own nectar to salute the orb of day ; ' t is not often that you have seen the one or the other of late . " The smith , nothing loth , pledged his jovial companion , who continued , as he refilled the cup for himself  --  " To our better friendship , Master Walford , and trusting you may find more jolly companions than your friends the wolves , ere another spring cuts our throats with her double-edged east winds . But I wrong you sweet south-western zephyrs , breathing upon me so wooingly , " cried he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected ecstasy . " Frigora mitescunt Zephyris  --  ver proterit stas , ' as our friend Horatius Flaccus hath it ;  --  ah ! I beg your pardon , you have no acquaintance with Horatius Flaccus . " " Never met the gentleman in my life , " returned the smith ; " but a Pokanoket I should think , by his language . I never could make head or tail of their lingo in my life . " " A Pokanoket ! Hear him not , shade of the laurelled bard of soft Venusia ! A Pokanoket ! a Roman  --  thou eremite Vulcan ! A Roman , thou two-fold anchorite , in that thou art both solitary and a forger of anchors ! " " And good anchors too ; aye , and picks and spades ; no better in all New England , Master Morton , " cried the burly smith , somewhat nettled at this storm of hard names , which his classical companion was rattling like hail upon his head . " Shall I slit his weasand , your worship , " said the contemplative Bootefish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who still remained in his reposing attitude by the side of his prisoner . " It would make him comfortable , I think . He seems impatient to have it done . His eye says , as plain as mortal tongue could speak , Robert Bootefish , no more words , but slit my wizen and have done with it . " ' " Slit his weasand ! if you do I 'll slit your nose , " cried Morton ; " and yet that pure and perfect carbuncle should remain , an indivisible gem forever . But stay ! The blessings of Flora upon your head  --  the softest plume from the wing of Zephyrus for your velvet cheek . " These latter invocations were not showered by the classical Morton , as it might seem , upon the head and velvet cheek of his henchman Bootefish , but were intended solely for the benefit of the slender youth , who , finding the party holding , as it were , a court martial upon their sylvan prisoner , had advanced towards them to advocate his cause . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Master Walford . I have been waiting impatiently for you to find the way from the beach to the cottage , but you have apparently found matter more important . " " Your knightly cousin , Sir Christopher , is he returned from our Puritanical friends of the nether bay ? " asked Morton , as he took off his cap and made a fantastic , half jocular salute to the stripling . " Sir Christopher has not yet found his way back , " answered the youth , " but I think the first shot fired was from his gun . I think I should know its crack among a thousand , though I suppose you will hold that a foolish fancy . At any rate , I claim the game as lawful prize . " " ' T is yours before you ask it . " " Then , thus do I take possession of my prize ; " and with this the youth bounded forward and snatched the knife from the hands of Bootefish . That worthy individual looked on with profound astonishment , while the lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner , and then clapped his hands , and uttered a musical halloo , as the animal , freed from his bondage , sprang to his feet , tossed his branched head high in air , and with a mighty bound disappeared in the thick recesses of the forest . " You are quite right , Signor Jaspar , " said Morton ; " I assure you that no true lover of the gentle craft but would have done as you have done . ' T is murder to shoot a buck so out of season . " " And I am ashamed that the worshipful Master Morton , Lord of Misrule and Sachem of Merry-Mount , should have been obliged to receive a rebuke from one wholly a tyro in the science , " answered Jaspar  --  stay ; I hear a footstep in the thicket . " And with the graceful bound of a panther , he flew towards the wood . CHAPTER II . THE LORD OF MERRY-MOUNT . During Jaspar 's absence , the others seated themselves composedly upon the rocks near the shore . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , and might have numbered some forty years . His features were regular , his hazel eye was large and laughing , his complexion fair but sunburned , his hair and beard auburn . His mustachios were curled upwards , and his long love locks were arranged with the coquetry of a man , who , even in the wilderness , seemed to value the graces of his person . His well knit figure was arrayed in a buff colored jerkin , with slashed sleeves , buttoned to the throat , and surmounted with a linen ruff . Dark colored trunk hose and boots of tawny leather completed his dress . In his girdle he wore a long sheathed knife , with his other hunting accoutrements , and in the hollow of his arm the fowling piece which had been so merciful to the departed moose . His companion , Thomas Walford , was a big , burly fellow , somewhat younger than himself , considerably more than six feet in height , with a swart complexion and harsh features , which were redeemed by a frank and manly expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leggings of deerskin , and in his whole appearance presented a marked contrast to his friend . Thomas Morton , who was a prominent actor in the veritable history which I have to relate , was a gentleman by birth and education . His father , an officer in the English army , had served with some distinction in the auxiliary legions under the banner of Henry of Navarre , and losing his life on the plains of Normandy , had bequeathed a small patrimony to his son . The youth had , after a careful and classical preliminary education , entered himself at Clifford 's Inn , and after completing his studies had been called to the bar . Here he might have prospered , and for aught we know have risen to be Lord Keeper , if , as he facetiously expressed it , he had been blessed with the faculty of keeping any thing  --  or rather , he would add , if he had not been addicted to keeping too much . He kept horses , hounds , and hawks , every thing in short , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but brief . His patrimony was soon exhausted . His creditors became impatient . Endowed with a teeming imagination , a sanguine temperament , and a vigorous constitution , he was suddenly inflamed with the desire of making a bold dash at fortune in the El Dorado of the west . The adventures of Raleigh , the romantic achievements of that poetical captain with the prosaic name of John Smith , all the accounts brought by hundreds of nameless voyagers to the new world , captivated his fancy . To a man beset by Jews at home , the Gentiles of the wilderness had no terrors . He had but few guineas left to sow , and he found England growing barren and fallow . He determined to transplant himself for a season into a new atmosphere and a new soil . Bright visions fluttered like golden singing birds around his midnight pillow . It was the fever of the age . It is difficult to realize the infatuation of certain classes of men at that day . The chimeras which were rampant in that century have been destroyed . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feudal sovereignties , palatinates , bishoprics , manorial lordships , with all the tinsel and glittering circumstance which are getting to be but threadbare patchwork even in olden countries , have left hardly a rag upon a bush in the western wilderness . When Beauchamp Plantagenet , of Belvil , in New Albion or New England , Esquire , published his letters " to his suzerain lord , the right honorable and mighty Lord Edmond , by Divine Providence lord proprietor , earl palatine , governor and captain-general of the Province of New Albion , " and gave the most minute directions towards planting and establishing a magnificient piece of secondhand feudality in the wilderness , he did not seem a whit ridiculous . Neither Beauchamp Plantagenet nor Thomas Morton were ridiculous , because they misapprehended the character of the movement which was setting towards America . They were wrong , and Thomas Morton suffered for his misapprehension of time , place , and circumstance , but these dreams spun their cobweb meshes around many vivid brains . Morton grew tired of Clifford 's Inn , the charms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassed him . His mistresses and his friends went off with each other , leaving him to muse upon the instability of love and friendship . An unlucky duel , in which he was so unfortunate as desperately to wound an antagonist , whose friends were more powerful than his sword , came to add to his difficulties . He saw himself plunging from one scrape to another , with no hope of extrication . And so , rapidly converting all that was left of his patrimony into money , he suddenly embarked for America , some half dozen years before the period at which we have presented him to the reader . He had at first found himself in Virginia ; thence he had wandered in a northerly direction  --  had visited and quarrelled with the colonists of New Plymouth  --  had been with Mr. Weston 's colony at Wessaguscus  --  with Captain Gorges  --  and afterwards with Captain Wollaston , at Mount Wollaston . Wollaston , who was a man of station , had engaged with him , in his undertaking , a few adventurers of his own rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a large number of persons bound to servitude , after the manner of the day , besides artificers , mechanics and agriculturists , sufficient in his estimation to establish a colony upon a large scale . It is needless to say that religion had no part in this movement ; and it is a striking fact , that of the many colonies attempted in Massachusetts , none succeeded except those which were planned and supported by religious enthusiasm . Mr. Weston 's colony had dissolved within a year from its origination . Captain Wollaston , who had planted himself very near his predecessors , in the neighborhood of the hill which still perpetuates his name , and who had been joined by the stragglers still remaining from previous settlements in the vicinity , found himself at the head of a disorderly and somewhat unmanageable crew , and becoming discouraged , soon retired to Virginia , taking with him a portion of his servants . The others remained under the nominal jurisdiction of one Filcher , whom he had appointed as his lieutenant , for the express purpose of conducting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius . Possessing a certain share in the adventure , he determined to make himself master of the whole colony . Inflaming the colonists with artful speeches , in which he warned them that they were about to be transported to Virginia , to be sold as slaves , and held out to them alluring prospects of wealth and good living if they rallied under his dominion , and remained where they were , he easily made them the instruments of his plan . Morton was eloquent , adroit , bold , good-humored , and luxurious and loose in his habits and principles . The motley troop of adventurers desired nothing better than to serve such a commander . They therefore exchanged their servitude to Captain Wollaston for a nondescript vassalage to Esquire Morton . He ruled them absolutely , for they were accustomed to be governed , and he possessed a superiority of intellect , education and character , which soon gave him unbounded dominion over them . His establishment at Mount Wollaston , the name of which , upon his elevation to the sovereignty , he had changed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the straggling survivors of the different trading plantations which had been begun and abandoned during the previous few years . But while he seemed only bent upon the accumulation of wealth , by means principally of the beaver trade and of the fisheries , which he proposed to establish ; and while his days were passed at Merry-Mount in a round of hunting and carousing ; he in fact , in company with some other kindred spirits , was nourishing still bolder and more subtle schemes . Among the original and most ardent encouragers of plantations in America , was a certain Sir Ferdinando Gorges , at that time Governor of Plymouth in old England . He was a knight of ancient family and large possessions , a devoted royalist , a bigot for church and state , and an ardent believer in the possibility of establishing vast and flourishing manorial and proprietary colonies in America , and particularly in New England . He had already expended large sums in attempts at colonization , the only fruit of which , then apparent , was an infant colony at Piscataqua , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whither David Thompson , a Scottish gentleman of education , had been sent as governor , some years previously to the period in which our story opens . Thompson , however , not fascinated by the savage charms of Sagadehock , had soon retired from his satrapcy and established himself upon the island which still bears his name . Not only Morton , Gardiner , Thompson , of Thompson 's Island , and Walford , but still other inhabitants of Massachusetts , of widely differing characters and pursuits , seemed united in some common purpose , and bound by a secret tie to Sir Ferdinando . To the Plymouth brethren , Morton was a thorn which they endeavored incessantly to pluck out and cast from them . His whole existence seemed to them an insult , so utterly were his character and principles opposed to their own , while at the same time their uneasiness seemed to have a deeper cause . His manner of dealing with the Indians , also , gave the Puritans great annoyance . Fully impressed with that grand characteristic of most Englishmen , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a frank and cheerful contempt , which was not without its philosophy . Where two nations are mixed together , he would say , one or the other must rule . He therefore assumed , at starting , a careless , graceful superiority , which rather astonished the natives , but in the end convinced them that he was a great sachem , whom they ought willingly to obey . He was never deluded into any enthusiasm for savage dignity or poetry , but found the Rising Moon , the Floating Cloud of the North-west , and the indomitable Buffalo , all very useful fellows to supply him with beaver and deerskins , and rewarded them according to their activity in his service , without any regard to the splendor of their lineage , or their private exploits of heroism . The Indians , in the vicinity of Morton 's residence , were peaceable in the main , well disposed towards the English , and more afraid of the encroachments of the Tarentines of the East , and the Pequods of the West , than of the pale-faced strangers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings . Morton took the best advantage of this disposition . He taught a few of them the use of fire-arms . But a still more potent agent in his scheme of dominion , he found in that gigantic engine of mischief which was so destructive to these children of the forest . That wizard power , like the genie of the Arabian fisherman , was imprisoned in a bottle . By these means Morton had extended his system of semi-vassalage from his white subordinates over the Indians also . His horizon opened as he advanced . He was already grown to be a man of power and consequence . The Indians brought him in great store of beaver , and he began to think himself likely to realize a colossal fortune at last in this most lucrative trade . His more extensive plans of dominion were associated with those of the Knight of Devonshire . The other personage , Thomas Walford , was a bold blacksmith , who like Morton had originally emigrated to Virginia , but , becoming dissatisfied , had dwelt awhile with Weston 's people . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck out a pathway through the wilderness , and at the period when the reader makes his acquaintance he had seated himself at Mishawum . Upon the narrow peninsula between Mystic and Charles rivers , and directly opposite to the triple-headed promontory of Shawmut , the burly blacksmith built himself a thatched house , which he surrounded with a palisade to keep out the wolves and Indians . There he lived with his old woman , as he affectionately termed the bride who had followed his fortunes from the mother country , snapping his fingers at the Puritans , whom , like an orthodox Episcopalian as he was , he looked upon with aversion ; and occasionally visiting his allies , the lord of Merry-Mount , the sachem of Squantum , and the man of mystery , at whose residence we found him at the beginning of the chapter , the impenetrable Sir Christopher Gardiner . His land at Mishawum was held by a grant from the Gorges family . He was , like Morton , an object of suspicion to the brethren at Plymouth , and was moreover a stumbling-block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new and large colony in Massachusetts Bay . The grant of the New England council to Gorges of thirty miles of land in length , and ten in breadth , on the north-eastern side of Massachusetts Bay , although loosely worded , was an awkward and stubborn fact not to be circumvented , and , like his own sledge-hammer , not likely to lose any of its weight in the hands of Walford . See Note I. CHAPTER III . THE KNIGHT OF THE SEPULCHRE . Walford and Morton had remained composedly upon the beach for a few moments , when Jaspar reappeared , leaning affectionately upon the arm of an individual of striking appearance . He was tall and thin , and wore a steeple-crowned hat , a short black cloak , with a white band about his throat , and other habiliments , of the sad color most cherished by the Puritans . He threw off his hat , however , as he approached , looking at it as he did so , with an expression of any thing but respect , and displaying , upon being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of that rare character with which time seems powerless . It was impossible from his face , any more than from his spare but sinewy figure , and the Arab litheness of his movements , to guess at the number of years which had flown over him , without leaving a trace of their passage . Thick , Antinous-like curls hung in raven masses about a dark and thoughtful brow ,  --  an eye , dark and commanding , but whose mysterious and changeful expression inevitably inspired the beholder with a sentiment both of interest and distrust , a complexion by nature or by exposure more swarthy than belongs to his race , severely chiselled features , and teeth glittering like a hound 's through his coal black beard , were the characteristics of his countenance . It was certain that he had " past through the ambush of young days , " but how far it was impossible to judge . Such was the individual whom men called Sir Christopher Gardiner . The boy was hanging upon his arm and looking fondly up into his face , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearied with a long tramp through the forest , but whose graceful and dignified activity seemed like his master 's to triumph over fatigue . " Good morrow , Master Merry-Mount , " said he , extending his hand to Morton ; " and good morning to you , worthy hermit of Mishawum , I am sorry that my absence should have lost me any portion of your visit to my humble abode . And how are the revellers of Passanogessit , Master Morton ? Have a care , the shaven heads of Plymouth are keeping a sharp watch upon you . ' T is a pity you could not borrow a little of the caution of our phlegmatic friend here , worthy Tom Walford . " " To say the truth , Sir Christopher , " answered Morton , " I have long since exhausted my talent at borrowing , and I doubt if I could thrive much even upon any advance from our friend St. Thomas the silentiary . His silence and his sledge-hammer are both very useful tools to himself , whose only companions are his wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodwife Walford ; but we must all work with the implements of our trade , you know , and I must keep my tongue whetted , or my brains will rust with it . " " I repeat my warning , " answered Gardiner , " that all our pains will be fruitless , if you are not disposed to govern yourself and your confederates a little more rigidly . I tell you , man , that there is great uneasiness at Plymouth . " " But they certainly are not aware that your humble servant , and their particular nightmare , Thomas Morton , the pettifogger of Clifford 's Inn , ' ( as they call the most rising young barrister who ever turned his back upon the woolsack , ) has the honor of your acquaintance . " " Certainly not , " answered Gardiner , " you may be sure that the mention of your name always inspires me with holy horror . They have no suspicion that the pious Gardiner , who seeks comfort in the refreshing bosom of their austere church  --  " " Cold comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected shudder . " That such a man as they know me to be , stooping under the burthen of his sins , and anxious only to seat himself by the outer door-post of the Temple of the Elect , can have sympathy or even acquaintance with the Godless Lord of Misrule , the disturber of the peace of Canaan , the din of whose revelry sounds so hideously upon the ears of the saints . " " As if this wide and boundless new world was discovered , " cried Morton , " only that its forests might resound with their eternal trumpets and their shawms . But let them come to Merry-Mount themselves , they shall have better fare than parched corn and ditch water . Let them wet their beards and vinegar faces in our sparkling claret jugs , let them listen to a catch led off by the mellifluous tongue of Robert Bootefish yonder , let them look upon a wild dance of beaver coated nymphs  --  . " " Perhaps they will make you a visit sooner than you think , " interrupted Gardiner , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spleen , lay kicking up his heels upon the grass  --  now humming a snatch of a drinking song , now muttering to himself a quotation from his favorite Horace  --  " perhaps your hospitality may be put sooner to the test than you suppose ; I see you prick up your ears ; take care that you keep them where they belong . The psalm singers have got a pillory , you know , and they are mightily expert at slicing off all superfluous appendages . " " Thank ye , Sir Kit , " replied Morton . " But if my tongue endangers my ears , I have a hand , thank fortune , that shall protect them all . I know their fingers itch for my ears  --  nay , have they not already ornamented their accursed whipping-post with one of the capital excrescences of my loyal subject , Humprey Rednape ? Does he not suffer obloquy enough at the hands of his confederates Bootefish and Cakebread , and all the other unfeeling varlets ? Does not that content them , but would they extend their sacrilegious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merry-Mount ? " " I tell you , Morton , that they are no respecter of persons . They consider you a nuisance , and they long to have you in their power . Your ears are not worth a wolf 's bounty , if they once get you into their clutches . " " The sacrilegious iconoclasts ! " cried the imperturbable Morton . " Verily they carry their hatred of ornaments too far . Are not these distracted Puritans satisfied with having abolished copes and tippets and corner caps , that they rage so carnally even against such trifling ornaments as your humble servant 's ears ? Truly their love of simplicity is unbecoming . Their hatred of ceremony carries them too far . " " You will find they will use little ceremony if they once proceed to extremities with you . " " But I tell thee , Sir Kit , they shall have nothing to do with my extremities . I will neither lend mine ears to their counsels , nor make a present of them to their pillories . Hang them , let them trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purify Canaan ,  --  but , by Plutus and Rhadamanthus , let them beware of entering the precincts of Merry-Mount ! My Cerberus never sleeps on his post , and a single growl of his would frighten them back to their dingy kennels , aye , even if they were led on by the valorous Captain Shrimp himself . " " If you speak of Captain Standish , " interposed the phlegmatic Walford , who had hitherto taken but little part in the conversation , " if you speak of Captain Standish , mayhap you may find him no baby , small as he is . He carries a two-fisted rapier , would split your skull as easy as I could crack a cocoanut with my sledge-hammer , and he wears an iron pot on his head  --  I know it , for I have had the tinkering of the same  --  would take a swinging thump as easy as my anvil , and never the worse . " " Vulcan , Vulcan , " replied the unabashed Morton , " your remarks are unsavory  --  they smell of the shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let little Captain Shrimp not venture to Merry-Mount . He shall find no Wittewamotts nor Pecksuots , I promise you  --  he shall be boiled in his own iron pot , boiled , aye , and eaten too as sauce to my salmon , the pungent little shrimp . " " Mayhap you may find him a bit too peppery for your taste , " answered the honest blacksmith . " And I have a mind , " interposed Sir Christopher , " that better things may be done with Captain Standish , or Captain Shrimp , as you call him , than eating him . I have had no interview with him yet , but such an ally as he would be invaluable  --  at all events , I agree in the warning of our honest Walford here . Be cautious , keep quiet for the present , do n't stir up these grim fellows before the time . " " Trust me for defending my strong hold , " answered Morton , more seriously . " Trust me for keeping , for the present , out of the clutches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , " said the blunt blacksmith ; " you 'll find the hug of a bear as soft as a young maid 's arms in comparison . But Sir Christopher has not yet informed us when he left Plymouth , nor how he travelled thence . " " I preferred , as you know , to travel by land and on foot , " said Sir Christopher . " The post-roads being much out of repair , " interrupted the facetious Morton . " I have been sojourning a week among the saints , " continued Gardiner , " leaving Jaspar and the faithful Sketwarroes to keep house in my absence . I am still an humble candidate for admission to their sanctuary , but I have ventured to broach but little of our scheme of transplanting their colony to Shawmut . Besides , I am still waiting for dispatches from Sir Ferdinando in reply to my last letters . " " As for the Indians , " continued Gardiner , musingly , " they are the best friends we have  --  I mean in any considerable numbers of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have as much reliance on a savage 's sagacity and friendship as on a white man 's . They are easily led , if you make them look up to you as a protector and a God . " " And I will say , " said Morton , " of my own knowledge , that they are better fellows , and will make better Christians , than the Puritans . Have I not converted more of the heathen , every year , by reading the liturgy to them , than the saints will convert in a century ? " " Say , rather , perverted , " said Gardiner . " I say , " continued Morton , warmly , " that my savage subjects are rapidly becoming as civilized and as respectable a body of rascals as my Christian ones . " " And no such difficult matter either , " said the blunt blacksmith , " if a body may judge from that lobster Bootefish , yonder . " " Bootefish  --  Bootefish ! " cried Morton , in so loud a tone as to arouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been enjoying in the sunshine during this protracted conversation . " I say , Robin , " he continued , with affected indignation , as the red faced and red coated worthy advanced , stretching his long arms and his bandy legs to shake off his lethargy ; " this mechanical son of Jupiter has the audacity to call you a lobster , and moreover denies that you are a Christian ; what do you think of that ? " " Son of Jupiter , your worship  --  Christian , your worship ! " exclaimed Bootefish , his brain evidently laboring to take in at one effort the incongruous images suddenly presented to him , and his small elephant eyes drowsily rolling from one of his companions to the other ; " I hope I despise Christians  --  I mean Puritans  --  as a Christian Episcopalian should . Down with the Puritans ! down with the lobsters ! at any rate , your worship , " grumbled the veteran , now thoroughly awake . " Tell Master Walford that if I am a lobster he had better keep out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morton . " Let me echo his warning , Master Vulcan , in fair payment for the one you gave me just now . A lobster is as dangerous as a shrimp , you may find ; aye , and wears as good a coat of mail to his back . " And so the sovereign of Merry-Mount , who was never so happy as when he could quibble upon the redoubtable Miles Standish , the hero of Plymouth , to whom he had an invincible dislike , rubbed his hands triumphantly , as he looked at the blacksmith . That gigantic individual looked down with the most benignant expression at the ludicrous indignation of Bootefish , without troubling himself much about the claws to which he alluded in so threatening a manner . " This is one of your instruments for turning savages into Christians , then , I suppose , " said he to Morton . " Christians , I defy you ! " said the indignant Robert ; " I am head clerk and precentor at Merry-Mount , Master Walford , I would have you to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to be looked down upon by a blacksmith . Who sets all the psalms at Merry-Mount , I should like to know , but Robert Bootefish ? Who makes the responses , I humbly ask , but Bootefish again ? Who taps all the ale casks but Bootefish ? " And Robert Bootefish , concluding his observations , smote his breast , and looked daggers at the undisturbed blacksmith . " Well , well , lobster ! " said he , not heeding the frown which gathered like a cloud around the shaggy brows of the clerk of Merry-Mount at the repetition of the offensive epithet . " Well , well , " said he , innocently continuing his bantering , " I dare to say , you will redden even the noses of the red men with your liquor . As for your psalms and responses , I have n't much more faith in such forms than the Puritans themselves , if your church and cellar be all one , as it seems . Tell the poor devils of savages to follow your nose to heaven . ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never quenched ! " Bootefish 's wrath was thoroughly aroused . His nose , which might be said to be his only feature , flashed with indignation . Plucking his knife from his sheath , he rushed , as furiously as his duck legs would carry him , towards his provoking antagonist . The phlegmatic blacksmith , even at that moment hardly aware that his victim was really out of temper , looked for a few seconds in utter astonishment at his ferocious onset , jumped back with agility , in time to escape with only a wound on his gigantic thumb , from a furious blow aimed at him with the hunting knife ; and then , rushing forward with the ponderous velocity of a bull , seized his squat assailant in his iron grasp , lifted him bodily from the ground , pitched him heels over head some half a dozen yards through the air , and then , recovering his composure , looked tranquilly on , as the unfortunate head butler , after describing his parabola through the air , alighted in a most undignified posture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the facetious Morton called his serfs , it will be remembered were the oarsmen of his boat , and had been gravely squatting upon their hams and smoking their pipes on the same spot , and in the same attitude , ever since their arrival . Upon the sudden descent of the luckless Bootefish between them , one of them assisted him to his feet , while the other , with unperturbed visage , took his pipe from his mouth and ejaculated , " Ugh , is my brother hurt ? " and without pausing for a reply , he grunted  --  " The Thunder-cloud of Mishawum is strong ; my brother is fat ; he can not wrestle with the Thunder-cloud of Mishawum . " " Thunder-cloud be damned ! " muttered the pious precentor of Merry-Mount , who , finding himself unhurt , although marvellously discomfitted , thought it necessary , on being picked up and set on his legs again , to manifest a show of hostility , although taking care to keep at a convenient distance from the stalwart smith . " The Thunder-cloud of Mishawum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass as it did , else I would have stuck him like a pig . " Morton , who had been enjoying the scene amazingly , while Gardiner , hardly heeding what was going forward , had been conversing in an under tone with Jaspar , now stepped forward and addressed the brooding Bootefish . " Faith , thy hand is out at wrestling , Robin , " said he . " Where is thy boasted Indian hug , of which we hear so much when there are no Indians , nor bears , nor blacksmiths , to practise it upon ? Never did I see a man fly through the air so buoyantly . Ddaleo ocyor Icaro . ' By my soul , the blacksmith has given thee wings , man . " " Never you mind , never you mind , your worship , " muttered his satellite , in a gloomy and threatening manner ; " the time will come . Revenge I will have , as sure as he lives . The man who injures Bootefish never went unpunished yet . " " Tush , tush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make such a pother about a tumble on the green sward . Never nourish ill blood , man ; ' t will only make your nose redder , and the blacksmith 's jibes still saucier . Shake hands , and be friends with him again . " " Aye , " said the hearty blacksmith , proffering his mighty hand , " shake hands and be friends again , Robin Bootefish . Give us thy claw , hang me  --  give us thy fist , man . A body must defend his bread basket , you know . " " Does he withdraw the lobster ? " asked Bootefish , in a stately manner . " He does , he does , every claw of him , " answered Morton . " And if not , what is a lobster , but a church dignitary  --  a redrobed cardinal ? So make haste , for I am in a hurry to be off ; and a quarrel between two such trusty friends of mine I could never endure . So , I say , make haste  --  kiss , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proffered hand of his late antagonist with such cordiality , that it might have been thought he intended to have literally obeyed the injunction of his superior . The blacksmith , however , apparently not desirous of the actual osculation he contemplated , kept him at metaphorical distance , and shaking his hand with an honest effusion of friendship , bade him forgive and forget , with a good-humored expression of countenance , which was reflected back in a sunny glow from the face of the chief butler . " You propose visiting Master Blaxton , you say . If you do so , please convey this packet to him , " said the knight , extending a carefully sealed paper to the blacksmith . " Willingly , Sir Christopher . It is about the turn of the tide now , and I may as well take the parson on my way homeward . Good day , my masters all  --  and good day , worthy Bootefish . No malice now , I suppose ? " " None , Goodman Walford , " said the pacified lobster , waving both his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat was soon tossing upon the tide , and his sail had disappeared behind the headlands of the cove , when Gardiner observed to Morton ,  --  " A sinewy fellow , that Walford , and as tough and as true as his own sledge-hammer . With a hundred or two of such giants , one might conquer a world . If Standish were but upon our side ,  --  . " " I tell you , you might as well expect to turn yonder river backwards , and make it flow to its fountain again . There is no turning nor twisting that sturdy little shrimp . I will say that of him , small as is the love I bear him , " answered Morton . " It has been a fixed notion with Sir Ferdinando , " said Gardiner , " that the Plymouth company , who have already been much indebted to his exertions , might be induced to transplant themselves to a position which they acknowledge to be vastly more attractive , and to settle under his jurisdiction . This would be an immense advantage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent upon outwitting him , and upon sending another and a powerful colony to these parts , might be foiled . Let but his charter and his commission pass the seals , with a flourishing colony already established , in a most admirable position , as a nucleus , and with the reinforcements that Sir Ferdinando and his powerful and wealthy kinsmen ( to say nothing of Mason and Lord Arundel ) have promised , and leave the rest to me . " " But Southcote and Rosewell , and the Vassalls , and Saltonstalls , have an amazing influence ; and more potent than all , are Mr. Humphrey and Isaac Johnson , the brothers-in-law of the powerful Earl of Lincoln . ' T is said that they actually contemplate removing hither themselves ; and that Lady Arabella and Lady Susan are fanatical enough to follow their husbands into the wilderness , " said Morton . " Aye , " replied Gardiner , " but Lord Lincoln 's influence is not so certain . " " At all events , " said Morton , " the old Gorges patent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Clifford 's Inn long enough to know that . " " Yes , " replied the other , " and it furnishes moreover , added to actual possession , a sufficient ground for enlarging it . Trust me , we shall yet outwit the Puritans , and if they settle at all , they shall settle under us . Give me but men , money , and a little time , and trust me , I will build a colony such as the world has never seen . A powerful metropolis in the bottom of this bay , and flourishing commercial towns at Mishawum and Naumkeak , to say nothing of your Passanogessit , extensive fisheries , and an exclusive trade with the Indians , a strong proprietary government , a new order of nobility , a peasantry with a bountiful soil , and a strong government to protect them  --  these seem but dreams , but they are visions which shall be history , before many years have rolled over our heads . The Lord Palatine of Massachusetts will soon hold his head high at home . Aye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with flashing eyes , " that the worm which they thought to tread out of existence shall turn upon them yet  --  the serpent is not crushed  --  and they shall find his fangs have grown . " Morton , who was apparently accustomed to these occasional ebullitions of passion from Gardiner , although he was not perhaps thoroughly aware of all their causes , waited coolly till his companion was more composed , when he observed ,  --  " Your future Majesty of Massachusetts will not forget the claims of your faithful ally and prime minister . Remember the services of a jurisconsult , and more particularly of one familiar with the codes of the conquered nations , will be invaluable in our nascent empire . " " I never forget friend or foe , " said Gardiner , " and you are a tried and trusty friend . I would to God you were a little more cautious one . By the way , " added he , " is Harry Maudsley still dwelling at Merry-Mount ? " " He is , " said Morton ; " but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moody , sometimes , and passionate  --  and at other times gay , and as full of reckless fun as the best , or worst of us . I sometimes hardly know what to think of the lad . " " Maudsley is dangerous , " said Gardiner , " and I will tell you moreover , whatever he seems , that he has a purpose here in this wilderness , sometimes he seems to me inclined to fanaticism , and yet I hardly know , there is something about him I should like to fathom . " " Why , do you know him so well ? " asked Morton , " I hardly thought you were acquainted with the lad . Have you known him in England ? " " I know what I know , " said Sir Christopher in a gloomy voice , with a scowl darkening his brow  --  " I tell you he is dangerous  --  ask me no further . " The sun had by this time past far below the zenith , and thick clouds were rolling themselves in dark and cumulous masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day was rapidly becoming obscured , the sea was black and troubled , and the fickle breath of the sweet south-west had already sighed its last among the leafless oaks around them . " The devil take these assassin spring days , " cried Morton , " smiling hypocritically in your face , and whipping you through the lungs with an east wind , as sharp as your rapier . I had twenty times rather face an honest tempest , with its fog , rain , or snow . A warm friend and a bitter enemy for me . There may be something congenial to a Puritan 's ideas in these days of sanctimonious sunshine , chilled all the while by an east wind as sour as their tempers , and eternal as their sermons , but not to mine , by Jupiter . " " Nor to mine , " said Gardiner abstractedly . " But while I am talking of sunshine , " continued Morton , " the sun is sinking into yonder mass of clouds , and the north-easter is beginning to pipe among the pines  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin Bootefish , get the boat off , and look lively , man , we have no time to lose , if the black snout of yonder grim monster of a cloud , which has already swallowed the sun , is not to open upon and devour us also . So be alive , Robert ! tu , nisi ventis Debes ludibrium , cave , ' which being interpreted , is , stir your fins , O Bootefish , if you would escape a wet jacket . " The worthy precentor , butler , and boatswain , of the eccentric Morton , being thus exhorted , got the boat expeditiously under weigh , with the assistance of his two savage proselytes , and the Lord of Merry-Mount jumped briskly aboard , having shaken hands and warmly bade farewell to his companions . CHAPTER IV . THE LUDLOWS AT NAUMKEAK . The low , flat , narrow tongue of land , formed by two estuaries of the Atlantic , upon which stands at this day the venerable and wealthy city of Salem , had been , until about two years previously to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great and singular mortality , called by some contemporary writers , the plague , which had swept away the Indians so fearfully , at a period just previous to the arrival of the pilgrims at Plymouth , as to prostrate their strength , and to open their territories , as it were , to the footsteps of the white men , had been equally terrible in its devastations along the whole coast , and far into the interior of Massachusetts . Naumkeak , if it had ever been occupied by the Indians , had , at any rate , lost its native population , whether by death or desertion , and was in 1626 a silent and savage wilderness , untenanted save by the wolf and the bear . Among those persons , numerous at that time in England , of good " quality , figure , and estate , " who were disheartened by the movement towards papacy of the English hierarchy under the new reign of Charles I. , was a certain Walter Ludlow . Sprung of an ancient lineage , and inheriting a respectable fortune , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but little interest in affairs , either of church or state . In that age , however , of religious excitement , apathy upon such matters was rare . Religion was the heart and soul of the times . The long smothered fires lighted with torches , snatched from the funeral piles of a thousand martyrs , were at last breaking out with devastating fury throughout the breadth of Europe . The flaming sword of God seemed , in the eyes of bigots and enthusiasts , to wave the human race on to battle , and armies of Christians crusading against Christians filled the air with their hostile shouts , and shook the soil of Christendom to its centre . From many a sacked and burning city , smoking like a sacrifice of blood and fire to the savage Deity , whom they worshipped in the name of Jesus of Nazareth , arose the wail of outraged women  --  the shrieks of butchered age or helpless infancy , mingled with the roar of cannon , the yells of triumph , the curses of the dying  --  a confused and hideous din @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . In such an age , to be indifferent in religious matters was difficult . It was almost impossible to avoid being a bigot , or enthusiast , or , what was most usual , both . Walter Ludlow , whose soul was first awakened to deep religious contemplation , upon the death of the wife of his youth , who was taken from him , after they had laid their two children in the grave , became converted to the principles of Puritanism during a brief and accidental visit made by him at Leyden . Ludlow was naturally a man of a melancholy and enthusiastic character , to which his domestic affliction , and his subsequent religious conversion , had imparted a deeper and a sterner tinge . He despaired of seeing the day-star of a brighter morning ever rise upon the land , and his thoughts turned to the wilderness . With his young and beautiful sister , the only person near of kin to him , who had been his sole companion at his desolate fire-side , who had been willing to share his sorrow , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastically sympathized in his despondency as to the prospects of their religion , he had at last embarked for New England . Belonging to no particular religious association , he had at first visited and sojourned awhile at the infant colony of Plymouth , but , from a variety of reasons , not being satisfied with his residence there , he had removed not a great while before the period of our tale to the neighborhood of Naumkeak , to which place the scanty remnant of the Cape Ann colony had removed . It was a few days after the events recorded in the last chapter , that Walter Ludlow and his sister Esther were wandering upon the wild and wooded peninsula , near which they had established their temporary home . " This chill breath from the sea , these gloomy and leafless forests , this silent solitude which enwraps us as with a mighty funeral pall , " said Ludlow , " are but a sad exchange for the soft airs and the opening blossoms of your old home , Esther . I fear you will bitterly repent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom God hath stricken , and sent into the wilderness to die . " " Alas ! " said Esther , " if the returning spring could but warm the freezing current of your heart ; if but a few faded flowers could but revive again , which in old and happy times blossomed about your pathway , I should regret nothing , not even the garden flowers of England . Say rather that I should regret only for your sake , that we have taken the pilgrim 's staff and scrip  --  for indeed you should have a bolder , or at least a more elastic and hopeful heart , to struggle among the heathen in this land of dark shadows . " " Your existence was not broken like mine , " said Ludlow , " your future was not like mine , a pathway through eternal snow . Let the broken-hearted and world-weary man wear the cowl of his solitude  --  let him wrap the desert about him even as a garment of sackcloth . But I had forgotten , even thou hast sorrow of thine own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister answered him with a suppressed sigh  --  " No , Walter , " said she , " I have no sorrows , no regrets of mine own . I know to what you allude , but I have cast from my heart an image which strove to impress itself there against my will . A worldling , a scorner of our religion , shall never hold the humblest place in my heart . One , who had dared to mock at my faith , and even to sneer at your melancholy madness and fanaticism , as he termed it , shall never cause me one tear of regret at leaving the land of my fathers . " " Alas ! " said the moralizing Ludlow , " the world , like the sea , engulphs our treasures . Beneath the tossing waters of the world how sink our proudest hopes ! There , sunk forever , lie our joys , our ambition , our love , all the ingots of our heart cast from us in the storm , even as glittering robes , heaps of uncounted gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But think you , Esther , that Maudsley hath already forgotten and forsworn you ? I always thought there was much good in him , and he might have been yet saved even as a brand from the burning . Think you never to behold his face again ? " " Never , " said Esther , sternly conquering an emotion which seemed to have more power over her heart than her spirit . " Never , " said she firmly , " for I have set up my staff forever in this wilderness , and have bade farewell forever to our ancient home , and you surely can not believe that the gay and careless Henry Maudsley , caressed by the world , and loving its caresses , is likely to abandon the pleasures of his youth and station in England , to take up his abode in the deserts of the new world . " " I know not , Esther , Maudsley is of an adventurous disposition , impressionable , wayward , but of a deeper and a stronger nature , I think , than you believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Esther . " But what is he to us ? We have looked our last upon him  --  for believe me , the wilderness is no place for him  --  the ocean rolls between us forever . " The conversation here ended abruptly  --  Ludlow saying that he had papers to examine , turned back to their residence . This was a rude but extensive log-house , which stood on the edge of the forest , surrounded by a small plot of garden ground . In its neighborhood were two smaller buildings of the same character , appropriated to the half dozen bound servants whom Ludlow had brought with him , and the whole precinct was inclosed with a ten foot palisade , formed by unbarked trees driven close together into the earth , presenting an humble but picturesque appearance . Esther sat musing long and deeply upon the rustic seat , formed upon the stump of a gigantic oak , where she had been conversing with her brother . It seemed a strange effect of destiny , that so beautiful a creature , well born , accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often falls to the lot of woman , should thus be seated musing alone in that wild forest . Esther was beautiful . Her features , although distinguished by an extreme purity of outline , possessed great mobility and variety of expression ; her fair hair was smoothed placidly from a forehead , which , as in all classic faces , was rather low , but of madonna-like breadth and pensiveness ; her eyes were long and full , and thoughtful rather than passionate . Her sad-colored garments , of the unadorned simplicity affected by the Puritan women of England , were not unbecoming to a figure slightly exceeding middle height , and possessing the robust , healthful , but eminently feminine development characteristic of English beauty , and heightened her resemblance to those types of virgin grace and purity , the early madonnas , painted by Raphael , while something of Perrugino 's severity still lingered around his pencil . Wearied with her solitary reflections , she at last arose and wandered through the open glade which stretched from the edge of the pine forest near their residence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , and covered with strong coarse grass , springing in wild luxuriance from the virgin soil . She amused herself with gathering a few violets , almost buried in the rank verdure , and sighed as she compared their almost scentless petals with the delicious fragrance of their sister flowers at home . The oaks which studded the waving sea of turf around her , brought to her remembrance the bosky parks and ancestral trees of England , and the early birds of spring , filling the air with their clamorous melody , as they darted from the ground , or made the leafless spray vocal with their love songs , soothed her thoughts , and bore them far away to softer and fondly remembered scenes . She had wandered insensibly farther from her palisaded home than she intended , and was approaching a thickly wooded and swampy forest of maples and birches , in which the glade was terminated , when she was suddenly startled from her reverie , by a low , suppressed noise , which strangely resembled the angry growling of a dog . What was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the verge of the thicket , standing motionless with eyes glaring full upon her , twenty paces from the spot where she stood . The animal was as large as the largest sized dog , and might have been mistaken for one , but for his small erect ears , pointed snout , and long bushy tail , resembling that of a fox . Grisly grey in color , broad breasted , lean paunched , with yellow green eyes flashing savage fire upon her , he sat upon his haunches , motionless , as if carved in stone , and fascinating the lonely girl by his fixed and terrible stare . The American wolf is a ferocious , but comparatively a cowardly animal , and except impelled by famine is slow to attack the human race . The winter had , however , been long and stern , and these savage creatures had often hunted in droves about the neighborhood , preying upon the few domestic animals , which the planters had brought with them , and filling the air at midnight with their howlings . Esther was aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were accustomed to encounter these brutes , single-handed , without fear , and she had often been told that the animal would shrink like a whipped cur from the attack of man . But thus , solitary , and far from help , to be confronted with a ferocious beast of the forest , was a fearful thing for a maiden nurtured all her life in the security of a civilized land . Frozen almost to a statue with terror , with marble cheek , rigid lips , suppressed breath , and eyes almost starting from their sockets , she instinctively , and as if impelled by an irresistible fascination , gazed full into the eyes of her ferocious antagonist . The lion is fabled to crouch submissively at a virgin 's feet , but the wolf who cowers before the strong man was never thought to be generous to the helpless . Was it then the mysterious power of the human eye , which seemed to exert its subtle and unfathomable influence upon that compact mass of savage sinew , bone , and muscle , subjugating the will which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would have driven the brute , with one savage bound , upon its prey ? Could it be fear that kept the monster motionless , crouching , but glaring still with those eyeballs of fire ? Was it all real , or was her fearful foe but a phantom of her heated imagination ? Her brain reeled , the vast and leafless oaks seemed to whirl and dance around her ; the mighty forest , swaying before the rising wind , seemed to rush through the air , sweeping and shifting from earth to heaven , as in the mad and bewildering changes of a dream . The incessant and shrill notes of a thousand singing birds thrilled in her ears like the warning cry of invisible spirits . Every thing seemed to move and change around her ; there was a rushing in her ears , as of a mighty wind , and then all seemed growing black as a funeral pall . She roused herself from the swoon which she felt was coming over her . It was no dream , the woods had ceased to move , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was alone in the wilderness , and there stood the gaunt wolf , with his glittering teeth and fearful stare , motionless and threatening as before . She roused herself at last , and became perfectly calm . She reflected that the beast who shrunk from the conflict with a man , might even cower before the attack of a determined woman . She had a slight branch in her hand , which she had accidentally picked from the ground in her walk  --  a dried , leafless , last year 's shoot , feeble as a rush , and held in the weak hand of a woman . But she had aroused her spirit now ; her heart throbbed high with excitement , and the blood which had been chilled bounded like impetuous fire through her veins . She advanced a step forward , brandishing the weapon above her head , with her eyes flashing full upon her adversary . The wolf sprang to his feet , glared fixedly upon her , but stood motionless as before . He seemed irresolute , whether to advance upon his antagonist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step nearer , her nerves quivering with strange excitement . It was a contest not of strength , but of nerve ; not of muscle , but of spirit . Her foe remained motionless upon his feet . She advanced another step . She was near enough to hear his suppressed breathing . Another , and the wolf with a furious glare opened his armed jaws , and uttered a long , dismal howl , which resounded fearfully through the forest , and struck renewed terror to the heart of the unprotected girl . She paused again , as if paralyzed , and stood unable to advance or to retreat , within ten yards of the ferocious brute , who remained still glaring , and motionless , but seeming less intimidated than enraged . Esther 's strength began to fail her  --  her prayers froze upon her lips  --  her eyes grew dim  --  but , even as they glazed , she saw the wolf springing towards her . Suddenly the bushes of a remote thicket cracked beneath an advancing step ; the report of a firearm rang through the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fell stone dead at her feet . Exhausted by emotion , overwhelmed by the sudden change from imminent and fearful death , to life and safety again , Esther sank insensible upon the ground . The hunter , to whose sure but distant aim her preservation was owing , struggled slowly through the tangled and swampy thicket through which he had plunged to her rescue , when suddenly a tall form , in a short , dark cloak , and steeple-crowned hat , strode down the glade from the opposite quarter , lifted the unconscious maiden in his arms , and bore her towards her residence . That man was Sir Christopher Gardiner . A moment afterwards , a young man , in hunting attire , emerged breathless from the thicket , and stood upon the spot where Esther Ludlow had for a few moments endured such speechless agony , and where , but for his prompt assistance , she must have died a fearful death . The youth was tall and slender , but active and muscular . His chestnut love-locks , long enough to distract the whole congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular features , proclaimed his Anglo Saxon blood , which his bronzed cheek and wild attire might have almost rendered doubtful . Esther was gone , and there was nothing upon the sward save the bleeding carcass of the wolf . The hunter spurned it contemptuously with his foot , and then leaned , lost in thought , upon his fowling-piece . CHAPTER V. THE MISRULE OF MERRY-MOUNT . We must now shift the scene again to Massachusetts Bay ; for Naumkeak , being without the semicircle inclosed between the points Nahant and Nantasco , was not a part of the territory which then bore that denomination . Upon the southern side of the bay , and a little westerly from the mouth of Wessaguscus river , upon which the unsuccessful plantations of Weston and Captain Gorges had been seated , stands Mount Wollaston . It was here that the reader 's acquaintance , Thomas Morton , after the spot had been deserted by the original founder of the settlement , had established his whimsical sovereignty . A miscellaneous collection of settlers , some of them servants of the original proprietors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had crystallized about this point as a common centre . These , with a small number of vagabond , peaceable Indians , the broken remnant of a tribe almost annihilated by the pestilence , and who entertained much the same kind of veneration for their white superior , which the savage caliban did for Stephano and his bottle , composed the rabble rout which the worthy Morton was fond of calling his subjects . Merry-Mount  --  for by that cheerful title , most grating to the ears of the Plymouth people , was the place now designated  --  was as agreeable a place for an exile 's residence as could have been found in the Bay . In the centre of a half moon , the two horns of which curved outward to the sea , forming a broad and sheltered basin , was a singularly shaped , long , elevated mound , rising some fifty feet above the level of the tide . It was a natural knoll of gravel , resembling in its uniformity an artificial embankment ; and although fringed about its base and its sides by white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely bare of wood , and presented a bold front to the sea , which was separated from it only by a narrow strip of marsh . Beyond this cliff , upon the right , as you looked from the hill towards the ocean , was the broad mouth of Wessaguscus river ; upon the left , a slender creek wound its tortuous way , through a considerable extent of salt marsh to the sea . Beyond the creek and the marsh , was a line of prettily indented coast , with the picturesque promontory of Squantum bending sharply towards the ocean , near which , on the landward side , was a large , wooded , island-like hammock , called Massachusetts , or the Arrow Head , the residence , previously to the plague , of Chickatabot , sagamore of the adjacent territory called the Massachusetts Fields . Many gently swelling hills rose , one upon the other , beyond , thickly crowned with white oak , hickory , and ash , whose gigantic , but still leafless tracery , was clearly defined upon the sombre back-ground of the shadowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and completely shut out that peninsula . On the inland side , the eye was delighted with a soft and beautiful panorama . As the region had long been inhabited , at previous epochs , by the Indians , there were many open clearings ; and the underbrush and thicket having been , according to their custom , constantly burned , the tall oaks and chestnuts grew every where in unincumbered magnificence , and decorated a sylvan scene , of rolling hills , wide expanses , and woody dells , more tranquil and less savage than could have been looked for in the wilderness . Seaward , from the Mount , the view was enchanting . Round islands , tufted with ancient trees , and looking like broken links from the chain of hills around , seemed to float far out upon the waves , till they were one beyond another lost in the blue distance ; while a low , but beautifully broken line of coast , fringed the purple expanse of the surrounding ocean , and completed the wilderness picture , fresh from the hand of Nature . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the river on the right , an inlet from the Atlantic in front , and embowered with ancient oaks , stood a very large , rambling , picturesque house , built of the unbarked trunks of colossal trees , squared , and cemented together with clay . Adjacent was a large plot of garden ground , and scattered around , in pretty close proximity , were some twenty smaller log huts , interspersed occasionally with rude Indian wigwams . A space of a dozen acres , including the Mount , was inclosed by a strong palisade , and upon the summit of the hill was a small fort , provided with a couple of murtherers , or demi-culverins . Such was Merry-Mount , and such the domain of Thomas Morton , suzerain of Merry-Mount , as he styled himself , and Master of Misrule as he was designated by the Plymouth people , to whom he was an abomination . It was late in the afternoon of a foggy and ungenial day . A noise of merriment within the " Palace , " as Morton denominated his log-house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal apartment , was spread a long and ample table . Upon the rude but capacious hearth blazed a mighty pile of hickory logs , crackling defiance to the rain and wind that were beating and howling without ; while , for additional illumination , were huge torches of pitch pine , stuck in pewter sconces , and emitting a shifting but brilliant flare , which lighted up the gathering twilight of the perverse April evening . Seated at the head of his rude table , with pipe in mouth , and a vast tankard at his elbow , was seated the Lord of Merry-Mount . At some distance below , was seated his lieutenant , Robin Bootefish , of the purple proboscis . Next to him was old acquaintance , " thou deservest to be installed forever as chief priest of the fountain of Merry-Mount . You are aware , Master Maudsley , " continued he , turning to the young man who sat on his right , " you are aware that there are many fountains of rare and curious merit in this wilderness ; so that the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need to smite no rock for their water . " " Truly , Master Morton , " answered the young gentleman , " the fountain presided over by your butler and friend , Robert Bootjack  --  . " " Bootefish , your honor , " interposed the worthy butler with calm dignity . " A thousand pardons , Robert Bootefish , " resumed Maudsley , " is a fountain of quite sufficient merit to find in the wilderness , and one quite equal to assuage the thirst of all the Puritans of New Canaan . But of what other fountains do you speak ? " " Marry at Winnesimit , " answered Morton , " is a fountain of wonderful virtue for the fair sex . ' T is said and proved that one glass cures the most obstinate barrenness ; so that we may be sure , if the place ever comes to be settled , ' t will be blessed with a most redundant population . " " A fountain haunted not by Egeria , but Lucina , " said Maudsley ; " and to what others do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood , " replied Morton , " over at Squanto 's chapel yonder , is a fountain of a most remarkable power ; for its waters cause a dead sleep of forty-eight hours to those who drink forty-eight ounces at a draught , and so on proportionably. " 2 " And are you chymist enough to solve the mystery of its waters ? " asked Maudsley . " No , truly , " said the Lord of Merry-Mount , " unless it be that the Puritans of Plymouth have buried their oldest and most soporific sermons within the grave of their honored and redlegged friend Squantum , who is entombed there . But , whatever be the cause , the fact is unquestionable . The great Powahs were accustomed to go thither to drink of the fountain , and when filled with its inspiration they would astonish their disciples with the multitude and magnificence of their visions . But after all , as you say , Master Maudsley , the fountain of Merry-Mount for me . The worst crime that the brethren can find in me is my merriment ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never catch , however contagious . So what harm can I do their saintships ? " " Truly you seem to be a martyr indeed , Master Morton , " said Maudsley ; " and , considering that the brethren have no more jurisdiction over your territory than the Khan of Tartary , one would think they might let you alone . " " And so they might ; for , as you say , the devil a bit of territory does their patent , which they have got at last , give to them north of yonder river of Wessaguscus . But my noise and my mirth offends them , it seems  --  s'death , have they ever inquired whether their gravity offendeth me or not ? What would they say , think you , should I issue a proclamation from this my palace of Merry-Mount , forbidding all prophesying at Plymouth  --  cutting of all anthems , and putting them upon a rigid allowance of sermons , say one yard to the hour ? " " Why , I think they would be very likely , " answered Maudsley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ears . " " And yet I have as much lawful jurisdiction over them , as they over the sovereign of Merry-Mount ; and in the eye of reason and equity I should be more justifiable than themselves . Is not mirth more philosophical than tears ? A plague on their doleful dumps . You are a scholar , Master Maudsley  --  what says our friend Horatius Flaccus on this point ? Misce stultitiam consiliis brevem . " ' " Yes indeed , " says Maudsley , to the infinite satisfaction of Morton , adding the concluding line of the ode ,  --  Dulce est desipere in loco . ' So pass round the tankard , Master Morton  --  the jaws of Bootefish are gaping like a stranded codfish . " " How can I express my delight to you , most excellent young man , " cried Morton , almost falling upon Maudsley 's neck . " You know not how I pine in these illiterate deserts for a companion skilled in the humanities . Saving and excepting the grim Sir Christopher , who is a scholar as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no human being to consort with me who has read the first book of Horace , or knows it from the first of Chronicles . Truly , like the clown in the wilderness , in worthy Will Shakspeare 's comedy , do I resemble that most capricious poet , honest Ovid , among the Goths . Judge , then , of my delight in meeting with you in the wilderness . " " Master Maudsley 's health , " cried the worthy butler , taking a mighty pull at the tankard , wiping the froth from his beard and handing it to his neighbor . " Master Maudsley 's health , " said the gentleman with the roast-apple physiognomy , plunging his face into the flagon , and becoming so immersed , either in the fluid or profound thought , that he forgot to take it out again till the tankard was dry . " I say , Peter Cakebread , none of that , " said the lengthy individual with the cap and feather , taking up the empty flagon , and ringing it discontentedly upon the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The suction of your skinny varlets passeth indeed . Robin Bootefish , I 'll trouble thee to supply the tank again . After Cakebread , ' t is nobody 's turn , thou knowest , till that be done . Why Peter , the Red Sea would be nothing to thee  --  and thou might'st drink it up for the new Canaanites to pass over , dry shod . " " Yes , " said the gentleman addressed , with his little beady eyes , glittering like a toad 's upon his brown , wrinkled face . " I thank my stars that I can look to the bottom of a tankard through all obstacles . But thou art mighty scriptural , Humphrey Rednape ; anybody can see that thou hast not sojourned at Plymouth for nothing . Marry thou hast lent an ear to the brethren indeed . " The face of the lengthy individual , who had left an ear upon the Plymouth pillory , was suffused with passion in an instant at the phrase . Clapping his hat still more firmly upon the side of his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vociferated ,  --  " Peter Cakebread , have a care  --  if thou canst swallow every thing , marry so can not I. Another such cowardly allusion to a  --  . " As the unfortunate Rednape was chafing under the gibes of the unpitying Cakebread , the replenished tankard was placed before him , and , without more ado , he buried his face and his rage together in the comforting fluid , seeking to drown the voice of his savage tormentor . As his countenance emerged from the tankard after a very satisfactory and refreshing pull , the taunting voice of Cakebread , repeating his mockery , struck on his solitary ear , and again awakened his wrath . " Take that , thou malicious old baboon , to stop thy infernal chattering , " roared he , dashing the flagon full in his enemy 's face , and then hurling the flagon itself at his head . Cakebread escaped with the shower bath , for , ducking his head with agility , he avoided the huge missile , which would have assuredly put an end to his joking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-will it was aimed . His countenance , when he again ventured to lift it from the table , was sloppy and woe-begone enough ; but the malice of his beady eyes was not quite extinguished . " Hallo !  --  What is all this ? " cried Morton , rapping upon the table with the hilt of his dagger . " Rednape  --  Cakebread  --  what mean ye by these quarrels and cuffings Can not ye indulge in the good things provided by my paternal care , without riot ? Natis in usum ltiti scyphis Pugnare , Thracum est , ' which in the vernacular is , None but blackguards break heads with the jolly tankard '  --  so hold your tongues , and give ear to my counsel . " " He has but one to give , " muttered the incorrigible Cakebread , but in so low a tone that it escaped the attention of Rednape . " And what is to become of us , I should like to be informed ? " chirped the Canary Bird , hopping off his stool , and running to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , I ask ? Here be these twain  --  Rednape and Cakebread  --  have consumed the lining of two tankards , and the devil a drop have the rest of us to wet our whistles withal . " " Get on thy perch again , Canary , " said the master of the revels , and shut thy bill ; Bootefish shall administer to thy wants . Robert , be lively , man . " " Certainly , if your honor commands , " said that important personage ; " but if I had my own way , not another drop should be set on the table for a quarter of an hour . A pretty thing , forsooth , if I , Robert Bootefish , butler , precentor , and head clerk , am to do nothing but run to and fro , at the command of these wasteful vagabonds . If the good liquor , prepared by these skilful hands , had gone to its lawful and proper place , never a word would I say ; but when I see these roystering sots sprinkling each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a watering-pot , I will take it upon me to pronounce them worse than Indians , or pagans , or heathen Puritans themselves . " " Well , well , old puncheon , " chirped the impatient Doryfall , do n't grumble any more , but stir thy stumps and the liquor . I am as dry as an exhortation ; I shall evaporate unless thou wettest me . Life is dust , but the clay must be moistened  --  so get along , old hogshead . " " Take care I do n't wring thy neck , Master Canary , and spoil thy drinking forever , " said the irascible Bootefish , feeling his dignity invaded , but stumping solemnly off in search of the desired liquor . " My name is Bernaby Doryfall , and a very good name too , " piped the good-humored Canary Bird , " but call me what thou likest , so thou starvest us not . To the health and long life of Master Maudsley , " concluded he , thrusting his bill into the tankard which the chief butler soon placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then other toasts and other tankards went round and round again . The mirth grew loud and furious . Songs to which nobody listened , glees of discordant and unhappy sound , and catches in which every thing was caught but the tune , succeeded each other in bewildering and still increasing confusion . Faster and faster flew the flagon , louder and louder grew the uproar , thicker and thicker rose the unceasing tobacco smoke , till it hung all over them like a thick grey fog , through which the pine torches wildly flashed and flared . It was a picture of wildly contrasted light and shadow , that evening scene of frantic revelry . That strange , rude banquet , that roughly raftered and uncouth apartment , those parti-colored and half savage costumes , those swart and bearded faces now flashing with fierce laughter , now black with sudden anger , now softening with drunken tenderness , were worthy of a Caravaggio 's pencil . Maudsley sat in his place , a spectator , not an actor in the merriment . He went to the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . The uproar sounded unnaturally in that wilderness-spot , the frequent oath , the ribald jest , the deafening and incessant song , and shout , and yell , broke strangely forth upon the solemn night  --  rang through the stern and mirky forest , and awoke but to overpower the hooting owl , and the howling wolf , with the wilder and more discordant notes of humanity . " Are these the men , " said Maudsley to himself , " are these the men to found an empire ? Are these the pioneers of civilization and Christianity in this benighted but virgin world ? By such ribalds as these are colonies torn from the parent trunk , and planted in the wilderness to blossom and grow strong ? " While he was musing , the storm had increased without , and now howled fearfully around the quaking house , the rain beat in torrents upon the roof , while the uproar of the elements seemed but to add fresh excitement to the furious riot of that revelling crew within . Suddenly a faint knocking was heard at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of night , and in this foul weather too ! " exclaimed Morton . " Bootefish , to the door , man , and admit the wanderer . " " Please your honor 's worship , " replied the chief butler , very reluctant to disturb himself , " ' t is none of our own company , ' t is probably some tipsy heathen of an Indian or vagrant Puritan . " " Robert Bootefish , " interrupted Morton , with a solemn , theatrical , but slightly tipsy expression , " it is a night , as the worthy deer stealer of Stratford hath it , Wherein the cubdrawn bear would crouch , The lion and the belly pinched wolf Keep their fur dry  --  . " ' " Aye , " interrupted Maudsley in his turn , " and yet perhaps as for this poor devil , Unbonneted he runs . ' But the wanderer to night , unbonneted or unbreeched , sachem , or settler , powah or Puritan , shall dry his fur at yonder fire , while I can undo the latch ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bootefish , and threw the door open . " Who knocks , " cried he , for not a soul was visible in the pitchy darkness . " Lo , it is I , a wanderer in the wilderness , " answered a feeble voice near the door . " Come in , wanderer of the wilderness , and shut the door after thee , " roared the jolly voice of the suzerain . " Come to the hospitable hearth of Merry-Mount  --  dissolve frigus  --  and take a pull at the Bootefish panacea  --  come in man  --  why , excellent well , " concluded he , as Maudsley introduced a slender , middle aged individual , in sad colored Puritanic habiliments , faded , patched , and travel stained , who advanced bashfully through the horde of revellers , till he arrived at the ample fire-place , where he stood , in most dismally drenched condition , with the water dripping from his thin peaked beard , oozing from every corner of his dress , and running like a little rivulet from the top of the tall hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merry-Mount , most worthy wanderer , " said Morton , " and pray whom have I the honor of addressing ? " The thin , half drowned little man looked bewildered enough , being thus suddenly brought from the wild and stormy darkness without , into the glaring , hot , and fantastic scene , where he now stood , a most striking and almost pathetic contrast to the other actors of the scene . For a moment he seemed to have lost the faculty of speech . " Take a drop of this fluid , " said Bootefish , officially waddling forward with his tankard , " mayhap it may loosen the rust from that tongue of yours , if so be you have a tongue , and have'nt worn it to a stump with preaching and prophecying . " The Puritan put his lips meekly to the tankard , moistened his throat with a very little of the liquid , and then looked wistfully at the company around him , with much the same sort of expression , which a kid might wear at being suddenly introduced to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information touching thy baptismal and patronymic denominations ? " said Morton . " In other words , might I again ask thy name ? Zounds , man , do n't look as if we were all rattlesnakes  --  who art thou ? " " Lo ! it is I , a poor worm and not a man , a reproach of men and despised of the people , " at last answered the wanderer in a plaintive voice . " And that , I suppose , we are to consider a most lucid explanation of your appearance and present position , " said Morton . " Well , well , sit down by the fire , dry your hide , and take another pull at the jorum . " " How the poor worm , as he calls himself , wriggles and twists , " said Peter Cakebread to the Canary Bird . " Zounds , I think some of the fishers of men down at new Canaan have thrust a hook through him , and thrown him as a bait among us here . Do n't expect to catch an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " concluded the brown faced , beady-eyed Peter , addressing himself to the Puritan . " Nonsense , Peter Cakebread , " answered the Canary Bird , " do n't suppose he comes angling for such slippery old eels as you  --  your 're half singed already in the devil 's frying pan . But look at the blushing Bootefish yonder , hang me , if he does not look at the bait longingly , he is growing serious . Halloo , Bootefish , take care , man  --  let not our precentor and head clerk give attention to the wiles of the artful enemy  --  no nonconformity at Merry-Mount , you know . The liturgy and good liquor forever ! " " Am I not precentor and head clerk of Merry-Mount , I presume to ask , " said Bootefish , reddening with importance . " Do I not convert the heathen Turk and Pagan Indian ? Well then , why not the heathen Puritan also ? I shall catechise this stray crop ear and illuminate his darkness , always with the leave of your honor 's worship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly , Robin , certainly , " said the master of the revels , whose delight it was to indulge his subjects in all their whims , and to keep them merry and good natured ; " make as many proselytes as thou canst , but my life for it , thou ' lt find a Puritan more stiff necked than a sagamore , but far be it from me to discourage your virtuous efforts . " In the meantime the poor wanderer , who evidently seemed to feel himself more uncomfortable among these mad and riotous vagabonds , than he had done amid the raging tempest and the midnight gloom , from which he had recently emerged , sat by the fire , his hands meekly clasped , his eyes piously elevated , and an inaudible prayer upon his lips . " Take this cloak , old fellow , and cast off that drenched and tattered garment of yours , " said Maudsley , bringing a warm cloak of ample dimensions , and wrapping it snugly about the poor pilgrim 's shivering form . " Thanks , most worthy youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the young man , in whose physiognomy alone , of all the strange faces which surrounded him , he seemed to read sympathy and protection . " Truly my garments are not of the driest , for lo ! I am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint , my heart is like wax , it is melted in the midst of my bowels . " " Then , " began Bootefish , with oracular gravity , " then , thou perverse contemner of the holy mother church  --  then , thou apostate from her , who would have suckled thee with her wings , and sheltered thee in the shadow of her paps  --  then , if thy bones are out of joint , here am I , Robin Bootefish , to put them all in again , with the help of my blessed exhortations , " and with this , the veteran plucked a greasy little prayer-book , very tattered and liquor stained , from his pocket , opened it at hap hazard , and holding it upside down , began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-edification . While this drunken foolery was going on , Maudsley and Morton , something weary of the folly , and who wished some private conversation , had retired into the adjoining apartment , the suzerain having appointed Peter Cakebread to officiate in his absence . The rioting and folly went on still more madly , now that the restraint of their superiors was removed from the rest of the revellers . " Now wanderer and worm of the wilderness ! " exclaimed Peter Cakebread , flinging his thin , spider legs upon the table , and then taking a mighty pull at the flagon , " now thou drunken miscreant with the melted bowels , and the broken bones , please inform this righteous and pious company thy name , location , and destination  --  answer , and at once , Croppy , on pain of my instantaneous displeasure . " My name , " answered the Puritan meekly , " is Mellowes  --  Faintnot Mellowes . I was some time an unworthy weaver of Suffolkshire , in Old England  --  now a pilgrim in the land of Canaan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Naumkeak upon urgent business ; after which I look intently to return to my helpmeet and my blessed babes , whom I have left in the wilderness . " " A home in the wilderness , " said Bootefish , waving his prayer-book solemnly to and fro  --  a home in the wilderness , where the altars of the blessed mother church are to be over-thrown before they are set up . Alas , for this benighted land ! Listen to me , thou apostate , to me Robert Bootefish ,  --  for am I not a babe still hanging on the refreshing bosom of the mother church ? " " Lord bless him ! Thou canst see the cherub was born for hanging , " interrupted Cakebread . " Do n't blush , Bootefish , " concluded he , with his toad-like eyes glittering with mischief , while the solemn Bootefish grew purple with indignation at this interference with his exhortations . " Hah , hah , hah , " suddenly roared the sprawling , long-legged Humphrey Rednape , who had been silently imbibing vast draughts from the Merry-Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his companions , without any active participation therein .  --  " Hah , hah , hah , " he roared with ringing , drunken laughter  --  " Bootefish a cherub !  --  a capital jest , ' ifecks !  --  Bootefish , a blessed cherub ! Hah , hah , hah ! " " Halloo , halloo  --  here is Rednape waked up at last , " piped the shrill voice of Canary  --  " I thought he had got a bottle of Squanto 's fountain , and was dead to the world for eight and forty hours ! But here he is alive and kicking , and laughing too from ear to ear at Bootefish 's exhortations . " " What an extensive hilarity must that be ! " cried the reinstated Cakebread  --  " Rednape laughing from ear to ear ! Why , ' t is a laugh forty miles broad , as the crow flies  --  since from Merry-Mount to Plymouth  --  . " " Hold thy peace , hold thy peace ! " cried the peace-making Bernaby Doryfall , stopping the mouth of the malicious Cakebread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wrath by the jibes of his ceaseless tormentor , was looking round the table for some suitable missile of revenge  --  " Hold thy foolish tongue , Peter ; and thou Humphrey Rednape , stop thy rash hand . Here are we all , forgetting the business in hand . Here , Faintnot Mellowes , " continued he , turning to the poor weaver , who had kept his seat in the chimney corner , shrinking as far as possible from observation , and hoping that the attention of his riotous companions would , by their own bickering , be directed altogether from himself , at least till the anxiously desired re-appearance of Master Maudsley  --  " Here , Master Faintnot Mellowes , some time weaver , and now an unworthy brother of Plymouth , I propose , as thou hast forsworn connection with New Canaan , as thou hast thyself informed us , although the reasons are not yet communicated ,  --  that thou be now admitted a member of the Merry-Mount society , with the customary ceremonies . " The suggestion of Bernaby Doryfall was received with shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dragged from the chimney corner , by the united exertions of Rednape , Bootefish , and the Canary Bird , and elevated , chair and all , upon the table , where he sat , presenting , with his peaked hat , draggled dress , and rueful countenance , an extraordinary contrast to the wild , bacchanalian figures who surrounded him . There he sat pilloried upon the centre of the table , mocked and tormented by the grinning imps , who were dancing , whooping , and chattering in mad and noisy confusion about the table . Suddenly Bernaby Doryfall , with a shrill halloo , leaped like a frog upon the table just behind his chair , placed both hands upon the victim 's shoulders , and vaulted over him in masterly style , only upsetting half a score of pewter mugs and flagons as he descended , and making an infernal clatter as he reached the ground . He was followed by the temporary master of revels , the wizzened , little old Cakebread , who took the leap with the nimbleness of an ape , mopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and alighting upon the ground with a malicious chuckle of triumph . The sprawling Rednape succeeded , who , after clearing the victim 's shoulders in rather a clumsy manner , floundered upon his nose , among the cups and dishes , nearly upset the table , and then measured his length upon the floor . His cap and feather fell off as he did so , his long hair fell back , and exposed the mutilated portion of his countenance to the derision of his companions . The clumsy Bootefish followed , who with great difficulty was hoisted upon the table by the assistance of his companions , and who , after waddling with ponderous but uncertain footing a step or two forward , with the air of an intoxicated hippopotamus , came to a dead pause , refused the leap , closed his eyes , gathered himself into a ball , and dropped heavily upon the floor . The game was kept up , however , with breathless rapidity by the Canary Bird , Peter Cakebread and Rednape , with one or two other subordinate and anonymous individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who turned half a dozen cart wheels upon the table , and then threw a final somerset over Faintnot 's head , in most brilliant and inimitable style . The company now refreshed themselves with another pull at the Merry-Mount fountain . Master Bootefish then stepped forward with bland dignity , presented the flagon to the poor badgered victim , and requested him to drink it off to the health of the Merry-Mount society . The meek weaver declined the draught ; whereat the chief butler , in great dudgeon , drank off the larger portion himself , and threw the slops over the prisoner 's head . " Thou art sprinkled now from the fountain of Merry-Mount , " said he solemnly , " and we propose that thou shouldst henceforth become a member of this honorable society . " " Alas , alas ! " cried the almost exhausted and thoroughly bewildered Faintnot , who really believed himself in the power of demons , and the whole scene before him one of witchcraft and delusion ; " alas , alas ! the dogs have compassed me  --  the assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help me ? No , not one . " " Did I hear aright ? " blustered Bootefish . " Dogs compass you , indeed ! and a wicked assembly , too ! Why , thou canting , heathen dog , dost dare to call the worshipful and virtuous society of Merry-Mount a wicked assembly ! Thou roystering , drunken knave thou , how shall such insolence be punished ? Humphrey Rednape , Peter Cakebread , Bernaby Doryfall ,  --  are ye all an assembly of the wicked ? What vengeance shall we inflict upon this perverse slanderer ? " Faintnot looked wistfully towards the door , and with bewilderment and fear at the threatening faces of his tormentors . " Alas , alas ! " he again exclaimed , " is there none to save me from the power of the dog ? Whither is the kind young man departed , and where is he , who sat but lately in authority over ye ? Shame on ye !  --  shame , that ye should wear the semblance of men , and yet be as fiends and ravening wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put me forth again , I beseech ye , if ye indeed be men , and not fiends ; put me forth again into the tempest and the outer darkness , and the Lord , even the God of Jacob , shall reward ye . " " Put thee forth again into this terrible storm ! " piped the Canary Bird , " how canst thou think it ? What a blot upon the hospitable fame of Merry-Mount ; and sooth to say , thou judgest of the free hearted revellers of Passanogessit as of the gloomy crop-ears of New Canaan . No , my good fellow , not yet shalt thou be dismissed into the wailing and teeth-gnashing of the outer wilderness . Pledge us to the prosperity of Passanogessit , and to the confusion of Canaan ! " he concluded , again tendering the oft-rejected flagon . The poor Puritan reached the cup with evident loathing to his lips , and looked beseechingly , as he exclaimed in broken accents ,  --  " Truly , trouble is near me , and there is none to help . Many bulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beset me round . Men , men , have ye no pity  --  no charity  --  no bowels of compassion ? Behold , my soul and body are wearied with travel and fasting . Is there none to save me from the lion 's mouth ? Is there no help from the horns of the unicorns ? " " Hah , hah , hah ! " shouted the baboon-faced Cakebread . " Hah , hah , hah ! Master Humphrey , who would have thought that the sly dog of a Puritan psalm-singer had been an old acquaintance of thine . Why , man , he knows thy name as well as the best of us . Didst hear him pray for deliverance from unicorns ? Can flesh and blood bear such gibes from a Puritan ? Look at him well Humphrey , my lad , dost recognize an acquaintance ? By the lord , perhaps ' t is thy executioner himself . To him , to him ! Numps , my lad . Quote him text for text ; take an ear for an ear . Crop his ears for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  crop his ears for him , Humphrey Rednape , and thou shalt never be jeered again by Peter Cakebread ! " The long-legged unicorn sprang into the air with rapture at Cakebread 's suggestion . His hatred of the Plymouth brethren was ancient , deep-rooted , savage , and not ungrounded . He had , as we have stated , been dealt with by the Puritans after the severest fashion . For the petty offence of reviling their magistrates and denying their authority , during a temporary and vagabond residence in their neighborhood , he had , according to their sanguinary practice , been pilloried , mutilated and banished . He had fled to Merry-Mount for refuge ; where , during his long association with vagabonds of similar habits to his own , he had fed fat the grudge he owed the Plymouth people , and where his hatred had been burned indelibly into his soul by the ceaseless mockery of his companions . The opportunity for revenge , for which he had so long panted , seemed now within his grasp . Determined to wipe out the memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cakebread , smarting under the memory of his own irremediable wrong , inflamed by the taunting laugh of his companions , furiously drunk , and blindly following the savage impulse of the moment , he whipped out his sharp hunting knife , sprang with a wild halloo upon the table , and seized the neck of the unoffending , unresisting weaver . The rest of the drunken crew flocked around , encouraging and applauding his purpose . The savage Rednape , his eyes half starting from his head , his hands quivering with rage and intoxication , his mouth uttering ferocious imprecations , had already torn off the Puritan 's hat and neck-band , had seized him by his right ear , with his knife brandished above him , when the victim , appalled by this ignominious cruelty , uttered a yell of horror , in so loud and piercing a tone , that even the executioner paused for an instant , while at the same moment the door flew violently open , and Henry Maudsley bounded into the room . " What means this mummery ? " he cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riotous apartment , and infused a thrill of hope into the heart of the poor victim . Rednape paused a moment , holding his knife suspended in the air , and looked with an expression of cowardly ferocity , worthy of a vulture , disturbed when feeding upon a carcass , at the angry countenance of Maudsley . " What means this mummery ? " he repeated , looking fiercely at the mob of rioters . " Have ye no shame , no manly blood in your veins , that ye stand by , like grinning apes , while this drunken ruffian is playing such pranks as these ? Leave your hold of his neck , Master Cut-throat , and let him descend from the place where you have pilloried him . " " Hey-day , hey-day , Master Maudsley ! " exclaimed the ferocious Rednape , retaining his position upon the table , and his hold upon his victim 's neck . " Hey-day ! what is this exhortation about ? Who gave you authority over me , or any of us , I should like to be informed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The victim struggled  --  the rioters cheered and yelled . Rednape brandished his knife , and would assuredly have executed his purpose , when Maudsley sprang upon him like a tiger , fastened his knuckles in his throat , and hurled him headlong and sprawling upon the floor . Then turning to the wanderer , who was half dead with exhaustion , excitement and mortification , he humanely and carefully assisted him to descend from the ground , and led him off through the mob of rioters to the door . The revellers , confounded by his rapid and imperious style of proceeding , ashamed of their excesses , and feeling a little tardy sympathy with the persecuted pilgrim , offered but little resistance . Soon after Maudsley had left the room with the weaver , whom he had taken under his protection , the sovereign of Merry-Mount entered , with marks of dissatisfaction upon his countenance . " How is this , my children , my lieges , " he cried , " how is this , that the back of your suzerain can not for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for riot and uproar ? I am ashamed at your conduct . I have just been succinctly informed by Master Maudsley ,  --  who is worth a hundred of ye , homo ad unguem factus '  --  a gentleman and a scholar , who has the bard of Stratford at his tongue 's end , and is as familiar with Flaccus as myself ,  --  I say , I have just been informed that outrages have been attempted upon the person of this poor wayfarer which are shocking to an ingenuous mind . I would blush for ye , but that I see Robert Bootefish is blushing for the whole company . Retire , the whole of ye ! ' T is long past midnight ; the butt is dry , the torches are burnt to the sockets , and ye are all as tipsy as wild boars . " As he concluded this oration , the despotic lord of Merry-Mount opened wide the door , and his obedient subjects , very drunk and very much ashamed , trooped forth , helter-skelter , into the darkness , bearing lighted torches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke vividly and fitfully upon the midnight gloom , like a horde of gnomes about to vanish into the bowels of the earth . The rain had ceased , but the darkness still continued . Morton watched at the door till the party had dispersed into the various cabins which were inclosed within the palisade . He then sallied forth personally , to examine the security of his outer defences , and having completed his rounds , returned into his house . In the mean time , Maudsley , who had taken the poor weaver in charge , had conducted him to his own cottage , where he had spread before him a supper of dried venison and Indian bread , and had then insisted upon his reposing his weary limbs upon his own couch , which , notwithstanding the protestations of the humble Faintnot , he resolutely resigned to him . The weary wanderer was soon enjoying the slumber which he so much needed , while Maudsley , lost in thought , remained gazing out upon the starless night . Feeling a little chilled as he stood by the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had so good-naturedly thrown about the wanderer , upon his first appearance at the banqueting hall of the palace . As he he lifted the garment from the heap of tattered raiment , which the wearer had cast from him upon retiring to rest , a sealed letter fell upon the ground . He mechanically took it up , and looked at the superscription . The packet was addressed , " To the honored hands of Esther Ludlow .  --  These with dispatch . " He gazed at the writing , till the waning light of the torch expired , and left him in darkness . See Note II . CHAPTER VI . where THE BAFFLED KNIGHT . When Sir Christopher Gardiner lifted the prostrate form of Esther Ludlow from the ground , and bore her to the house , he was not aware to whose prompt assistance the preservation of the maiden was owing . He had from a distance observed the danger to which she was exposed , but having unluckily no fire-arm , he was unable to rescue her immediately , and was rushing down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maudsley 's bullet laid the ferocious animal lifeless at Esther 's feet . Annoyed at being thus prevented from rendering a signal service to the fair Puritan , he did not pause to investigate the circumstances of the case , but while Maudsley was struggling through the swamp , which intervened between Esther 's position and the point from which he had fired , and while his form was still concealed by the bushes , the knight had rapidly raised the fainting girl in his arms , and borne her to her home . When Maudsley arrived , he was somewhat surprised to find the unknown damsel , whom he had rescued , thus spirited away , and his first impulse was to search for her . He observed , however , but very indistinctly , the figure of a man in puritanic habiliments , disappearing through the pine forest , and he then remembered , that in the neighborhood of this spot , which he had never before visited , was the residence of several religious settlers . The society of such people was not congenial to him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England , he had the faintest sensation of sympathy , the Puritan who seemed to hold the thread of his fate in her hands , although she had , in his estimation , slighted and scorned him  --  that Puritan was , as he believed , many miles away in the settlement of New Plymouth . He had been but a short time in New England , and he had not yet chosen to visit the Ludlows in their retreat . It was partly shame at being obliged to acknowledge the weakness of his heart , partly doubt , whether his presence might be pleasing or not , and partly a lingering feeling of resentment , which had restrained him from flying across the narrow strip of wilderness , which as he deemed still separated them , even as he had already traversed the stormy and wintry Atlantic . Supposing the Ludlows some sixty miles distant , he , of course , could hardly associate the idea of his Esther with the damsel whom , concealed by bushes and dimmed by distance , he had seen encountering the wolf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had been carried away in safety by a man of her own faith , her father , husband , brother , lover , he cared not which , he was on the whole rather gratified than otherwise . He thought , to be sure , that it would have been rather more courteous , had the Puritan gentleman stayed till his arrival , but he reflected that their rapid retreat had probably saved him from listening to a thanksgiving , concluding with an exhortation , which would have been too long for his patience , and he felt grateful for their departure . As we have seen , he mused a little on the circumstances , and then dismissing the whole matter from his thoughts , he went his way . In the mean time Gardiner had borne Esther Ludlow to her house , where he found her brother . He was somewhat alarmed at the situation of his sister , but the explanation of Gardiner satisfied him , that there was no danger to be apprehended , and the exertions of a faithful waiting woman , whom Esther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored her exhausted senses , he pressed Gardiner to remain at his house for the present . He had occasionally seen the knight at Plymouth , where he was regarded as a man weary of the world , a man who had led a life perhaps of adventure and of passion , but whose spirit was now changed , and who had as it were taken the cowl , and gone into the wilderness as into a convent , where he might atone , during the rest of his days , for the follies of his worldly career . " And it is to your prompt assistance then , " said Esther , who was now perfectly restored , and who felt almost ashamed of having had the weakness to faint  --  " it is to your assistance that I am indebted for deliverance , " said she , suppressing a slight shudder , and addressing herself to Gardiner . " Alas ! no , " he replied ; " I was about to render you assistance , which would have been a very easy as well as a most welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an unknown hand from a distant thicket , Roger Conant 's , perhaps , or that of some other of your neighbors , anticipated my intention and destroyed your enemy . No great achievement to be sure , for the wolf is a cowardly cur , and would certainly not have waited for my arrival , before taking himself to flight , even if this unknown champion had been absent . " " It is strange , " said Esther , " that the man to whose prompt assistance I am so much indebted , should not at least present himself at our cottage . Was Roger Conant at his own hut , Walter , " she inquired , turning to Ludlow . " No , he had been absent since daybreak  --  and there was none about his household who knew whither  --  I think it likely that it was he who assisted you , and I hope I shall soon have an opportunity , if it be so , to offer him my warmest thanks . " " If it be Conant , " said Esther , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid our thanks . Such an every-day matter as destroying a wolf , he will hardly deem a matter of triumph . " " He were a more savage brute himself , " exclaimed Gardiner with enthusiasm , and looking with flashing eyes at Esther , " he were worse than a wolf himself , did he not triumph in being the chosen instrument to rescue so precious and cherished a life from the threatening danger  --  I would it had been my lot instead of his . But Providence decreed otherwise , " he concluded , slightly elevating his eyes to heaven , and fearing that his manner might have expressed more warmth than would be acceptable . " I thank you for your kindness , " said Esther , " and I certainly do not forget , that your arm was ready and willing to preserve me , even if no other assistance had been near . " " Have you received news from England ? " asked Gardiner , turning abruptly to Ludlow . " I am expecting dispatches by the way of Plymouth , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that harbor , and one too , by which important news have come to hand . My own letters , which would have been addressed to me at Plymouth , are , I trust , already on their way across the intervening wilderness , but I am not yet in possession of them . " " You are not yet aware of any details , " said Gardiner , " but I think I understand you to state , that you have learned already something of importance . " " Truly , " said Ludlow , " of much interest to me , and to you likewise . " " Appertaining to affairs at home , or regarding our own matters here in the wilderness ? " asked Gardiner . " They regard ourselves , our own colony and prospects , " said Ludlow . " And our oppressed religion no doubt ? " added Gardiner , " but I am anxious to know something more  --  I too am entirely without advices , and pray you to impart to me whatever you have learned . " " Briefly then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , serious effort is making to colonize these parts , by people of a wholly different stamp from those who have hitherto attempted the enterprise . " " Differing from our brethren of New Plymouth , I apprehend you to mean , " said Gardiner . " Truly , " said Ludlow , " I did not so intend , although , to be sure , the new colonists are different in many of their principles from the brethren of New Plymouth . As I understand , they are such who retain still a deep and yearning affection for our holy mother church , and who would see her reclaimed from her errors , and purified of her Popish gewgaws . Like my sister and yourself and me , they would still remain in communion and sweet fellowship with their ancient mother , and not like the Separatists of Plymouth , tear themselves too rudely from her arms , and fiercely refuse holy intercourse with her . " " In short , " said Esther , who felt a deeper and livelier interest than her brother in these matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rather Puritans than Separatists . They are nonconformists , who seek to establish a purified church on this side the ocean . Separated by the mighty Atlantic , from the land of their fathers , they would not separate in heart and spirit from the church of their affection  --  but only wipe away the stain of its errors from their own garments . " " They are then Puritans , these new comers ? " said Gardiner , with apparent calmness , but with a savage scowl for an instant darkening his forehead . " They are so , " said Esther , answering his question , and not observing the expression of his face . " But my brother meant , when he called them men of a different stamp from the former settlers in this wilderness , that they differed widely from the idle and dissolute , who have sought these shores , not for conscience sake , but in the sordid hope of gain and worldly advantage . " " Let us not speak of them , " said Gardiner , " but of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  can you tell me by what right they come into this neighborhood ? " " We have not yet , as my brother has mentioned , learned the details , but we hear that a company of pious and energetic people has been formed , numbering among them many men of station and fortune , and that this company has obtained from the council of New England , a grant of the whole territory of Massachusetts Bay . " " Aha , " muttered Gardiner to himself , grinding his teeth savagely , and looking black as a demon , upon the madonna face of the beautiful Puritan , to whom he was listening . " Aha , then Sir Ferdinando has been baffled indeed . And pray can you inform me , " added he aloud , and in the blandest tones , " can you inform me whether such a grant has actually been obtained , and the patent already executed ? " " Such is the story , " answered Esther . " But if your own letters do not reach you sooner , I trust we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when our messenger from New Plymouth shall have arrived . " " ' T is very strange , " muttered the knight to himself , " that I am left thus in the dark . Either Blaxton must have dispatches for me , or they have miscarried altogether . Sir Ferdinando could never have intended that I should be thus groping in ignorance of such important matters . I crave your pardon , lady , " said he aloud , " for having given you so much trouble by my earnest desire for information . An exile , you know , as well as any other , thirsts for knowledge of affairs at home . I thank you for your kindness , and with your permission will now wish you good morrow . " So saying , Sir Christopher courteously saluted Ludlow and his sister , passed rapidly across the glade , and disappeared in the forest . " The knight seems troubled and disconcerted , " said Ludlow to his sister , after their guest had departed . " He seemed perplexed and strangely affected , " answered Esther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England  --  why his anxiety should be thus excited , I hardly know . ' T is a strange , moody man , whose mind seems to me as impenetrable as his visage . I know not why , but he inspires me with any thing but confidence . " " Nay , you judge him harshly , " said Walter Ludlow ; " Gardiner is , like myself , perhaps , a broken-spirited man , melancholy and solitary , but not therefore to be distrusted . " It is unnecessary to make further record of the Ludlows ' conversation , as we have at this time more to do with the knight who had left the cottage . CHAPTER VII . BIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL . It was very natural that Sir Christopher Gardiner should have been exceedingly perplexed at the information which he had received , in such a fragmentary manner , from the Ludlows . He had received nothing by the recent arrival from England , and according to the tenor of his former letters , affairs had been in a very hopeful train for the advancement of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England , Sir Ferdinando had meditated a great change in his schemes . His fertile imagination suggested to him , that one great obstacle to his success , lay in the New England Council  --  of which , although he was one of its most influential members , he was , after all , only a fraction , and consequently often hampered in his plans by want of sympathy , or by direct opposition on the part of his associates . Another difficulty with which he had to contend , lay in the instruments with which he had been obliged to work . He had been disappointed that he had been unable to inspire his son with any of his enthusiasm . The pictures which he painted to him did not dazzle him at all . But , while Sir Ferdinando was casting anxiously about him , and regretting that the character of his son altogether unfitted him from taking any part in his design , it so happened that circumstances took him to the continent , and he chanced one day to meet Sir Christopher Gardiner at Madrid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an intimate connection with the Gorges family , which will probably develop itself more fully as this history proceeds , had made the elder and younger knights familiar with each other . Gardiner had then but recently appeared , after nearly twenty years ' absence in foreign climes , during which he had been disinherited . Strange adventures , in which he had been an actor , had from time to time been whispered in England . He had been a pilgrim to the Holy Land  --  he had been in many battles , by sea and land , and in the service of many states . He had dwelt long in Venice , that marble portal through which so long had flowed the commerce of the world , and dwelt there in some important , but mysterious capacity . It was certain that he had been engaged in the celebrated mock conspiracy of the Duke d'Ossuna against the Republic , in which the subordinates all lost their lives , while he preserved not only his head , but increased both his credit and his fortune . Disguised as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venice , without even exciting a suspicion ; and throughout the whole drama , even to the explosion of the conspiracy , he had been the right hand and most trusty agent of the Duke , in all his daring , subtle , but unsuccessful schemes . At this juncture he had suddenly disappeared , as if the earth had swallowed him . And after men had done speculating , whether he had been sunk in the lagoons , or whether his friend , the Viceroy of the Sicilies , had popped him into the crater of Etna , to prevent any inconvenient blabbing , he had suddenly , after a long interval , re-appeared in England , which he had left a boy , and where no man knew his face . Some said he had not always borne the name he bore . Some whispered that there were potent reasons for disguise . That he had commanded a band of Uscoques , or Dalmatian pirates , was believed by some ; while others were perfectly certain that he had distinguished himself in a memorable action , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destroyed these scourges of the Adriatic . He was indeed generally believed to have been a Knight of Malta ; and if so , he was probably not an Uscoque . At the same time , it was currently reported that he had married an English woman of rank and fortune in Rome , and repudiated her soon afterward for a Cardinal 's hat , with the Pope 's triple crown in perspective . Missing the election to St. Peter 's chair by a single vote , they said he had thrown down his hat in a rage , and had suddenly bolted to the East . Here he was known to have resided a long time , and was suspected by many wiseacres of having adopted the koran and the turban , and to have been rewarded with the pachalic over a dozen different provinces , whence he was only removed to occupy the station of grand vizier . Hence he was again driven , by a wild passion which the chief sultana conceived for him . Reciprocating the sentiment , but averse to the bowstring , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and while the unfortunate Fatima was sinking to the bottom of the Bosphorus , he was heartlessly skimming across its surface in the swiftest of feluccas . The thread of his adventures was snapped again at this moment ; but the wiseacres , tracking him like bloodhounds , came up some how or other with him in Spain , where he had gone to visit his friend , the Duke d'Ossuna , who had returned to his country and made his peace at court . Thence , people said he had been startled by the unlooked for appearance of his wife , who , after dodging him through all his windings , from Venice through the Cardinal 's college to the Levant , and so across the Mediterranean to Spain , had suddenly confronted him in the Escurial . Giving her the slip , he appeared to have found the seven-leagued boots , and to have dashed off again to the world 's end . The wiseacres were once more baffled . A little only of the nonsense which had been talked about him , may indicate the estimation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even shadow forth the probable character of the man about whom so much mysterious folly had been engendered . And yet there were undoubtedly a good many truths mixed with the absurd gossip which was so greedily swallowed . This history may probably eliminate the real from the fanciful ;  --  but at present we are only concerned to account for his intimacy with Sir Ferdinando Gorges . That doughty old knight , and most brilliant of schemers , almost fainted upon Gardiner 's neck when he discovered him . He had known him long and well ; and without stating at present the precise relation in which they stood , let it suffice , that never were two persons better adapted to be useful and serviceable to each other . Gardiner was very ready to recommence his adventures on a new scene . His battered fortunes , he thought , would be admirably recruited by the creation of a magnificent county palatine in the El Dorado ; and his jaded imagination , palled by his varied and chequered adventures in the moss-grown world , where he had run his race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visions of a new empire in a virgin world flashed across him for the first time . As for Sir Ferdinando , he probably knew how much to believe of the various adventures reported  --  not by Sir Christopher himself , however , for he was silent and impenetrable  --  of that adventurous personage . He cared not whether he was monk or martyr , Turk or Christian , Knight of Malta or Dalmatian pirate , cardinal , pope , or vizier . He knew his character thoroughly ;  --  knew that no better man could possibly be found in the breadth of England for his purposes . Trained from boyhood to the use of every weapon , insensible to fatigue , calm in danger , subtle in scheming , prompt in action , commanding in person , and above all , untroubled with that inconvenient companion , a conscience , Sir Christopher seemed to have been expressly compounded for his great designs . Gardiner 's patience had however been severely tried . To a man of his impetuous nature , the languor which seemed to characterize all the proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inactivity to which it doomed him became inexpressibly galling . Saving the society of Jaspar , and the occasional companionship of the suzerain of Merry-Mount , to which potentate he imparted just as much , or as little as he chose , of his own thoughts , his life was passed either in solitude or in masquerade . Gardiner , however , possessed a deep knowledge of human nature , and reading Morton 's character at a glance , he saw how much assistance might be derived from his various qualities and accomplishments , although his flippancy and recklessness caused him great uneasiness . In his intercourse with the brethren at I lymouth , whom he visited in the demure character of a spiritually-minded and contrite man , he had found how much irritation existed in the minds of those holy men at the madcap freaks of Morton and his ragamuffin subjects . The news which Gardiner had just gathered was very perplexing . The vessel which brought the intelligence seemed to have arrived at Plymouth directly after his last visit to that place , and he now found that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the Ludlows informed him that a new company of Puritans had obtained a patent from the New England Council , it seemed pretty certain that Sir Ferdinando 's efforts had been foiled , and that the contemplated dissolution of the New England Council and division of its territory was as far off as ever . This new movement disconcerted all his schemes . His plan , which to a sanguine and scheming nature like his , seemed not impracticable , of transferring the Plymouth company to Shawmut , to hold their territory  --  although that , of course , was to be kept a secret from them at present  --  under a grant from himself , when he should have become lord proprietor of the whole province ; and of occupying all the important points upon the coast with colonists upon whom he could rely , required a considerable reinforcement in men , money , and every kind of material from England . Concerning this matter he had repeatedly written to Sir Ferdinando , and he was anxiously expecting the arrival , during the summer , of at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had been accustomed to a life of adventure  --  who were to be occupied in building fortifications at first , and afterwards in agriculture , fishing , and Indian trading . Gardiner was at a loss how to act at present . Sir Ferdinando must have written to him , but his letters might be still at Plymouth ; or they might have been intrusted to some messenger ; or they might have been inclosed , as for particular reasons had sometimes been done , under cover to William Blaxton , the Solitary of Shawmut . While the knight was ruminating upon these matters , the day was fast declining . At the moment when he had parted from the Ludlows , he had intended to proceed immediately to his boat , which he had moored in a little cove about a mile from their residence . Lost in meditation , however , he had loitered in the forest longer than he had intended , and he was aroused at last upon perceiving the almost level beams of the sun piercing through the mighty pines around . Finding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave matters which immediately engaged his attention , to the marble brow and chiselled features of the beautiful Esther , he checked the vagrant current of his reflections , and hurried with a rapid and impatient step to the shore . He found his faithful Indian attendant seated in the boat , and wondering what had become of his master . Sketwarroes was an invaluable acquisition , which Gardiner had made in England . He had been one of a number of savages kidnapped in the south-eastern region of New England , by the infamous captain Hunt , and by him sold into slavery . He had been , however , rescued , brought to England , and protected by Sir Ferdinando Gorges , in whose service he had remained several years ; so that the English language being familiar to him , his services as an interpreter were very valuable to Gardiner , to whom his friend Sir Ferdinando had intrusted him . The sun went down , as the little boat , spreading her light sail to a faint easterly breeze , slowly cleft her way across the purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headland which interposes itself between Naumkeak and the outer promontory of Massachusetts Bay was rounded , and within an hour afterward it fell a flat calm , before a quarter of the little voyage had been completed . After watching the stars till past midnight , and waiting in vain for the faintest breath of wind from any quarter of the horizon , Gardiner abandoned the helm to Sketwarroes , wrapped himself in his cloak , and stretched himself calmly to sleep in the bottom of the boat . CHAPTER VIII . THE SOLITARY OF SHAWMUT . Upon the afternoon of that same day , a single figure sat upon the highest peak of the triple-headed promontory of Shawmut . Around him was spread the lovely panorama , which still , but with diminished beauty , surrounds the picturesque city of Boston . A solitary figure sat upon the summit of Shawmut . He was a man of about thirty years of age , somewhat above the middle height , slender in form , with a pale , thoughtful face . He wore a confused , dark-colored , half canonical dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an ancient palmer 's , and slouched back from his pensive brow , around which his prematurely grey hair fell in heavy curls , far down upon his neck . He had a wallet at his side , a hammer in his girdle , and a long staff in his hand . The hermit of Shawmut looked out upon a scene of winning beauty . The promontory resembled rather two islands than a peninsula , although it was anchored to the continent by a long slender thread of land , which seemed hardly to restrain it from floating out to join its sister islands , which were thickly strewn about the bay . The peak upon which the hermit sat , was the highest of the three cliffs of the peninsula ; upon the south-east , and very near him , rose another hill of lesser height and more rounded form , and upon the other side , and towards the north , a third craggy peak presented its bold and elevated front to the ocean . Thus the whole peninsula was made up of three lofty crags . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was derived the appellation of Trimountain , or Tremont , which it soon afterwards received . The vast conical shadows were projected eastwardly , as the hermit , with his back to the declining sun , looked out upon the sea . The bay was spread out at his feet in a broad semicircle , with its extreme headlands vanishing in the hazy distance , while beyond rolled the vast expanse of ocean , with no spot of habitable earth beyond those outermost barriers , and that far distant fatherland , which the exile had left forever . Not a solitary sail whitened those purple waves , and saving the wing of the sea gull , which now and then flashed in the sunshine , or gleamed across the dimness of the eastern horizon , the solitude was at the moment unbroken by a single movement of animated nature . An intense and breathless silence enwrapped the scene with a vast and mystic veil . The bay presented a spectacle of great beauty . It was not that the outlines of the coast around it were broken into those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where precipitous crag , infinite abyss , and roaring surge unite to awaken stern and sublime emotions ; on the contrary , the gentle loveliness of this transatlantic scene inspired a soothing melancholy , more congenial to the contemplative character of its solitary occupant . The bay secluded within its forest-crowned hills , decorated with its necklace of emerald islands , with its dark blue waters gilded with the rays of the western sun , and its shadowy forests of unknown antiquity , expanding into infinite depths around , was an image of fresh and virgin beauty , a fitting type of a new world , unadorned by art , unploughed by industry , unscathed by war , wearing none of the thousand priceless jewels of civilization , and unpolluted by its thousand crimes  --  springing , as it were , from the bosom of the ocean , cool , dripping , sparkling , and fresh from the hand of its Creator . On the left , as the pilgrim sat with his face to the east , the outlines of the coast were comparatively low , but broken into gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger island , in extent nearly equal to the peninsula of Shawmut , covered with mighty forest trees , and , at that day , untenanted by a human being  --  although but a short time afterwards it became the residence of a distinguished pioneer . Outside this bulwark , a chain of thickly wooded islets , stretched across from shore to shore , with but one or two narrow channels between , presenting a picturesque and effectual barrier to the boisterous storms of ocean . They seemed like naiads , those islets lifting above the billows their gentle heads , crowned with the budding garlands of the spring , and circling hand in hand , like protective deities about the scene . On the south , beyond the narrow tongue of land , which bound the peninsula to the main , and which was so slender that the spray from the eastern side was often dashed across it into the calmer cove of the west , rose in the immediate distance , that long boldly broken , purple-colored ridge , called the Massachusetts , or Mount Arrow Head , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cheviot Hills.On their left , and within the deep curve of the coast , were the slightly elevated heights of Passanogessit or Merry-Mount , and on their right stretched the broad forest , hill beyond hill , away . Towards the west and north-west , the eye wandered over a vast undulating panorama of gently rolling heights , upon whose summits the gigantic pine forests , with their towering tops piercing the clouds , were darkly shadowed upon the western sky , while in the dim distance , far above , and beyond the whole , visible only through a cloudless atmosphere , rose the airy summits of the Wachusett , Watatick , and Monadnock Mountains . Upon the inland side , at the base of the hill , the Quinobequin River , which Smith had already christened with the royal name of his unhappy patron , Charles , might be seen writhing in its slow and tortuous course , like a wounded serpent , till it lost itself in the blue and beautiful cove which spread around the whole western edge of the peninsula , and within the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced the bold and craggy promontory of Mishawum , where Walford , the solitary smith , had built his thatched and palisaded house . The blue thread of the River Mystic , which here mingled its waters with the Charles , gleamed for a moment beyond the heights of Mishawum , and then vanished into the frowning forest . Such was the scene , upon a bright afternoon of spring , which spread before the eyes of the solitary William Blaxton , the hermit of Shawmut . It was a simple but sublime image , that gentle exile in his sylvan solitude . It was a simple but sublime thought which placed him and sustained him in his lone retreat . In all ages , there seem to exist men who have no appointed place in the world . They are before their age in their aspirations , above it in their contemplation , but behind it in their capacity for action . Keen to detect the follies and the inconsistencies which surround them , shrinking from the contact and the friction of the rough and boisterous world without , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a regenerated and purified existence , they pass their nights in unproductive study , and their days in dreams . With intelligence bright and copious enough to illuminate and to warm the chill atmosphere of the surrounding world , if the scattered rays were concentrated , but with an inability or disinclination to impress themselves upon other minds , they pass their lives without obtaining a result , and their characters dwarfed by their distance from the actual universe , acquire an apparent indistinctness and feebleness , which in reality does not belong to them . The impending revolution in church and state , which hung like a gathering thundercloud above England 's devoted head , was exciting to the stronger spirits , whether of mischief or of virtue , who rejoiced to mingle in the elemental war , and to plunge into the rolling surge of the world 's events , while to the timid , the hesitating , and the languid , it rose like a dark and threatening phantom , scaring them into solitude , or urging them to seek repose and safety in obscurity . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their age , while still the current of the world flows rapidly past them . Of such men , and of such instincts , was the solitary who sat on the cliffs of Shawmut . Forswearing the country of his birth and early manhood , where there seemed in the present state of her affairs no possibility that minds like his could develop or sustain themselves  --  dropping as it were , like a premature and unripened fruit , from the bough where its blossoms had first unfolded  --  he had wandered into voluntary exile , with hardly a regret . Debarred from ministering at the altar to which he had consecrated his youth , because unable to comply with mummery at which his soul revolted , he had become a high-priest of nature , and had reared a pure and solitary altar in the wilderness . He had dwelt in this solitude for three or four years , and had found in the contemplation of nature , in the liberty of conscience , in solitary study and self-communing , a solace for the ills he had suffered , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . His spirit was a prophetic spirit , and his virtues belonged not to his times . In an age which regarded toleration as a crime , he had the courage to cultivate it as a virtue . In an age in which liberty of conscience was considered fearful licentiousness , he left his fatherland to obtain it , and was as ready to rebuke the intolerant tyranny of the nonconformist of the wilderness , as he had been to resist the bigotry and persecution of the prelacy at home . In short , the soul of the gentle hermit flew upon pure white wings before its age , but it flew , like the dove , to the wilderness . Wanting both power and inclination to act upon others , he became , not a reformer , but a recluse . Having enjoyed and improved a classical education at the university of Cambridge , he was a thorough and an elegant scholar . He was likewise a profound observer , and a student of nature in all her external manifestations , and loved to theorize and to dream in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders of the new world were to him the objects of unceasing speculation , and he loved to proceed from the known to the unknown , and to weave fine chains of thought , which to his soaring fancy served to bind the actual to the unseen and the spiritual , and upon which , as upon the celestial ladder in the patriarch 's vision , he could dream that the angels of the Lord were descending to earth from heaven . The day was fast declining , as the solitary still sat upon the peak and mused . He arose as the sun was sinking below the forest-crowned hills which girt his sylvan hermitage , and gazed steadfastly towards the west . " Another day , " he said , " hath shone upon my lonely path , another day hath joined the buried ages which have folded their wings beneath yon glowing west , leaving in their noiseless flight across this virgin world no trace nor relic of their passage . ' T is strange  --  ' t is fearful  --  this eternal and unbroken silence . Upon what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lands , even in the course of this single day 's career . Events , as thickly studded as the stars of heaven , have clustered and shone forth beneath his rays , even as his glowing chariot-wheels performed their daily course ; and here , in this mysterious and speechless world , as if a spell of enchantment lay upon it , the silence is unbroken , the whole face of nature still dewy and fresh . The step of civilization hath not adorned nor polluted the surface of this wilderness . No stately temples gleam in yonder valleys , no storied monument nor aspiring shaft pierce yonder floating clouds  --  no mighty cities , swarming with life , filled to bursting with the ten thousand attendants of civilized humanity , luxury and want , pampered sloth , struggling industry , disease , crime , riot , pestilence , death  --  all hotly pent within their narrow precincts  --  encumber yon sweeping plains ; no peaceful villages , clinging to ancient , ivy-mantled churches  --  no teeming fields , spreading their vast and nourishing bosoms to the toiling thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vesper bell , no peaceful low of the returning kine , no watch-dog 's bark , no merry shout of children 's innocent voices , no floating music from the shepherd 's pipe , no old familiar sounds of humanity , break on this listening ear . No snowy sail shines on yon eternal ocean , its blue expanse unruffled and unmarred as the azure heaven ; and ah  --  no crimson banners float the sky , and no embattled hosts shake with their martial tread this silent earth . ' T is silence and mystery all . Shall it be ever thus ? Shall this green and beautiful world , which so long hath slept invisibly at the side of its ancient sister , still wear its virgin wreath unsoiled by passion and pollution ? Shall this new , vast page in the broad history of man , remain unsullied , or shall it soon flutter in the storm-winds of fate , and be stamped with the same iron record , the same dreary catalogue of misery and crime , which fills the chronicle of the elder world ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lo is it not as if the universe , the narrow universe which bounded men 's thoughts in ages past , had swung open , as if by an almighty fiat , and spread wide its eastern and western wings at once , to shelter the myriads of the human race ? " The hermit arose , slowly collected a few simples which he had culled from the wilderness , a few roots of early spring flowers which he destined for his garden , and stored them in his wallet , and then grasping his long staff , began slowly to descend the hill . As the slender form of the exile , with his sad-colored garb and pilgrim 's scrip and staff , stood out in dark relief against the western sky , the only human figure in that solitude , he seemed almost a creation of the fancy , a pathetic but sublime image , contrasting and yet harmonizing in a wild and mystic sense with the wilderness scene around . He slowly descended the steep south-western declivity of the hill where he had so long been musing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there thickly overgrown with large trees , whose ponderous branches stretched across his path , presented a rough and uncertain footing to the wanderer . After a few minutes ' walk , he reached a wide and open glade , which was spread out at the base of the hill and along the secluded basin which received the waters of the Charles . The undulating surface of this grassy expanse was studded with many detached and magnificent forest trees , principally white oaks , hickory , and elms , and presented the appearance of a natural park of some fifty acres , fringed towards the water with a thick growth of maples , alders , and birches . At the base of the hill which rose abruptly to the north and east , facing southwardly upon the open park , and having the broad and beautiful cove upon its right , stood the cottage of Blaxton . It was a startling and impressive picture of cultivation and refinement that little cottage , embowered in freshly budding vines , surrounded by a garden laid out with artistic elegance , and backed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homestead , starting as if by magic out of the bosom of that vast wilderness , and stirring the deepest fountains of feeling with its placid beauty . It was the first gladdening footsteps of culture ; it was as if Minerva , mother of all humanizing arts , had according to the ancient fable , just stamped her foot upon the virgin soil and the olive of civilization had leaped forth to greet her coming . The house was built in those picturesque forms which were then so common in England . It was low-browed , irregular , rambling , with sharp-pointed gables , a red-tiled roof , small lattice windows with diamond panes , and a porch covered thickly with woodbines . The materials of which it had been constructed had been brought from England , and it resembled in its general character a miniature parsonage . The early swallows built their nests under its eaves , and the ancient crows with sable stole and solemn note circled about the surrounding pines , or rested in dark clusters upon their umbrageous tops . The young orchard had but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the exile had made his abode here , and the spring being earlier than common in that region , the pink flakes of the peach blossoms were strewn already upon the ground , while from the young and blushing buds upon the apple boughs a faint fragrance diffused itself upon the evening breeze . Between the cottage and the water 's edge stood a single pine of enormous height , the growth of centuries , its massive but tapering trunk , rising like a colossal shaft to a dizzy height , bare of branches till near the summit , and then throwing out those wild , wizard boughs , crowned with eternal verdure , and murmuring unceasing music , which make this tree so picturesque and remarkable . In the fork of one of these arms was the large and rudely raftered nest of an osprey or fish-hawk , who haunted the same spot year after year , unscared by the gentle hermit who had made him one of his most cherished companions . The precinct around the house , garden , and orchard was separated from the water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impenetrable fence of upturned roots , the skeleton remains of the forest giants which had been felled , or had fallen in natural decay , and was thus protected from the wolves and other enemies name=f285-103Page image - Page 086. by a natural and very effective barrier . Upon the western confine of this inclosure , and very near the pebbly margin of the shore , a pure and sparkling fountain , the silver spring from which the whole promontory of Shawmut derived its name , welled forth from the deep black mould , amid a thicket of shrubs and interlacing vines , and was overshadowed by a rustic arbor , which the graceful care of Blaxton had raised as a temple to the water nymph whom he looked upon as the presiding deity of his rural domain . Blaxton passed through the entrance to his hermitage , lingered a moment in his garden , and entered the house . A cheerful fire of hickory logs looked invitingly to him as he came in from the chill atmosphere . The room in which he sat was his innermost sanctuary . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptible library , and the tall dark folios , some two hundred in number , were ranged in a dark , antique , bookcase against the walls of the silent apartment . A large table , encumbered with books and manuscripts , stood in a corner , and an ample cabinet , stored with a considerable number of specimens of natural history , occupied a whole side of the room . " Welcome , friends of my solitude , " he exclaimed , as his eye looked complacently upon his dumb but eloquent companions . " Welcome , ye sages of the olden time ; welcome , ye bards whose strains , enshrined in the eternal crystal of a buried language , are ever redolent of youth and joy , breathing as freshly here upon this silent wilderness as once , attuned to classic lyres and gushing from the reedy voices of garlanded youths or dancing nymphs , amid shouts of martial triumph or bacchanalian rapture , they did thousands of years ago . Waked by the music of your immortal strains , these savage and solitary realms become instinct with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pours the sparkling water from her silver urn . Forth from the dim recesses of yon ancient wood , behold the graceful fawns trooping in mystic dances , beating the earth to the wild harmony of their clashing cymbals . In every tangled thicket lurk the leaping satyrs , through all the forest floats the rustic music of the hairy Pan , from every ancient oak or drooping elm starts forth a green-robed Dryad . What is it to me , that the solitude is unbroken by the voice of man ? Led by your hand , am I not surrounded and entranced by visions of a long vanished world ? And you , ye stern , rude chroniclers of later and darker ages , ye dark-cowled , cloistered monks , holding aloft , above the wild and barbarous deluge , ingulphing the world around you , the sacred torch of reason and of science ,  --  do ye not read to me a lesson of undying wisdom ? As I shudder at the dark tale of rapine , and the ceaseless conflict between brother men , the eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph of the evil spirits of our race , am I not taught to seek in solitude and self-communion for the solace which the world denies . And most of all , to thee , holy and blessed talisman , which alone art powerful to guide my tottering steps ; to thee , ever-gushing fountain of divine revelation ; to thee , comforter in sorrow , guide in danger , all-sufficient companion in the solitary valley of dark shadows , to thee do I look for support and consolation ; and most of all do I bless his holy name that hath vouchsafed to me this treasure . The Lord is my shepherd . I shall not want . " The yellow light of the fire fell fitfully upon the meek head of the recluse , as he sat upon his antique chair , bending over his clasped and illuminated bible . Late he sat within that secluded cell , immersed in sacred study , or indulging ever and anon in profound and enraptured reverie . The long , distorted shadows , projected by the various objects in the apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , monotonous ticking of an ancient clock which stood by the door , seemed to moralize with its iron tongue upon the steady but unheeded flight of time . The fire burned low , the wind of night sighed gently through the pine tops , and there was a faintly audible whisper , as the thin skeleton arms of the drooping elms which hung around the house , swept mournfully across the roof . Blaxton shut the book and gazed , lost in meditation , upon the smouldering firebrands . In the oppressive silence of that midnight solitude , the slightest sounds of nature seemed to acquire a vague importance . The dropping of a brand upon the hearth , the low hissing of the sap in the green logs , or the sigh of the breeze around the lattice , which sounded like an articulate , disembodied voice , would ever and anon cause the solitary to start and listen as if unseen spirits were holding communion with him . In that age of superstition , when a belief in supernatural visitation was universal , it was not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Blaxton , leading such a life of seclusion and study , being himself , as it were , an unreal and almost impossible phantom in the wild scene through which he seemed rather to flit like an apparition than to inhabit it like an earthly resident , should be free from the prevailing conviction of his times . Suddenly , as he mused by his fireside , there seemed to be a faint , inexplicable sound , as if a finger were drawn across the window-pane . His heart stood stock still , and for an instant he dared not raise his eyes towards the casement . He aroused himself , however , in a moment , and , without moving from his seat , strained his eyes upon the glass from whence the sound seemed to have proceeded . There was nothing there , save the wandering spray of a woodbine , moved by the wind and flickering in the sickly light of the late risen moon . It must have been his imagination . He composed himself again , and forcibly directed his thoughts to other matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemed not to have been produced by the swaying of the delicate vine . Presently the sound was repeated , and this time more audibly than before . He could not be mistaken , the glass of his casement was swept gently by human fingers . It was a low , strange sound , or something resembling rather the phantom of a sound , which jarred upon his nerves , and sent a shiver through his frame . It was as if spectral fingers were beckoning him to the window to look out perhaps upon some nameless horror which should freeze his blood . His heart , which had stood still before , now beat audibly in his bosom . He could hear its pulsations as distinctly as he could the slow tick of the clock which had been sounding monotonously on , and which now by its deep-throated , premonitory gurgle , seemed about to strike the hour of midnight . Again the sweeping spirit fingers stole along the glass . He sprang to his feet , gazed hurriedly at the window , and then stood as if changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him from without . He could see its features distinctly , and recognised them but too well , The phantom of one , too dearly loved , too early lost , was gazing upon him . The countenance wore a sad and warning expression , and the large , mournful eyes spoke of guilt and late remorse . Two white hands clung to the lattice and seemed to implore his forgiveness and pity with their mute supplication . It was a fearful thing for the solitary , thus at deep midnight , in the midst of that boundless desert , with his mind already filled with mystic fancies , engendered by his late reading and his prolonged reveries , to be confronted with what he could not but deem a visitant from the world of spirits . There is nothing more startling in the midnight solitude , than even the fancied apparition of a face looking in through our window from the external gloom , and to this lonely man there seemed not a doubt that this was an apparition . He stood as if transfixed . He essayed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth . He strove to move , to shake off , if he could , what perhaps was an incubus , a creation of a disordered fancy . His limbs refused to obey his will , his knees shook , but would neither advance or recede . How long he stood gazing at the phantom he could not tell , but after a time it seemed to clasp its hands above its head , and then to melt away into the darkness . What meant this visitation ? Did it bid him forth , for some mysterious reason , into the midnight wilderness ? He breathed more freely now that those sorrowful eyes were no longer gazing upon him ; his blood , which had been chilled in its current , now throbbed freely from his heart , his limbs regained their elasticity , his soul resumed its mastery . Impelled by an irresistible impulse , he sprang towards the door , breathing a fervent prayer for protection as he went . He passed rapidly through the little porch , emerged from its shadow into the moonlight , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon shed a mystic light upon the scene . An unaccountable and oppressive influence seemed to pervade the air . A sensation of being the victim of unseen mockery stole over him . The weird fantastic shapes of the vast roots , which inclosed his domain , looked , in the shifting and uncertain light , like a troop of squat and jeering demons . The owl shrieked , the boding whippoorwill uttered her ceaseless plaint , and the shrill , piercing cry of the tree toad struck upon his ear like the yell of a fiend . He strained his eyes in every direction , but nothing met his gaze that seemed to have connection or sympathy with his late mysterious visitant . The moonlight lay in faint patches among the shadows of the trees , but no semblance of humanity seemed to be stirring throughout the breathless solitude . After remaining in the cold night air for a few moments , he was turning back to his cottage , feeling more and more convinced that he had been the prey of some wild delusion , when suddenly , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alder thicket , and not far from the margin of the bay , he beheld the dim outline of a human figure , wildly extending its arms for an instant , and then hurriedly clasping its hands above its head , as it glanced swiftly as a flash through the moonlight , and then faded away into the dark shadow of the forest . For a moment , the hermit , who was excited , but less perturbed , by this second apparition , was inclined to follow the phantom into the morass , where it had seemed to melt away . He restrained himself , however , and stood still upon the spot , gazing steadfastly upon the dark and tangled thicket where the mysterious figure had disappeared . But there was no farther indication of its presence . After remaining till he was chilled with the bleak night air , and exhausted with excitement , he became convinced that , whatever it might betoken , the phantom had at last vanished . He fell upon his knees to offer a devout prayer for guidance and support , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight moments , he walked languidly into the house . As the door closed after him , the faint plash of an oar seemed to float , for an instant , from the cove , and then all was still again . See Note III . See Note IV . CHAPTER IX . SYMPATHY AND ANTIPATHY . It was natural that Esther should be looking with as much eagerness , although with widely different motives , for a confirmation of the intelligence by their own private letters , as did Sir Christopher Gardiner . Truly it seemed a strange destiny which had brought these two powerful spirits , so contrasted , into such recent and accidental conjunction . An imaginative temper might have figured these two personages , thus , as it were , hovering about the cradle of an infant state , the mysterious and threatening form of the knight , the angelic figure of the maiden , thus floating in strange proximity , as the embodiments of the two great conflicting elements of our nature . Like a dark enchanter and a beneficent fairy , like an evil genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences seemed fated to some mystic conflict  --  who could foretell its duration or its result ? As Esther looked forth from the door-step along the glade , which had so recently witnessed her conflict with the wolf , and her rescue by some unknown but unforgotten deliverer , she saw the figure of a man in Puritan habiliments , just emerging from the corner of the forest . She supposed at first that it was Sir Christopher Gardiner coming to renew his inquiries , but before she had time to call to her brother , whose presence she desired at all their future interviews , she observed that she was mistaken . The new comer , although above the middle height , was by no means so tall as Gardiner , and moved with a languid gait , very different from the knight 's lithe movements . His steeple-crowned hat was slouched deeply upon his brows , so as almost entirely to conceal his features  --  his garments were old and travel stained , and he supported his feeble steps upon a staff . He appeared , however , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his frame , muscular and well knit , seemed to belie his drooping deportment . He gravely saluted Esther as he approached . " Is this the residence of Walter Ludlow ? " he asked in a husky voice . " It is , " said Esther ; " have you business with my brother ? " " And you are Esther Ludlow , " he continued , in a low hesitating tone , looking upon the ground as he spoke , and , as it would seem , laboring under some kind of embarrassment . " I am Esther Ludlow , " replied the maiden , " but you seem fatigued , good brother . By your garb you should be from Plymouth  --  and you must have travelled far to-day . Enter , I pray you , into the house ; my brother is now in the neighborhood , and will insist that a travelling stranger like yourself should partake his hospitality . " " You are very kind , good maiden , but my frame is , perhaps , not so languid as it seems  --  I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . " " The twilight , " said Esther , " will soon be upon us . Enter our house and refresh yourself . It is the hour of our evening meal , and my brother will soon be here . " The stranger seemed reluctant to enter the house . He lingered near the door-step , unwilling to accept Esther 's proffered hospitality , and yet seeming slow to declare his errand . He seemed oppressed by some secret emotion . " My brother will deem himself ill treated , if you decline the shelter of our humble roof this night , " continued Esther , " The night is approaching , the air is already growing keen , the wilderness is full of danger to a lonely wayfarer . " " The dangers of the wilderness are not those which I most fear , " answered the stranger enigmatically , and in the same husky tone . " But I have forgotten myself strangely , " he continued , as he observed something like suspicion floating about the clear brow of his companion . " My business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her brother . A vessel has arrived at Plymouth , and I have been intrusted by the man of God , our worthy governor and brother , to deliver one or two packets to the scattered indwellers of the wilderness . Lo ! here is that which beareth the superscription of Esther Ludlow . " The humble and toil-worn stranger drew two parcels from his bosom , as he spoke , and handed them respectfully to the maiden . Esther with eager thanks snatched the proffered epistles , one of which was addressed to herself , and one to her brother , and hastily breaking the seals of her own dispatch , she found , with delight , that it inclosed four different letters . She hurriedly examined the handwriting of each , and then laid them all down with a heavy sigh . " From him alone not one line of remembrance , not one word of regret , " she murmured . The tears came into the proud eyes of Esther , and with the letters all unopened upon her lap , she sat like a beautiful statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble , and her features working with the expression of subdued but deep emotion . For a moment she seemed totally unaware of the presence of the stranger . The eagerness with which she had opened the dispatch vanished , her anxiety to hear all the details of the great movement , in which she felt so intense an interest , had apparently subsided into indifference , and , lost in sorrowful thought , she seemed heedless of all , save the one feeling , which exclusively occupied her mind . While she remained apparently unconscious of all that was passing before her , the stranger stood , gazing intently upon her , from beneath the slouched hat which concealed his features . His presence seemed to have been wholly forgotten , or she might have perhaps felt some surprise that the feeble , toil-worn wanderer should prefer to stand thus transfixed and motionless before her , rather than seek repose and refreshment in the house . She aroused herself at last with an effort , mechanically lifted one of her letters , and broke the seal . The trifling physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thoughts , and to arouse her interest in the weighty matters which had so recently occupied her mind . She began to read one of the letters with avidity , when suddenly she remembered the stranger , and turned her eyes full upon him . She blushed , she knew not why , as she saw him thus immovably gazing upon her ; but as he seemed embarrassed and unwilling to meet her glance , she merely attributed the strangeness of his deportment to awkwardness . " In sooth , " said she , " I have strangely forgotten my duty . You will have but a lame account to give of the hospitality of Naumkeak when you return to the brethren of Plymouth . If you persist in refusing the shelter of our roof , at least suffer me to bring you some trifling refreshment ; and I pray you to repose your wearied limbs on yonder bench for a little time before you proceed upon your journey . " " A crust of bread and a cup of cold water , " continued the stranger in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crust of bread and a cup of cold water is all that I require , and I shall crave your pardon if I take this refreshment upon the outside of your domicil . I have yet far to travel to night , and I will repose for a moment upon this bench . " With this the stranger seated himself , and Esther went for a moment into the house . She soon re-appeared , bringing the simple food which he had desired , and placed it upon the bench beside him . " With your leave , " said she , " I will even glance over the contents of this letter , while you are reposing and refreshing yourself . " As she spoke , Esther again resumed the letter which she had opened , and became absorbed in the contents . Meanwhile the stranger sat with untasted bread , hiding his face with his hands , and gazing upon the excited features of the beautiful Puritan , as if he would have read her soul . " Then they have not yet sailed , " she murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her letters . " Endicott is to set forth in June , and with him Gott and Brakenbury and Davenport , and other good and true men  --  and much opposition is expected from certain friends of Sir Ferdinando Gorges  --  the knight and his powerful party are supposed to be moving heaven and earth to prevent the king 's grant of a charter  --  he is thought already to have sent his emissaries to this country  --  two worthy and learned clergymen , Master Higginson and Master Skelton have agreed to embark in the  --  ; Holy Father of Mercy ! Henry Maudsley in New England ! " The letter dropped from her hands as she uttered this exclamation ; and her eyes filled with tears as she murmured , " Then I did him wrong ; one cause alone could bring Henry Maudsley to New England . " " Aye , Esther , but one cause , " said a deep , familiar voice at her side . Esther started , grew pale as ashes , and trembled like a leaf . She looked towards the stranger . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced very near to her , his tattered cloak was thrown aside , his hat had fallen to the ground , revealing the well-remembered face of Harry Maudsley . " Aye , Esther , but one cause , " he cried , while she seemed contending with a variety of emotions , among which pride seemed at length to gain the mastery , suppressing her tears , smoothing her agitated brow and restoring a faint tinge to her marble cheek . " Forgive me , " he continued in an impassioned tone , " that I have dared to appear in this disguise before you . It was accident which prompted it , as it was accident which first revealed to me the place of your residence , when I deemed you an inhabitant of the Plymouth Colony . " " And was it accident , too , " replied Esther , who had by a strong effort recovered a portion of her calmness , " and was it accident that brought Henry Maudsley into these wild deserts ? " " No , Esther , " was the reply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet believe me , that although impelled across half a world by a passion which I have struggled to conquer , till at last it has conquered me , although brought to your feet by an impulse which I could no longer resist , yet , believe me , I had no unmanly , no unworthy motives in this disguise . " " And yet , " answered Esther , " false robes should never hide a true heart . If , as I am willing to believe , I was the motive of your exile , why steal thus masked into my presence , why treacherously surprise my unguarded thoughts ? " " Again I implore you to forgive me , Esther , " replied Maudsley . " I had been longer than you think a resident in this neighborhood , not dreaming that you were so near me . A poor wayfaring pilgrim , whom I chanced to rescue from indignity , had been intrusted with letters addressed to you and to others . Learning thus unexpectedly the place of your residence , I could not resist the temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet it would have been easy for you , " answered Esther , " to have made your appearance long ago , and without disguise . " " Aye , " answered Maudsley , " and one constituted as you , can not perhaps conceive of the wayward and perverse impulses of a temperament like mine . Although I had crossed a winter 's sea in a miserable bark , only that I might throw myself once more at your feet , yet no sooner did I find myself in the same wilderness with you , then I began almost to shrink from our interview . " " This is indeed strange , " said Esther calmly . " And it is strange , too , " continued Maudsley , " that a miser should starve among uncounted riches . Why did I hoard , like a treasure , the golden moments of our meeting ? I know not . At last , influenced by a rebellious feeling at the power which I felt you exercised over my whole nature , and assisted by the singular accident which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once more to listen to your voice , and then to tear myself away forever . " " Maudsley , " replied Esther sorrowfully , " your character remains as wilful and as enigmatical as ever . Why then did you not execute your purpose ? " " Because , " was the passionate reply , " because unintentionally I had surprised a secret dearer to me than the whole world beside . When I found that I had not been entirely forgotten , when I heard your gentle voice breathing my name , when , as you believed , there was not an ear in the whole wilderness to hear you , judge if it were then in my power to tear myself away . " It is unnecessary to record at length the conversation of the lovers . It may be believed that the displeasure of Esther at Maudsley 's disguise was not very difficult to appease ; and it may be believed , too , that she was deeply affected by the evidence which he had given of his constancy and his devotion to herself . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , there were a thousand matters to excite their interest , about which Esther , who had now been so long in exile , was desirous to be informed . " You have told me nothing of yourself , Henry , " said she , " nor of your friends . You have not told me how the world hath prospered with those who are nearest and dearest to you at home . Your sister , is she still so sad and broken-spirited , or doth she recover from the heavy blow ? " " My sister is dead , " answered Maudsley , mechanically , but in a deep and gloomy voice . " Dead ! is Edith dead ? so young  --  so beautiful  --  so gentle  --  so virtuous . Has she so soon gone down in sorrow to her grave ! Though I never enjoyed but a slight and passing acquaintance with her , yet I could weep with you , Henry , for I know how much you were to each other , and I know how much affection , and how many pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not weep for her , " said her companion , in a moody but composed tone . " You see I do not weep for her . She has been released from a life of suffering ; nay , more , " added Maudsley , in a hoarser tone , " she has been released from a life of unmerited but deep disgrace . Virtuous , high-spirited , as she was , it was better that she should sink at once into her grave , rather than creep through an obscure life , bowed to the earth with shame that was not hers , and with tears of blood lamenting that she had ever seen the light of day . " " And her husband ? " " Her husband , " cried Maudsley , grinding his teeth with a passionate expression , and uttering his words slowly , one by one , as if they fell like drops of blood from his heart  --  " her husband has fled . The villain has escaped me . I have sought him long , but he has still eluded my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not die ; and if he be still upon the living earth , I will yet track him to his lair . The blood of my murdered sister cries out to me from the ground . My heart is not deaf to the appeal . " " Alas , Henry , " said Esther , " vengeance belongeth only to God . Vengeance is his , and he will repay . Believe me , that it is not wise nor well thus to constitute yourself the avenger even of one so deeply injured . Think you , that he who hath been the wicked cause of all this misery shall escape God 's wrath ? But tell me , Henry , was the fearful mystery ever solved , which rendered your sister 's marriage a nullity , and thus blasted her happiness and laid her in an untimely grave ? " " It was so , " answered Maudsley , in the same calm but gloomy tone . " The mystery was solved , at least in part ; solved sufficiently to teach my sister that there was no relief except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at this time and place need not be repeated ; but you shall know it all . Suffice it now , when I inform you , that their marriage was indeed a nullity because  --  " and as he spoke , Maudsley 's voice subsided into a hoarse whisper , which , however , fell distinctly upon Esther 's ear , " because there was another gentle and earlier claimant for the honored hand of her husband . " As he spoke these words , Maudsley laughed with a low , savage laugh , that chilled the blood of his companion . " There were other matters too , but I will not now spread aught of the foul mass before your eyes . Suffice it , that the villain has escaped , for you know that I was unfortunately absent during the whole of these transactions , but while he exists , the fires of hell could not burn out the record of his guilt . Let us speak no more of this , dear Esther , " continued Maudsley , shaking off the dark shadow from his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivacious tone which was natural to him . " Let us speak no more of this , but of you . The dead are in their graves , where the broken-hearted sleep well . But do not , in mercy do not , persist in your sad determination to entomb yourself thus body and soul together in these gloomy deserts . With every day which finds your stay prolonged , the cold enchantment seems to wind itself more and more about your senses . Arouse yourself ere your blood be chilled and your brain bewildered . Promise me , dearest Esther , that I may return and bear you from this fearful world . " " I had hoped , " said Esther , " that we had done with this subject , upon which it is impossible that our hearts should ever beat in unison . Distress me , I beseech you , no farther , and believe that my decision is irrevocable . " It will appear from these last observations , that the lovers , in spite of the knowledge of their mutual affections , were as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England . The impetuosity and wilfulness of Maudsley 's character were as incorrigible as the calm but almost infatuated enthusiasm of Esther was inflexible . It had been her lover 's object throughout their whole interview , to induce her to forswear the purpose to which she had devoted her life . He represented to her in the most passionate terms the cruelty to herself , to him , to her brother , to all the world , of which she was guilty in thus encloistering herself for life in that dreary wilderness . He painted in the most glowing colors , which a lively fancy could suggest , the delights which might yet be theirs , surrounded at home by all the enjoyments of affluence in a civilized land . His words fell coldly , more than coldly upon Esther 's ear . It was not that she was an enthusiast , and therefore , like many enthusiasts , a bigot ; for this her nature was too feminine . But she was more and more convinced that the dissimilarity of their characters and ruling motives , was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she deemed most high and holy upon earth in his eyes was trivial or false . While he could not help respecting her enthusiasm , he looked upon it as madness , and could not avoid expressing , in indignant language , his abhorrence of the influences by which her whole existence was sacrificed to the maintenance of a pernicious and an absurd idea . All his social relations , his whole education , all the influences under which he had existed since boyhood , had taught him to look upon Puritanism as an uncouth and uncomfortable fanaticism . His mind revolted at the thought that a woman like Esther Ludlow , partly in deference to the feelings of a moody and weakminded brother , partly in sympathy with a perverse movement of the age , should bury all her graces in this living sepulchre . His pride too had been aroused , and in crossing the ocean his purpose had been fixed  --  he had vowed in his heart to tear Esther from the wilderness to which she had devoted herself , and to bear her home in triumph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funereal pyre , as a victim exposed in the desert to appease the wrath of a fabulous dragon , and he felt a thousand hearts swelling within him , as he swore to rescue her from her impending fate . The quarrel which had occurred between them long before in England , was of a nature which was almost irremediable , because it had for the first time torn aside the veil from both their hearts , and revealed to each other the gulf which in reality flowed between them . The sneering indignation which Maudsley had allowed himself to express against the infatuation of Walter Ludlow , and the influence which it had exercised upon the mind of his sister , had led to a more full development of their feelings , and Maudsley learned for the first time , with anger and dismay , the extent of what he designated Esther 's fanaticism . Between two natures , both proud , while the determination of the one was fully matched by the impetuosity of the other , it may be easily imagined that the chasm must have grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this time , to relate much more of their present interview , farther than to say , that they found each other unchanged in feelings , and yet unchanged in purpose . Esther 's nature revolted at the sacrifice of all her convictions and purposes , which was demanded of her almost imperiously by her wilful lover ; while he , despite the words of affection which had fallen from her lips when there could have been no intention to deceive , felt his pride engaged in the contest , and could not help arguing to himself , that , after all , that affection must be calm and passionless , which possessed not sufficient power to conquer her religious fanaticism . Suddenly , while these thoughts were passing through his mind , another thought suggested itself to him . With startling abruptness he requested to know who was the fortunate personage in Puritan habiliments , who had lifted her from the ground at the time when she had so nearly escaped destruction by the wolf . Although at the moment when the adventure happened Maudsley had not the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now felt a certainty under the circumstances that the female whom he had rescued from danger could have been no other than Esther . Esther was almost overpowered , when she was thus suddenly informed that it was to Maudsley 's arm that her safety upon that occasion had been owing ; but even while she was murmuring her broken expressions of gratitude , Maudsley impetuously repeated his question . " Led hither , " said he , " by a mysterious fate , I was yet too far removed to recognise either your own countenance or that of your sable-suited admirer . It was not your brother  --  the stranger was far taller than Walter Ludlow . Rebuke my impetuosity , if you like , but you can not wonder that I should be desirous of learning the name of one who appeared to stand toward you in such near and dear relationship . " " Master Maudsley , " replied Esther , with cold dignity , " I have no hesitation in informing you , that the individual whom you saw upon this spot is not in near or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought hither upon that day by some trifling business with my brother . He is , I believe , a member of no church community , although he seems a man of a religious and even ascetic disposition . He is a person , however , whose society I am very far from affecting . " " How call you his name ? " asked Maudsley , eagerly . " He is called Sir Christopher Gardiner , " answered Esther . " Sir Christopher Gardiner , " cried Maudsley , with a strange sharp cry , as if a dagger had been plunged into his heart . " Sir Christopher Gardiner , the associate of Esther Ludlow ! Idiot that I was , not to have suspected this before , " continued he to himself , in an undertone . He mastered his emotion , however , by a strong effort , and forcibly directed the conversation , for a few moments , into other channels . There was , however , a baleful and inexplicable spell exercised upon his nature , by the very name of Sir Christopher Gardiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united with a real knowledge of certain matters which inspired distrust and even hatred , filled his soul whenever the image of the mysterious knight was presented to him . It would be premature at this time , to say more than that he felt a strong , although , to a certain degree , a mysterious repugnance , to the character of that adventurer , and a sensation of horror at finding him in communion with Esther Ludlow . His disordered fancy would not , for a long time , obey the dictates of his reason , and after a few moments of broken and incoherent conversation , during which the wonder , indignation , and pity of Esther were alternately excited , he found at last that it was impossible for him any longer to repress his agitation . Muttering a curse upon his weakness , and upon the folly which had led him across the ocean , only to exhibit and proclaim it the more , he uttered aloud a few hasty and common-place expressions of farewell , and then abruptly quitted the presence of Esther , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this singular interview . The dark shadows of evening were already descending upon the earth , as Maudsley , yielding to the tumultuous torrent of his emotions , strode down the glade with wild rapidity , as if lashed forth into the outer darkness by furies . He dashed violently across the open space which lay immediately before him , and plunged into the gloomy arches of the pine forest . The eternal shade , the cold and fragrant breath of the mighty grove , conveyed no coolness to his heated brow , no soothing balm to the fever in his soul . Stung by a multitude of torturing fancies , which writhed and coiled like serpents from his heart , he swept rapidly through the dim and silent wood . He fled like a coward before the phantom shapes of his excited imagination . Was it for this , that he had sacrificed or was ready to sacrifice his all , home , country , friends , ease , wealth , ambition , pleasure ? Was it for this , that he had been ready , though he avowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and bury himself in the vast cloisters of the secluded wilderness ? Was it for this , that he had struggled so long and so bravely with his feelings , only to find himself at last , the laughing-stock of a hypocritical , mysterious adventurer , whom he had found to his horror , or whom he imagined that he had found his successful rival . It was strange , but with only the most casual acquaintance with Gardiner , Maudsley had , from the first , conceived an indefinable hatred for him , which , moreover , as he fancied , had been as cordially reciprocated . He had , when occasionally in his presence , been overcome by a singular and unaccountable sensation , and had found himself , urged by he knew not what strange fascination , gazing intently upon his face , and striving to call up some dim , vague , long faded impression of earlier years . In such times , he had been oppressed by a supernatural sense of previous existence , fantastically united with a boding presentiment of the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the unknown hereafter , which troubled him , he knew not how or why , and which seemed as it were , a spell exercised upon him by the dark physiognomy of the knight . But his sensations now were real , or he deemed them such . Here was the mystery of Gardiner 's existence solved ; here was the hidden reason of his enigmatical and apparently aimless residence in this wilderness ; here was the cause of all this masquerading , his double-faced contradictory mode of life , his solitary journeys , his sudden absences . It was plain as light . He had wondered at his Puritanism , or at what he had always considered his affectation of Puritanism  --  he wondered no longer . It was the love of Esther Ludlow , which he sought in the depths of these deserts . It was the love of Esther Ludlow which worked these sudden and bewildering transformations . Was it strange ? Was it unnatural ? Did he not himself acknowledge but too truly the potency of the spell ? He shuddered when he contemplated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hers . In what a gulf of desolation would her trusting heart be wrecked ! He checked himself for a moment as he was speeding breathlessly on , curbed the career of his insane thoughts , and endeavored forcibly to dismiss the subject from his mind . What was it all to him ? He had torn himself from the presence of Esther , and he had internally vowed , that the charm should be forever broken , which had bound him so long . What then to him was Gardiner 's character , or his mystery , or his way of life ? Let him be the devil if he would , and if the pure-hearted Puritan maiden chose to devote her white soul to the fiend , what mattered it to him , when , how , or why , the unholy contract should be completed ? On , on the fled once more through the mirky night , a fugitive from his own thoughts , which seemed like spectres to people the gloomy glades of the forest . CHAPTER X. THE MISHAWUM GIANT RECEIVES COMPANY . Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mishawum , was standing alone at his wilderness forge . The promontory of Mishawum was a narrow tongue of land , thrust boldly out into the bay , having the Mystic River on its northern , and the Charles River on its southern side , and advancing very closely to the craggy heights of Shawmut . Like its neighbor peninsula , Mishawum was a rough , precipitous spot of ground , with vast granite rocks frowning here and there through the masses of pine and cedar , which with white and black oak , hickory , birch , and maple , covered its sides with wild and ancient verdure . Thomas Walford has already been presented to the reader 's acquaintance . His residence , consisting of a thatched log-house , with a kind of shed or shanty which he called his forge , was surrounded by a strong palisade of cedar trunks , ten feet in height and driven deeply into the earth . The general aspect of the place , as may be easily conceived , was wild , rugged , and solitary . The house stood not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a high and precipitous hill which sloped boldly down into the bay , and the prospect , excepting the remarkable feature of the triple-headed , craggy peninsula opposite , which of course presented a more striking and picturesque effect , when seen from this distance , was very much the same as that which was spread before the eyes of the solitary of Shawmut . The burly smith stood in his half-subterranean and rustic shanty , whose low thatched roof was supported by the twisted and rugged stems of cedars . The glare of a brilliant fire fell upon his bull-fronted , shaggy head , his rude and swarthy features , and his massive half-naked bust , while the rest of his leathern clad person was in dark and heavy shadow . He was striking millions of sparks from a ponderous and red-hot bar of iron , at every stroke of his heavy sledge-hammer , and as he stood there in his hairy strength , the only human figure in that solitary retreat , he looked more like some gigantic creature of heathen mythology , some half fabulous Cyclops forging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real and tangible mass of human flesh . Although Walford was the only European inhabitant of the little peninsula where we find him , and which , as has been seen , he held under the Gorges patent , the place and the neighborhood were frequented from time to time by straggling parties of Indians , who were under the nominal jurisdiction of a peaceable and amiable young sagamore , who had already formed friendly connections with the scattered residents of the bay . The natives generally entertained a considerable respect for the blacksmith , who , although very good-natured , and never disposed to quarrel with them unnecessarily , had yet occasionally been known to inflict severe chastisement upon some of their number who had presumed to meddle with him . The smith paused for a moment , as the plash of oars sounded from the water immediately below him , and listened to learn if perchance any visitors were about to claim his hospitality that morning . He supposed , however , for he did not take the trouble to go to the verge of the cliff to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoes upon the beach below , for the sake of baking clams , frying fish , boiling lobsters , or for some other peaceful and culinary purpose , and he had ceased to trouble himself any more about the matter , when all at once he heard footsteps scrambling up the steep ascent , and the sound of several English voices sounding nearer and nearer to his own precincts . Presently there was a loud rapping at his outer gate . " Hillo , hillo , hillo , Master Walford ! " sounded through the palisades . " Hillo , hillo , " answered the smith , without stirring from his anvil . " Who makes such a pother at this early hour in the morning ? " " Open thy gates , thou inhospitable smith , " said a deep , muddy voice , which evidently had soaked through the frowzy beard of Robert Bootefish . " Dost mean to treat thy loving friends and Christian neighbors as pagan Indians or heathen Puritans ? Here be I , firstly , and secondly Master Humphrey Rednape , with your friends Cakebread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They will call me Canary Bird , Master Smith , " whistled a shrill voice through the palisade , " though they know as well as you that my name is Bernaby Doryfall . But for the love of good fellowship let us in . Fear nothing here ; we are but honest friends and Christian white men . " " Walk in , my masters , " said the burly smith , in a good-humored voice , swinging wide open the gate to admit his visitors . " Good morrow , Master Smith , " said Bootefish , saluting his host with great dignity , as , followed by his three companions , he waddled through the gates , with the stately importance of a plethoric duck . " You have , I think , met with these worthy gentlemen before . Look you , this be Rednape , a swashing knave , and a godly but a drunken sot , and a quarreller in his liquor . And this be Peter Cakebread , a wise fellow , I promise you , and well-instructed and witty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his heels if he could , to prevent it from following and frightening him forever . And here , this yellow-coated , piping , whistling little gentleman , is the Canary Bird . " " They call me Cana  --  " " Hold your tongue , sot , " interposed the chief butler of Merry-Mount , indignant at the interruption , as the poor little Canary Bird was beginning to chirp his favorite tune . " Ye are all heartily welcome , my masters , " said the smith after the ceremonious Bootefish had concluded his introductory harangue ; " and now , if each of you will seat himself upon the softest stump he can find , we will , if you like , proceed to business . What brings you here so early in the morning , Master Bootefish ? " " Master Morton of Merry-Mount , " began the Canary Bird . " Hold your tongue , again , thou impudent yellow-breasted biped , " interrupted the butler , " and allow your superior to answer all questions directed to him . Is it thus I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasuring this fine morning ? Have I not bountifully permitted you the healthful recreation of rowing all the way from Passanogessit ? for the devil an oar have I pulled that you might all be gratified , and now is this my reward ? Be silent all . Good master smith , I pray your indulgence upon these malapert young followers of mine . " " A truce to your apologies , " said the blacksmith , " and now if there be one among you who hath brains enough , I pray to be informed of the purpose of your visit to my humble abode this morning . What would ye of me , Master Bootefish , for in truth thou alone seemest possessed of a sufficient amount of gravity and sobriety to answer a grave and sober question ? " " I praise Heaven , " answered the respectable Bootefish , in answer to this address , " I praise Heaven that I am grave and sober , and , as you remark , the only person of gravity and sobriety in this worshipful company . Know then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Thomas Walford , that we have been specially deputed by his worship , Master Thomas Morton , armigero and lord of the manor of Merry-Mount , to bid you to certain mid-summer night revels , which we propose to keep at the said manor of Merry-Mount , to begin at five of the clock upon the morrow evening , and to continue throughout the May-day , which immediately succeedeth , and as many hours longer as the butt holdeth out . " " And be this all which bringeth you here this morning , ye devil 's crew ? " said the courteous blacksmith to his guests . " Have I not already been bidden to your mid-summer revels for May-day , as this pudding-brained Bootefish hath it , and must my privacy be disturbed for such a marvellous piece of information ? Know , then , that I have already promised your Master of Misrule to visit him to-morrow , and with that take yourselves off . Away , ye buffoons ; yet stop awhile , your throats shall be moistened before you go . " So saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring which was fastened into a large square stone in the corner of his shanty , and lifting the rough and ponderous granite slab as easily as if it had been the lid of a snuff-box , he suddenly disappeared , like some eastern enchanter , into the entrails of the earth . When he returned , he bore an earthen jug in his hand , out of which he filled a pewter can of ample dimensions for each of his guests , and pledging them himself from the mouth of the jug , he exclaimed , " There , my merrymen all , taste ye the rosa solis , which hath been ripened in the bowels of the wilderness . What sayest thou , Robin Bootefish , is it potent ? " " Truly good , Master Walford , " said the pompous butler , his elephant eyes twinkling with delight , " truly thou hast laid bare a fountain of unequalled purity ; thou hast laid up a treasure in the earth ; thou hast found a mine of virgin gold in the entrails of the desert . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Peter Cakebread drained his measure of the potent fluid at a single draught , gasped for breath as if he had swallowed a sword , according to his paternal avocation , and then with his toad-like eyes , glittering and almost darting from his leathern face , he exclaimed ,  --  " Thou marvellous ogre of Mishawum ! Thou potent enchanter ! Let me worship thee . Truly it is comforting to see so sweet and spiritual a resurrection from beneath you mighty tombstone . Come then to Merry-Mount , and be king over us , most stalwart smith , for truly he who can compel such spirits from the bosom of the earth should fitly rule his fellows . " To this spontaneous indication of fealty to himself , or rather to his subterranean treasures , the blacksmith made no further answer than by filling each man 's goblet again , and bidding them drink it off and begone . Thus conjured , the respectable party of visitors , having again done due honor to the blacksmith 's cellar , bade their host farewell . The blacksmith closed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after listening for a moment to their confused shouting and hallooing as they descended the precipitous hills , helter-skelter , now tumbling over each other , now quarrelling , now laughing , now cursing , he stepped calmly back to his forge . " Truly an ill-begotten pack of drunken knaves , " said he to himself , as he lustily plied the bellows and resumed the occupation which had been interrupted . " This Master Morton is like to raise trouble now for himself , by keeping such a nest of buzzing hornets to swarm about the country , disturbing every honest man in his business . Small love do I bear yonder Plymouth crop-ears , yet I swear by my stedge-hammer , I had rather consort with psalm-singers than with such brawling , drunken vermin . Thank fortune , I am fairly rid of them for to-day ; but stay  --  what mean these shouts yonder ? Heaven forefend the hornets be not all buzzing back again about mine ears . Stay , that was the yell of a red-breech . " In truth , during the worthy blacksmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audible in his sylvan retreat . For a few moments after the last shouts of his departing visitors had died away beneath the hill , there had been an absolute silence . It was , however , soon broken by a confused din of angry shouts , ferocious execrations , clashing weapons , reports of fire-arms , and that shrill , unearthly , fiendlike yell of the savage , which seems to blend into one cry the guttural trill of a Tyrolese mountaineer with the long howl of a famished wolf . " The drunken varlets are squabbling with the savages , " said the smith , after listening attentively . " Have a care , my masters , or mayhap ye may find the Mishawum red-skins not so easily tamed as your Passanogessit savages ! Yonder coppernosed Bootefish may chance to find himself without a scalp to his wooden head before he gets home to his ale butt . By my beard , he would gain by the loss of it , for methinks his wits be mightily in need of airing , and I marvel how the fog is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little daylight be let into it with a tomahawk . Fore George ! but there be swinging blows and bloody coxcombs passing about by this time , I warrant me , " concluded the smith , as the noise of the scuffle became gradually louder and more distinct , while the contending parties appeared to be struggling nearer to the blacksmith 's abode . The worthy blacksmith , who had no particular desire that his solitude should again be interrupted by the drunken foolery of his late visitors , was yet something curious as to the cause of the uproar . As he was , however , about sallying forth to investigate the matter , the sounds seemed suddenly to cease . Either the contest , whatever it might have been , was terminated , or the scene had been shifted to a more distant spot . He accordingly relinquished his intention , and went on with his work for a few minutes , until he was again aroused by confused shouts , yells , and a variety of other disturbing sounds , which again arrested his attention . CHAPTER XI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Walford to himself , suddenly abandoning his forge , and advancing towards a look-out which he had built for himself within the precincts ; " beshrew me , but there seems to be warm work going on yonder . Of a surety yon vagabonds have incensed by their devil 's tricks , some straggling party of my red-legged friends . Peaceable they be and well disposed to those whom they have learned to respect ; but the Lord preserve the scalps of such as meddle with them without need . " With these words he ascended his rustic watch-tower , and looked out upon every side . He was apparently not long in arriving at a conclusion as to the state of the case , for after remaining but a few moments in his elevated position , he descended with great rapidity , put on a huge iron head-piece , and arming himself with his sledge-hammer , strode resolutely towards his gate , unbarred its fastening , and sallied forth in the direction of the din which had now subsided again into a confused and discordant murmur . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heights , descended from the elevation upon which his solitary abode was situated , and after tearing his way through the tangled thickets which obstructed his passage , he emerged at length upon a low , open plain , which , studded with a few large oak trees , expanded itself upon the southern and south-eastern base of the crag where his hermitage was placed . When he arrived there , he found a very peculiar scene exhibited to his observation . Upon the plain were assembled some half dozen savages , belonging , as he well knew by their costume , to the scattered tribe who inhabited the neighborhood of his peninsula . They had evidently that morning established a temporary encampment , as a single wigwam , hastily constructed of oak saplings fastened into the earth , with their boughs bent together at the top , and covered over with coarse matting , formed the central point of the scene . The savages were all young , active , clean-limbed men . Although tall , stout , and evidently excelling both in activity and strength , their limbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a general diffusion of bodily force over the whole frame , rather than any local development of striking and exaggerated muscular power , indicated the remarkable adaptation of the race to encounter the life of constant endurance and danger to which their climate and their habits subjected them . Their glossy black hair was shorn straight across their foreheads , with a long tuft streaming like a horse 's tail behind , except in the case of one who seemed to be a kind of chief , and who wore his shaggy locks turned up over his head like a helmet , with the wing of a hawk fantastically twisted into the crest . They were dressed in deer-skin mantles , picturesquely hanging from their shoulders , wore leather sandals upon their feet , and were all armed with tomahawks , and one with bow and arrows . Their bare and robust chests were daubed with rude , hieroglyphical emblems , among which the impression of a bloody hand seemed the most favorite device , probably because it was the most easily depicted . As the blacksmith supposed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors , which had evidently terminated in favor of the red skins , who had borne their enemies captive from the scene of the affray to their encampment . Rednape , who had received an ugly gash upon the shoulder , was seated on the ground with a very ghastly and woe-begone expression upon his sinister phisiognomy , near the entrance to the hut . The helpless Canary Bird was ruefully contemplating an arrow which had struck him in the calf of the leg , without inflicting a very severe wound , and which he was painfully attempting to extract , to the manifest gratification and amusement of his captors , who looked upon his struggles with the most ironical and irritating expressions of condolence . As for the dignified Bootefish , who seemed to have escaped without bodily harm from the contest , the savages had bound him fast to the trunk of an oak , where he stood the butt of his merciless tormentors , looking , however , upon their grimacing visages , and enduring their painful , practical gibes with stoical fortitude . " Grin away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his copper nose flashing defiance at his captors , as one of them , who seemed to take an especial delight in administering to his discomfort , was solacing himself by pricking the worthy precentor 's massive cheeks with the point of his knife till the blood flowed at each successive puncture ; " Grin away , ye ugly villains . Prick away , ye black-snouted , red-legged vermin . Do ye think a white man and an Englishman is afraid of his own blood ? By the bones of my father , had yonder sneaking cowards but stood their ground like men , ye should have had another tale to tell when ye got back , if ye ever did get back to your hovel here . Whoop away , and split your throats , an ' it please ye , " he continued , as the savage uttered a fiendish and discordant yell close in his ear , which was elicited not by the chief butler 's remarks , as he supposed , but by the sudden appearance of the blacksmith upon the scene of action . Walford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the open ground , and had posted himself behind a tree for a few moments , while he took a rapid survey of the spectacle before him . He had entertained no doubt from the first , that the Englishmen had in some manner or other originally provoked the savages , and he had been at first disposed to let them finish the quarrel for themselves as they had begun it . Finding , however , that the odds were so unequal , or rather observing that the contest had in reality ceased , and that his countrymen and late turbulent visitors were likely to suffer a great deal of injury from their captors , even if they escaped with their lives , his blood was roused ; and having great reliance on the personal strength and unparalleled audacity which had hitherto supported him so well during his solitary existence in these deserts , he had resolved to come to their rescue if possible . While the savages , one or two of whom had already entered into their hut intent upon domestic and culinary affairs , while the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humorous sports at the expense of their victims , pricking their ears , pulling their noses , and punching their sides with the points of their sharp knives , were thus comparatively inattentive to all but the business before them , he had stolen silently and cautiously , but with rapidity from one tree to another , till at last , with a sudden bound he had thrown himself among them , cutting the cords which bound the valorous Bootefish at two blows of his hunting knife , and then waving his sledge-hammer about his head with an imposing air of defiance . Meanwhile the savages , two or three of whom had thrown their arms upon the ground , and were busily occupied with a great heap of clams , upon which they were proposing to hold a triumphal feast in honor of their victory , sprang suddenly to their feet , uttering a shrill halloo of mingled surprise and rage . The doughty butler , finding himself no longer a prisoner , seized a tomahawk which lay providentially near him upon the ground , and rushed like an enraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving a severe blow upon the head , which seemed , however , not even to stun him , closed with his foe in a fierce and close embrace , which lasted for a few minutes , till both the combatants , furious with rage and hatred , rolled together upon the ground , dealing each other blows with hands , teeth and feet , neither seeming capable of relinquishing his deadly hold upon the other so long as life or breath remained . While these two were thus engaged in desperate struggle , the savage who had taken the lead in tormenting the butler while he was bound , infuriated at his escape , and quivering all over with disappointed malice , now turned upon the blacksmith , who had thus come so unexpectedly to the rescue . He was a tall , powerful creature , less in stature than his gigantic antagonist , but wonderfully active and supple in his movements . He had thrown off the deer-skin mantle from his shoulders , and now advanced to the conflict , wielding aloft his tomahawk , his eye flaming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cry of a wild beast . The blacksmith saw that there was no child 's play before him . He was unwilling to engage at first in close hug with his enemy , for he knew , by experience , that his anointed and slippery skin , the snake-like movements of his body , and his practical adroitness , would counteract somewhat the advantages of his own enormous strength . He retreated a little space to a tree , while the savage standing at about six yards ' distance paused a moment with his tomahawk brandished high in air , and apparently deliberating in his own mind , whether he would close with him at once , or assail him from that distance . His decision was apparently soon made , for whirling his heavy tomahawk twice or thrice around his head , he suddenly hurled it with the velocity of a thunderbolt at the head of his enemy . If the smith had not providentially donned his head-piece before sallying forth that morning , his days had been numbered , for the weapon struck full upon his forehead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then buried itself in the trunk of the tree against which he was leaning . The bull-fronted smith shook his head slightly , as if a wasp had been buzzing in his ears , and stood as unmoved and impassible as before . The savage , furious at having been foiled , uttered a yell , and then plucking his long , sharp knife from its sheath , rushed madly upon him . Walford calmly awaited his onset till his enemy 's hands were almost at his throat , and then swinging his mighty sledge-hammer high in the air , he dealt the savage a single blow upon the skull . It was enough . The wretch dropped like a log , without a single cry or motion , and lay stone dead at his feet . While this rapid tragedy was acting , Bootefish and his foe still lay coiled together in ferocious embrace , while the other four savages had been engaged in an attempt to secure Rednape and the Canary Bird . They had been but half successful , however , for Rednape , having caught up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , had struck about him so vigorously as to disable one of them , and to free himself entirely from their grasp . Finding himself clear , and not troubling himself much about the general issue of the combat , he had taken to his long legs , and was skimming across the open plain with great celerity . The unfortunate Doryfall , however , was securely bound hand and foot , and fastened to the same tree which had just before held Bootefish in captivity . He was of course unable to render assistance to the blacksmith , who now found himself opposed single handed to three vigorous and unwounded enemies , not counting the fourth who had received several ugly blows from Rednape , and who now seemed crawling towards Bootefish and his foe , for the apparent purpose of expending his remaining strength in behalf of his red brother , who appeared in danger of yielding up the last breath in the hands of the truculent butler . The three now made a concerted and wary attack upon the Thunder-cloud of Mishawum , who had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smith maintained his post , with his back securely planted against the tree , and daring his enemies to the assault with calm but contemptuous gestures . The savages had , however , evidently no inclination to trust themselves to close quarters with their colossal foe , any sooner than was absolutely necessary . They stood at some twenty paces ' distance from him , and as they saw that he was unprovided with any missile weapons , they knew themselves in safety so long as he remained in his quiet attitude against the tree . So many and so fabulous were the reports , that had been related among the scattered dwellers of the neighborhood , concerning the strength of the solitary blacksmith , that the Indians , as we have seen , had long stood in wholesome awe of his prowess , and had generally been inclined rather to cultivate his friendship than to encounter his enmity . Being now engaged in actual contest with him , they were resolved , if possible , to deal with him warily and at advantage . Fortunately for the blacksmith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then very rare among the savages , and but one of them was armed with bow and arrows . They were in fact not accoutred for battle , and had accidently become engaged in conflict , after having sought the peninsula that morning with entirely pacific purposes . They had indeed , as will hereafter appear , been first provoked by their enemies to the contest . The Indian who appeared to be the leader of the party , and who wore the hawk 's wing in his head , now suddenly drew his bow , while the blacksmith 's attention had been momentarily withdrawn from his enemies by an unexpected noise in an opposite direction , and taking a rapid aim , discharged an arrow at the solitary champion . The shaft sped with such precision that it struck his left shoulder , pierced through the fleshy part of the arm , and pinned it to the tree . At the same time , the two other savages were cautiously stealing , each in an opposite direction , towards their intended victim , both armed with knife and tomahawk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as without wincing he tore the arrow from his arm , " but this be no time to stand pinned like a scarecrow to a tree . Am I to stay longer here as a butt for yon clumsy red-breech , may I be damned ? Look to thyself , thou greasy villain , for , by the Lord , there is a bloody nose in store for thee , and that before thou'rt thirty seconds older . " As he spoke he waved his sledge-hammer , and was about rushing single-handed upon his foe , when a shrill whisper in the air above him suddenly arrested his attention , and for an instant almost caused his stout heart to tremble . " Now may the foul fiend burn ye all , " he shouted , " for if mortal man must fight single-handed with three painted devils upon the earth , and with the powers of the air beside , the odds be too unequal . " " Hist , hist , hist , Thomas Walford , " cried a shrill voice above him , which seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stop where thou art , mine honest and most valorous Smith , dodge about the tree for a few minutes longer , and thou art safe . Take my word for it , and stick to the tree . " " Thy word , in sooth , thou invisible devil , " answered the simple-minded blacksmith , somewhat puzzled by this counsel from an aerial source , and yet involuntarily obeying the command . " Thy word , in sooth , thou mocking goblin , and why should I obey thy counsel , if I would keep my scalp under my iron-pot , and not dodged around the tree as he made this address to his invisible companion , and had thus avoided a second arrow from his most troublesome enemy , while , at the same time , the other two savages had paused in their advance upon him , for reasons which soon appeared . The pugnacious Bootefish , who had clung to his foe with the tenacity of a bull-dog , and who might have been cut into a hundred pieces before his hands and teeth would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last succeeded in exhausting his enemy and obtaining the upper hand . Extricating himself from his savage clutches , he had planted his knee upon his breast , and plunged his knife into his throat . Being thus delivered from the mortal struggle in which he had borne himself so manfully , he had , although somewhat fatigued by his short but ferocious encounter , found no difficulty in dispatching the savage whom Rednape had wounded , and who had well nigh crept upon him , before he had completely vanquished his first antagonist . Under these circumstances , the contest assumed a totally different aspect . There were now but three of the six Indians remaining , and they were opposed by two Englishmen , not sufficient odds for the savages , in the estimation of the bold blacksmith . " Who art thou , thou voice without body or legs ? " asked Walford , pausing , in spite of himself , to listen to the admonitions of his mysterious companion . " Body enough , Master Bootefish , and legs more than enough , or my name 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here , man , ' t is no devil in the air , but simply your friend Peter Cakebread , roosting and cooing like an innocent dove upon the branches of this protective oak . " " Roosting like an innocent dove , sneaking and squealing like a villainous tree-toad rather , " said the blacksmith indignantly , as he looked up and saw the wizzened and preternatural visage of Cakebread , grinning at him through the leafless spray of the tree , while , with his long , ape-like arms and legs , he swung himself from one limb to another . " Why thou lily-livered , toad-faced coward thou , had'st thou had one particle of manhood in thee , thou would'st have been down here like the brave old Bootefish yonder , whom , by heaven , I will never quarrel with again , the longest day I have to live , helping me to punish these greasy red-skins , and not roosting there like an unclean bird among the branches of a tree . " " Fair words , fair words , I pray thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding position . " Truly , am I not sitting here like a guardian angel , directing your endeavors , and praying devoutly for your success ? I tell thee , there be succor approaching , for from the summit of this tree I have just seen a boat approaching yonder beach . " " Succor indeed , thou miserable varlet ! " answered Walford , " why seest thou not , that three of the six enemies be lumps of dead clay already , and that if I stay here now talking to thee , it is that the other poor devils may run away if they will , for by the Lord , I have marvellously more desire to trounce thee for thy cowardice , than to chastise these red-legged creatures . " In effect the combat seemed to have ended . The three savages had withdrawn to the neighborhood of their wigwam , dragging the two bodies of their slaughtered friends with them , but not daring to meddle with the one which lay at the feet of the blacksmith . They seemed now to limit their ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as soon as they had again arrived within ear-shot , had not ceased in his vociferous attempts to set them right as to his real name , and to assure them that Canary Bird was only his " totem , " or war name , in Indian phraseology . Whether the savages supposed that this appellation , derived from so valiant a bird , indicated the extraordinary heroism of its wearer , whether they were particularly acquainted with the habits of his feathered sponsor , which was not then often to be found in New England , or whether indeed they understood or attended to any thing which fell from their captive 's lips , did not distinctly appear . They contented themselves simply in answer to each successive exclamation , with the normal grunt of their race , which might have indicated approbation , dissent , reproof , or any thing else that happened to be in their minds . At all events , the unfortunate Doryfall did not seem likely at that moment to effect his liberation , which probably was the object to which tended his incessant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than has been related , for indeed the whole contest which has taken us so long to recite , had occupied but a few minutes , Peter Cakebread had again scrambled to the top of the oak , upon which he was perched , to take a survey of the surrounding country , while one of the savages , he , namely , who had so adroitly nailed the blacksmith to the tree with his arrow , crept cautiously to the edge of the thicket , and placed his ear to the ground . Scarcely had he done so , when he started to his feet again with a yell of triumph , and dashed furiously back , hatchet in hand , towards the wigwam . At the same moment Cakebread uttered a shrill cry of disappointment and terror from the summit of the tree . " What ails thee now , thou liverless child of Satan ? " cried the blacksmith , standing upon the defensive again , while Bootefish seized the tomahawk which had been discharged at the commencement of the conflict and buried in the tree . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What seest thou in yonder thicket to scare thee out of thy senses again ? " Before Cakebread had time to reply to the blacksmith 's interrogation , the cause of his dismay and of the savage 's exultation was explained . A party of Indians , numbering eight or ten , commanded by a chief who appeared to be of considerable importance , broke suddenly from the thicket which fringed the plain , and advanced rapidly towards the scene of action . At this unexpected reinforcement , the three savages , who had been quite satisfied with the length of the contest , and who would have been well pleased to have got rid of the blacksmith and his truculent friend , now plucked up heart again , and leaving the captive Doryfall to guard himself at the entrance to their wigmam , they renewed the attack with the assurance of an easy victory . Bootefish and the blacksmith , each placed himself against a tree , prepared to sell their lives as dearly as possible . Retreat was out of the question , for the party who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and northern verge of the plain , and crowned the neighboring heights , effectually surrounded them in the rear , and the sea which spread before them upon the southern and eastern side , cut off all escape in front . One of the three savages now advanced very near to the blacksmith , executing a very furious and warlike dance before his face , yelling with ferocity , and taunting him with a variety of irritating gestures . The smith , convinced that there was nothing to be gained by remaining stationary any longer , feeling a far stronger inclination to exchange his own life for that of two or three of his foes , than to stand still to become the captive and the laughing-stock of creatures for whom he had a hearty contempt , desperate at this evil stroke of fortune after he had considered his victory secure , and lashed into fury by the insulting grimaces of the savage , now abandoned all idea of defence , and leaving the covert of the tree , rushed madly at his antagonist , waving aloft his sledge-hammer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had stood still an instant longer , took to his heels as Walford advanced , and fled in the direction of the wood . The smith pursued , but with less rapidity , his fugitive foe , and in so doing , found himself directly in the centre of the plain , separated from any protecting tree , and offering a mark for half a dozen arrows , which were immediately discharged at him by the new comers , and which inflicted two or three flesh wounds . He paused , foaming with rage , and eyeing his antagonists , who were thus goading him at the same time that they remained out of his reach , with the fury of a baited and wounded bull . His career seemed at an end ; the savage who had provoked him was already surrounded by his friends , an arrow in the leg impeded the smith 's advance , and as he stood there a defenceless mark , one of the new comers , who was the only one provided with a fire-arm , suddenly advanced to within twenty yards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smith 's hour was come . He was to die at last like a wolf in the wilderness , and what would become of the old woman on the hill yonder . He cursed his folly , which had tempted him forth from his fortress in behalf of the riotous crew , who had disturbed his solitude that morning ; he cursed the fate which had sent the new party of red-skins thither , when he had so fairly routed the first ; he cursed ten thousand times the carelessness which had sent him out without his trusty fire-arm , which alone would have made him more than a match for the whole of them . " Fire away , " he roared with the voice of a lion , " ye greasy villains , and stop your chattering ; ' t is a brave deed surely , for a dozen Indians to get the better of two Englishmen , for as to yon trussed chicken yonder  --  " The report of a matchlock interrupted him as he shouted his defiance . Strange to say , it seemed to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken upon his ear , when the savage who was so nearly threatening his life , suddenly sprang high into the air , uttering a quick , sharp cry , and then rolled dead upon the plain , his gun exploding harmlessly as he fell . At the same instant two figures sprang rapidly forward from the eastern edge of the plain , both armed with long , heavy matchlocks , and advancing near enough to be easily recognised , stationed themselves each behind a tree at a short distance from the blacksmith . " Fairly shot , Sir Kit , by Jupiter Diespiter , " said the shorter of the two as he coolly took aim at the nearest savage , who was however several hundred yards ' distant ; while Sir Christopher , to whose ready hand and skilful eye the blacksmith 's preservation was owing , rapidly re-loaded his piece . At the same moment Walford darted gallantly forward , and notwithstanding the discharge of a half dozen arrows , succeeded in seizing the musket of the savage whom Gardiner had slain , and in tearing his ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without receiving a single additional wound , he hastily took up a position behind an oak , not far removed from his two confederates . " Hold your hand , Morton , for an instant , " said the knight , as he saw Morton preparing to fire . " ' T is but a waste of powder  --  yonder fellows are out of your reach at present , and unless I mistake the matter , will be in no hurry to come to nearer quarters ; my life for it , they have been provoked to this , for I know their temper well . At all events , here be three of us , with good weapons in our hands , and a fit match , I take it , for yonder round dozen of painted vagabonds . Pause a moment and observe their motions  --  you know how deeply important I consider it to secure the good-will of the savages in this neighborhood . Had not our trusty giant yonder been in such imminent peril , I would not have hurt a hair of their heads . Pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , methinks they show a marvellous inclination to skulk into the covert yonder . " " They are deliberating , Sir Christopher  --  taking grave and deep counsel ; I obey you , and await the result of their cogitations . " With this the Lord of Merry-Mount lowered his weapon and leaned coolly against the tree . " But look at the giant of Mishawum , Sir Christopher , " he resumed , " with an arrow sticking in each leg ! Tell me now , looks he not like a feathered Mercury , with the talaria on his heels  --  save that he is perhaps a trifle stout for sailing through the air . Why he hath arrows enow in his legs to furnish Robin Hood . Had he but a bow now , he were as well equipped an archer as ever trod the merry green wood . And yet what recks he of bows or arrows ? Non eget Mauris jaculis neque arcu , ' for hath he not possessed himself of pouch and matchlock from yonder stiffening savage ? But how camest thou to see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to drop yonder unfortunate savage so promptly ? " " Experience , Master Morton , " answered the knight , " experience , from earliest childhood to the present moment , has been tutoring me . When danger threatens , never lay about you in the dark . Trust me , a man with his eyes wide open is worth a dozen heedless fellows who rush upon danger blindfold . " While these events had been taking place , or rather just before the very opportune arrival of Morton and Gardiner , the valorous butler , who had been severely bruised during the progress of the affray , and was well nigh exhausted by his extraordinary efforts , had been captured at last by the two remaining Indians of the first party , who had attacked him , the one with his bow and arrows , the other with a long hatchet-headed pole . They had now bound him again , and had dragged him to the neighborhood of the wigwam , where he now sat upon the ground very near the Canary Bird , looking the image of dogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " continued Morton , after a little pause , during which the savages seemed to be still deliberating whether to attack or to hold a parley with the three Englishmen . " Ah , look yonder at my paragon of precentors , my most bibulous of butlers , my most bandy-legged of Bootefishes , taken he is , captured , in durance vile . There too lies the luckless Canary Bird by his side , picked , trussed , and ready for roasting ; and yonder sneaks back Humphrey Rednape with the pouch on his shoulders according to your command . This way , Humphrey Rednape , or the red devils will add you to the brace yonder . Sneak this way man , " continued Morton , as Rednape , who , as will be remembered , had fled early from the field of battle , but who had in reality been the cause of the favorable turn which things had taken , by the information which he had conveyed to Morton and Gardiner , of whose whereabouts he happened to be informed , now stole forward with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire-arm in his hand . " These savages are peaceably disposed , " said Gardiner , suddenly . " I have no doubt on the subject . Down with your piece , you mistake me . No more killing . They have not the least appetite for gunpowder remaining . ' T is much more to my purpose to deal gently with them . They respect me and fear me ; ' t is time that they should love me . Moreover , I recognise their chief  --  ' t is Sagamore John , as well disposed a fellow as can be found in the bay . My life for it , he comes half way to welcome me as soon as I am recognised . " With these words the knight , to Morton 's profound astonishment , left the cover of the tree with his matchlock carelessly lying in the hollow of his arm , and coolly advanced to within fifty yards of the second party of Indians , who had been standing huddled together in earnest conversation since the fall of their first champion . Half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrows were drawn to the head , while Morton , transfixed with wonder , stood gazing at the incomprehensible fool-hardiness of the knight , when suddenly , at a word of command , the weapons were all lowered , and the chief of the party uttering a shrill cry of recognition , advanced forward to meet the Englishman , proffering his hand , and making a hundred gestures and unintelligible protestations of friendship . The sagamore was a young man , tall and well limbed , like most of their other warriors , and wore a variety of ingeniously painted devices upon his arms and bust . A robe of magnificent beaver skins hung from his shoulder , a girdle of wampum was around his waist , and he held a tomahawk in his hand . Like all the other savages who had appeared upon the scene , he was equipped for peace , and had had no expectations that morning of a conflict of any kind . He had a good-humored , horse face , with an expression of considerable intelligence , and was evidently regarded by his companions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chieftain of a small body of natives who inhabited the neighborhood of Mishawum , and who were all subjects to the more extensive sovereignty of the Squaw Sachem of the Massachusetts . Between this potentate and the knight , there had for a long time existed relations of perfect friendship and mutual esteem . During his residence in the Massachusetts , Sir Christopher had ably employed the long period of apparent inactivity to which the slow moving and somewhat recalcitrating operations of his confederates in England had condemned him , in establishing secret but extensive relations of amity with the chiefs of all the scattered tribes in the neighborhood of the territory , over which he eventually contemplated establishing his own sovereignty . His connections with them were widely ramified , and managed with the adroitness which was his distinguishing characteristic . The sagamore and Sir Christopher exchanged salutations . In a few hurried expressions , which were inaudible to the other parties , and by a careless gesture of the knight towards the savage who had fallen by his hand , it was evident that he had explained his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the affray , he seemed willing to prolong his interview with the sagamore . All appearances of hostility having ceased on both sides , the other Indians retired by themselves for the present to the vicinity of the wigwam , where they resumed the interrupted preparations for their feast ; while Morton and Walford together proceeded to liberate the two captives Bootefish and Doryfall , and then withdrew to the vicinity of the beach to hold deliberation . " Beshrew me , " said the blacksmith to the knight , " but you seem marvellously to understand yourself with my friend the sagamore yonder . A man of pith he is , and no skulker ; and by the beard of my father , I would not have valued your life at a farthing when you marched out upon them just now . To be sure , their arrows be mighty clumsy tools , " continued the giant , who had been amusing himself , since the cessation of hostilities , with extracting the stone points of the darts , which , as we have seen , had inflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure , they be mighty clumsy tools , unless the game be cocksparrows ; and look ye , I be something bigger and tougher than a cocksparrow , " he concluded , contemptuously tossing the weapons which had galled him upon the ground . " Aye , " said Morton , replying in the careless humor which was habitual with him , to the observations of Walford , which Gardiner , engaged in colloquy with the sachem , did not appear to heed . " Aye , master smith , thou seest that our worthy friend Sir Christopher is even more closely allied to his highness Sagamore John , even than thy gigantic self . The devil a bit would yonder cocksparrow archers have dropped their weapons at thy command , or even at mine , suzerain of Passanogessit , though they know know me to be . See what it is to be born with the jewel of command in your eye , as a beaver with a priceless treasure in his tail . And truly this Sagamore John , as he delights to style himself  --  thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his savage name , which would crack our jaws worse than his tomahawk or thy sledge-hammer , and into more pieces than it hath syllables  --  truly John is a very agreeable young man . " " Aye , " answered the smith , who had troubled himself but little with savage pedigrees or politics , " ' t is as pretty a fellow in a squabble as one would care to meet with of a summer 's day . A great chieftain he is , to be sure , and the Lord of all these parts I believe  --  may they have never a worse one . " " Poh , nonsense , thou most careless and uninstructed giant , " answered Morton , " thy ignorance of the genealogy and political history of the tribes among whom thou hast pitched thy tent , is lamentable . Know , then , that yonder dignified red-skin , with the wholesome name of John , is but a satrap , a prefect , under the mighty personage who rules these savage realms . Know that this whole country of the Massachusetts obeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the dowager of the lamented Nanepashemit , or the New Moon , which New Moon being brought into unlucky conjunction with certain Tarrantine tomahawks , was suddenly eclipsed somewhere in the year of our Lord 1619 . He left behind four lesser satelites , three sons and a daughter  --  one of the sons , the respectable young man now before us , whose pagan name , Wonohaquahan , I will for once venture to pronounce , has command over some twenty or thirty warriors , while his brothers possess a similar authority farther towards the east , but the dowager , the Saunks , hath succeeded to the throne , and exercises despotic sway over her sons and subjects . " " Master smith , " suddenly interrupted Gardiner , turning from the sagamore , " what began the riot this morning ? That is the matter to be looked to now . " " Faith , Sir Christopher , the devil a bit can I instruct you on the subject . Four drunken vagabonds of the pious crew , harbored by our friend Master Morton here , paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three vagabonds , for yonder Robin Bootefish hath this day borne himself so like a man of mettle , that he shall be damned before he hears hard names again from Thomas Walford ; aye , or hard knocks either , " said the smith , extending his hand towards the doughty butler . That individual who by a kind of miracle had escaped unwounded , though marvellously bruised , from his various adventures that morning , and who had been refreshing himself during the interval afforded by the historical disquisition of Morton , with a quiet nap in the sun , had aroused himself at the voice of the blacksmith , and now listened with gratification to this encomium upon his conduct . " Thanks to you , worthy Goodman Walford , " said he with stately but sincere cordiality , as he arose from his recumbent position , and extended a hand to the blacksmith . " Thanks to you , master blacksmith , and truly I be well pleased that the individual whom you chose to honor with the name of lobster , and mayhap to handle somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath had opportunity to show the stuff he be made of . " As the butler paused for breath , Gardiner , who had become impatient at this effusion of sentiment on the part of the butler and smith , now repeated his inquiry as to the cause of the conflict . " If your worship , Master Morton , will allow , " resumed the butler , " I can explain to Sir Christopher the whole of the matter in about six words . " " Out with it , man , " said Sir Christopher impatiently , " methinks it needs no urging . " " Well , then , know your worship , " said the butler , " that the whole cause of this little riot with the red-breeches is all along of Peter Cakebread . He be a mischievous , idle varlet , as your honor knows , ready to get a friend into trouble , and willing to let him get out of it for himself . Now you see , this Master Cakebread , as we landed from our boats at Mishawum this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-breeches snugly lying in the cove . " " I knew there was knavery at the beginning , " cried Morton . " There was a mighty bag of corn-meal in the boat , " continued Bootefish , " and your worship knows that the devil a pinch of meal or flour has been at Merry-Mount these three months . There were also several measures of dried beans besides . Now what does my gentleman , Master Cakebread , but takes me this very bag of meal and these very dry beans , and pops me them into our boat , saying that we would have bread enow for May-day at Merry-Mount , or the devil was in it . I reproved him for it , your honor , and called him a vile thief . This made him laugh , hardened sinner that as he is , and without more ado , he shoved the empty canoe out upon the water , as if it was not enow to steal the contents thereof . As we were squabbling among ourselves , the red-breeches , who had from the hill-top discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon us , shrieking like devils , before we had put off in our skiff . As soon as they discovered Peter 's knavery , you may be sure that they screamed and yelled all the louder . Now what does my little Canary Bird , when we found ourselves beset , but drop on his face and pipe for mercy . As for Peter Cakebread , the cause of all the mischief , why the devil even lent him his own wings , to fly away withal , for how else he could make his escape as he did , clean over the heads of us all , Christians and pagans , friends and foes , is more than Robert Bootefish can tell you . In the midst of our tussle upon the plain , up comes Goodman Walford , and the rest is known to your worship . " The worthy butler concluded his harangue , which , without more circumlocution than was to have been expected , had at last instructed Morton and the knight as to the real cause of the quarrel , by a beaming glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where is this skulking Cakebread ? " said the knight , " the culprit is known , and must be found and punished . Master Morton , I shall insist upon an exemplary chastisement as the only means of satisfying the savages ' sense of justice . " " Right as Rhadamanthus , " answered Morton , " but where has the knave bestowed himself ? " " I have already told thee , Master Morton , " interrupted the smith , " that the creature hath been seen by me in the midst of the squabble . Flying in the air he was , like an imp of the old one , for Satan protects his children . But if he be any where outside the hottest cauldron in Beelzebub 's kitchen , you 'll find him upon yonder oak . Take him an ' ye will , but by the Lord , I would not singe my fingers with his carcass to please the best Christian in the bay . " While the smith was speaking , the knight had already advanced to the oak under which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rest of the party followed him , and soon became aware of the presence of the luckless culprit , who ensconced among the topmost branches of the tree , sat grinning at them in defiance , and obstinately refusing to obey the knight 's order to descend from his pinnacle , from a very shrewd suspicion of the treatment he was likely to meet with . " I knew we should find the culprit at last , " exclaimed Morton . " Cakebread , Peter Cakebread , thy sins must be atoned for , and that speedily . Of this thou mightest have been sure , ere thou becamest a corn-stealer , for punishment , sooner or later , surely overtaketh the guilty . What says my friend Flaccus upon this point ? Raro antecedentem scelestum Deseruit pede Poena claudo . ' Which for thy better apprehension is , Punishment with her club-foot , will yet overtake the nimblest and most thievish baboon . ' Have the kindness , then , to come down and be whipped .  --  Valet ima summis mutare . ' Leave thy infernal mopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed little inclined to obey the behest of his liege lord and sovereign , and remained in his elevated position , looking very malicious , very obstinate , and very much frightened withal . The knight became now very impatient , and shouted to him in a voice whose peremptory tones seemed to produce an instantaneous effect upon the culprit . " I tell thee to descend from the tree , and that instantly , thou misbegotten child of Satan ; it were better for thee to obey my commands without hesitation ; for I swear to thee if thou palterest with me ten seconds longer , the tree shall be felled to the ground , and thyself delivered over to the savages whom thou hast plundered , to be dealt with according to their pleasure . Obey me instantly and thou shalt be chastised , indeed , but thou shalt be protected from the vengeance of the Indians . " This last threat , or rather the mixtures of threats and promises , seemed to have its effect upon the culprit . He began slowly to descend from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowermost branch of all , he sat himself quietly down for a moment , at about ten feet elevation above their heads , and seemed disposed to enter into a parley with the imperious knight . " Worthy and most valiant Sir Christopher , " he began in a fawning and suppliant manner , " thou knowest that bread is the staff of life , and that  --  " " Now by St. John , " cried the knight in a towering passion , " if thou darest to utter one single word of expostulation , or delayest one single second longer thy descent to the ground , I swear I will shoot thee as I would a fox , and give thy carcass to the Indians in exchange for their poor devils who have been knocked on the head in consequence of thy misdemeanor . " As he spoke , the knight lifted his matchlock to his shoulder , and deliberately covered the body of the trembling culprit . Cakebread knowing with whom he had to deal , and finding Sir Christopher thus indisposed to trifle , made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor to his early education , he alighted upon his feet in the very midst of the group , wearing a ludicrous expression of mingled fear , malice , and curiosity upon his wizzened features . The knight seized him by the throat in an instant , and then making a sign to Rednape and Bootefish to approach , he handed the culprit to them , with orders to bind him closely with a cord which Rednape held in his hands . The unfortunate Cakebread fell upon his knees , for he believed that the knight had determined to execute him at once without judge or jury , by suspending him to the branch of the tree which hung so conveniently a few feet above his head . The frightened culprit fell upon his knees and roared for mercy . " Have compassion upon me , thou most humane and puissant knight , and thou , too , my honored lord and sovereign , most worshipful Master Morton , " he cried , with his teeth chattering as he spoke ; " truly have I done nothing but abstract a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the enemy as a Christian warrior should . Bread is the staff of life , and for the lack of it must we die , and yet be hanged for procuring it ? " " Gag the cowardly driveller , " said the knight impatiently to Bootefish and Rednape ; " and know , thou unlucky and most thievish imp , that there is no question of hanging . Chastised thou shalt be ; whipped , and that soundly , to appease the vengeance of the Indians , and to furnish them an additional proof of the justice that Englishmen know how to render , even when their own countrymen must bear the pain and the shame . Master Morton , have the kindness to summon the savages from yonder wigwam . " " Willingly , Sir Kit , " answered Morton , " but permit me before I do so to make a suggestion ,  --  Is it certain that it would not be better to hand the culprit  --  ? " Here the unfortunate Cakebread struggled violently to speak , and to throw himself upon his knees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  " Would it not be better to hang the culprit , or at least a culprit ? If Cakebread be too valuable a subject for me to lose , and I confess his many excellent social qualities have endeared him very much to the society of Merry-Mount , why I am not sure that I could not find among the more aged and weather-beaten veterans of the crew , a worthy substitute for the gallows . There is a fellow in my mind just now , a huge feeder , who dwells at Merry-Mount , and hath done so for years , who is old , blind , deaf , and altogether of no value to me or to any body ; what sayest thou , Sir Kit , suppose we discharge Master Cakebread from custody and send forthwith for my venerable friend and hang him vicariously to yonder branch , in presence of the savages ? My life for it , they will be most salutarily impressed by so imposing a spectacle . " " Tush , Morton , " said Gardiner , who , although impatient at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Merry-Mount , as he always did even in his most whimsical moments , with considerable deference . " Tush , Morton , thou triflest too unseasonably ; I have determined , that although this actual offence be not very grave in amount , yet that this practice of pilfering by white men upon Indians is likely to bring us into contempt , and that it is necessary to make an example of this fellow , who , as thou hast thyself informed me , has been guilty of such tricks before . He must be chastised in presence of the Indians , and that at once . " Cakebread , who , in spite of his cords , had contrived to execute a hampered dance of rapture , and to emit certain smothered and unnatural sounds indicative of his intense delight at Morton 's proposition , and his unqualified approval of this project of a vicarious punishment , now received a smart rap on the head from Bootefish , to induce a more reverential demeanor , while Sir Christopher continued ,  --  " If you will have the kindness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant Bootefish yonder to the temporary office of executioner , I will , without farther delay , see that a proper chastisement is meted out to this culprit , which will be sufficient as an example , but which will hardly prevent him from fulfilling his duties as principal buffoon , so long as he can find greater fools than himself to laugh at his folly . " " Robertus Bootefish ! " suddenly exclaimed Morton , upon finding by the knight 's determined manner , that the matter must be forthwith settled ,  --  " Robertus Bootefish , thou art hereby authorized by the command of thy suzerain , to take upon thyself , in addition to thy other responsible offices of butler , precentor , and head clerk , the dignity of carnifex maximus , which is in the vernacular , head executioner , not only for the present but for all future time , and thou art hereby instructed to hold thyself in readiness to execute the penalty of the law according to the behest of the illustrious knight , Sir Christopher Gardiner , upon the body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar , Peter Cakebread , upon this very spot and at this very moment of time . Dixi . " The worthy Bootefish , who had been well aware of the result towards which all this parley was tending , and who was nothing loth to inflict upon the sneaking comrade who had well nigh , through his knavery , cost him his life , a proper chastisement , which he regarded as rather due to his unmanly flight from the battle-field than for the larceny , had already prepared a formidable whip , and now came forward with considerable alacrity in obedience to the order of his august master . The savages were immediately summoned , and squatted themselves gravely upon their hams , forming a circle around their chief , who received from Morton and Gardiner a rapid and succinct account of the matter from the beginning to the end , and expressed himself thoroughly satisfied with the penalty proposed . The luckless Cakebread was then unbound and led forward by Rednape and the Canary Bird into the centre of the circle , when he dropped upon his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession of his guilt , accompanied by many whining appeals for mercy . He was , however , promptly condemned to receive forty lashes immediately ; and although his fears had perhaps anticipated a far more fearful penalty , he again attempted by a variety of hideous howls , to obtain a mitigation of punishment . Finding all his efforts in vain , after casting an imploring but ineffectual look at Morton , he permitted himself to be seized by Rednape and Doryfall . As soon , however , as they had taken him by the arms , he dropped heavily upon the ground , affecting to have fallen into a swoon , and lay motionless and apparently as senseless as a log . At a look from Gardiner , Bootefish advanced to assist the others and they then lifted him from the earth in their arms , where he lay like a man , from whom all the bones had been suddenly extracted , with his lithe and supple frame swaying and twisting in every direction like a dead serpent . As they carried him past Gardiner , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled fear , rage and hatred , which was worthy of the countenance of a fiend , and which might have inspired a more susceptible mind than the knight 's with a sensation of terror . Sir Christopher , however , appeared not even to observe the expression of the imp whose hatred he was at that moment incurring , and who , contemptible as he seemed , possessed venom and determination sufficient to inflict a signal vengeance upon the author of his punishment , if the opportunity should occur . The abject creature was now tied by the neck and shoulders to a young hickory , and the forty lashes were laid on with a hearty good-will , and with solemn composure , by Bootefish . The first stroke aroused the culprit from his affected torpor , and elicited a howl which resounded among the wooded crags of the surrounding wilderness . At the second he began to dance about with extraordinary vivacity , and throughout the whole chastisement he performed a series of wonderful gyrations about the tree , accompanied with frantic but unsuccessful struggles to escape from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the echo of the last howl had died away among the cliffs of Mishawum , the savages , at Gardiner 's request , were drawn up in a double line , the cords which secured the culprit were unbound , and he was ordered in conclusion to run the gauntlet through them , and to receive a swinging thwack from every one of them as he passed . As soon , however , as he was liberated , he dropped again like a torpid snake upon the earth , and appeared entirely inanimate from the effects of his punishment ; upon Gardner 's stirring his prostrate carcass with his foot , however , and threatening him with an additional allowance of stripes upon the failure of instant obedience , he jumped upon his legs and proceeded cautiously to the head of the line . Here , as he was attempting to steal quietly by the first post of danger , he was received by a hearty knock from the flat side of a hatchet ; when , suddenly recovering his powers , as if by enchantment , and exerting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , threw a somerset clean over the heads of his enemies , and then fled swiftly across the plain . At the command of their chief , the savages desisted from the pursuit which they had at once commenced ; and all parties being thoroughly satisfied with the penalty inflicted , and with the general result of the morning 's operations , they severally dispersed to their respective destinations . CHAPTER XII . TWILIGHT MYSTERIES . Late in the afternoon of the same day , Esther Ludlow , who was walking alone very near her own door , was surprised to see the tall figure of Sir Christopher Gardiner crossing the glade and approaching the house . The knight appeared no longer in the gay attire which he had worn in the morning and throughout the scenes in which we have found him engaged , but appeared again in the sad-colored suit , and wearing the steeple-crowned hat which marked the Puritan . His demeanor and bearing were no less altered , and it would have been difficult for the keenest observer to have discovered in the grave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calm and somewhat melancholy countenance of the personage who was now exchanging salutations with Esther Ludlow , any trace of the mnn of action whom we left so lately upon the plain of Mishawum . " I have taken the liberty to intrude once more upon your presence , " said he , with a demure glance at Esther , which was quickly withdrawn as her eyes met his own , " because , since I last parted from you I have received letters , which confirm the tidings which you somewhat briefly imparted to me , the last time we met . Believing that in all probability your own dispatches might not yet have been delivered , I have come to proffer whatever information I may have obtained for your own use . " " I thank you for your courtesy , " replied Esther coldly , for she was not too well pleased with the knight 's visit , and felt a strange trouble , she knew not why , at his presence ; " I thank you respectfully , but the letters which have been delivered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fully instructed us as to the course of events in England , and as to the particular details of the matters most interesting to the dwellers in the wilderness . " " Then I have only to express to you , " replied the knight , my sincere congratulations at the auspicious tidings . Before another three months shall have elapsed , we may hope to see the commencement of a religious settlement , the laying of the corner-stone of a permanent asylum for the persecuted . I know how much of pure and sublime happiness such an event must excite in your breast . I sincerely trust that you will not be offended that a lonely and unworthy wayfarer like myself , ventures to express to you his sympathy with a cause which he knows to be nearest to your heart . " " It lies doubtless very near to my heart , " replied Esther , who was somewhat softened to the stranger by his apparently fervid interest in the cause to which she had devoted herself , but whose mind , pre-occupied at that moment by deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover , was but little open to any strong impression from the language of the man who was now addressing her . " It lies doubtless very near to my heart , and I am truly impatient that the expected ships should arrive . Still my mind at times misgives me , whether obstacles may not , after all , occur during these troublous times , which may make their endeavors fruitless . " " Not so , believe me , " answered her companion , who , as will be explained hereafter , had already made up his mind as to the line of conduct he was to pursue for the present , having now received the instructions which he had been so eagerly expecting from his confederates in England . " I have reason to believe that the good work is likely to go on and prosper . Such is the tenor of the advices which I have received from my own friends , and such , doubtless , must be the hopes held forth in your correspondence . " " I can not tell , " answered Esther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , as she found the knight desirous of protracting the interview without any apparent cause . " Our enemies in England are powerful and malignant , and I fear they may send emissaries to the wilderness to impede our cherished work . " " But the friends of the colony at home are powerful and influential , " replied the knight , who was gazing with a look of undisguised admiration at the fair face of his companion . He checked himself suddenly , however , and remembering that passionate words and bold glances but ill comported with the stern and grave character which he had assumed , he added in an altered tone , " Believe me when I assure you that you have but little to fear from the machinations of the enemies whom you deem so powerful . As to the emissaries to whom you allude , I doubt very much their existence ; certainly I have found but few persons in whose sincere attachment to our great religious enterprise , I could not confide as much as in my own . " " And yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirous to terminate the interview with the mysterious personage , who inspired her with an unaccountable feeling of distrust , but unwilling to be absolutely discourteous to a man whom she knew her brother regarded with respect ,  --  " I fear me that , among the wild and lawless spirits who inhabit the south-western coasts of Massachusetts , there be many who are both evil wishers and evil doers . Strange tales reach our ears , of godless and profane ribaldry in those regions , which would be in itself sufficient to bring a curse and a desolation upon the land . " " If you speak of the rioters and worthless revellers of Passanogessit , " answered Gardiner , " you may dismiss any fears as to evil influence from such a source ; believe me , that crew of outcasts is too contemptible and too insignificant in every manner , to merit a thought . They will be swept away like the foul and noisome mists of the morass yonder , before the clear sunlight of religion which is so soon to rise upon this benighted land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will see them shrink away like owls , and bats , and foul things , which fear the light of day . Profane not , beautiful Esther Ludlow , " added the knight with another look of earnest and irrepressible , but respectful admiration , " profane not your serene thoughts , by allowing them to wander to subjects so infinitely below your own exalted sphere . " The passionate glances of the knight fell upon the beautiful Puritan as harmlessly as tropical sunshine upon a marble statue . With a cold and unembarrassed look , which almost disconcerted him , she replied ,  --  " I am willing to receive your account of them , Sir Knight , and to participate in the hopefulness with which you seem to regard the undertaking of which we were speaking , but the air is growing chill and the evening is approaching . I regret that my brother 's absence must make me appear uncourteous , in not inviting you to partake of the humble hospitality of our roof , and I must even crave your permission to retire . " Gardiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as decided as this seemed to be , and he still lingered at the door-step , ready and yet reluctant to take leave ; thus detaining , for a few moments , his companion , who was naturally unwilling to withdraw into the house until he had departed . It was a strange but not unaccountable attraction , which had exerted so sudden an influence upon the knight 's imagination . It should , moreover , be never lost sight of , that although the scenery of this tale is found in the stern deserts of New England , yet that the actors were all Europeans , born and reared among all the influences of an ancient civilization , and subjected to all the conflicting , turbulent and chequered sentiments , motives , and passions , which beset human nature when developed under the exciting atmosphere of a high social culture . Such almost wilful contrasts are not the least remarkable features in the singular scene presented upon the opening pages of New England 's chronicle . " I purpose visiting our brethren at New Plymouth very shortly , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview , " and I should be well pleased if in aught I could be serviceable to you . I have tarried long enough among them , to know that you have heaped upon your head the blessings of those who were nigh to perish , and that your departure has been bitterly lamented by the poorer of the brethren and their families in that sterile spot of earth . Is there naught in which I can be useful to you ? " " I thank you for your courtesy , " said Esther , advancing a few steps towards him , " for I do remember me , that there is a family there which truly demands my care . A certain weaver from Suffolkshire , who emigrated to these shores during the past year , and who has been sojourning at New Plymouth , is , I believe , still tarrying there . He is feeble in health , and not overburdened with capacity for this wilderness work . Commend me to him , and advise him , in my name , to tarry still a little with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settlement at Naumkeak . He must at this time be suffering many pangs of poverty , and perhaps illness , for he has a considerable family . Sir Knight , I shall even accept your courteous offer , and entreat you to convey to this poor weaver , whose name is Mellowes , a small token of my remembrance , with an assurance of my continued interest in his welfare . " Esther went into the house for a moment , and presently returned . " There are a very few gold pieces in this purse , " said she , extending it to him , " but they are all which are at present at my command , and more than sufficient to save my poor friends from absolute starvation . If , however , want should continue to press upon them , they may be able to procure the necessaries of life by means of this useless gaud , which I pray you to convey to the Goodwife Mellowes , with the assurance that the trifling gewgaw is not sent to be worn as a piece of worldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , when they shall find themselves sorely beset . " As Esther spoke , she took from her neck a heavy gold chain which she wore studiously concealed beneath the folds of her folds of her garments , and delivered it to the knight . " And now Sir Knight , " she concluded , " once more imploring your pardon for my withdrawal , I shall even bid you farewell . " She entered the humble cottage as she spoke , and closed the door behind her . The knight stood stock still for a moment , gazing enraptured at her retiring figure . He then advanced a few steps across the glade , when he suddenly paused and leaned musingly against the trunk of an oak which stood on the verge of the forest . He lifted the chain to his lips , and kissed it passionately many times , and then fastened it round his neck . As he did so , a smile of indefinite triumph shone for an instant across his dark features . The brown shadows of evening were fast descending upon the landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The knight still leaned against the tree , lost in a vague but delicious reverie . He believed himself alone in that wilderness , but he was wrong . Within a few paces of him , but concealed by the heavy branches of the very tree against which he was leaning , stood the dusky figure of a man . He stood with his eyes glaring fearfully upon the knight , his hand clenching a naked rapier , his breath suspended , and his features and whole frame convulsed by fierce , but resolutely suppressed emotion . The man who stood in ambush there was no savage , although he was thirsting for the heart 's blood of his enemy , and was delaying with an almost voluptuous sensation of hatred , the moment of gratification , which fate seemed at last to have placed within his reach . That man was Henry Maudsley . He had arrived at the spot a few moments before , with his heart filled with regret and remorse for what had seemed to him in his cooler moments , the unjust and unworthy suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last interview with Esther . After that last interview he had been hardly able to explain even to himself the sudden and stormy passions which had overflowed his heart like a torrent , when he first learned the existence of what he believed to be an intimacy between the knight and his beloved . From that moment a demon seemed to have assumed dominion over him , and he had struggled in vain against the fearful influence . He had , however , during the many solitary hours of absence which had passed since he had left Esther so deeply wounded as his unseemly outbreak of anger and jealousy , found a little time to reflect upon his conduct and situation . Although still unable to shake off the indistinct fears which weighed like lead upon his spirit , he had , however , schooled himself into believing that he was perhaps the victim of his own imagination , and had so far prevailed over his hot temper and his pride as to form the resolution to seek once more an interview with Esther . He would once more , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would once more , but with more eloquent appeals than the tame language with which , as it now seemed to him , he had last urged his suit , again endeavor to tear her from the desolation in which she had made her home , would once more , and in bold and irresistible terms , warn her of the dangerous character of the unworthy knight whom she had admitted to her acquaintance . Should he find his first suspicious as baseless as he fondly prayed that they might prove , he would upon his knees implore her forgiveness , that he should have dared to profane the purity of her mind with the breath of his suspicions . If , however , he should find that those boding thoughts which still haunted him could not be dispelled by her presence , he would at any rate bid her farewell in a spirit more worthy both of her character and his own . Having once formed this resolution , he had , with the headlong impatience of his character , been unable to rest till he had fulfilled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had devoured the rugged and difficult tract of wilderness which still separated him from her , and had paused a moment within the edge of the thicket which fringed the glade before her door , to collect his whirling thoughts , and to calm his feverish brain . At that very moment , as he thus paused , in full view of that lowly door-step , but himself screened from sight by the protecting branches of the tree , he had been an involuntary witness to the concluding moments of Esther 's interview with the hated and mysterious adventurer . He stood there transfixed , gazing as mute and motionless upon the face of that fair Puritan , as if , like the loveliness of the fabled Medusa , it possessed the power to transform him to stone , while , as in that fearful fable , a thousand serpents sprang from the life 's blood which seemed slowly dropping from his heart . He stood there , like one enchanted , too distant to hear the low accents of Mabel , and with his whole soul concentrated in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthquake would hardly have aroused him . He heard not , spoke not , scarcely breathed , but he saw all that passed . He saw Esther place the chain in Gardiner 's hand ; he saw him kiss the sacred pledge of affection , accursed hypocrite that he was , and then place it next his heart ; he saw his smile of gratitude ; he saw Esther 's lips breathing the gentle accents of farewell ; he saw the long , audacious glance , with which the knight dwelt upon her retiring form ; he saw his smile of triumph as he advanced , in slow and repturous self communion as it seemed , directly towards the tree which sheltered his own figure . He saw all this , and stood motionless . He suppressed even his breath as he saw his hated rival striding so closely to him . The knight paused at last , and leaned against the tree . Maudsley was so near that he might almost touch him ; he saw the chain glittering upon his breast , he could almost see the bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their triumphal music in his brain . They were alone together in the wilderness , with only the stars to look down upon them , and his hand clutched the hilt of his sword convulsively , as he felt that if the hour of certainty and of despair had struck , that the hour of vengeance , too , had sounded . He stood there gazing upon the face of his successful rival , and resolved , as he studied the lineaments of that dark and impassible physiognomy , that he would calm himself before he addressed him , because he knew the self-balanced character of his antagonist , and was unwilling to confront the man who was always master of himself , while his own reason was well nigh blinded by his passion . He stood there striving in vain to compose himself , for a few rapid moments , and remembering that the spot where they now stood was too near the abode of Ludlow , and therefore unfitted for the work which they were soon to have in hand , he determined to accost Sir Christopher tranquilly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Maudsley was thus hesitating , the knight suddenly aroused himself from his reverie , and , with rapid movements , strode away from the tree in the direction of the coast . Maudsley , forgetting his resolution of calmness , and furious lest his prey should escape him , sprang madly forward , calling out to his enemy in a low , husky tone , choked with emotion , which was inaudible to the rapidly retreating and unconscious Gardiner . At the same moment his arm was suddenly clutched from behind , and his progress towards his antagonist impeded . Thus assaulted , he turned upon his new enemy , raising his sword to cut down the skulking savage , by whom he supposed himself attacked . What was his surprise to see that his arm had been seized , and his career arrested by the hand of a fair , slight youth , who held a dagger indeed , but whose frame , though graceful , seemed so powerless compared to his own , that he lowered his uplifted sword , contenting himself with shaking off the arm which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wonder into the face of the youth . " Spare him , spare him , Harry Maudsley , " said the young stranger , in a voice which was wild emotion . " Not to you , not to you belongs the task  --  you shall not escape me , " he continued , clinging with all his strength to Maudsley , who strove in vain to cast him off , as he found that the form of Gardiner had already disappeared in the darkling forest . Enraged at this singular and unaccountable interruption , maddened to see his enemy thus eluding his grasp , and cursing the folly which had restrained him from dashing to the earth the slender creature who had thus stepped between him and his revenge , he once more turned to him . " Now , by the God of Heaven , " he cried , " I know not what prevents me , thou insolent stripling , from cleaving thee to the earth . Whence come ye , in the name of the foul fiend , who , I believe , hath sent you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ye , and why have you dared thus to lay violent hands upon me , and to interfere with my purposes ? Speak , or even this slender frame shall not  --  . " Maudsley interrupted himself as he spoke , for his face was now close to his companion 's , and there was something fearful in the expression of the stripling 's beautiful but distorted features , and in the wild light that gleamed from his eyes , with the yellowish , unnatural glare of a savage creature of the forest . " Strike , if you will , " said the youth , without the slightest indication of fear , as he looked contemptuously upon the threatening blade of Maudsley  --  " strike , if you will . My purpose is at least answered . The knight is already far beyond your reach . Strike , Harry Maudsley , think you I fear your anger . Alas ! this heart of mine hath been more deeply struck this night than sword of yours could wound it . Strike , Harry Maudsley . Think ye my life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the heart of your fair and fickle Puritan ? " Maudsley chafing at this allusion to the wound which was festering in his bosom , and completely enraged that the interruption of the stranger had been , indeed , successful in compelling him to defer his vengeance upon Gardiner , exclaimed in a voice hoarse with passion  --  " I hardly know why I pause , why I obey not your bold defiance , save that I scorn to strike at aught so feeble . What art thou , peevish boy , that thou hast dared thus to intercept my purposes , and even to goad me beyond endurance , by thy sharp and scornful language . But I cry your pardon , my gentle youth . Doubtless , you too are a suitor to yon fair and fickle Puritan , as you term her , and have learned by what you have seen this evening , how well such suit is like to prosper . Is it so ? Tell me , and I will forgive thee for thy insolence . " The lad laughed a low , scornful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an indefinitely taunting expression , upon the face of Maudsley . " No , truly , Master Maudsley , you are strangely deceived by your passion . Think you , then , that yonder marble face and stony heart , to which you yourself bow down in such hopeless adoration , have such an omnipotent charm , that all who look upon her in this savage wilderness must straightway kneel and worship ? Oh , no , believe me , your frigid Puritan hath no charms for me . " " Insolent , presumptuous ? " interrupted Maudsley , who , however , was so impressed with the extraordinary apparition of this youth , whom he now looked upon for the first time , that he stood still and listened to him , with a curiosity excited by his mysterious appearance and language , that not even the tumultuous emotions that were raging in his bosom , could entirely extinguish . Who the singular stranger was , how he seemed to be so familiar with his name and person , how he was able thus to probe the secrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus to taunt and dare him to his face , with such impunity , were questions which he asked himself but could not answer . " No , Master Maudsley , no , " continued the stranger , " neither insolent nor presumptuous . My words are meant in kindness , for God knows I would almost spare my deadliest enemy the pang of jealousy . " The youth 's features were livid with emotion , and his voice grew hoarse and husky as he spoke , but he commanded himself again , and continued in a more gay but bitter tone ,  --  " No , no , Harry Maudsley , your wondrous Puritan hath no charms for me . I loathe the very name of Puritan , I hate their rigid looks , frigid hearts , and insolent sanctity , and for yonder daughter and fitting model of her whole dreary sect , I assure you I do esteem her well assorted in this gloomy wilderness . Believe me , I looked upon you but now with pity , when I marked the benumbing spell spread over you by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse , " said Maudsley , " the privilege of thy weakness . I would I knew if thou wert man or child , angel or demon , that thou standest here calmly mocking me , while I stand listening like a slave . " " Be calm , Harry Maudsley , " answered the mysterious youth , while Maudsley , who really seemed in a manner fascinated , and who , perhaps , as would not have seemed extraordinary in that age of boundless superstition , believed himself in the presence of something unearthly , stood obediently silent again . " Be calm , Harry Maudsley ; I tell you I pitied you from my heart , when I saw you thus spell-bound by your cold enchantress . No , the woman I could worship should be one who should make the blood whirl through the veins , not a statue carved in ice , to freeze my heart and chill my senses . " " Why then , " asked Maudsley , " why in the name of Heaven , if you are not bound by some singular tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why are you thus interested , why were you thus impassioned , why did you arrest my arm , and frustrate my intentions ; in one word , whence and what are ye ? " " Faith , " answered the lad , still in the same gentle but taunting manner , " I hardly know why I should answer your catechism . My own information as to your name and purposes , your past and your future career , are all sufficiently well known to me , and yet have I not intruded upon the privacy of your thoughts by one single question ? " " My future ! my future ! inexplicable and perplexing being ! " exclaimed Maudsley , " presumest thou then to read the dark , unwritten page of coming events ? " " Truly , " answered the stranger , " it needeth no ghost from the grave to foretell thy future . A less preternatural hand might venture to lift the curtain , which hardly conceals the mad career of such a reckless spirit as thou seemest . " " Read it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maudsley , impatiently . " No , no , " exclaimed his companion , " I am no necromancer nor mountebank . Least of all , to-night , shouldst thou listen to thy doom . Suffice that if I read the stars aright , thy fortune is still within thy command , thy destiny not so direful as thou thinkest . Nay more , thou shalt have a pledge of this promise . Mark me , ere three days are flown , shalt thou find around thy neck , something which is very dear to thy heart . " " What mean you by this riddle ? " exclaimed Maudsley  --  " and what know ye of  --  " " Ask me no farther , " interrupted the youth , " what I know , I know . Suffice it you to know , that where you most love , I most hate , where you most hate , I most madly love . Yet am I not your enemy , nay more , I would be your friend , but that friendship from me is a mockery and a curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good wishes , " interrupted Maudsley , " but I could wish you to talk less in parables , which convey but dim intelligence to my uninstructed ear . Know ye , since ye forbid me to ask you further of yourself , and since you disclaim all interest in , and all affection for the fair Puritan who dwelleth yonder , know ye yon false-hearted knight , whom men call Sir Christopher Gardiner ? " " Do I know the knight ? " almost shrieked the stranger , in a shrill passionate tone . " Do I know him ? " and the boy laughed a hollow , mocking laugh , that almost chilled the listener 's blood . " Truly I know him well . And yet I pity him , I pity thee , I pity yon fair , icy maiden , I pity each and all of ye more , ten thousand times more , than I do myself . There might be creatures who , if they looked in upon my heart even now , might pity even while they shrank from me . No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the time shall come , perhaps , when the strange and bewildering scroll shall be as plain to our senses as if written in letters of light . I cry your pardon , " added the youth , suddenly checking himself , and speaking in an altered and more moderate tone , " I am much to blame , but sometimes I fear my brain is turning . This wandering late of nights may be hurtful . You ask me if I know one Sir Christopher Gardiner . I bade you to question me no further , yet you shall be answered . Beware , Harry Maudsley . Look to your beautiful Puritan . Though she be marble , she may be moved , though she be ice , she may melt ; and I tell you that , if there be one silver cord of human tenderness within her heart , the hand of the wily tempter hath already struck it , and awakened its slumbering music . " The youth paused , and looked at Maudsley with an expression of profound commiseration , as he saw how deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more upon his arm with an almost caressing gentleness , as he said in a low and melancholy tone ,  --  " Alas ! we are all consumed by selfishness . Believe me , I spoke wildly and perhaps unwisely . Tell me , " continued the boy almost fondly , " is yonder fair-faced Puritan so dear to your heart then ? " " I know not from what source , " answered Maudsley , " that you derive your mysterious power over my mind . Tell me , I conjure you , why do I thus stand listening like a slave to your wild and incoherent ravings ? " " You have not answered my question , " continued the youth , still in the same caressing tone . " Tell me , is the maiden so dear to you then ? " " She was . " " And is she so no longer ? " " No . " " Alas , Harry Maudsley , I know you better than you know yourself . Yours is a nature where passion obeys not reason . You love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . Look yonder at the cold , pale , virgin moon , " said the youth , as the crests of the shadowy forests became silvery in the rising radiance . " Serene and passionless she sails in yonder calm and distant ether , and heeds not the tumultuous tides of ocean , which follow her high command like spell-bound slaves . Such is your fair and soulless mistress . I pity you , and ah ! how truly can I sympathize with you . Think you I know not what brought you hither over the wintry sea ? and think you I do no honor to the thought ? I too , I too , who have forsaken home , and happiness , and God , only to wander in the wilderness till my heart bleeds itself to death , I too can pity , sympathize with , yea , render honor to the abject slave of love  --  wandering in deserts , braving peril , sacrificing his all , and all for naught . " " My sacrifices are over , boy , " said Maudsley ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it in the desert . I know not your sorrows , but I fain would know them . Let us return together across the stormy deep . Neither to you nor to myself , I fear , is the crown decreed after all our struggles . Will you go with me ? " The moon-light shone full upon the pale , beautiful face of the youth . Maudsley saw that his eyes were full of tears . " No , Harry Maudsley , I go with none . I must do my work alone . For me there is no returning , no reprieve . Your heart is kind , and deserves a better fate than seemeth now in store for it . Believe me , it shall go better with thee , and trust the word of one who hath so long been out of fortunes favor , that he hath ceased to hope for himself , that your star shall soon emerge from the clouds . Farewell , Harry Maudsley , perhaps we meet again . " The boy seized his hand , pressed it passionately to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but in vain . He followed in the direction in which he had vanished , but could find no trace of him . Obeying some irresistible impulse he dashed forward in pursuit . Plunging through the difficult and briery thicket , now caught by mighty grapevines which twined like coiling serpents round his limbs , now hurled to the ground by the grey , protecting branches of the ancient trees , and now struggling through the dreary morass which quaked and shifted beneath his feet , still on he sped , through the silent night and the darkling forest . He reached the shore , he looked forth upon the mighty waste of waters . The moon hung in cloudless glory above the tossing waves , and the long column of light lay upon the ocean 's surface like a prostrate pillar of silvery fire . But neither on shore or sea could his eyes discern any trace of a living creature . He threw himself on the sandy beach , and listened to the monotonous but musical roar of the surf . His wild and whirling thoughts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublime solitude , and his boiling blood flowed more calmly . CHAPTER XIII . THE MAY-DAY REVELS AT MERRY-MOUNT . The last day of April had arrived , and the eccentric sovereign of Merry-Mount , who had promised to his subjects and himself a celebration of the ensuing festival of May-day , according to the good old custom of merry England , had completed his preparations . Many of the guests had already assembled , for the sports were to commence upon the eve , and to be continued through the following day . A rabble rout of vagabonds of all descriptions had assembled at Merry-Mount . All his numerous subjects and retainers , including those of the reader 's acquaintance who had already recovered from the damages sustained in the conflict at Mishawum , were lounging about the pathways of the forest or amusing themselves upon the open glade around the palace , with various uproarious sports . Upon the summit of the bare and elevated mound which rose on the seaward side of Morton 's territory , the sovereign himself was seated in company with Henry Maudsley and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , my masters , " said Morton , " that you have kindly consented to grace our poor revels . A poor and meagre substitute , I fear me , for the ample and jovial revelry of old England 's merriest holiday , our entertainment may prove ; still good humor shall not be wanting , nor such good cheer as the wilderness may afford . " " I hope my worthy gossip , Robin Bootefish , hath quite recovered from his ugly knocks from yonder red-legged vermin , " said the blacksmith ; " truly was he pounded into a jelly , and I never thought at one time to see him on his pegs again . A good swashing fellow is Robin , and a hearty fellow at a hug with a red-breech ; I hope his soul and body hold together , Master Morton . " " Hold together ! that do they indeed , " answered Morton ; " honest Robin 's soul and body are as well coopered together again as ever a one of his own ale-butts over which he presides with so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-so . I fear me from your cloudy countenance that you have but small spirit for these follies . " " In truth , Master Morton , " answered Maudsley , who still lingered from habit at the place where he had temporarily and for his own purposes established himself , but to whom , as may be easily supposed , the habits of the Merry-Mount crew were distasteful enough in his present state of mind ; " in truth , I fear I shall be but a sorry guest at your festivities , and you must pardon me for reminding you that , by our compact , I am to be but a lookeron , and not an actor . " " As you please , as you please , " answered Morton , " you shall find that our majesty of Merry-Mount is less despotic than our royal brother of England . Nobody shall dance or sing upon compulsion in my dominions ; but trust me , Master Maudsley , you would do well , for your own sake , to take that gloomy mask off your handsome face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint who may have cracked his lantern-jaws with too much yawning and singing of hallelujahs . By the way , I regret that our estimable , but rather serious friend , Sir Christopher , hath positively refused us his presence . He is at present at New Plymouth , I believe . " The gloom upon Maudsley 's haggard features was certainly not enlivened by the concluding allusion of Morton to the absent knight , who had hitherto eluded his pursuit , and his voice trembled with suppressed emotion as he replied ,  --  " I have heard that the knight , with whom by the way my acquaintance is but limited , had made a pilgrimage to Plymouth . I have some trifling matters of business to settle with him , and trust ere long that he will return . I presume you know something of his movements , Master Morton . " " Truly , but little can safely be predicted of Sir Christopher 's movements , " was the reply , " unless one could have the good fortune to look at their very intricate springs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom . Still I shall marvel much if he do not return to his customary haunt before many days have passed . " " It appears that your sports , " said Maudsley , who was desirous of changing the subject of their conversation , " are to commence this afternoon . I suppose your May-pole , however , will hardly be erected before morning , as that I think is the usage , at any rate , in the part of England which I inhabit . " " The May-games , " answered Morton , who was full of quaint information upon this , and upon all kindred subjects , " were not always confined to the first of May , nor concluded in one day . They , are indeed , Master Maudsley , a relic of ancient custom among the heathen , who religiously celebrated the four last days of April and the first of May , as a festival in honor of the goddess Flora , the gentle deity of flowers and fruit . The ancients were a genial and an imaginative race . By the beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake at my birth , and that I was intended to have flourished among the pagans . " " But I believe , " said Maudsley , " that an equal homage has been always paid to the same divinity , although under a less classical appellation , from the remotest times , both in England and in other lands . " " Unquestionably , " said Morton , " the custom hath been time-honored among Christians as well as pagans , and I swear that the benighted heathens of this Ultima Thule shall also learn to respect it . The peasantry of England and of other countries hold that the observation of the ceremony is a good omen , and will propitiate the warm favors of the Summer , and win the golden treasures of Autumn . " " In old times , " said Maudsley , " I think I have heard or read that , as in antiquity , the revels of May were protracted much beyond a single day in England . " " Of a surety , " replied Morton . " In the reign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its festivities , that May perforce usurped the dominion of its sunny sister June . Those , Master Maudsley , were the glorious days of graceful and manly sport , and the returning smiles of spring were hailed and courted amid the waving of pennoned lances , the career of panoplied knights , the clangor of trumpets , the smiles of beauty . Day after day on horseback , on foot , with spear and sword , cross-bow and quarter-staff , would the gallant knights continue their tournament , maintaining the charms and the supremacy of their sovereign Lady May against all comers from far or near . " " But the custom was of far more ancient observance , I believe , " said Maudsley , who was listlessly endeavoring to distract his stormy thoughts , by affecting an interest in the subject , which at that moment engrossed his companion 's whole attention . " More ancient ! " exclaimed Morton ; " marry , I would fain know at what remote period there was an England without a May-day . Not surely in the glorious days of King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the genial month appeared , would ride forth early in the morn , a Maying into the woods and fields , attended by her knights of the round table , all clad in green , all mounted on their mettled steeds , each bearing a fair lady on his crupper , and each followed by his esquire and yeoman . Alas , my masters , I do ill to dazzle ye by invoking the stirring memories of brighter ages ; but a wayfarer in the wilderness , like myself , must even do his best with the materials which he can find . " " There is a meaning and a moral in all such ceremonies , " said Maudsley , " although the sad-browed saints , whose fingers itch to pluck all the gay plumage from life , can never see it . " " Marry , " replied Morton , " and what a forlorn and shivering chicken will poor humanity prove when they have pulled all the painted feathers out of its tail . A fig for life when it hath lost its illusion . The foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it hath grown virtuous and sensible and regenerated . These wiseacres , who would crop the world of its frivolities as closely as they trim their own skulls , may have the whole of it to themselves and welcome , as soon as they have completed their work . When life is drained of its liquor , they may live in the empty butt as merrily as Diogenes in his tub , and no interference from Thomas Morton . In the mean time , Master Maudsley , there shall be mirth and dancing , good liquor and good fellowship . But lo ! our friend , the Cyclops of Mishawum , lieth already in the arms of Morpheus . I fear I have been tedious as a Puritan . Moreover , the hours are advancing , let me first awaken this slumbering giant , and then with your permission , Master Maudsley , we will descend to the plain yonder . " The blacksmith was accordingly awakened from a refreshing nap , which the didactic conversation of Morton had induced , and the three accordingly descended from the mound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fine and warm , the season was a forward one , so that there was a prospect which might not have always proved the case , that the necessary garlands and budding branches would be found for the morrow 's purposes , and upon the whole , the spring , in this climate more than in any other , the most perverse , coquettish , and fickle of seasons , seemed desirous of rewarding her ardent and light-hearted adorer with her sunniest smiles . The open glade around the palace was thronged with a strange and motley assemblage . We have already observed , that besides the large number of vagabonds of various descriptions who occupied the log-houses which were clustered and formed a little village around the palace of the suzerain , there had been a general invitation given by Morton to all the scattered inhabitants of the neighborhood to share his hospitality upon this occasion . Moreover , a considerable number of Indians of both sexes , who had long been upon terms of intimacy with the Merry-Mount crew , and many of whom , in consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acknowledge him as their liege lord , were mingled indiscriminately with groups of Englishmen , as wild in conduct , if paler in countenance , than themselves . Boisterous games , frantic peals of laughter , loud and incoherent and often incomprehensible language , English chatter and English oaths intermixed with the guttural grunting of the Indians , in short , a distracting variety of screams , shouts and yells awoke the echoes of the hilly amphitheatre which encircled the scene . " Come , my merry men all , " said Morton , as soon as he arrived among them , " the sun is already near setting ,  --  ' t is time we decided the contest between the forces of Winter and Summer ; for beshrew me , if we win not the victory , the May-pole may stand another year in the forest among its brethren , with the crows building their nests in its branches , instead of being borne and erected in triumph upon the summit of Merry-Mount . " " Please your worship , " said Bootefish , who now came forward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the banquet of this evening are completed , the ducks are spitted , the pigeons trussed , the lobsters disemboweled , the ale broached , the spirits ready , and our spirits willing  --  I only wait your worship 's orders . " " Spoken like a Spartan , most laconic of butlers , " answered Morton , and now do me the favor to draw off your party , or rather order the two prefects to lead each his own to the summit of the mount . " Bootefish , who was Morton 's prime minister and grand coadjutor upon all great occasions , and who felt himself entirely in his element when engaged in ceremonies of any sort , now seized a brazen trumpet which hung at his waist , and blew a blast which made the forest ring again . As he concluded his strain , two grotesquely attired creatures were seen suddenly to issue from different thickets of the neighboring wood , and advance towards the company . The first seemed a cross between an ourang outang and a bear , walking erect like the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a tall , grim figure , with the face of a man looking hideously forth from a tangled thicket of beard which hung around his face and swept his breast . His whole body as well as his arms , legs , hands and feet were covered with black and rugged fur ; a garland of winter green was upon his head , and another encircled his waist . This Orson held an oaken cudgel in his hand and advanced boldly towards the assemblage , making a series of uncouth gestures . This was the embodiment of Winter . The other figure came dancing and skipping forward with the airy movements of a Zephyr , although his merry features would hardly have seemed sufficiently divine to captivate Aurora . A garland of wind-flowers and violets adorned his brows , a robe of green gossamer floated lightly from his shoulders , his legs and feet were adorned with buskins and sandals , and he had wings upon his heels . Thus attired , and presenting a happy combination of Ariel , Mercury , and Zephyr , this airy being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalis , according to the pedantic Morton 's expression , skipped forward with many fantastic contortions towards the assembled spectators . The two suddenly met in the centre of the glade , and gazed at each other with apparent astonishment and indignation . Suddenly , Orson , with a howl of rage , lifted his mighty club , Zephyr raised his light and flower-wreathed wand to defend himself ; but just as the blow was descending , skipped nimbly back , while his ferocious antagonist , losing his balance by the unresisted violence of his own attack , floundered clumsily upon the ground . Zephyr now frisked briskly forward , and began to dance upon his prostrate body , but Orson suddenly rousing himself with a roar , the aerial being tumbled in his turn , while Orson again threatened to demolish him with his club . Summer lay stark and stiff upon the ground awaiting the decisive stroke ; the blow descended , but ere it struck the victim , the prostrate Zephyr suddenly darted into the air , thrusting out a long , red tongue , and while his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly upon his shoulders , and tied himself in a knot about his neck . Orson , thus incommoded , howled hideously and capered round the field , striving in vain to free himself . It was useless , the imp securely held his seat , grinning like a mythological monkey . Suddenly , Orson collecting all his energies , plunged wildly forward , directly towards a large tree which stood near the centre of the glade , apparently determined to dash out the brains , both of himself and his persecutor . As he reached the tree , however , the Zephyr skipped nimbly from his post , caught a projecting branch , and swung himself upon it . The luckless Orson gained nothing by his stratagem , but a useless thump of his own hairy carcass against the tree , the force of which brought him again upon the ground . Zephyr jumped again from his perch , his eyes glittering with triumph ; but ere he had achieved the victory by standing again upon his prostrate body , his enemy was up again , and again menacing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew a second blast , and at the sound the two champions desisted from their combat , and with threatening gestures separated from each other . The whole assemblage , who had been gazing with much glee at the combat between the representatives of Summer and Winter , seemed to regret that it had been decided neither way , but while they were shouting for its renewal they were directed to divide themselves into two parties . At the word of command , and with the promptness of drilled soldiers , they obeyed the orders , and divided themselves into two equal portions ; over the one of which Orson instantly assumed command , while the other arrayed itself under the banners of Zephyr . The two parties , marching in harmony with the trumpet of Bootefish , which all the while was blowing martial sounds , now advanced towards the mound , which they ascended at the opposite ends . Morton , as umpire of the impending combat , had preceded them to the summit , and had seated himself upon a rock , where , attended by Walford and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two parties , numbering some twenty-five upon a side , stood in single file along the hill-top . Their leaders now arranged them across the breadth of the mound , so that only about the half of each party stood upon the table-land , while the other portions maintained a difficult footing upon the steep sides of the cliff , by clinging to each other . Bootefish now blew another blast from his trumpet , and then waving his hand for silence , in a very impressive manner spoke as follows :  --  " Oyez , Oyez , know ye , good people all assembled , that our gracious sovereign lord , Thomas Morton , Prince of Passanogessit , and suzerain of Merry-Mount , not being satisfied with the combat betwixt the forces of the winter and spring , hath been graciously pleased to ordain , that ye all , here and now assembled , and equally and fairly matched , do each and all of ye , here and now offer your own bodies upon the issue , and by true and manful wager of battle , decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dignified Bootefish blew another blast , and then added in a less pompous manner , " Now fall to work , ye devils ye , red , white , and grey ,  --  pull Dick , pull devil , hug heathen , hug Christian , and make the matter short , or by the Lord , the brant geese will be burned to a cinder . " The stately butler , who already began to be impatient , lest the banquet , which had occupied so much of his attention lately , should be spoiled by delay , now withdrew towards the vicinity of his liege lord , and looked upon the contest with some impatience . The two leaders , Orson and Zephyr , now joined hands together upon the summit , with their followers dangling in a chain , each clasping the waist of the one before him in the line . Manfully and ferociously they tugged , each striving to pull their antagonists over to their own side or to the ground . For a long time they stood locked , motionless , and so evenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last Orson , with a howl , which was responded to by the shrill whoop of half a score of savages , hugged the grimacing Zephyr within his hairy arms , and pulled the whole opposing column half a dozen feet towards him by main strength . Zephyr , half suffocated in his embrace , lay apparently powerless in his arms , and hardly made an effort to resist the attack , but no sooner did he find himself partially at liberty and on his feet again , than he dexterously turned a somerset , still holding Orson by his shaggy fore-paws , and twisting his elastic legs tightly about the monster 's throat , ordered the nearest link in the living chain which hung behind himself , to pull with might and main . He obeyed , while the strangling Orson , helpless and powerless , was dragged forward like a bull to the shambles , with his cohort struggling confusedly after him . Suddenly there was a pause , the party who were so nearly victorious began to yield again . Zephyr still hung , but with relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative of winter , breathing and gaining strength again , began to press backwards , dragging his opponents after him with prodigious vigor . Zephyr , still loosely clinging to his foe , allowed himself to be dragged to the edge of the cliff , the opposite column shouting all the while their yells of triumph , when suddenly he untwisted his legs , threw a back somerset , wrenched himself free from Orson 's clutches as he did so , and then stood on his feet at the head of his column , while his antagonist , who , with his whole party , had been tugging with might and main to drag their enemies to the brow of the precipice , now suddenly released from the opposing pressure , toppled backwards upon his men , who all fell one upon another , heels over head , down the steep side of the mount , rolling helter-skelter on each other , till they reached the marsh below , some of them even sousing themselves in the creek at the base of the hill , before the impetus of their descent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast , and the lord of Merry-Mount stepping forward , announced that the combat was terminated in favor of the cohorts of Summer , and that accordingly , upon the following morning , the Summer should be brought home with appropriate ceremonies and symbols of victory . He farther announced , that as the evening was approaching , and the immediate business of the day terminated , he invited the worshipful company to do him the honor of their presence at the grand banquetting-hall of the palace . The ceremonious Bootefish now again sounded his trumpet , while the discomfited Orson , with his prostrate followers , arose and struggled from the morass which had received them , shaking the mud and water from their garments , and once more ascended to the summit of the mount . Here , at the command of their sovereign lord , both champions embraced each other in token of amity , Orson hugging the breath out of Zephyr 's body , and Zephyr returning the compliment by again half strangling his late antagonist with his supple legs . The whole party now formed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and master of ceremonies , who waddled down the steep declivity as majestically as his short legs would allow , they followed the Prince of Passanogessit and his two companions , Maudsley and the blacksmith , towards the palace . An abundant supply of good cheer and good liquor had been provided , and the banquetting-room , which was capacious enough to hold about one half the guests , was soon thronged , while the remainder of the company , who could find no room , were satisfied with bivouacking upon the outside , where they were liberally supplied from the tables within the house . Master Morton presided with solemn dignity , upon an elevated dais or platform at one end of the rude hall , where Maudsley also found a seat , and looked distractedly at the wild and grotesque scene which presented itself to his eyes . The shades of evening had already settled upon the forest , but the rude hall was as usual lighted by the broad glare of numerous pine torches which threw a fitful light upon the strangely assorted company , where the ruddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saxon mingled wildly with the flashing eyes , painted faces and rude but picturesque costume of the savage children of the forest , who sat as motionless at the revel as if sculptured in bronze . The company upon the outside had lighted a fire , around which they were clustered , while the food and liquor , laughter and song went round , and before many hours had elapsed , they were joined by the other party , who had found themselves somewhat cramped by the confined dimensions of the royal banquetting hall . Here the mirth and uproar were continued till late in the night , or rather till early in the morning , although Morton , who had ordered all matters with a foresight befitting so solemn an occasion , had taken care that but a limited quantity of liquor should be served out at this introductory portion of the revels . The sovereign of Merry-Mount , as soon as he thought that the banquetting had gone far enough , had himself retreated within his domicile to snatch a short repose . At about two o'clock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity into the midst of the assembled rioters who were still congregated about the bonfire , he mounted upon the stump of a large tree which had been felled , and addressed them as follows :  --  " My faithful lieges and dutiful subjects , we are of opinion that this night 's revel hath already been sufficiently protracted . Therefore , be it known to ye , that it is our pleasure that ye do now , one and all , and in such parties as your tastes may arrange , go presently forth into yonder forest , there to collect the choicest garlands , and to hew to the earth the mighty pine already selected for our May-pole , which now still standeth among its leafy brethren . Ye will at sunrise bring home in triumph the majestic symbol of the returning spring , and with appropriate ceremonies erect it upon yonder mount , where it shall serve as a fair sea-mark to guide all comers upon the morrow , who desire to partake of the hospitality of our palace of Merry-Mount . " Furthermore be it known unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sovereign specific for restoring and renovating the lustre of the human countenance . Ye will do well to bathe your visages , something time-stained and haply flushed with liquor as they may be , that beauty may be spread over them , as behoveth the gallant followers and sworn lieges of our sovereign , Lady May . Go forth , my lieges , and your sovereign shall , after a little time , follow in your footsteps . " As the suzerain concluded his oration , which was received with uproarous demonstrations of applause , the company , with many a whoop and yell , divided themselves into different parties , and plunged forth in various directions into the forest which surrounded the palace . Morton withdrew again into his mansion , while the blacksmith , who had no mind to sacrifice his sleep in order to participate in these midnight ceremonies , and who cared not to enhance the beauty of his swarthy visage by bathing it in May dew , stretched himself at his vast length by the embers of the fire , and was soon lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the borders of the forest , till he was wearied with the conflict of his own distracting thoughts , retired into his own log-hut , which stood in the neighborhood of the palace . CHAPTER XIV . CONTINUATION OF THE MAY-DAY REVELS . The sun rose brightly from the sea upon May-day morning , and Maudsley , who had found but slight and unsatisfactory repose within his hut , stood upon the summit of the mount , and refreshed his weary soul with a contemplation of the majestic scenery around him . Although he was by nature of a wayward and impetuous disposition , and although his prejudices , from the earliest period of his life , had enlisted him strongly against the gloomy and austere principles of Puritanism , he could not but confess , as he looked upon that solemn and impressive wilderness scene , so full of fresh and uncontaminated beauty , that it were indeed a prostitution of nature , if the virgin purity , the cool and shady loveliness of this sylvan world were to be profaned forever by orgies such as he had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something within his bosom responsive to the enthusiastic spirit of Esther Ludlow , which suggested the thought , that it were a nobler destination for this stern and unappropriated wilderness , to become a new realm for earnest and self-sustained enthusiasts who had become weary of the older world , than to fall under the base dominion of the scum of Europe , conducted thither by leaders impelled by purposes of self-aggrandizement , and seeking only to transplant upon this wild territory the worn-out follies , the decrepid purposes , the reeking crimes of civilization . He thought , as he stood alone upon that cliff , of the contrast between the grovelling pursuits and the ribald character of the men who dwelt around , and the lofty if fanatical nature of those , concerning whose welfare and success he could not , in spite of himself , but participate somewhat in the interest which was so enthusiastically felt by Esther . He imagined that even he , too , felt that within him which could abjure the world , where he had dwelt till he had found or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself for a moment to a vague dream of what happiness there might be in this beautiful land , alone with one who was dearer to him than the whole world beside , when suddenly the dark shadow of the knight rose upon his fancy , and dispelled in an instant the soothing vision . At a moment when he was struggling to shake off the thoughts which were again thronging to his brain , he was awakened at once to a vivid perception of the world about him , by a variety of shrill and uproarious sounds which issued from the forest . At first , so entirely had he forgotten the mummery of the preceding evening , and the promised sports of the present day , he was at a loss to account for the sounds , but as soon as he observed one or two of his late companions emerging from the woods , he recollected that the May morning had arrived , and he descended from the eminence towards the open glade . In a few moments the whole wild crew , who had passed the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after a short pause formed a procession and moved slowly towards the mount . They were bringing home the May-pole , which was a vast pine nearly a hundred feet in length . The tree had been stripped of its bark and branches , ornamented with garlands of wintergreen and forest-tree blossoms , and placed upon rudely constructed wheels . In place of oxen , some fifty savages were yoked together , each wearing May garlands upon their swarthy brows , and evidently taking a grave satisfaction in thus assisting at a solemn ceremony , which Bootefish had assured them was an initiatory step towards their conversion from paganism , and which was sure to require copious besprinklings of the strong water , which they worshipped as the white man 's God . Thus harnessed , the savages drew the mighty May-pole slowly along , with the Lord of Merry-Mount seated upon it in solemn state . The rest of the company thronged around him in his triumphal progress , marching in unison to the braying of trumpets and the thump of drums , whose rude music sounded strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great efforts , the May-pole was at last brought to the top of the Merry-Mount , where , after a pair of elk antlers had been fastened to its top , and the red cross banner of England , with a variety of other pennons , added to its other decorations , it was triumphantly erected upon the summit . Many shouts of congratulation now rent the air , and then the company , a little wearied with their exertions , threw themselves upon the ground for a few moments ' repose . Morton and several of his adherents now withdrew for a time from the mount , leaving the company under the charge of his lieutenant and grand master of the ceremonies ; who , after serving out to them what he considered a sufficient quantity of liquor , soon after retired himself . A grand arbor was now constructed of green branches upon the hill , not far from the May-pole , and another of lesser dimensions near it . A considerable time had thus been spent , and the sun was already approaching the zenith , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the palace , and presently a fantastically attired company were seen advancing gravely toward the mount . The procession was led by the sovereign of Merry-Mount himself , who , as Lord of the May , was attired according to immemorial custom in the green forest garb of Robin Hood . He wore moreover upon his head a gilt and glittering crown , and held a gilded staff in his hand , as symbols of his supremacy . Hanging upon his arm , came a dark-eyed , dusky daughter of the forest , who , for lack of a fairer representative , was arrayed as Maid Marian , the May Lord 's favorite dame . She too , as Queen of the May , wore a gilded crown upon her swarthy brows , with her glossy black tresses floating almost to her feet , and was arrayed in gaily colored robes of purple and crimson cloth . They were followed by Cakebread , who had recovered from the effects of the flagellation received at Mishawum , and who now figured as court jester . The respectable buffoon wore a fool's-cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantaloons , whereof one leg was of flame color and the other of purple . He held a bauble or fool 's baton in his hand , and his dress was hung with little bells , which jingled merrily as he danced along , occasionally refreshing himself and the spectators with one of his favorite somersets . Next came the grave and dignified Bootefish as Friar Tuck , his short but portly person arrayed in a monkish robe bound about his ample waist with a cord from which hung a rosary and cross , and his rubicund physiognomy looking particularly effulgent , as it broke out like the rising sun from the dark and cloud-like cowl which covered his venerable head . Rednape followed as the lover of Maid Marian , wearing a tawdry cap , ornamented with a wreath of violets , fastened securely to the right side of his head , and a sky-blue jacket ; while his long legs were daintily incased in scarlet breeches and hose , cross gartered , and with countless ribbons and true lover 's knots streaming from every portion of his dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by less distinguished members of the company , and wearing immoderately loose breeches , curling shoes of a yard 's dimension , and enormous , empty sleeves hanging from their gaily colored jerkins . The principal musical performer followed , with a drum hanging from his neck , a tamborine in his hand , and a lathe sword at his side . Next came a creature with a wolf 's head and a fox 's tail , with half a dozen green and golden snakes wreathed round his waist ; after him , a kind of goblin wearing the grim head and portentous teeth of a shark , with a dragon 's tail ; then several palmers masqued and cloaked ; then a jack-in-the-green , or living pyramid of blossoming branches , dancing grotesquely along to the wild music which accompanied the procession . Last of all came the merry Bernaby Doryfall , riding the hobby-horse , the animal 's head and shoulders artistically contrived of pasteboard , while an ample housing , or rather petticoat of parti-colored cloth , descended to the ground , and effectually concealed the rider 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable appearance , and flourished a wooden dagger in his right hand , while with the other he reined in his restive steed as he gaily pranced and capered about , bringing up the rear of the pageant in a very effective style . The procession ascended the mount in an orderly manner , and arranged themselves about the May-pole , while the rest of the revellers arose from their recumbent positions and stood , awaiting the orders of their sovereign . That potentate now took a roll of paper from his bosom , upon which he had inscribed a short poem , setting forth , in very high flown and classical doggerel , an allegorical description of the ceremony , combined with many enigmatical allusions to the present and prospective condition of the nascent empire of the Massachusetts.This , after he had read it in a sonorous and impressive voice , he gravely affixed to the May-pole , that it might serve for the edification of his guests , whenever they felt inclined for literary relaxation . Then , with an indescribable air of majesty , he again extended his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted her with stately step to the great arbor , where he seated her upon a rustic throne . Then advancing once more in front of the verdant tent , he exclaimed ,  --  " With gilded staff and crossed scarf , the May Lord , here I stand . " " Know ye , therefore , my faithful subjects , that your sports are to be conducted in an orderly and reputable guise , so as in no wise to cast discredit upon the court of your sovereign , or to invoke a blush upon the tender cheek of our loving queen ,  --  Music , awake ! ye lieges all advance , And circling join in merry Morrice dance . " ' Thus having spoken , the merry monarch seated himself at the side of his queen , while the whole of the company , Christians and heathens , friars and dragons , palmers , masquers and mummers all joined hand in hand , and danced madly about the May-pole . Round and round they frisked , their brains , already heated with draughts stronger than May-dew , whirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantic with unbridled excitement , ringing forth upon the solemn wilderness around them so wildly and discordantly , that the very beasts which peopled the forests might have shrunk to their caves in dismay . Round and round they whirled , shouting , laughing , yelling ; now some of them rolling by dozens upon the earth , and dragged about by their companions till they found their feet again ; now the more active of them leaping and curvetting over each other 's heads , or frisking about upon each other 's shoulders , the riders hallooing in triumph and the victims staggering blindly about , but all yelling and leaping as if the wild and stunning music which still played more and more furiously had maddened their senses or transformed them into goblins . Faster and faster flew their heels , louder and louder sounded the diabolical strains of the music , more fierce and frantic rose the piercing shouts ; startling the echoes of the stern and savage hills around them , which seemed to reverberate an indignant response to their demoniacal merriment . Suddenly Cakebread , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centre of the group , shaking his bauble , and commanding silence . The whirling vortex paused for a moment in its mad career , and the revellers , knowing scarcely if they stood upon heads or heels , became stationary for a moment , to listen to his communication . " Look ye , my masters , " he cried , " this is indeed the music of the spheres , though something cracked and discordant it may be , and this the circling of the starry hosts around the sun . Beshrew me , though , but these whirls be faster than befitteth some of the planets . As for me , I am a comet , bound to no orbit , and dance but for my own pleasure . If ye will that I execute a hornpipe , such as my virtuous dam , whom the Lord assoilzie , was wont to delight the world withal , so  --  if not , may the devil blow his trumpet , and set ye all whirling again  --  but the comet shall break loose from your influences . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stating confidentially to his friends that his parents had both been rope-dancers and fire-eaters by profession , and that he had been brought up from earliest childhood to their respectable calling . Furthermore , he was apt to mention that his destiny in life had been perverted by a pious and charitable schoolmaster , who had attempted to save him , like a brand from the burning , and had instructed him in Latin and the humanities , but had thrown him away again afterwards . By this process he had acquired an enlightened education , but had lost his ancestral calling , and had become neither flesh nor fish , and only fitted for a buffoon . This may serve to explain his vein of conversation , occasionally more ambitious than that of his confederates . The company signified their approbation of his intentions , and accordingly Peter Cakebread came forward , his eyes glittering with merriment , and executed his promised hornpipe with wonderful zeal and agility , and in a manner to do credit to his parentage and education . Never before , at least in that wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings , such a breathless profusion of miraculous somersets , such a hopeless confusion and entanglement of head , heels , arms , and legs , in one rapid and bewildering contortion . Merrily jingled the jester 's bells upon foolscap , jerkin , and bauble , as he span and gambolled about , and merrily did the company applaud , as they gazed with open mouths and staring eyes upon this exhibition of his dexterity , and swore that he must have made a compact with the evil one , and exchanged his soul for a skeleton of whalebone , so superhuman did his pranks appear . In short , Peter Cakebread outdid himself , and seemed to have combined and embodied within himself , at least for that occasion , all the extraordinrry and necromantic qualities of his departed and illustrious parents . As he finished his dance , by standing stock-still upon the point of one toe , in the most graceful and preternatural manner , he was greeted with noisy plaudits , in which the sovereign of the revels heartily joined , as he sat there upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he cried ; " of a truth thou hast surpassed thyself . A merrier buffoon , a nimbler morrice-dancer , choreis aptior et jocis , ' it could hardly have been my lot to meet with in this savage wilderness . Thy sovereign drinks to thy health , and the gentle Marian likewise , " he concluded , after touching with his lips the tankard presented officiously by Bootefish , and then extending it to the dusky sharer of his throne , who , nothing loth , did due honor to the toast , or at least to the tankard , which she seemed better to understand . After Cakebread had finished his dance , and had meekly and modestly returned thanks for the applause so generously bestowed upon his exertions , the master of ceremonies came forward with an important air , and conferred gravely with his sovereign . " Thou art right , worthy Robin , " answered that potentate , upon receiving this communication ; " truly the chariot of Phoebus is already wheeling from its zenith , and the day will yet prove too short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let the pyramid of tankards and trinkets be erected , that the rosy milk-maids , according to immemorial custom , may dance for their simple prizes about it . " Bootefish accordingly beckoned two or three of the revellers to his assistance , while the rest remained recumbent upon the grass , pledging each other in the fiery liquor , and laughing uproariously at the jibes of Cakebread , who , stimulated by the applause which he had received , and the copious draughts which he had imbibed , exerted his utmost powers worthily to discharge the high functions of court jester , which had been conferred upon him by his sovereign . Presently Bootefish and his assistants had erected upon the mount , about half way between the May-pole and Robin Hood 's arbor , a tall pyramid of tankards , pewter plates , and flagons , which were to be used at the ensuing banquet , and garnished it with ribbons , small looking-glasses , strings of gaudy beads , gaily-colored strips of cloth , and a profusion of such cheap and trifling finery , as was most pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revels that the pyramid was ready . " Be it it known to ye , my lieges , " said Morton , rising to address his subjects , that the milk-maid 's dance is one of the most ancient and time-honored customs of the May-day , and that no festivity in honor of our sovereign lady could be esteemed complete , where this most graceful and becoming ceremony was wanting . Rings , chains , gooches , ribbons , and such simple bravery , are the appropriate rewards for the gentle contenders . It were a burning shame , if this custom , thus honored throughout the Christian land of our birth , should be omitted in this our first festivity in this benighted wilderness . The dance of the rosy milk-maids , pleasing and pretty as it is , can in no wise be dispensed with . Rosy milk-maids , come forth ! " At this concluding exclamation of Morton , his faithful master of the ceremonies gravely led forth a band of savage maidens , who had easily been prevailed upon , by promises of liberal reward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuously displayed upon the pyramid , to agree to take share in the pageant . The rosy milk-maids , accordingly , as the Lord of Merry-mount facetiously designated these dusky daughters of the forest , came forward , hand in hand . Though differing widely from the buxom lasses of England , their prototypes upon this occasion , yet there was something far from disagreeable in these lithe and graceful creatures , with their bright , savage eyes , supple limbs , and elastic movements . They joined hand in hand , and executed gracefully one of their own wild dances , ever and anon , accompanying their airy bounds with sudden , shrill , but not unmusical snatches of rude vocal music . Their countrymen , mingled with their paler-faced confederates , looked on with dignified composure , occasionally applauding their vigorous whirls with a deep grunt of approval . When the dance was finished , they stood stock-still , and received at the hands of the master of ceremonies , the prizes which were suspended from the pyramid , with a composure and dignity which might have befitted princesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exultation of manner , but they quietly adorned their swarthy , but exquisitely moulded persons , with the various petty decorations which they received , and then gracefully and silently withdrew towards the principal group of revellers . The company were now refreshed with a slight repast of dried venison and bear 's meat , of which they partook as they reclined together upon the grass , and when the meal was concluded the sports were resumed . There were now many games of skill and strength exhibited . A mark was set up at the extremity of the mound and the savages and Christians contested with each other with the bow and arrow , in which , as was observed with considerable satisfaction by the sovereign , the palm of superiority was by no means always to be awarded to the Indians , but was fully as often due to his more immediate subjects , who manfully contended for victory with their swarthy allies . The savage was foiled at his own weapons . Perhaps it was the fire-water which dimmed his eye and rendered his nerves unsteady , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . Games of wrestling , Indian hug and trip and twitch succeeded , in which the savages , with their slippery skins , almost naked persons , and pliable limbs , were almost constantly victorious . Then there were merry bouts with the quarter staff , in which the hardy Saxon regained his lost supremacy , while many a broken head and bloody coxcomb dealt liberally among the heathen champions , attested the prowess of the English at their own national game . Late and long were the games protracted , and long and loud continued the uproar and the merriment . The sun was now fast approaching the horizon , and the hardy frames both of pagan and Christian would have been well nigh exhausted , but for the liberal circulation of the butler 's flagon , which still flew gaily around , wherever a feeling of lassitude seemed creeping over the revellers . As the subtle influence mounted to their brains , again their spirits kindled , again their frames became instinct with renovated vigor , as if the wand of an enchanter had been waved above their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been conducted with orderly precision , now succeeded a general pell-mell , in which all parties , old and young , male and female , Saxon and savage , mingled in desperate and bewildering confusion , hugging , tumbling , knocking , thumping , tripping , twitching , pulling , leaping , dancing , singing , whooping and hallooing , as if they had all gone mad . At last the Lord of Merry-Mount extended his hand to his savage queen , and led her forth with majestic grace towards the May-pole . Both , wearing their golden crowns upon their heads and decked in royal robes , now danced a slow and stately measure , and then , with agreeable condescension , joining hand in hand with the whole group of revellers , they commenced once more the merry Morrice dance , the sovereign accompanying his steps by singing in a clear , melodious voice the initiatory verses of the song to which he had alluded . The whole assembly pealed out the chorus , making a din loud enough as they did so , to shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concluded , the monarch and his queen slipped out from the throng , while the rest continued leaping and frisking about the May-pole , in a rapidly revolving circle , which increased every instant in its dizzy speed , till one after another , overpowered by his exertions , was sucked into the merry whirlpool and sank overcome upon the ground . The revellers , thus fairly danced off their legs , remained reposing upon the sward for a few minutes , till the master of ceremonies again sounded his trumpet , when all , suddenly inspired with renewed vigor , sprang to their feet again , and marshaled by the indefatigable Bootefish , formed again into solemn procession and marched down the mount towards the palace . See Note V. CHAPTER XV . MORE MYSTERY . The sun had sunk behind the forest-crowned hills . The golden and violet hues which fringed the robe of the departing day , were already mingling with the dusky purple of the twilight . The last lingering glow upon the summits of the pines had faded . The revellers had left the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone remained upon the hill , feeling a sensation of relief , that his ear was for the moment no longer vexed with the howlings , nor his eye offended by the grimaces of the crew who had been keeping their long holiday upon the now silent mount . " And did the gentle and sylvan sports of merry England , " said he , musingly to himself , " indeed resemble this grotesque buffoonery , I could even find it in my heart to sympathize with the Puritans ' hatred of all holidays and pastimes . Did the graceful and poetical festivities , by which the genial summer , in olden times and lands , was ushered to her throne , bear affinity to the frantic orgies which have this day been enacted , I could honor the stern enthusiasts , who would trample upon such mummeries . Methinks I feel my brow burning with confusion at having looked so long and so listlessly upon fantastic pranks , fouler even than the bacchanalian rites of ancient fable , and which might have shamed a crew of leaping satyrs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound of altercation in the valley below him . He turned his eyes in the direction whence the sounds proceeded , and saw several figures , evidently belonging to the company , who had recently entered the palace , and who seemed , so far as he could discern in the gathering twilight , to be collected in a group about a person wrapped in a mantle , who appeared desirous of disengaging himself from the rest . He descended noiselessly from the hill , and advanced unperceived towards the disputants . " Stole away , stole away , " cried a mocking voice , which Maudsley recognised as that of Cakebread ; " no , no , my pretty master , ' t is not for thee to treat with such disdain the hospitality of the puissant Lord of Merry-Mount . I tell thee I am sent to bid thee return to the banquet . I am ordered to conduct thee thither , by our sovereign potentate himself . " " And tell thy sovereign potentate , " said a voice , in whose irritated , but musical tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insult which I will not brook . I am master of my own movements , and look ye , I purpose to go forth from Merry-Mount upon the instant . So commend me to your sovereign , as you style him , and tell him as much in answer to his message . " But I tell thee , Master Malapert , " answered Cakebread , who still acted as spokesman of the detaining party , " that I have special orders from the sovereign to bring thee back , and at once . So obey the monarch 's behest , and that cheerfully and instantaneously , or else I shall arrest thee by virtue of this rod of office , " and thus saying , the jester shook his bauble till the bells rang again in the face of him who seemed thus determined to withdraw . " And I tell thee , Master Mountebank , that I give thee special orders to leave me , and that instantaneously , " answered the stranger , in a still more angry tone ; " go back to thy master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insolent buffoon to bear his messages . " " And how if the buffoon , " answered the other in the same mocking tones , " decline to profane the ear of majesty with insults , such as his mind is unlikely to digest ? " " Then keep them for thyself , " was the reply ; " I trow thy mind can digest them as easily as thy back can brook the lash . " The jester , somewhat stung by this allusion , was about making a still more irritating reply , when the long and ungainly figure of Rednape thrust itself between the disputants . " Truly , " said he , " I am inclined to look at the face of this high flying youngster , which he has kept covered all day so daintily . Who knows , Master Cakebread , but this be some villainous spy , sent among us by the saints . Come , come , my young master , off with your hood and mantle , honesty should never be ashamed to show its face in any company . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cloak more closely about his features , and Maudsley , who had now cautiously advanced still nearer , saw that he was one of those , who , masked and disguised as palmers , had been present during the day 's festivities , but who , as he had accidentally remarked , had kept as far as possible aloof from the crowd of revellers . Rednape , somewhat puzzled by the determined resistance of the youth , stood for a moment awkward and irresolute , and apparently unwilling to proceed to extremities , when Cakebread , who seemed to have reasons of his own for detaining the departing guest , whispered something in his comrade 's ear . " Sayest thou so ? sayest thou so ? " said the ungainly vagabond , apparently astonished at the information which he had received , " then , mayhap , it were safer not to meddle with him , for if ever man had the devil for his most particular and confidential  --  . " " Nonsense , man , I tell thee it will be worth a handful of golden angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I shall even take the liberty myself to unmask this pretty gentleman . " And thus saying , Cakebread , relying upon the support of his confederate , Rednape , ventured to pluck the slight and seemingly friendless stranger by the cloak . " I bid thee once more come along with me into the presence , " he cried , " and that , too , wearing thine own natural features . What , man , the masking and mumming be all over , and  --  . " The stripling , enraged at this assault upon his person , started suddenly back from the jester 's clutches , and throwing back the short mantle from his right shoulder , suddenly brandished a dagger in his assailant 's face . " Now , by heaven , my patience is exhausted indeed , " he cried in a voice of passion ; " lay your ruffianly fingers upon me again ,  --  interpose yourself an instant longer to my departure , and I will stab you to the heart . " The cowardly Cakebread , appalled at this intrepid demeanor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rednape , crying out as he did so , " To him , Humphrey , to him ! Down with the murderous , blood-thirsty ruffian , down with the sanguinary spy , down with the disguised assassin , down with him , Humphrey . " Thus appealed to by his confederate , and obeying the brutal instincts of his nature , Rednape plucked his sword from its sheath , and rushed desperately upon the stranger , who , at the moment when he saw himself temporarily disengaged from his first tormentor , had suddenly attempted to save himself from the unequal contest by flight . The two other vagabonds , however , who had , apparently from curiosity , followed Cakebread and his companion from the palace , now interposed themselves to his retreat , and the unfortunate but courageous youth was obliged to turn and defend himself against his enemy . Ill enough it doubtless would have fared with the victim of this cowardly attack , whose slight and tender frame was but poorly fitted to an encounter with the big and bony miscreant who now attacked him , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprung with a bound a towards the ferocious Rednape . " Stop , thou cowardly thief , " cried he indignantly ; " unhand that slender boy , and face a man , if thou hast courage enow for aught but robbing hen-roosts . Turn here , or by heaven , I will clip thy other ear for thee upon the spot , and cheat the pillory of its due . " Rednape , thus purposely taunted by Maudsley , who wished to divert his rage from the stranger to himself , turned suddenly from the pursuit of the weaker enemy , and rushed ferociously at his new assailant . Maudsley received his onset with composure , parried successfully a desperate blow aimed at his head , and dealt him in return a crushing stroke with his sword which nearly severed the ruffian 's right arm from his shoulder , and sent him bleeding and howling back to his companions . Cakebread and the two others , who had been but just enabled through the deepening twilight to witness the sudden arrival of this new protector of the stranger , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see no more of a controversy whose aspect was thus decidedly changed , but , without more ado , took to their heels , and ran with headlong haste to the palace , not even waiting to see whether their wounded confederate , who had sunk exhausted and groaning upon the field , were alive or dead . The field being thus cleared of the ruffians , the stranger , who had stood stock-still upon the arrival of Maudsley 's unexpected assistance until the issue of the contest , now advanced towards his deliverer . " We meet again , Harry Maudsley , " said he , with the silvery accents in which Maudsley instantly recognised the voice of his mysterious companion at Naumkeak . " We meet again , Harry Maudsley , and truly I may thank your most opportune assistance , that we do meet once more in this weary world . Truly I do thank you , and from my heart , for your bravery , although , alas , you would wonder that I should thank you for so worthless a boon as life , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed , indeed , " replied Maudsley , " that it was my enigmatical and most shadowy friend , whom I had the pleasure of assisting . You may spare your encomiums upon my bravery , for it needed none to whip away a pair of cowardly curs , like those who presumed to meddle with you . But what do you here amid this wild and worthless crew , and what means the cowardly attack which was even now made upon you ? " " Why I am here , " replied the other , " I could hardly myself explain , saving that I am but an instrument in the hands of others , or rather , perhaps , because I yield without hesitation to a destiny which hurries me hither and thither , like a withered leaf before the whirlwind . You would with difficulty understand my purposes , even if I should endeavor to explain them . As to the obstacles which yonder ruffians interposed to my departure , it is no mystery to me , although no doubt to you it is somewhat inexplicable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You still speak in parables , " answered Maudsley . " We meet , in gathering twilight , in lonely forests , drawn together by some irresistible influence , as if our fates were bound together by an invisible chain . And yet I have hardly gazed upon your face , except through dim shadows ; you appear to me , and you vanish , like some spiritual inhabitant haunting these solitudes . " " Distress yourself no longer , Master Maudsley , " interrupted his companion . " I am , I do assure you , no unearthly sprite , but healthy flesh and blood . I am now about to bid you farewell , with one word of consolation . I swear to you , then , that what you most dread shall never happen , that what you have almost ceased to hope , shall yet occur . Believe me or not , but when to-morrow 's sun shall first shine upon you , you shall acknowledge my power , for you shall already behold its influence . You shall feel still more sensibly that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , remembering the fidelity with which I have hitherto observed my promises , be the more disposed to trust me for the future . And now farewell , Harry Maudsley , and if you value the continuance of our friendship , follow me not . " The stranger extended both arms through the gathering gloom towards Maudsley , as if he would have embraced him . Maudsley advanced more closely , and it seemed as if his companion 's arms for an instant touched his neck . In another moment he had vanished into the depths of the forest . " ' T is strange , " muttered Maudsley , after his strange companion had left him . " So gentle and so frail a form , and yet so imperious an air , so bold a heart , so wayward a mood , so mystic a fancy . " He turned away , but suddenly as he advanced , his ear was struck by a deep groan , as of one in pain . " Hey-day , who speaks ? " cried Maudsley , suddenly startled from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened so short a time before . " By heavens , if that be really the voice of Humphrey Rednape , perhaps I may have some ocular proof that the whole scene hath not been a creation of my imagination . " Groping his way towards the spot whence the groans proceeded , he soon became aware of the presence of the unfortunate Rednape . Finding that his wound , although attended with a very profuse loss of blood , did not seem to be so dangerous as he had at first supposed , he left him lying upon the ground , while he coolly paused for a moment at the door of the palace upon his way to his own hut , and recommended the condition of the suffering ruffian to the particular regards of several of his fraternity . Rejecting very peremptorily all entreaties upon the part of the sovereign , to enter the palace and partake of the concluding festivities , and with eye , ear , and brain wearied with the fantastic scenes of which he had been all day long an unwilling witness , he sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling . Long and loud was the merriment within the palace . Fierce and furious was the revelry , whose discordant din vexed hour after hour the solemn ear of night . But we willingly drop the curtain over the concluding scenes of the Merry-Mount holiday . CHAPTER XVI . THE MINOTAUR . Upon the afternoon of a glowing and sultry day , the solitary of Shawmut was sauntering beneath the ample shade of the oaks and chestnuts which decorated his natural park . A few weeks had passed since the events recorded in the last chapter , and the fervid summer had already succeeded to the coy and reluctant spring . It was early June , but , as is not uncommon in a climate which loves the intense so much as ours , the heat was already that of mid-summer . The verdure of the forest as well as of the open glades was of that tender and peculiarly vivid green , which marks the summer 's infancy ; and the many flowering trees and shrubs which , for a few brief weeks , decorate themselves at this genial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stern wilderness scene where the exile dwelt to a gay and painted garden . The red rose and the wild eglantine festooned themselves about the sterile cliffs ; innumerable dogwood trees , scattered profusely through the woods , displayed their large , white , magnificent flowers ; the laurel upon the hill-sides blushed with its rose-colored chalices ; the dainty privet , which loves the abode of man , hung over the rude palisades and tortuous fences its clustering and snowy panicles ; the gaudy iris and the purple flower de luce made the fountain 's edge , the brook-side , and the damp meadows gay ; while from the stern and hideous morass , which bounded one side of the park , was diffused the delicious odor of the azalea , that obscure and hidden shrub which makes an atmosphere of fragrance about the foul and repulsive swamps where it abides , like a sweet and virtuous soul sanctifying , by its own perfume and beauty , the most squalid and cheerless haunts of humanity . The woods , the hills , the plains were vocal with the melody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer 's genial warmth . The swift and busy swallow darted to and fro about the roof of the cottage ; the clear , cheerful note of the quail , calling and responding to his mate , sounded incessantly from the edge of the wood ; the plaintive and monotonous melody of the thrush resounded throughout the innermost depths of the forest ; while in the open glades , swinging and balancing himself upon the most slender twigs , the merry bobolink executed in masterly style his brilliant bravuras , and impromptu variations . The golden summer day had been spent by the gentle exile in protracted wanderings through the forests which girded his lonely home . As the sun was sinking behind the hills , he emerged from the shadow of the trees where he had so long been lingering , and , staff in hand , began to ascend the crag which rose immediately above his dwelling . When he had reached the summit , he seated himself upon his favorite spot , and looked out upon the summer sunset . The day had been one of fierce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds had rolled up , pile upon pile , before the gentle breath of the south-west wind , and now , broken into wild and fantastic masses , and colored by the departing sun-shine with purple , gold , emerald , violet , and every other radiant hue , they stretched in a flood of glory along the western horizon , now building themselves up like the walls and battlements of towered and aerial cities , now changing to a shadowy but innumerable army , crowding cohort after cohort , with glittering spear and shield and crimson banner , around the descending chariot of the god of day . Quivering gently above the sunset 's glow , just where the clear blue of the upper sky was mingling with the emerald green nearer the horizon , appeared the young moon 's silver bow . Far along the northern edge of the horizon played the lambent summer 's lightning , incessant , gentle , innocent as an infant 's smile . Throughout the massive foliage of the scattered trees , which reared themselves along the precipitous sides of the hill , sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentle influences of the scene , and refreshed by the grateful breeze , the solitary sat gazing long and musingly upon the wilderness scene , which had already grown dear to his heart . The purple hues of evening were already settling upon the landscape , when the hermit heard a footstep ascending the narrow pathway , and looking downwards , he saw presently the tall form of Sir Christopher Gardiner advancing towards him . He felt a slight sensation of impatience at this interruption to his solitude . The knight and himself were connected by a slight and single thread . Blaxton claimed to hold the peninsula of Shawmut by eminent domain , acknowledging for himself , as he said , no suzerain but the Lord of Hosts . He had , however , so far recognised the rights of Sir Ferdinando Gorges in Massachusetts as to allow his own name to be inserted in John Oldham 's lease from the Gorges family , as one who would induct the lessee into the property on the opposite promontory . He troubled himself , however , but little with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness . " Good even , most contemplative hermit of the desert . " said the knight , as he reached the summit , " truly the path to this eyrie of yours is something of the steepest . You should have the wings as well as the gentleness of the dove , to inhabit this mountain top . " " Good even to you , Sir Knight , " answered Blaxton , " I am , as you say , but as a partridge hunted in the mountains , but I care not . I have escaped the snare of the spoiler , and I love to ascend to these contemplative heights , and look down upon the world below me . " " Aye , Master Hermit ; but methinks thou shouldst have the wings of eagles , as I but now remarked . My frame is somewhat of the hardiest , and my lungs of the soundest , but truly this precipice is something of  --  " " I carry the patriarch 's ladder with me always , " interrupted Blaxton , " and climb from earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient piece of furniture , " answered the knight , humoring the humorist , " and one that would be invaluable in more professions than one . By St. John , half a dozen such scaling ladders in a siege , would make short work of the strongest citadel built by mortal hands . I find you as discursive and contemplative as ever . I guessed , when I tracked you to this aerial summit , that I should find you still farther removed in spirit from the dull earth which we have the misfortune to inhabit . Know you , perchance , to pass to other and more trivial matters , that the saints of Plymouth are mightily enraged at the mad pranks lately enacted in the bay by my merry gossip , Thomas Morton , and that there be serious intentions of forthwith ejecting him from his present abode by force of arms ? " " Truly , " answered the solitary , whose hermit life had so much increased his natural absence of mind that he rarely heard more of any companion 's observations than sufficed to direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any means bringing him into perfect communication with the other 's mind . " Truly I have but little sympathy with your saints , whether of New Plymouth or of other regions . It seemeth strange to me that a brotherhood of martyrs , who have fled to the wilderness for conscience sake , should so clumsily have left their consciences behind them , that the apostles of liberty in things spiritual , should have been so careful to bring with them from the land of slavery , the old bolts and shackles which have so long been festering upon their own limbs . A martyr it seemeth is but a bigot after all , and our fugitive martyrs have been somewhat too careful to bring a brand from the funeral pyres of their murdered brethren at home , to light new faggots for their own victims in this barren wilderness . If poor humanity be so helpless and crippled , what matter whether it hobble to heaven on crutches supplied to its infirmity by an anointed prelate or a self-elected saint ? Is it not strange , Sir Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have possessed wit enough to solve the mighty riddle of their age ? Verily , it seemeth to me , that this eternal warfare of religion , which hath so long brooded with its gloomy wings over the whole of Christendom , that this fierce and oppressive sphinx , which hath so long appalled the souls of men with its fearful presence , doth but propound a riddle , by whose solution it would be annihilated . " " And have you discovered , " replied the knight , " in the course of your lonely contemplation , the mystery of the sphinx ? " " I have read the riddle , " answered the solitary , " and the answer is Toleration . This mighty reformation , of which we hear so much in many lands , and which hath hitherto proved in England but a mockery , is naught , so long as one fetter remains upon liberty of conscience . What matter that the scarlet mantle of Babylon should be rent into tatters to show the corruption which those gorgeous robes conceal ? What matter that priests should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long as still some other fantastic delusion is to succeed , so long as the whole contest is but a petty struggle between rival impostors ? ' T is by pondering on matters such as these , that I have a little estranged myself from my kind , perhaps , for I feel something within my bosom which rebels at tyranny in whatever form it may disguise itself . I have built my solitary name=f285-217Page image - Page 200. altar here upon this fair mountain-top , where I can commune , eye to eye , with the Creator of the universe . Truly he reveals himself to me , not through the awful thunderings amid which he appeared to the fierce prophet upon Sinai 's mount , but rather seemeth he to speak to my heart with the gentle whispering of a loving father . Sometimes it seemeth to me here , in this fresh and unpolluted solitude , as if the vanished days of the old and sinless world , when the Lord walked in the garden with the patriarchs , might be renewed , and that his loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the solitary paused , Sir Christopher , who , as may easily be imagined , had taken but small interest in the discursive and moralizing soliloquy of the hermit , but who knew by experience of how little advantage it was to attempt to arrest the course of his vagaries , replied :  --  " Most virtuous hermit , your words are indeed the words of wisdom , and I have a profound satisfaction in finding how much we sympathize in our views of human nature . But unhappily , O most contemplative of mortals , I have not been endowed with that generalizing and philosophical spirit , which enables you to draw such sublime results from your meditations . This poor machine of mine , look you , hath been constructed for action , and I feel it already corroding in its present quiet . Furthermore , if , as you say , the human race be so fond of persecution and tyranny , why what proves it more than that they were born to be persecuted and tyrannized , and that the only method to save them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ceremonies , pageants , and formulas so dearly , what proves it after all , but that man is not a metaphysical abstraction , but an unlucky biped , who reasons only through his senses , and who must be governed through his senses . And now , taking leave of metaphysics , I would either bid you farewell upon your mountain-top , or accompany your footsteps to the vale beneath . " Blaxton , as may be supposed , had hardly profited much by the disquisition which the knight had given him in exchange for his own , but , observing by his guest 's motions , that he was about descending the hill , he mechanically arose from his seat , and accompanied him along the south-western declivity , towards the western cove . " The door of my poor hermitage is ever open , " said the solitary , as they reached the vicinity of his abode , " and I could be well pleased , Sir Knight , to offer you its poor hospitality . " " I am bounden to you , Master Hermit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the most of the gentle breeze which I see yonder is just curling the surface of the water . I have a considerable voyage before me to night , and I sought you upon my way , trusting to communicate to you one or two important matters . I pray you to honor me with your attention a few brief moments . " " Willingly , willingly , " answered the hermit , who had not heard a word of his companion 's remarks , " and I am truly pleased to find you as prone as myself to philosophical speculation . A petty world , Sir Christopher , a petty world and a petty people . A stale cheese at best , be its maggots ever so busy . The night is like enchantment , the wilderness under this young summer moon shines like a silver garden . I must saddle the archbishop , by your leave , and even take a canter . " With this the whimsical hermit very gravely walked off towards his homestead , leaving the knight standing near the beach , quite alone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moping , moon-struck owl ! " said Gardiner to himself . " The creature has even flown away from me , after all , in the very breath with which he assured me of his undivided attention . However , the evening is yet young , I will at least await for a little while his re-appearance . " So saying , Sir Christopher threw himself upon the turf under a spreading tree , and solaced himself for a few moments by contemplating with extreme attention the play of the gentle moonlight upon the waters . As the knight , however , was not blessed with the habit of imperturbable and reposing rumination which marked the character of his late companion , and as he had not sought the promontory of Shawmut that night to gaze at the moon , he naturally , after a little time , became very impatient again . Just , however , as he was upon the point of taking his departure , he heard a hurried trampling upon the north-western extremity of the beach . He turned and saw the hermit , mounted upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him from England , and tamed for his own riding , careering in a rapid gallop , along the sandy margin of the cove . His loose robes and long grey hair were streaming wildly in the summer wind , and as he flitted through the moonlit scene , he looked more like a fantastic creature of the imagination than an actual inhabitant of earth . Gardiner had seen many things and many people in his day . He had , moreover , become very familiar with the eccentric and flightly character of the recluse ; but he fairly rubbed his eyes , as this wild creature flitted rapidly to and fro upon the yellow sands , passing and repassing before his eyes with extraordinary velocity , the bull lashing his sides with his tail , and evidently enjoying the sport as much as his master , to whose every impulse he seemed astonishingly obedient . It really seemed to the knight that he must either be the victim of some optical delusion , or that the singular metamorphosis of the gentle , dreaming hermit , into this mad Minotaur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , argued the possession of some preternatural power on the part of his companion . He looked calmly on , however , and awaited with patience the termination of the hermit 's gallop , as he had one or two matters which he wished to confide to him , before he took his departure . After rider and animal seemed temporarily exhausted by their race , they suddenly halted , close to the knight , who still lay stretched beneath a tree which grew very near the beach . " We were talking of the Reformation , " said the recluse , speaking in the same calm and gentle voice which was habitual with him ; " but I need not remind you that we have ever been in England even far behind the Continent of Europe . The Reformation , the world over , has been unsuccessful , because , when men are once up to the knees in blood , their virtue is apt to be soaked out of them ; but after all , something was accomplished  --  something more was attempted . Indeed , Luther and Calvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's end ,  --  two rams ' - horns , whose spirit-stirring blasts were potent enow to batter down the outworks of the popish Jericho ; but they are cracked and broken now , and fit only for children 's playthings . I tell you it now needs an archangel 's trump not to awaken men from their lethargy , for they are awake , but to startle them from their wilful and hopeless madness . " For my own part , " said Gardiner in reply , without manifesting any astonishment at the hermit 's proceedings , " I care not whether the pontifex maximus be Pope Harry , who burns a schoolmaster for beating him in an argument about transubstantiation , and gives a convent 's revenue to a woman who makes a pudding to please him  --  Pope Elizabeth , the holy virgin , who , unlike her father , does not marry , and therefore rarely murders her paramours  --  Pope Jamie , who finds it so much pleasanter to be pope than ruling presbyter , or Pope Charlie , who will not be comfortable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the foot of his real and Roman holiness . I care not one jot indeed , whether I have Harry or Charlie , Julius or Gregory , Tudors , Stewarts , or Borgias , to direct my worship , and to smooth my path to heaven . I have other  --  " " Excuse me , Sir Knight , " interrupted the hermit , " but I even paused to give a little breathing time to Bishop Laud , here , " continued he , patting the neck of the animal which he bestrode , and to whom he had given the name of the arch-enemy of the Puritans . " Poor fellow , he puffs enow to shame his godfather . There is a prelate , Sir Christopher , will mount the devil 's back and ride him off his legs . Satan himself will be spavined before his career is over . Then go thy ways , bishop , " he concluded , suddenly dismounting , and suffering the animal to wander and graze at will through the park ; " I will have more mercy upon thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil himself . And now , Sir Knight , I think you had somewhat to impart to me . " " Simply this , " said Gardiner , whose accurate perception always informed him exactly when a word or two would reach his companion 's mind , and who never showed , by his manner , that he found any deviation from the strictest common-place in the hermit 's erratic demeanor  --  " simply this , and I crave your pardon for not having communicated the matter before . Thomas Morton hath incurred the enmity of the Plymouth brethren by many mad pranks by him committed , more especially by an uproarious frolic for eight and forty hours ' long at May-tide . Thomas Morton will be attacked by an army of saints . He will be expelled from his residence , and sent prisoner to England . All this will happen within thirty days , and yet the reckless rioter will not believe it . These papers , however , which I have withdrawn from his keeping , I wish to intrust to your hands . " With this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the hands of the hermit , who was listening with attention . " Mixed with them are several important papers of my own , which I do not consider so safe in my own temporary domicile as they will be with you , the more so , as this untoward event which is so soon to take place , hath induced me to make some alteration in my plans , and will , perhaps , cause my absence from these places for a season . The papers relate , mostly , to the affairs of Sir Ferdinando . You will , however , perceive that the departure of Morton , which I foresee and have accordingly provided against , although he is resolute in his own disbelief thereof , may be yet turned to good . I do not regret the opportunity of being able to communicate through a trusty ambassador , with Sir Ferdinando , except of the necessary procrastination which it it causes . " " Sir Knight , " answered the hermit , " I take these papers , which you no doubt think of extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last year 's leaves . I shall keep them carefully , and in the same receptacle you wot of . I know nothing , or but little , of Sir Ferdinando , I know nothing of your purposes nor projects . I care as little for your schemes as for the schemes of the saints . I have consented , when almost the only dweller in the Massachusetts , to be appointed by the knight to put John Oldham into the possession of his lease ; but truly if he has no reliance on any stronger arm than mine , he is likely to remain out of possession for many a long year . Truly there is a certain hard-handed Indian fighter at the opposite promontory , who I think would be more serviceable to Master Oldham than myself . However , the knight is doubtless the best judge of his own matters , and therefore even let my name stand . Have you other commands for me ? " " Thanks , gentle Master Blaxton , " answered the knight , " but I have deposited my papers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my visit . I warn you , however , that you will probably ere long receive a summons to join in the pious crusade against the anti-Christ of Merry-Mount . You will be called to trail a pike in the holy warfare , or your purse will bleed for it . " With this the knight courteously bade the hermit farewell , and , stepping briskly towards the beach , was soon lost from view ; while Blaxton , hardly heeding his departure , remained , contemplatively gazing on the sylvan scene before him , now softly lighted by the young summer 's moon . It will be perceived how very little sympathy , either of opinion or character , existed between the knight and the hermit , and how slight and accidental was the band which united them . Blaxton 's mind was so honestly and unaffectedly removed above , or at least without , the ordinary sphere of human cares and wishes , and his character , like his life , had through long seclusion and a systematic indulgence of its eccentric humors , become so lonely , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected colonization of the New England wilderness . The high priest of nature , seated in simple but sublime loneliness by the side of his forest fountain , passing his gently monotonous days in exalted communion with his Creator , was likely to look forward rather with a sensation of impatience than of gratification , to the arrival of men who , however earnest and enthusiastic , belonged , as the reader may have already gathered from his conversation , to a sect with whom he felt little sympathy . He , however , felt that in the boundless wilderness there was room enough for nations , and he therefore could not conceive that a few scattered pioneers could in any way incommode each other . For himself , he did not dream that there was a possibility of his own solitude being disturbed , but believed that his rights of property in a wilderness spot which possessed no value but that which was derived from his hands , would undoubtedly be held sacred . As for Sir Christopher Gardiner , his position was growing intolerably irksome . After having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of the projects and counter-projects for colonizing New England , he had at length , as we have seen , obtained information from his coadjutors at home . The information had , however , proved in the highest degree unsatisfactory . The dilatoriness and lukewarmness of his friends was becoming intolerable . The fiery man of action saw himself condemned to another and a protracted season of languor and inactivity . Instead of his recruits in men , money and munitions , and an approval of his purpose to seize upon and occupy at once all the prominent posts in the country , he received counsels of caution , procrastination , dissimulation . He more than suspected that this growing timidity and hesitation at home was indicative of an inclination to abandon altogether an enterprise which perhaps was beginning to lose its charms . Still , however , with the tenacity of purpose which belonged to his constitution , he kept fast hold upon his own projects , determined not to abandon them so long as one powerful confederate remained to him , and as long as a solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that Sir Ferdinando 's project was for the present foiled , or at least postponed . He had received direct information that a company of Puritans had received a grant of land from the company in England , a part of it including a portion of the very territory once conveyed to the Gorges family , and that a body of emigrants , under highly respectable and influential leaders , were immediately to set sail for New England . He was , however , assured that the effort to obtain the grant of a charter from the crown to this company , without which the enterprise must necessarily fail , would be unsuccessful . The attention of government was directed to the seditious , democratic and dangerous character of the sect who were thus , as was insinuated , contemplating the establishment of an independent republic upon these distant territories ; and strong opposition was made , both directly and indirectly , by powerful persons , to prevent the accomplishment of their designs . Sir Christopher was particularly enjoined to observe accurately and unceasingly the conduct , conversation and character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England constantly and minutely informed as to all their proceedings , with a view to sustain the charges of their opponents , that the new settlers were not only schismatics but rebels , and that they were thoroughly and bitterly hostile , as well to the monarch 's authority in the nation , as to his supremacy in the church . Had there not been some peculiar and private objects to be attained in the wilderness , and had there not been at the moment some peculiarly cogent objections to his visiting England , it is highly probable that the knight would have abandoned the country upon the instant , with a view of expostulating emphatically and personally with his hesitating confederates , and of infusing something of his own vigor and audacity into their minds . As it was , he saw himself condemned to play the spy for a still longer period . Dissimulation and intrigue were not distasteful to him ; on the contrary , they formed the very sphere in which his peculiar genius most delighted to exercise itself ; but intrigue in the forests , dissimulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished a schemer . He had , however , under the circumstances , nothing for it but to bide his time , and though he chafed at the inactivity which was imposed upon him , he submitted for the present with as good a grace as could have been expected . The vagaries of Thomas Morton , morever , had given him a good deal of uneasiness . He had constantly warned him how inexpedient it was to excite the jealousy of the other religious settlers , already established in New England , and how necessary it was to the final success of their schemes that the character of himself and his associates should , for the present at least , appear to be discreet and orderly . But reasoning was apt to be thrown away upon the reckless potentate of Merry-Mount , and Gardiner already began to fear whether he was not likely to derive more injury than benefit from his alliance . Still as the good-humored roysterer possessed many qualities that were highly valuable to him , and as he had been privy , in a considerable measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to manage him and preserve his alliance . Unfortunately the late May-day festivities at Merry-Mount had excited the wrath and indignation of the Puritans of New Plymouth , among whom Gardiner had carefully established himself during the whole period of Morton 's riot . This he had done , both to enable the settlers to contrast the solemnity of his own character with the licentiousness of the master of misrule , and to enable him to observe at once the effects produced upon their minds by the whole proceedings . For a moment we return to the solitary of Shawmut . The day had been one of fierce and unclouded sunshine , the evening had been cool and serene , but the night which was now approaching seemed to be of another character . The moon had sunk in the west , overwhelmed at her departure by the hosts of dark and shadowy clouds , which seemed to have gathered from every quarter to hurl her from her throne . The north wind blew its trumpet-blast through the shivering woods . The scud flew thick and fast across the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , as if from a conflict of invisible and aerial hosts . Suddenly a flaming meteor , larger and more lustrous than a planet , shot completely across the sky , springing up from the north , culminating almost to the zenith , and disappearing in the sea with a crash like thunder . Then the thickly congregated mass of clouds suddenly rolled away , like a scroll that shrivels in the flame , and the hermit saw in the western sky , hanging just above the horizon , the gigantic image of a flaming sword . As he was gazing with a sensation of awe at this strange phenomenon , which displayed itself just after his eyes had been dazzled and his ears stunned by the sudden appearance and violent explosion of the meteor , it vanished , while a little above the quarter where it had disappeared he distinctly saw the images of four ships , slowly ploughing their way across the blue and unclouded expanse of ether , with snowy sail and flying pennon , each , after a few moments , successively disappearing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The solitary stood gazing at this strange succession of weird and unwonted appearances with a singular trouble in his mind . He stood watching long after the last aerial ship had sunk below the horizon , anxiously awaiting the appearance of some new and still more bewildering phenomenon . No farther sign appeared however . The clouds gathered again over the face of heaven , the night grew gloomy and starless , the wind , now veering towards the east and freshening to a gale , spread its wings , damp and heavy with ocean mist , across the murky landscape . The hermit , who felt chilled and depressed by the sudden atmospheric change , as well as perplexed by the wild and boding appearances which he had witnessed in the sky , looked fearfully around , lest perhaps the former preternatural but beautiful face , which had not long before appeared to him , might even now be gazing through the dense foliage of the oak tree near which he was standing . He almost dreaded , as he cast his glances slowly around him , to find those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning and prophetic expression which they lately wore . But the strange apparition did not return to him that night , although his imagination , strongly excited by the unusual phenomena of nature which had just displayed themselves to him , might easily , it would seem , have bodied forth , out of the melancholy and dreamy fancies which were thronging about his mind , some visible shape of mystery and terror , such as had once before perplexed and haunted him . With slow and thoughtful step he paced along the verge of the cove , and then entered his lowly cottage . Historical fact . CHAPTER XVII . THE CAPTURE . A few days after the revels of Merry-Mount had been concluded , the sovereign of that territory was left in almost solitary state in his palace . He had depatched the greater number of his retainers to the inland portion of the country , this being the season when it was usual with them to meet the Indians , make their purchases of beaver , and arrange their future contracts ; and there were none left within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Canary Bird . Leaving those two worthies in charge of the palace , Master Morton , one fine summer 's morning , passed over the river and took his way towards the plantation of Wessaguscus , or rather to what remained of that unsuccessful establishment at that place . A few straggling settlers still lingered in the vicinity , living , however , in the most miserable condition , some of them being actually servants to the Indians , and performing menial offices for a livelihood , although by far the greater portion had made their escape from the unpromising colony ; some to Plymouth , some to Merry-Mount , and some , who could command sufficient means , to England . The fate of the plantation at Wessaguscus , ( the earliest settlement in Massachusetts Bay , ) was a striking counterpart to that of New Plymouth , and in fact the history of every settlement that was made in the territory of the Massachusetts , by any class of adventurers , except those with whom religion was the ruling motive , shows that some higher and stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to maintain a colony in so wild and dreary a solitude . The vernal period of Massachusetts history bears some resemblance to the spring-time of her climate . If we regard the successive efflorescence of civilization along the edge of the bay , the pale and feeble buds reluctantly expanding their petals one by one , amid a stormy and cheerless atmosphere , many of them frozen and destroyed before unfolding , and the healthiest but faintly quivering upon the black and leafless bough , we shall find that there seems but one single source of vitality , capable of protecting and supporting their faint and slow development . In warmer climes , under more genial influences , and inspired by golden dreams of terrestrial wealth and glory , there have been colonies whose beginnings were more brilliant , picturesque , and captivating to the imagination , but they have not unfolded to empires . The broad-leaved tree of the tropics derives its rank luxuriance as much from the stimulating and poisonous influence which it imbibes from the atmosphere , as from the fertility of the soil in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its towering shaft , its umbrageous top , but a blast of the hurricane lays it low . The stalwart oak , whose roots descend through beds of sterile gravel and through-clefts of frost-riven granite , derives its nourishment from the pure and unsunned veins of living water , and from a thousand subtle and invisible treasures of nature 's inmost bosom . The tempests of a thousand years sweep over it in vain . Morton had passed a portion of the summer 's day loitering about the neighborhood , hoping to fall in with certain petty chieftains , of the neighboring tribes , with whom he was in constant habits of intercourse , and with whom he had some particular arrangements to conclude . He had been disappointed , however , and was upon the point of returning to his own domains , as it was already late in the afternoon , when he suddenly heard himself called by name . Turning in some surprise at the sound , he saw emerging from a kind of cavern , partly natural and partly artificial , which opened upon the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The creature seemed covered with hair from head to foot , but how much of his hirsute covering was the natural growth of his own hide , and how much had been borrowed from other animals , could not , in the general squalor and filth which covered the whole , be accurately discovered . His head was covered with matted iron-grey elf locks , which circled and twisted in every direction , like a nest of rattlesnakes ; the nails of his hands and feet were long and crooked , like vulture 's talons ; he had a basket on his arm , and held a long pole in his right hand . The expression of his features , as far as could be discerned through the mass of hair and filth with which they were obscured , was something less human than that of an intelligent ourang-outang . " Master Morton , Master Morton , " screeched this creature , suddenly darting out of its cave , and leaping towards the Lord of Merry-Mount . " How now , thou filthy Caliban  --  art thou not starved nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen the creature before  --  " What wouldst thou with me , most venerable carrion ? Propound , explain , but prithee stand upon the other side of me , for the wind , look ye , sits upon this quarter , and there be certain damp and earthy exhalations , contracted doubtless by thy subterranean mode of life  --  pauca verba , pauca verba ,  --  thou understandest me , I perceive . " " Master Morton , Master Morton , thou diddest me a kindness once , " said this human woodchuck . " Did I so , indeed ? " answered the other ; " then prithee , do me another in return . " " Truly I will , your worship . What shall I do to serve you ? Shall I dig you a basket of clams ? Stay but here , your worship , and I will be back before you can whistle for me . " And with this the creature planted his pole in the earth and began leaping down the side of the hill . " Stop , stop , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this present juncture , and truly the favor I meant to ask of you , was simply that thou shouldst frothwith return again into the womb of thy mother earth . Burrow back again , thou most venerable mole , for truly thou makest the daylight hideous . Come back with the owls and the bats , and the toads , and the other noisome things which love the twilight  --  but the sunlight , believe me , was never made for thee . But stay , I did but jest , " added Morton , as the creature , hanging its head and weeping bitterly , began slowly to retreat towards his cave  --  " stay here , then , and air the inmost chambers of thy mind , by opening them to the breeze and sunlight of improving society . After all , ' t is not good to be so solitary . Take thy clam basket and follow me . Thou shalt go with me to Merry-Mount , and shalt dwell in my tent , poor miserable devil that thou art . Come along , I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diddest me a kindness once , " said the Caliban , turning again towards his companion , and squatting down at the door of his cave . " So thou diddest me the honor to observe before , " answered Morton , " and truly I do even propose to do thee another . I tell thee to follow me to my palace , and forsake thy heathenish haunt and grovelling habits . Come live with me , and be my love , ' as the worthy Kit Marlowe expresses himself to a more fascinating object , let me hope than thou art  --  " " I can not away to Merry-Mount , " answered the other . " I would go willingly , but I can not away . " " And why can you not , most hirsute of human creatures ? " answered Morton . " Come with me , I say , and that at once , for by the Lord it is growing dark and mirky , and the air looks full of smothered thunder . " " Yes , yes , Master Morton , thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have not lived under ground so long for nothing . I can smell the brimstone when it is boiling . There is thunder brewing up yonder , and plenty of it , and the wind will blow a little perhaps to-night ; any body knows that . " " By Jupiter , " said Morton , " here is a subterranean philosopher ! But what hath all this to do with my invitation to thee . I did bid thee to our palace at Merry-Mount , thunder or no thunder . " " I told thee I could not away , " answered the other . " And why not , pretty one , " replied Morton . " Truly , because I have sold myself to the great god Abamoko , and he hath ordered me to stay here to serve his red children . If I should go away from my cave , who would find ground-nuts for the sachems , who would dig clams for them , who find quails ' eggs for the squaws ? Sometimes I feel as if I should like to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the snow hides the ground-nuts . But the red creatures are very kind . They give me my cap full of parched corn every week when I work for them . I thank thee kindly , Master Morton , but I can not away to Merry-Mount . I have sold myself to the great god Abamoko . " " Now here is an ingenious fellow , " said Morton to himself , who found that the poor crack-brained man of the woods was out of the reach of his arguments . " Now here is a profound philosopher , who has gone farther than ever Christian went before , for he has even turned his back upon our old and respectable Sathanas , and sold himself , soul and body , to an Indian 's devil  --  and a devilish hard bargain he has made of it too . A cap full of parched corn hebdomadally !  --  proh pudor ! is that the rate paid for humanity by this pitiful devil ? Commend me to honest Mephistopheles after all , and the devil take such sneaking skin-flints as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what favor did I ever do thee , for which thou expressest so much gratitude , albeit somewhat uncouthly ? " " Thou didst once rescue me , " answered the Caliban , " when three red-skins would have destroyed and scalped me . I had pilfered but I was starving . Thou didst save my life , and moreover thou didst give me , besides , a horn of rosa solis . " " I do remember me , " exclaimed Morton , " and by Jupiter Diespiter , here is gratitude enow to redeem a city . Here is a poor outcast , burrowing in the ground and feeding on pignuts , who remembereth with gratitude one single horn of liquor , for as to the preservation of thy life , seeing what use thou makest thereof , that can hardly be reckoned a kindness . By heavens , such virtue shall be rewarded . Look upon this , sylvan monster ! " And with this Morton held up a hunting flask , of ample dimension , which he carried suspended at his side . An unearthly grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods , as he leaped nimbly forward , and eagerly clutched the treasure which was offered to him . " Aha ! " said he , as he greedily applied it to his lips , " aha ? this is a greater spirit than Abamoko . I wish I served your spirit , Master Morton , but Abamoko is powerful , and his red children are very kind . Alas , I can not go with thee to Merry-Mount ! " " Stay where thou art then , in God 's name , " replied the other , " since thy thraldom is so irresistible ; and now farewell , for truly I like not over-well the threatening aspect of yonder clouds , and I have a trifling march before me . " " Alas , alas , thou art going indeed , " said the wild man , " and truly I fear much lest mischance should befall thee . I have smelt the thunder all day long as I lay in my cave , and I saw fearful sights in the air last night . But ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst ! There is a more fearful mischance threatening thee , Master Morton , alas , alas ! to thee who have been so good to me . " And here the creature began to weep bitterly . " Why , thinkest thou I am afraid of the thunder and rain , most delicate of wood spirits ? " said Morton , laughing . " Alas , alas ! " blubbered the other , " ' t is not the rain , nor the wind , nor the thunder , though they will all be fearful . ' T is the dreadful Captain Standish , the mighty man of Plymouth , that I  --  " " Captain Standish ! " exclaimed Morton , " what of the heroic shrimp , what of the most puissant pigmy ? speak . " " Alas , alas , " replied the other , " I pray thee jest not at that mighty man of wrath . " " Diddest thou never hear , " continued he , in a low and mysterious tone , " diddest thou never hear of the fearful plague which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know not how many , neither was I here then . Alas , alas ! I was then in my own happy home , and had not sold myself to the terrible Abamoko , " continued the creature , with the tears running afresh along his grimy cheeks . " Did I never hear of it , " cried Morton , " why thou most uninstructed pagan , did I not see it ? Was not I , Thomas Morton , Prince of Passanogessit , travelling through these rugged wildernesses at the very time when that same distemper ceased ? Did I not , who knew that the Indians were ceremonious and careful in the offering of burial rites to their dead , did not I , when wandering through the places where they had dwelt , and whence they had all vanished , see them all lying in heaps like autumn leaves , old and young , sachems , warriors , squaws , and papooses , all rotting together unburied in the wilderness , with the wolves , and the kites , and the carrion crows feasting upon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Golgotha instead of to the Massachusetts , and what then wilt thou tell me of this plague , and what the plague hath this plague to do with Captain Shrimp ? " " Knowest thou not then , Master , that the plague still exists ? " continued the other in the same hoarse and boding tone . " Quite the contrary , my rustic friend , " answered Morton , " I know that it hath surceased well nigh these ten years . " " The plague exists , Master , " said the other , still in the same hoarse and earnest accents . " It hath gone to sleep , but it exists still , it hath foded its wings , but it is alive , and it will soon fly over the land again ; so beware of the mighty man of Plymouth , Master ! " " It hath gone to sleep , hath it ? " answered Morton . " Aye , truly , Master , the great God Abamoko himself hath told me so , often and often , as he visited me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God Abamoko visits thee nocturnally , " answered Morton . " Excuse me , but his highness seemeth somewhat addicted to low company . " " Alas , alas ! " answered the monster , " he comes by night , and fastens the fetters upon my legs ; they are red-hot iron , and they burn me to the bone ; he screws them tight , and my flesh smokes , and my blood boils , and my brains fry . " " What detestable and unfeeling cookery , " answered Morton ; " now may Satan himself consume such a boiling , frying , scorching devil as Abamoko . Why in the name of Beelzebub do n't you fly away in the day-time ? " " Because he makes me swear every night to serve him and his red children faithfully . Because he hath burned and branded me for his own ; because the fetters are always there in the day-time , although invisible and looser than in the darkness . " " And where in the foul fiend 's name broodeth this plague that terrifies you thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Mayhap it were as well to find its nest at once , and crack all its eggs before it hath time to hatch them . " " Ah , " continued the outcast , in the same solemn tone , " jest not , I pray thee , with such fearful matters . Knowest thou not then in very truth , that the hero of Plymouth keepeth the plague in a barrel , safely stowed in the cellarage of his own house , and that if he list , he can let it loose to fly over the whole country ? " " Whew ! " exclaimed Morton , " so the murder is out . So Captain Shrimp is the devil 's head butler , is he , and hath the care of his choicest casks ? And how , I pray thee , hast thou made this notable discovery of the treasures of the Plymouth cellar ? " " I tell thee , Master , " continued the other , " that the red children of Abamoko all know whence came the fearful pestilence many years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the scourge of red men . Abamoko himself hath told them where it is confined , and who keepeth the keys of its prison . This is why they all fear the Englishmen so much , and the hero of Plymouth most of all . " " Truly a most admirable device , " answered Morton . " Ah , valiant Miles , ah , truculent Shrimp , thou hast , indeed , a trick or two worth knowing . Bless thy witty brains , I could almost worship thee . And thou wert in London but lately , and in the very midst of the plague , too , and escapedst unharmed . ' T was the very vintage season for thee , no doubt , and there didst thou fill thy hogshead for wilderness consumption . The pestilence in a puncheon , forsooth ! No wonder these deluded savages fear thee as the roaring lion ! " " Hush , hush , " exclaimed his companion , who seemed quite shocked at the irreverent manner in which his astounding piece of intelligence was received ; " hush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell thee it is ill jesting upon these awful matters . Ah !  --  what a peal was that ! Abamoko is full of wrath ; " and with these words the lunatic coiled himself into a heap upon the ground , moaning dismally , while his teeth chattered with fear . In effect , the weather had began to assume a somewhat threatening aspect . The day , which had been one of intense heat , was already drawing to its close , but there was no freshness , no evening coolness in the atmosphere . The sun had sunk beneath a long , dense mass of leaden clouds which lay motionless along the horizon , but the whole upper surface of the heavens still glowed like burnished brass . Not the faintest breath of wind was perceptible , and the gigantic oaks and chestnuts , which grew around the spot , stood with their massive foliage darkly painted upon the brazen sky , the outline of almost every leaf so sharply defined , and every branch so fixed and motionless , that the very forest seemed enchanted . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird sent forth a solitary note , not an insect murmured . Nature seemed so spell-bound and breathless , that it was a relief to Morton 's ear , when the distant and muttered thunder , which was hardly audible , and which , however , seemed so sensibly to affect his companion , at last interrupted the boding silence . There were certainly some symptoms of an approaching storm , although it seemed probable that it would be long before it broke forth . Although it was past sunset , and although the western edge of the horizon was dark and gloomy , yet there seemed a singular and inexplicable radiance in the sky . Long bars of brilliant light seemed to be projected upwards from some source far away from the quarter where the sun had sunk ; and as evening advanced , instead of the shadowy and refreshing twilight , the brightness of the sky seemed with every instant to increase . While the portion of the west , which would naturally have been tinged with the last glowing colors of the departed day , retained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the sky a thin rack of flame-colored vapor , which seemed to radiate an intense degree of heat and light . Wild and ragged clouds of a dull green hue , were driving with fearful velocity across this blazing surface , indicating that while the deceitful and brooding calm still lingered below , there was already a fierce commotion in the upper atmosphere . Morton stood looking at these various and portentous appearances , with the eye of a man whom long experience in the wilderness had taught to read the book of nature with great accuracy . " There is no mistaking such ugly signs as these , " said he , rather to himself than to his companion . " It needs no misbegotten gnome , coming from the bowels of the earth , to tell me that there will be a devilish pother of the elements before I can get back to Merry-Mount . Now , although the weather be June , and the distance home but ten miles , yet I would rather empty a tankard in the poorest hedge ale-house between London and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with nothing to light me on my path but the lightning , which is a mighty zig-zag and uncomfortable kind of link bearer . " " I tell thee , Master , " croaked out the lunatic , as he lay coiled and shuddering in a heap , " profane not thus the name of the mighty and fearful hero of Plymouth . Deride not , neither , the terrible Abamoko . He rushes even now over our heads , astride the thunder . " " Faith , then , " answered Morton , " I wish he would even take me up on his pillion behind him . As for the heroic Captain Standish , whose name , it seems , is not to be profaned , I beg thee , in case that he , as well as Abamoko , should pay a visit to thine humble abode , to present to him my warmest congratulations and regards . Tell Captain Standish , moreover , that should his leisure allow , it would gratify me deeply to receive him at my poor palace at Merry-Mount , the rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit on his part , and  --  " " Your presence here will save Captain Standish that trouble , " suddenly exclaimed a stern voice at his side . Morton turned hastily round , and to his infinite amazement , beheld Miles Standish , standing close to him with his drawn sword in his hand . At the same instant he felt himself suddenly seized from behind by several powerful arms , and before he had time for a single struggle , he beheld himself a prisoner . At that very moment there was a louder and more prolonged peal of thunder , at which the lunatic uttering a sudden and sharp cry of horror , started to his feet , looked fearfully round , and then vanished into the bowels of the earth .
