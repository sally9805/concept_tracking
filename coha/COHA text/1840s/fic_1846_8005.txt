Higginson , Thomas Wentworth , 1823-1911 : Sonnet from Sonnet ( 1846 ) Editorial note : 1Kb TO WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON . BY J. W. HIGGINSON . ' T is not that deeds like thine need my poor praise , When , though commending not each word of strife , I yet would thank thee for thy manly life , Thou rugged Luther of these latter days : Oh when will men look through thine ardent phrase To the true depth of that devoted heart , Where selfish hope or fear had never part To swerve thee , with the crowd , from Truth 's plain ways ! When that day comes , thy brothers , wiser grown , Shall reverence struggling man 's true friend in thee , Thy life of stern devotion shall atone , For some few words that seemed too rough to be , And they shall grave upon thy funeral stone " This man spoke truth and helped us to grow free .
