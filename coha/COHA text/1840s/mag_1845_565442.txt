txt WE had intended to write at large upon the policy and operations of the American Tract Society . But we find that the unexpected length of some of our articles confines us to a few pages . We have hesitated , therefore , about saying any thing till our next number , in which we shall have room for a more full expression of our views . There is , however , a question respecting one part of the Society 's operations , which recent discussions and developments have rendered peculiarly interesting and exigent . We refer to the alteration of standard works of Christian literature . There is a dissatisfaction with the course of the Society 's committee in this respect , wide already , and spreading like flame before the wind . A few words , therefore , fitly spoken , now , * Report ( to the Public ) of the Committee of the Synod of New York and New Jersey , on the alteration of Books by the Publishing Committee of the Tract Society . Address of the Committee of the American Tract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee at Boston to the Members and Friends of the Amencan Tract Society in New England . may be better than many in our next number . We take several positions for granted at the outset , without discussion , since in our view they need none . We take it for granted that the American Tract Society is truly and eminently a beneficent institution , receiving a larger support than would be received by denominational institutions of the same kind , having access to fields from which such institutions would be excluded , and having a benign and powerful influence to secure the best kind of catholic unity-unity in essential doctrine , in spirit , and in action . We take it for granted that the wide and rapidly running dissatisfaction among the numerous supporters of the Tract Society , of which we have spoken , really exists . We can not be blind to the fact , if we would . The action of associations and sy. nods , the language of our religious journals , and the private intercourse of individuals , decisively declare it . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general sentiment of New England Congregationalists , when we say , that this discussion must be arrested by a // prompt , full and fair consideration on the part of the managers of the Society , of its cause , and by a settlement of principles for future action wisely made and distinctly announced , or those managers will lose the confidence of a large part of their constituency , and the Society 's usefulness be greatly impaired . We take it for granted , that the committees of the Tract Society regard themselves not as the Society , but as the agents of the members of the Society , responsible to those members , and therefore anxious to know their wishes and will . We take it for granted , also , that those who have expressed dissatisfaction with and urgent objections to the course of the Publishing Committee , are what they profess to be , real and earnest friends of the Society , and desire only its constitutional administration and prosperity . We come then abruptly to the question , Is it right-morally right we mean-for the publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard authors ? this we will divide into two , which may be more clearly discussed separately . ( 1 . ) Is it right for them to alter works of history ? ( 2 . ) Is it right for them to alter practical and doctrinal works ? To the first question , we answer , decidedly , No . A work of history is the testimony of an individual to facts of which he has acquired , in his view , an accurate knowledge . To alter an historical work , therefore , is to destroy its peculiar value . The peculiar value of a work of history-i. e. its value as historyis measured by the worth of the author as a witness . If it is altered , therefore , its peculiar value is destroyed as truly as would be the deposition of a witness by being altered by a lawyer before its presentation to the court and jury . The testimony is worthless . It is no longer testimony . It is no longer authentic . It no longer speaks by authorVol . III . ity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , it can never be adduced to answer the great purpose for which it was written . It would be rejected at once by any disputant who should learn the fact that it has been altered . It may be argument . It may be exhortation. it may be romance . But it is no longer testimony-no longer authentic history . Hence the public sentiment requires , and publishers are usually very careful to give , full and particular evidence of the complete authenticity of editions of historical works . Moreover , to alter an author 's history , and send it out as his , is really a fraud . No one would deny that the alteration by a lawyer of the deposition of a witness is a fraud . No more can it be truly denied that the alteration or omission of the statements of an historical witness is a fraud . It makes the testimony of the witness other than as he gave it . It presents testimony which he did not present . And yet it is sent out as substantially his testimony . It deceives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an historical work , to save the feelings of his customers , and increase the sale of his book , would , when detected , be denounced at once . It is as truly a fraud , as would be an alteration of the historical statements of the Bible . The difference between the error of altering sacred history  --  the Bible  --  and the error of altering history by a human author , is a difference in degree , not in kind . In each case it is the alteration of testimony to facts . The fact , that in the one , the testimon* altered is divine and infallible , m*es the error greater in degree , but not different in kind . We have an illustration in point . The Roman Catholics , in their version of the Bible , wishing to give divine authority and recommendation to the worship of images , altered this passage in the epistle to the Hebrews , " Jacob - worshiped // leaning on the top of his staff , " so as to make it read , " Jacob adored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to denounce this as a " pious fraud . " Now surely it is a less fraud , but not less truly a fraud , to alter the statements of any human historian , and send them out as his . These remarks apply not merely to statements of the prominent facts of history , but also to the coloring and shading of those facts . Alteration here destroys not only the idiosyncrasy of the writer , but the authenticity of the work . The identity of a person consists not less in his flesh , and color , and air , and gait , than in his bones and sinews . The ' reasons which we have given are decisive , we think , against the alteration of an historian 's statement by individuals . They are equally decisive against such alteration by the publishing committee of the Tract Society . The fact that such alterations are made by a committee of a benevolent association , with benevolent intentions , does not change their nature and tendency . If such alterations , when made by an individual , destroy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less when made by the committee of the Tract Society . If such alteration , when made by an individual , is a fraud on the purchaser or reader , it is none the less a fraud ( we speak not of intention ) when done by the committee of the Tract Society . There are also additional and peculiar reasons why the committee of the Tract Society should not alter the statements of history . We will mention two . The firs is , that the Committee publish su*h altered statements not with their own funds . They are trustees and disbursers of a fund contributed by others . They draw from a treasury which is filled from all the land ,  --  into which the rich casts from his abundance , the poor from his penury , and the child from his little store . And these numer ous contributors have never contemplated or authorized such use of their funds . The other reason is this . The Committee , by this course , affect not themselves only . They bring discredit on the Society . They give an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garbler of history . Men will think , that the Society changes history to suit its purposes ; they do not know how far or in what respects changes are made , and they will not confide in its integrity as a publisher . Thus the Committee cut the cords of public confidence in the Society . But plain as is the general question of the propriety of the alteration of history by the Committee , the particular question which has been a subject of public discussionWere the Society 's committee right in altering the History of the Reformation by Merle D'Aubign* ? - is , if possible , still plainer . Whatever doubts there may be in some minds on the general question , we see not how there can be any on the particular question . One of the great lessons which that history teaches is , the evils of prelacy and hierarchy . But the Committee have stricken out all references to prelacy and hierarchy , as such , or have so changed them as to make them bear only on one form of hierarchy ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness , by altering his testimony-by the fact of alterationbut such is the nature of their alterations , as to divest his history of one of its chief lessons  --  to defeat one of its main objects . Besides  --  and this is in our view a consideration of great weightD'Aubign6 himself , with as strong motives as had the Committee to make these very changes , deliberately chose not to make them . He is intimately associated at Geneva with evangelical Baptists , one of // whom  --  a prominent clergymanmade common cause with him in leaving the established church . Notwithstanding , he did not think it proper to depart from the ordinary language of history respecting Anabaptists . He values highly the evangelical Episcopalians . He has the strongest motives to be tender toward their peculiarities : for he is intimately and pleasantly associated with many Episcopal residents at Geneva , who have rendered important aid to the church with which he is connected . He was on terms of closest friendship with an excellent Episcopal missionary who had retired to Geneva to reside , and has recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the warmest fraternal feeling toward all who love Christ in sincerity . He has lately been engaged in plans and endeavors to promote unity among the different evangelical Protestant denominations . With all this pressure of motive to suppress , he has yet given the historical facts , not merely respecting papacy , but respecting prelacy and hierarchy . The very reasons which could not prevail on the author to depart from the usual statements and forms of statement of history in writing the work , surely can not justify others in altering those statements or forms of statement when written . The author , with his numerous manuscripts and varied facilities for writing exact history before him , did not omit or modify the statements and references in question . But the committee of the Tract Society , without these facilities for securing historical accuracy before them , omit and modify those statements and references , and do this , not to make them more exact , but indeed to make them less exact , that they may better suit certain denominations of Christians ! Is it not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's history for the press , How will this or that statement and reference suit this or that denomination , and what omissions or modifications will make it suit ? Moreover , the Committee had evidence , in D'Aubign* 's late spirited Lecture on Puseyism and High-churchism , that his conviction is very deep , and his feeling very strong , of the evils of prelacy . To have made these alterations without consulting D'Aubign6 , is a discourtesy and wrong toward him , which the Committee now see and regret , and which has received the decided disapprobation of himself and his friends . That the Committee did not see and prevent this , is remarkable . That they did not at least consult with the author 's intimate friend and frequent correspondent , Rev. Dr. Baird , a resident of the same city with themselves , is still more remarkable . We are informed , by the Address of the Committee , that D'Aubign* is , at their request , revising this history , and adapting it to the purposes of the Society . We are reluctant to object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . This adaptation of the work to the Society 's channels , though it will doubtless be done with the best motives , will , we fear , be-surely it will appear to be-a suppression of important historical statements , in order to answer a purpose . Some years since , James K. Paulding , after he became engaged in partisan politics-he was , we believe , an incumbent in , or aspiring to , a high political officepublished a new edition of his works , striking out a very true , spirited and just passage respecting slavery in the southern states . The act was regarded with general contempt . Now D'Aubign* will revise and alter his history for the Tract Society-if he does it-with far other motives than those of this author , corrupted in manliness and honesty by political ambition . Yet we fear that his revision will beafter what has happened it will appear to be  --  a modification or softening // of the lessons of history , that they may not offend any among evangelical Christians . To " offend not in word , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule in social intercourse , but a bad one for a witness in a court of justice , or on the pages of history . " Facts are stubborn things , " and we like not to see their stubbornness broken down . In the remarks which we have hitherto made , we do not deny the propriety of a publication by the committee of the Tract Society , or by individuals , of a history openly and avowedly corrected by a competent historical hand . That would be the publication of a new work  --  the history of A corrected by B. Nor do we wish to be considered as expressing any opinion concerning the propriety of publishing history with notes which contradict or correct the text ; nor whether a man may rightfully expurgate Shakspeare , or , should he choose , travesty Virgil , or turn Milton into doggerel . Such questions have no bearing on the present discussion , and we have no room for their consideration . Much less do we deny the right to abridge history . Abridgment is not alteration . It professes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An abridgment of history is not regarded as the genuine work . It avows itself to be , not the testimony of the author as he gave it , but the testimony of the author as abridged by another ; and its authority rests jointly on the author and abridger , and will be proportioned to our confidence in the correctness of the one , and the ability and fidelity of the other . We come now to the second question , Is it right for the publishing committee of the Tract Society to alter the practical works , and the doctrinal works of a practical bearing , of standard authors ? We have weighed this question carefully , and we answer , Yes-en certain conditions . We think that it may be done with great and blessed results ; and , if done according to the conditions which we shall mention , with few if any evil results . If Baxter , and Flavel , and Edwards , and others like themmen such as the world does not see in every age-can , by being deprived of those parts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers multiplied ten , twenty or a hundred fold ; if they can thus implant the principles of the common Christianity , which they so ably advocate and powerfully impress , and which they chiefly prized , in a hundred times as many minds as they would if their works were unaltered ; if the choice Christian writers of the world-the next best instrumentality to the Bible and the living ministry-can thus have their sphere of usefulness indefinitely expanded , and this without harm in any direction , surely , a most important end will be gained , a glorious result accomplished-one which theywho love and long for the spread of the common Christianity will not lightly prevent . Now we believe that , by divesting these authors , in some of their treatises , of the little of denominational matter which they have , they can be made , by this catholic Society , with its power-presses and its hundreds of distributers , both in densely and sparsely populated regions , to preach to hundreds , where before they preached to tens . With the reasons on which we ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we can not spare . They are familiar to all who read or hear the communications of the Tract Society . But , while the benefits from the wider circulation of these works , by means of their alteration to suit the channels of this catholic association , are fully acknowledged , there are those who fear evil results which will more than counterbalance these benefits . They say , these Christian // classics lie in our hearts next to the Bible . We can not bear to see them mutilated . We feel as does an artist , when he sees rude hands marring a chef d'xuvre . A rough shock is given to some of their most sacred associations . And the5i think that no benevolent society can be sustained , which thus wars with the religious tastes and feelings of the Christian community . They say , also , You are destroying the testimony and burying in oblivion the authority and the reasoning of our strongest writers on interdenominational questions , and the questions between different schools . These questions we acknowledge to be less important than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not unimportant . The right statement and explanation and successful defense of them is essential to the best development and most effective influence of the evangelical system . These questions are greatly interesting to us and to the cause of Christ . These questions have been settled , in our view beyond dispute , by these giants in Christian literature . And you destroy all this their work . You consign to oblivion their logic and authority on these questions . Says the Old School Calvinist , You are striking election out of Edwards , or at least diminishing the proportion and prominence of election . Says the New School Calvinist , You are striking new school out of Baxter . I can show you three solid pages of real Taylorism in his " Call to the Unconverted , " sacrificed on the altar of mutilation . Says the Pedobaptist , You divest these works of all their conclusive arguments against the Baptists . You rob Wilberforce of his testimony in behalf of Episcopacy , says the Churchman . You strike out this and that logical annihilation of prelacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not even allow of incidental expressions against Arminianism , adds the Calvinist . You must not publish any thing against Arminianism , rejoins some Calvinistic Episcopalian , who is reluctant to be known in his own denomination as other than Arminian . And then , say they all in chorus , You send out the mutilated book as genuine , without any boEa fide information of the alteration ; and by your cheap and forced circulation , you push all other editions of these works out of the channels of trade , and ultimately out of the world . Thus in your zeal to multiply certain portions of these authors ' works , you bury certain other portions . You kill the authors in part , that you may make their other part more active . And then you profess to have done nothing except to change a little obsolete phraseology ! This course , moreover , which you are commencing , is one of indefinite evil . You establish a precedent whose influence and effects you can not measure nor forecast . On the same principle , a Unitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them of every thing opposed to his heresies , and pass them off as genuine , with the exception of such alterations as time renders necessary . And so might this practice run on , till the whole religious press should be employed in stereotyping deceit . These objections from various quarters have , we think , great weight , and , could they not be obviated , we should say , alter no books . But we believe that they can be in a great measure obviated by the conditions which we propose . The first condition , not perhaps in the order of nature , but in importance , as related to these objections , is , Let the fact and nature of the alterations be distinctly announced-so distinctly announced , that no one who reads the title-page or preface can receive the idea that the Tract Society 's edition is the complete and genuine work of the au // thor . Let there be no concealment , not the least , on this poinL Let it be confessed , or rather professed , that the work has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Society is , not to publish works completely genuine , but works so altered ( let the word be spoken right out ) as to be acceptable and useful among the masses in all evangelical denominations . This , plainly , is the only honest course . It is the only course which tells the truth  --  the only course which does not deceive . To send out a work deprived of important pages , or sentences , or words , of denominational matter , with no declaration of the fact on the titlepage and in the preface , or with a declaration that slight changes have been made , such only as are required by style and obsolete phraseology , is to publish an untruth , and that as often as there are volumes published , yea , as often as those volumes are read . We feel strongly-we would speak decidedly , on this point . It is telling untruths by stereotype font and steam press . Who can estimate the fearful influence of such an example of a great and benevolent association , seen in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is liable to all the objections to which we have alluded . It shocks the taste and principles of the scholar , and wounds the associations and attachments of the Christian reader . It destroys the authority and buries the arguments of great authors on those important questions which divide evangelical denominations and schools . It ought not to be allowed . There should be such an announcement of the fact and nature of alterations , when made , as to forbid the reader to believe that the edition is the exact and genuine production of the author . Should it be said , that this course will diminish the circulation of the books-that many will not buy nor receive them , if they know that they are not genuine-we answer , Be it so . Then we have no right to put our books upon them ; no more than a tradesman has to put off damaged goods on a man who is searching for those which are sound . Be it so . We have no right to catch readers by guile . We have no right to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a deceptive course , to force out of cir-* culation and print , the genuine works of the ablest Christian writers , and to nullify labors to which they , and thousands of like faith with them , attach great importance . And it is poor policy . Better a diminished circulation , than the loss of the confidence of the Christian community , the withering of the Society 's resources , and the destruction of its usefulness . We suppose that , by this fair and open course , the circulation of the altered works would be diminished , just where it ought to he , not among the masses for whom they were chiefly designed , but among clergymen and scholars , who ought to have the genuine works . We feel bound to say  --  and we say it with great reluctance-that the Publishing Committee , doubtless with the best intentions , have committed an error at this important point-an error which , in our view , they ought to perceive and renounce . They have not made that distinct announcement of alterations of which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and have been apparently unwilling to let the world know that many of their books are-what they are-altered to suit a purpose , not the exact and genuine productions of their authors . But , on the other hand , it will be asked , Will this prevent the evil results anticipated ? We think , that in connection with another condition , it will . For , the distinct declaration that the Tract Society 's edition of a treatise is altered , and // is not in all respects the genuine work of the author , will effectually prevent the burial of that author 's authority and arguments on interdenominational questions . The genuine editions will then be in abundant demand , and of course will be abundantly supplied . And no one will ever presume to quote the Tract Society 's edition as proof that the author did not maintain certain opinions on those questions , or to infer that he did not advance powerful and decisive arguments on those questions , from the fact that they are not found in that edition : for it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance the common Christianity of all the sects , and that whatever pertains to denominational Christianity , however important in that relation , has been expunged or modified . To illustrate this point , suppose that it had been proposed to Edwards , while living , to preach to Baptists , or Arminians , or Episcopalians , or to Fuller to preach to Pedobaptists , or to Wilberforce to lecture to Presbyterians , and to confine themselves to subjects on which they and their hearers were agreed ; would they not have cheerfully consented , provided that the fact of this limitation was distinctly announced and well understood , and that they should be free to proclaim and enforce their peculiar opinions elsewhere ? Would they not have more than consented ? Would they not have rejoiced thus to have had a wider scope given them for usefulness on the field of the common Christianity ? This is just what the Tract Society , pursuing essentially the course we have indicated , would do with the works by which such authors , though dead , yet speak . The other condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let alterations , when made , he made cautiously , skillfully and judiciously . Alteration of the standard works of Christian literature , enshrined in the hearts of Christian scholars , is an exceedingly delicate task . It is far better , therefore , when practicable , to have works written than altered to suit the basis of the Society . And we believe that authors may now be found , who , by the aid of the light shed now for ages on practical and Joctrinal subjects , will write treatises better adapted to the Society 's purposes , than can be made by the alteration of works written without the Society 's specific purposes in view . This is a topic which well deserves a distinct and minute consideration . But we have not room for it now . This , however ,  --  the writing of books for the Society ,  --  can only be done gradually . To supply volumes in this way , requires time -- time in which thousands will perish for lack of knowledge . There seems to be a necessity , for a xvhile at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by alteration to the Society 's purposes . But this should be done with extreme caution . They who do it should bear in mind the delicacy of the work-that it is * work to which many of our wisest men consent with extreme reluctance , even on condition that the fact and nature of alterations is distinctly announced ; that it is a work which wars with the tastes and associations and feelings , if not with the judgment , of the enlightened Christian community . This should cause them to determine to make no changes , except when absolutely necessary for the Society 's purposes . The members of the Committee should lay aside , not indeed fidelity to , or the peculiar opinions of , the denominations they represent , but all the littleness and narrowness of the sectarian spirit . This work of alteration should also be done with great judgment and skill . Bearing in mind the great delicacy and difficulty of the work , the Committee should employ // those to do it who will not bungle . Remembering that they are directing the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will not maul them . A blacksmith should not be set to mend a watch , nor a stone-mason to alter the Belvidere Apollo . The work should be done by one thoroughly and scientifically acquainted with doctrinal and practical theology , as well as familiar with the scope and spirit of the author , and with the peculiar views of the several denominations included in the Society . We think that whoever has made alterations hitherto , has had his eye directed by the benevolence of his heart , more toward the destitute masses for whom the volumes of the Society are chiefly intended , than toward the intelligent Christian readers and scholars who are jealous for the integrity of the works , which , next to the Bible , they love . We have been ourselves more troubled by the nature than the fact of the alterations . We think that many of them are entirely unnecessary , and that some of t*iem evince , not merely a difference of opinion between denominations , but also a yielding to the littleness of the sectarian spirit . We think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-that some of these changes have been unskillfully made-made in violation of scientific and judicious rules , both of rhetoric and theology . We can not afford room for instances . Some of them have been widely published , and have made a deep impression . We will allude to onethe alteration of the main propositions of Edwards 's Treatise on Redemption . In the general introduction to that treatise , under the head of Doctrine , the author gives a summary definition and statement of the terms to be used , and of the positions to be established . The design of the work of Redemption he summarily expresses in five propo sitions . Two of these propositions , and these the most important , have been altered ! This is enough to set theological and rhetorical teeth on edge . The very frame-work of the building , the chief bones of the body , are changed . Now this alteration was entirely unnecessary ; for the same sentiments are inwrought in the whole work , and formal expressions of them are left , perhaps abundantly , and some even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Society 's purposes , they should not be made . If the Publishing Committee can not adapt a treatise to the channels of the Society without altering its main propositions-its frame-work-we say , let that treatise be given up as impracticable . Against such alterations , theology , logic , taste , nerves , cry out . We have not seen any public defense of this alteration , but we have heard that it has been privately defended , thus . These are not main propositions . Proof . - They are enclosed in a parenthesis . To this we answer : In the edition before us they are not enclosed in a parenthesis . And if they were , what then ? Who does not know that some of the old writers used the parenthesis very freely , as modern writers do the dash , and often to include very weighty matter ? We have no patience to argue such a point . It is the merest quibble , and every uncommitted man , who knows the nature of a parenthesis , will say so . We have thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pursued by the committee of the Tract Society in the present exigency . We have carefully and anxiously watched the expressions of dissatisfaction , and the astonishment and grief , which exposure of the alterations in works of history , and of practical and doctrinal theology , has produced . We have consulted with many lovers of the Society wiser than ourselves , and // we believe that the course of ' which we have spoken is not only right in itself , but will satisfy the members and friends of the Society , and heal the present alarming and growing dffflculty . It will , we think , satisfy those who have uttered complaint , and made exposures of the alterations . " The Committee of the Synod of New York and New Jersey " - though in their publications on this subject , if we understand their commission , they ought to act , and if we understand their own explanations , they do act , not as " Committee of the Synod , " but simply as individuals ,  --  will , we should judge , be satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly to see their way clear , and to walk rather gropingly , and have appeared from time to time to change their ground , and have uniformly perhaps taken stronger ground than we , yet the gist of their objections has been , the falsification of historical testimoPy , and the tendency of the alterettion of practical and doctrinal works to destroy the authority and bury in oblivion the arguments of standard writers on interdenominational questions . If this can be obviated , their anxiety and alarm will cease . The executive committee of the Boston Tract Society have marked out essentially this course , in their late appeal to the members and friends of the American Tract Society in New T*ngland . " They say ,  --  , " We come now , in the second place , to speak more directly with regard to the principle and practice of accommodating books to the great object thus conternplated by the Society . " It would be a misfortune if this Society should present itself to any mind with its incidental arrangement of revising books in undue prominence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society exists . It seeks to make known salvation by Christ through books and tracts to the largest possible number of souls in our land . When this can be promoted by issuing books which require no alteration , all will agree that this , for every reason , should he done ; and such has been the practice of the Publishing Committee . But when a hook can , in the view of the Committee , promote the great object for which it was written more effectually in the hands of the Society by certain changes or omissions , they feel that it is their duty to make them , and the book being thus prepared , as they think , in the very best way to teach the greatest number of minds the truths necessary to salvation , they send it broadcast over the land . " " It is right and fair that each book which is altered by the Publishing Committee should apprise the reader of the fact . While it would be injudicious to make such a notice obtrusive , are ! while a desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own good intentions , it is indispensable that every hook which is altered should not be in any danger of passing as the exact production of the autbor . If the present notices in any of the books are not sufficient , it **fl be easy to make them so . The Publishing Committee have assured us that every book which is altered shall cootain such a notice , informing the reader of the nature of the alterations in it , without relying on his supposed knowledge of the Society 's plan of publications to suggest to him that alterations may have been made . They have also expressed their intention to prefix such a notice to all the future issues of their present publications which may require it . It will then be understood that those who wish for the works in their original form must look elsewhere for them than to this Society , and those who are willing to circulate or receive books which , while they have been revised by the Publishing Committee for more extensive circulation , are still substantially as they were written , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , March , 1845 , p. 15 . In other words they say , Let changes when made , be made cautiously and judiciously , and be distinctly announced . Let not the Committee presume on the reader 's knowledge of the Society 's basis of union for information as to the fact and nature of the alterations ; but let them be so announced in the preface , as , that the work altered " shall not be in any danger of passing as the exact production of the author . " This ground , the defenders of the Tract Society have generally taken The New York Observer , which has defended the course of the Committee , concedes that alterations // should " be judiciously made and distinctly announced . " We think , therefore , that on this general ground the whole difficulty may be harmoniously adjusted . But , while this ground of adjustment has been indicated both by those who have assailed and those who have defended the course of the Publishing Committee in making changes in books , it has not been taken , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . They have published in the American Messenger , the appeal of the Boston Executive Committee . But they have not announced the principles and positiona of that document as their own . The Boston brethren Inform us in their appeal , that the Publishing Committee have promised them , that the course indicated in that appeal , i. e. judicious alterations and distinct announcements , shall be pursued hereafter ; also , that the announcements of alterations in works already published , which are not sufficiently full and distinct , shall be made so . But the Publishing Committee have given no such assurance to the community . We looked anxiously for such an assurance in the address of the Committee which accompanied the republication of this Boston appeal . But we were disappointed . We did not find it , nor any thing which looked like it . For ourselves , we distinctly and emphatically say , that we can not be satisfied , and we fully believe that the New England Congregationalists will not be satisfied , until a frank , full and formal announcement is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that this course will be hereafter pursued . We make no apology for speaking thus plainly on this subject . We have not commenced the discussion . We have regretted the mode of its commencement . We regret that those who have seen evil in the acts of the Publishing Committee did not make their attempts to remedy it through the channels of the Societydid not take the course which the constitution of the Society points out for the correction , by the members of the Society , of any errors in the conduct of its officers. * But we find a discussion going on in the public channels of communicationa discussion which , unless arrested by a satisfactory adjustment of difficulties , will we fear seriously injure , if not destroy the Society . The Society depends for its usefulness and existence on the confidence of its members and patrons . If that confidence be destroyed , its usefulness and existence are ended . This fact , on the one hand , should produce great candor and caution , and forbearance , and orderliness ofmethod in those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should induce a disposition in its officers , to attend to every breath of dissatisfaction among its members and friends , whether coming to them as individuals , or as officers , whether coming with due observance of technical 9rder or not ; and to be ready for inc*uiry and explanation , and adjustment , and a reference to their constituency  --  a disposition carefully to avoid creating distrust of the Society , and injuring its usefulness by undue partiality for their own acts , by pertinacity of opinion , * The 10th and 4th articles of the Consti*tion of the Tract Society are as follows : " Article X.-The president , or , in his absence , the vice-president , or other otticer first on the list in the city of New York , at the request of five directors , may call special meetings of the hoard of directors , causing three days ' notice of such meetings to be given . The board of directors shall have power to call special meetings of the society . " " Article IV. - The society shall meet annually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the proceedings of the foregoing year shall be reported , and a board , consisting of a president , vice-presidents , secretaries , a treasurer , two auditors , and thirty-six directors , shall be chosen . " // or obstinacy of spirit , or assumed independence of the great body whose responsible agents they are , or by the imputation , public or private , of sinister motives to those who complain of their course . In conclusion , we assure our brethren of the Publishing and Executive Committee , of our sympathy with them in their trying situation . They have labored hard , and with excellent intentions , and it is doubtless grievous to them to find that any of their acts have been unsatisfactory . We hope that they may be divinely guided . We think that they are in danger of mistaking the state of the public mind and will . We have seen some indications of a disposition to consider the fact that the recent discussions have not diminished the receipts of the Society as a verdict against the complaints , and in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this disposition ; and we protest in behalf of the Society , against such a mode of settling the pending questions . It is a mode which is by no means immediately decisive ,  --  a mode by which in so short a time , the public decision can not at all be inferred . XVe know that many have given to the Society , within a few months past , more freely than formerly , not because they wholly approve of the course of the Committee , but lest it should appear that the Society had already lost public confidence . We know that many have given , with the full conviction , that after what has happened , the hors complained of will not he rerated . We know that others have given under protest against those errors , and given more liberally than usual to evince the impartiality and friendliness of their protest . It is a mode of judgment which will ultimately indeed be entirely decisive . If tried long enough , it will settle the question as to the public verdict . But the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be known till pronounced by the Society 's injury and ruin . We protest therefore , in behalf of the Society , against a mode of ascertaining public opinion so dangerous to the strength and life of the Society . There is a more excellent way . Our prayer is , that wisdom and grace may be given to the Executive Committee to meet the present exigency with a right spirit and with excellent judgment . Then we are sure that the result of these discussions and trials will be an enlarged and strengthened confidence in a Society which they and we greatly love . PosvscainT. - Since the preceding article went to press , we have seen the Report of the Pastoral Association of Philadelphia , on the publications of the Tract Society . One of their resolutionstakes a decided position against " any alteration being made in the works of any author at the suggestion of a sect , or so as to suit the basis of the unioo of the Tract Society , except where the consent of a living author has been obtained . " The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is entitled to immediate and full consideration . A position , similar to that expressed in the resolution to which we have referred , has been taken by other Associations of ministers , and by the correspondents and editors of several religious journals , some of whom testify that the same opinion prevails in the community around them . We think these indications plainly point to the policy which we have suggested-viz , the writing , rather than the altering ofbooks to suit thebasis of the Society 's union . That policy ought to be adopted at once , and a supply of books procured in accordance with it as soon as practicable . We think , however , that the position taken in the above resolution ought not to be at present insisted on . We believe that it can not be defended and maintained in its full length and breadth . We earnestly desire that all differences may be adjusted on the ground which has been indicated in the preceding article , and in various other quarters-viz , cautious , skillful and judicious alterations , and distinct announcements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the meaning of distinct announcements . That meaning should be accurately defined and settled . The meaning which we give it , is fully expressed in the foregoing pages.
