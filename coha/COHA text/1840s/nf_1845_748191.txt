txt WE come this Evening to award the Premiums and to close this Fair of the Eighteenth Anniversary of the American Institute . We have , in the beginning , to proffer our thanks to this numerous and crowded assembly for their many demonstrations of kindness and support , of the great principles involved , and their eager anxiety evinced for the success of our cause . Custom has rendered necessary an Address on these occasions , and the attendance of such an audience as this indicates the great interest the public feel in the ceremonies of the Institute . Allow me to say , that until within a few days past I did not expect to have been present on this occasion . I have no speech prepared . I have no Address ready to deliver ! It seems , however , a fitting occasion , and with the indulgence of this assembly , I propose that we should spend the time of this evening , and informally talk over our family concerns ; and recount with each other the varied circumstances in our family affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity . A review of the past may better enable us to mark the course for the future . A Convention of Farmers , Gardeners and Silk Growers of the United States has been held during this Fair , in which , all the States and Territories , except five , were represented , which brought together and imparted much valuable information . From such sources , as well as from our individual experience and realization , he was gratified to announce that our nation , in all its districts , was blessed with great prosperity and happiness . Our climate is genial ; our soil is productive . Individual enterprise and efforts , in the varied pursuits of civil life , are crowned with corresponding successes . In the full enjoyment of civil and religious liberty , the members of our national family now have much cause for rejoicing for their multiplied blessings . In looking about for the causes , under a kind Providence , which have led to such consequences , the great question of INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS , hedevelopement of the resources of our Country , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present themselves to the view and mind of the observer , exhibiting in bold relief the causes and their effects . What man of middle age will not recollect when our occupied country consisted of a mere belt of land upon the Atlantic coast , and all beyond was interminable wilderness ? The South , with a soil exuberant , was prosperous in its Planter condition , and its labour was successfully employed in the production of its great natural staples , Cotton and Tobacco , which found a ready foreign market . The Eastern States were doomed to a soil hard and sterile , which scarcely afforded to their industry a scanty subsistence . Necessity , that fruitful mother of invention , taught them to adventure on the ocean , and forced them to provide for their wants by their own manufactures . The soil of the Middle States , fertile and congenial to agriculture , and abounding in mineral wealth , was by distance rendered unavailing and valuelesswithout the means of transportation . The jealousy of foreign governments , interdicted the produce of our land , while it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country with foreign fabrics . Our currency was exhausted . The industry of the country languished . The enterprise of our people was depressed . The Planter alone stood erect , with a ready foreign market for his staple , Cotton . The cotton crop had been rendered of an hundred fold value , by the invention of the cotton gin , by WHITNEY , of Connecticut . Under an impending crisis oi such a character in our family concerns , New-York entered upon her system of Internal Improvements . She adopted her canal policy , and pledged her " fortune and her sacred honour " for its consummation . Her Erie and her Champlain canals have been completed . The original costs were upwards of nine millions of dollars , and the tolls received for the present year ( 1845 ) are two millions and a half of dollars . The lands along the extended lines of her canals are made available ; as also those of the whole State are greatly increased in value . Its mineral wealth of Iron and Salt are now available . The State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , provided for all her productions . But we must look west from Buffalo , for the national and material benefits from the Erie canal . Transportation and a market are opened to all the upper lakes . The government lands pn thousands of miles of their snores , arc made accessible and available for sale and settlement . In earnest of the facilities and increased value of all the upper lakes , yonder in this room is a large mass of copper ore from Lake Superior , sent here as a specimen in competition with other ores . Buffalo has become the seaport for the commerce of the lakes , and has thereby quadrupled its population . The villages on the line of this canal have grown into towns , and the towns have become cities . Troy and Albany have each quadrupled their population , under this new commerce from the canals . An official report shows the trade on the canals , in 1841 , was ninety-two millions of dollars valuation , which has now grown to more than one hundred millions . The bosom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the busy hum of man in the industrious pursuits of commercial enterprise , continually resounds on every part of its shores . /z/ This city , to which this mighty tide from the far west is setting onward , and which could only claim her one hundred thousand inhabitants , when the system of the internal improvements of this State was adopted , can now count , including the suburb villages appended to her , a population of four hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants . May it not be said within the limits of truth , that the nine millions of dollars expended for the Erie and Champlain canals , if extended in the estimate of public benefits , to ninety and nine millions , would yet be short of the reality ? Pennsylvania , our sister State , is entitled to much consideration , in any consultation about our family and domestic concerns . She has a district of country , estimated by geologists to equal any other in the known world , in mineral and agricultural wealth . It is stated that England has two thousand square miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten times as much , or twenty thousand square miles of coal district , and containing both bituminous and anthracite coal . She , too , has a superabundance of iron ore , and much of it is in juxtaposition with the coal . All this boundless mineral wealth , was situated in remote districts , and from its distance , was unavailable and of small value , without new means of transportation . She , too , of necessity , embarked in her Internal Improvements , and has succeeded to open canal and rail-road communication for transportation to tide-water . She has this year ( 1845 ) brought out , two millions of tons of anthracite , and upwards of six hundred thousand tons of bituminous coal . Her struggles have been great , and her trials severe in the accomplishment of this great state and national object . The anxious advocates of Foreign Importations foreboded her failure , and croaked her ruin , in that great undertaking ; which , united with the running down of the ever-memorable and execrable Compromise Act , aided to alarm capitalists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shade on her reputation . She has survived the occasion . The great work is accomplished . The coal delivered this present year has enabled her to pay the interest on the canal debt , and wipe ofF the stain of defalcation and imputed fraud . The state and this nation , have much cause to rejoice in the consummation of this great work , so replete with benefits to agriculture , commerce and manufactures , and so essential to the future means for our national defence . In vain did our FULTON study to adapt steam-power to the purposes of navigation in vain has American genius provided propellers for its better use ; in vain will America attempt to hold in competition , her place upon the ocean , without adequate arrangements being made for the production and use of domestic coal . ( Great applause . ) This people , as one family , owe a debt of gratitude to Pennsylvania , for the trials she has endured , and the noble work she has achieved for herself and for the common welfare . Before and while this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in progress , who will not remember , and what householder does not know and bear witness , that the price paid for the imported coal consumed in this city , in our dwellins and in our workshops , varied from fifteen to twenty-two dollars per chaldron ? It has already mostly given place to the Pennsylvania coal , at $5 per ton , and has occasioned a corresponding reduction in the price of wood . Without estimating for the future , on the two millions and a half tons of coal brought out this year , the saving must be to the public upwards of ten millions of dollars , aside from the employment of domestic labour . The whole work is American , and its costs have been kept at home . With such facts before us , who can endure the disease of desiring foreign importations ! who does not spurn the thought of continuing dependent on foreign importations for our necessary domestic supplies , and omitting the just developement of our internal resources ? ( Great applause . ) Of the iron of Pennsylvania it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply for home consumption and exportation ; and the same means for transportation provided for her coal , is equally ready and available for her iron . She has numerous furnaces , and takes the lead in iron . In 1843 she had only two Anthracite furnaces . She now has twenty-seven in active operation , and using 500,000 tons of coal per annum . New- York is next in order . She has in active operation about two hundred furnaces using charcoal , and employing about four thousand labourers . It is said in the public prints , about two million tons of iron is the yearly consumption of the world . This total estimate is believed to be far too low . The United States already produces one quarter of that amount ; and with iron ore and coal to answer for the whole amount on demand . The present yearly consumption of the United States is equal to 42,000,000 of dollars of which about one-fifth is yet imported . Steam , as a motive power in war and in peace ; in navigation and on rail-ways , added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution in its wants and demands ; and promises an importance and a value to coal and iron which has never before been given to them . Individual and associated enterprise for the production of domestic supplies , has been crowned with most prosperous and signal success . The resources of our country , are found to develope , as new mines of wealth . Manufactures have prospered , converting the raw material into fabrics of more than a hundred fold increased value . They have not only supplied the domestic consumption , but they have called Commerce into active employment , and are successfully exporting their wares to Calcutta and the East Indies ; and to the Brazils and South America . So entirely successful , have American manufacturers been in acquiring preference in those foreign markets , from the superior excellence of their goods , that Europeans now often label their goods with American marks , to obtain a ready market . Mr. T. said the extraordinary success which had attended the varied manufacturing pursuits , had occasioned them not only to give active employment to the industry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce of our abundant agriculture . Agriculture profited largely , in the market from our public works , and yet more extensively in the establishment of manufactures . He had taken from a recent paper this notice : " GROWTH OF A MANUFACTURING TOWN . A single School District in the town of Manchester , N. H. , which eight years ago contained but one hundred and twenty-five inhabitants , all told , now has within its limits a busy population of nearly ten thousand . The whole amount of cash disbursed by manufacturing establishments is not far from seventy-five thousand dollars per month sixty-four thousand dollars of which are paid to the operatives alone ! Who can point us to an instance on record of similar thrift , rapid increase , and substantial prosperity ? " Mr. T. said he would ask what farmer , or what mechanic , was the poorer , for this sudden growth of the town of Manchester ? Nay , he would even ask , what farmer , what mechanic in all the surrounding country , or what inhabitant of the State , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disbursements of capital in such an interior district ? This notice will illustrate very many like notices in substance , which might be produced . But turn your thoughts to Lowell ; a yet stronger case . There the water power which had run wild for ages , has been subjected to work for man . Its once desert banks , now show the investment of twenty millions of capital , much of it created by its own work ; and with a population of upwards of thirty thousand inhabitants , all with prosperous employment . What farmer , or what mechanic is the poorer for all this ? The agriculturists of Ohio and Illinois will tell you , their droves of cattle and stock are driven out , re-fatted in Pennsylvania and Western New- York , and come to their market in Philadelphia , New- York and Boston . The grain and provisions from Michigan find their way to the same markets . The Rail-Road eastward from Albany , in addition to its other freights , have cars for fatted bullocks and other animals , as passengers , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the causes which have so suddenly and so greatly augmented the wealth , and increased the population of the Eastern and Middle States ; and given vitality to the far West , by affording it supplies and a ready market , for all the productions of its exuberant soil . Virginia and the Carolinas have steadily adhered to their planter condition . The production of cotton and tobacco as their only staples , with a ready foreign market , was the fixed boundary of their enterprise . They would not manufacture , or attempt the introduction of any other staple production . That their tobacco was charged with a foreign duty of nearly three thousand per cent. , stimulated them only to increased production . That the amount of their sales was returned to them in fabrics manufactured from their own cotton , at an increased cost of from four to four hundred fold , occasioned no doubts with them , of the expediency of continuing such a foreign trade . When information was given , that the Manchester of England , with two hundred thousand inhabitants , and abounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported on the profits of the manufacture of their cotton , it awakened no intention to become their own manufacturers , to employ their own labour , and to keep those profits at home . Early prejudices stood immovable in support of colonial habits . Their Joshuas , who had succeeded the men of the Revolution , had commanded the sun and the moon of their prosperity to stand still . New states had been added , and greatly augmented the quantity of cotton produced , while the price has steadily fallen from thirtyseven to four cents a pound , the lowest possible point of production ; and with the worn out tobacco plantations of Virginia , tell the story of their advancement in this age of self-reliance on our domestic industry , internal improvements and labour-saving machinery . But we inform you , with much delight , the charm has broken the spell has passed away . Rail-Roads are penetrating into every part of the South . Emigrants from other states , have gone in and redeemed the worn out lands by better cultivation , and manufactures have there successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last census showed two hundred and sixty-one establishments in the Southern States for manufacturing cotton upwards of one hundred have since been added numerous others are being erected , and on a more extended scale . Some now export their yarns to the north , and to Europe . Great applause . Will you look at these specimens of cut glass , brought here from remote districts , in competition for the premium of the American Institute ? They are all of superior quality and excellence ; their varied works , having attained much perfection , now furnish domestic supplies , and have checked foreign importations . Yonder specimen , a magnificent vase , has borne off the palm , and won the premium . Do you ask from whence it came ? From Wheeling . Yes , one of the four glass establishments of Virginia , has this day won the premium on these manufactures . Loud applause . A revolution in public opinion at the south , in regard to manufactures , is rapdily moving onwards . The advocates of foreign importation , often point to the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions value ot cotton , and three millions of tobacco , in contrast with only between four and five millions value , in all other productions exported to England , from all the United States . This is too true . It proves the tone of the measures , which have prevailed . The paralysis of some of our stand still politicians , and their measures , have worked such results . The partiality and injustice will be apparent , when it is remembered that the yearly productions of Rhode Island alone , in her agriculture , commerce and manufactures , equal in amount the boasted fifty-six millions of cotton from all the south . The annual production of Massachusetts amounts to one hundred and thirty millions of dollars . The production of New- York is equal in amount , other than the trade on her canals . That of Pennsylvania is of nearly like amount . Ohio , an unsettled wilderness when the Constitution of the United States was adopted , is now , by her liberal policies , grown to be the third state in the Union . Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater excess of wealth . New- York now has doubled the population of Virginia . What a demonstration of the consequences of their respective lines of policy ! When business is successful , when the industry of the country is fully employed , how can better evidence be afforded of the prosperity of a people ? The wages of this country furnish ample subsistence , and elevate the condition of the labourer . In Europe the price of labour will not average above ten cents a day . It explains its depressed condition , in subsistence , in habits and intelligence . We urge you to make the contrast , and remember , our duty is to provide for our own household . We have no sympathies with those who desire foreign importations . Away with all idea of importation for our necessary supplies , or articles for which we have the material and can manufacture ! Applause . It is unjust to our own artisans and labourers , it is bad faith to the emigrants who have come among us , that the productions of the labour of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be admitted here to glut the market , ruin their business , and throw them out of employ . Who does not rejoice in the triumph of domestic industry and art exhibited in the numerous articles of American production which now surround us . The American Institute holds emphatically to the doctrine of selfpreservation that this country should create its wealth , its independence , its supplies , and consequently secure its own happiness . We are now exporters of articles , of which , a few years ago , we imported large quantities . To repel accusations , the views of the American Institute in relation to protection , free trade and a tariff , had been explained on a former occasion . They are again stated , as follows : " We are not the advocates of a high Tariff . We advocate the encouragement Of Domestic Industry Of Domestic Production . We maintain the expediency of high wages , and an improved condition for our Home Labour , over the depressed labour of Europe . As means to accomplish these great objects We claim that the measures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encroachments of other countries , so as to secure to our own citizens EQUALITY in commerce , in rights and privileges ; and by a just distinction between the raw material and the manufactured articles imported , to lay duties for revenue . on the manufactured articles , so as to encourage our own labour , in the production of like articles , and thus to PROTECT the Domestic Industry of onr own people , and develope the resources of our country . Agriculture depends for its prosperity on production and a market . Encouragement induces the one ; home manufactures aud commerce will provide the other . " /z/ A reference to a few cases will illustrate the preceding explanation . In the commercial regulations established between independent countries , it is just and usual that regard should be had in the rights and privileges granted by the one ; to the rights and privileges allowed by the other . This is the relative " EauALrry " which we claim to be regarded . To give where we get and get where we give . American flour sent to Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Rio Janeiro the duty is $6 , and at Venezuela it is $4 . Other cases can be added to these examples . In return for this , by our commercial arrangements we receive their staple ( coffee ) free of duty . This is " Free Trade ! " Under an act of Congress , a duty is levied on coffee imported , and which is paid by American vessels , while Dutch vessels have a treaty , made under a former administration , allowing them to bring cargoes including coffee duty free . Mr. Secretary BIBB determined , the treaty and the law must each have their operation ; and so administered the treasury . Mr. WALKER , to correct this , has recently issued an order , " de daring that it could not have been the INTENTION to put foreign vessels on better terms in our ports than our own vessels , " and directing the duty to be levied . The Dutch insist his order can not repeal their treaty . This is not only Free Trade , but " a little more so " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " another " like treaty . The duty under the present Tariff of England on total articles which she actually receives from the United States , is an average of 49 per cent . The discrimination between the raw material and the manufactured article made by her , occasions a wide difference . Deduct the cotton she takes duty free , as a raw material for her manufactures , and the average duty is over 300 per cent , on all articles the product of the United States . Under our Tariff of 1842 , on all articles subject to duty , the average rate is 32 per cent . The articles imported in 1844 , duty free , amounted to nearly twenty-five millions of dollars . This sum being included in the amount , and the average of duty on the total import , is reduced to 24 per cent . Thus our commercial arrangements with England are , 24 per cent , against her 49 per cent , on all articles imported or , 32 per cent , against her 300 per cent , on all articles imported subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , received by either . Add to this , she has a discriminating duty in favour of her colonies of 147 per cent . This is not quite yet a case of free trade , and we are required to make a further reduction of our duties . During the war of 1812 with England , a law was passed to encourage American seamen , and giving a bounty on vessels employed in the fisheries of four dollars per ton , and twenty cents a barrel on fish cured vriih foreign salt and exported . The law has since been continued , and is now in force . England laid a duty of $6 a barrel ( now $4 ) on foreign fish , and duties on foreign timber , lumber , agricultural productions , &c.,; so /z/ high as to be prohibitory , and admitting the same articles from her colonies free of duty . Then came our new treaty of " reciprocity in trade and commerce " with Great Britain , ( not including her colonies , and by which her ships are admitted into our ports on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or her manufactures ; and reload with fall , timber , lumber and sometimes the produce of our agriculture , and sail not for England , where the duties are prohibitory , but for her colony of New-Brunswick , where they touch , and the vessels and cargoes then go home free of duty . No American vessel is allowed in this trade . Official returns show that 2,361 British vessels were thus employed in the year 1844 . Their crews averaged from eight to ten men , showing that 20,000 British seamen were thus employed in this American carrying-trade by way of New-Brunswick . The patriotic legislation to create a carrying trade , and a nursery for American seamen , has been turned the other end first by diplomatic arrangements ; and the bounty on the fisheries paid from the Treasury of the United States , now serves as a nursery for British seamen . This is also a case of free-trade under a treaty of reciprocity : with which all those are content , who endeavour to prevent encouragement to domestic industry , and study to retard rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuitous trade is carried on from the Southern States , touching at Jamaica , the Bermudas , or some British island , and thence home from the colony , with their cargoes , free of duty . Some of the fruits of free-trade on one side only , will appear from a Report made to Congress by the Naval Committee , which states that out of 109,000 seamen sailing out of the United States , only 9,000 were Americans . The Ohio ship of the line sailed from New- York on a three years cruise , with a crew of 1,000 men , only 182 of whom were Americans . Others of our public vessels are manned in like proportion . Complaints are making that foreign vessels are now under-bidding and obtaining the cotton-freights , in preference to American vessels . This is and ever will be so , under our present commercial arrangements . Those vessels come out bringing foreign manufactures , and in preference to returning in ballast , can afford to underbid and take cotton at any freight they can get . It is the same with coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New- York canals . Any return freight they can obtain is clear gain . A Bremen ship coming out with German emigrants , will bring wheat at six or seven cents a bushel , or other freight in the hold at a nominal rate , in preference to buying and taking in other ballast . There is a rapid and an alarming increase recently of foreign tonnage , in the American carrying trade . A few years ago its proportion was about one tenth ; in 1840 , the proportion was over one third /z/ of the whole . It is rapidly getting possession , especially of that branch of trade which is bulky and requires the greatest amount of shipping , and is the most valuable to navigation . It is in effect , now in possession of nearly one-half of the whole of the carrying trade of the United States . Facilities have been afforded in the administration of the laws , for these and other like abuses . When legislation would not be subordinate , then diplomatic arrangements were made to secure results . It is believed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hope , the time has come when measures will be taken to reclaim our lost rights , and regain that " equality " in Trade and Commerce , so just to others ; so essential to our country . American influences must and will prevail ! Time , and the occasion ( he said ) rendered it necessary to desist in this general review , and require us to give a more particular attention to the splendid specimens of American genius now under exhibition . All these go to prove the capability of the country to supply itself with all the necessaries of life , and point out the necessity of the government enabling and maintaining it in its efforts to do so . The President then alluded to the different machines in exhibition for the purpose of saving labour , especially the one for the production of Flax and Hemp ; and compared the facilities now thus secured with the difficulties and disadvantages which , up to a late period , were encountered in these productions and preparation of the raw material . It would enable the west and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staples for their rich soils , and furnish a supply of those valuable materials as a part of their abundant productions . It promises to accomplish for hemp and flax , what the gin did for cotton . He paid a fitting compliment to Mr. BILLINGS , the inventor of the machine . He was a native of Massachusetts , a resident of Missouri and was educated at the common school of New-England ; where it is safe to read the Bible . He paid a passing tribute to WHITNEY , the inventor of the cotton gin . A traveller at the south for his health , he saw the difficulty of picking the cotton from the seeds , and at once conceived the idea of the cotton gin , and gave an hundred fold value to the crops of the planter . Having accidentally mentioned " common schools " he said he could not refrain from adding a fitting illustration of its benefits to this government and the country . Increased safety for monarchial goverments is supposed to rest in the lack of education of the labouring classes of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write . Their system of the division of labour allots and confines individuals to separate divisions of the same manufacture . It is said they have ihirty-two divisions of labour in the manufacture of a pin . The intelligence of such labourers must , of consequence , be limited to the division of their employment . They can only /z/ work in that division , and in that alone . They are thus permitted to have only the thirty-second part of an idea of the business in. which they are employed . The American labourer , starting in life with his common school education , soon understands all the divisions of the manufacture . His intelligence embraces the principles of the machinery , to accomplish any required result . He sees and readily improves defects , and he becomes an inventor as a part of his daily occupation . It is from such first causes , America is now distinguished in the civilized world , as a people remarkable for their inventive capacities and great readiness to furnish machinery of every kind . The machine shops of Lowell , Rhode Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged executing orders for Russia , Germany , Belgium and Holland . Russia has this year ( 1845 ) taken seven million pounds of American cotton to be worked up at Moscow and St. Petersburgh , on her American machinery . Learning wisdom , she too , takes her cotton duty free as a raw material , while she has added fifty per cent , to her previous duties , on the manufactures of other countries , which do not make commercial arrangements with her , on principles of equality in trade . Russia learned where supplies could be had , and made her first orders on America for cotton machinery in 1837 . Free trade England then had her laws , providing fine , and imprisonment for all concerned with forfeiture of machinery and vessel , aiding in any attempt to export machinery . To countervail American enterprise in those new markets for American machinery , she has since repealed those laws . A new spinning machine or throstle frame on exhibition , for turning out cotton thread , was then alluded to , and the improvement it has introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by a new arrangement of the spindles a superior accuracy , quality of work , and speed are obtained . ( He here exhibited a skein of thread . ) This skein of 840 yards , and being 300 to the pound , is equal to 143 miles of thread from one pound of cotton : a signal triumph of machine over hand labour . He pointed to the Telescope in exhibition explained its properties of American materials and manufacture its price $500 equal in its powers to those imported , which cost $2,000 . He then said the machine for drilling and blasting rocks was one of usefulness but pointed to the hoisting machine for lifting burthens , especially in lading or unlading vessels , and storing goods in upper lofts ; as a most signal specimen of labor-saving machinery . Speaking of the display of cut glass , from all parts , he was led to notice some recent remarkable instances of Southern awakening in the cause of manufactures ; and he reasoned from the statistics of Lowell , and other manufacturing towns , as to the dependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; by the way of encouragement to the south in the good work . He said agriculture could /z/ not prosper , till the prior prosperity of manufactures and commerce , to create consumers and provide a market . The farmer and mechanic now understand their own good ; one to raise grain , another to make iron , one to manufacture cloth , another leather ; and thus in the various pursuits , to go on harmoniously , for the common prosperity . He spoke of the very excellent specimens of sheet iron on exhibition , equal to the English , and were in competition with the best Russia . He pointed to some iron castings , and said the pattern or form , once obtained , the castings were made at about four cents a pound , and in the whole at a cost of not many more cents than the dollars asked for the imported ones . Away , said he , with the importation of the necessaries of life from abroad ! ( Great applause . ) Let it be here said , lest it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ought to be made a part of common school teaching , to better fit the pupils for mechanic trades . On the desideratum of making machinery so necessary to work the raw material , alluding to the different interests thus benefited , the speaker happening to mention " the pipe-layers , " a great laugh was raised , which the speaker took in good part . The price of the articles thus made was lessened one quarter , and one half ( he said ) since the competition commenced . ( Applause . ) And not only in iron , but in glass manufactures and others . Certificates to this effect were read from different producers , of which the following is one , from M. and T. SWEENEY , manufacturers of glass at Wheeling , Va . " They say during the years ' 41 and part of ' 42 our flint glass manufactory was idle , owing to the want of business resulting from the reduction of the tariff under the Compromise Act , so that our hands were idle for some eighteen or twenty months . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again put our works in operation , and have been since making all the glass our factory is capable of producing ; and we are now selling our glass at twenty-five per cent , less than we did at the adoption of the tariff of ' 42 , and we believe the deduction has been general over the country . " He alluded to the raising of the Great Britain on the floating dry dock in this city , which dock he said was first presented to the American Institute for competition , and received its sanction . Yes ! a son of the soil of Great Britain near me justly observes , America has taken Great Britain in her arms , and lifted her out of trouble . ( Vociferous applause , long continued . ) General TALLMADGE then held up a piece of Osnaburg , manufactured in Charleston , South Carolina , and hailed it as a proof of a wakening up in the cause of manufactures even in that " free trade " State of the Union . ( Cheers . ) Wool and wollens next occupied his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , which he hailed as a triumphant feature of the year 's production in this country . Then came silk , of which he gave a very encouraging report . He men- /z/ tioned the $1,000 premium of MYNDERT VAN SCHAICK for the cultivation of silk , amidst much applause . Apropos of the bells of Mr. MENEELY , of Troy . The speaker remarked that he did not allude to those fair ones in the gallery of the bells from this foundry , the largest in the United States , weighing 8,125 pounds , has just been suspended in the observatory in this city , and the proprietor informs us that no less than seven hundred , of various weights , made by him , are now used as church bells in this state alone . An allusion to old Kentucky drew down thunders of applause , which was increased to a deafening and long protracted series of cheers and shouts , when the specimen of hemp , raised on the farm of HENTRY CLAY , was held up to view . On showing some silk bonnets , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country which produced the material for such works others love the girls that make them . Loud laughter and cheers . Miss STONE 'S horsehair bonnet , invented and made by herself , elicited great applause . The steam engine by which the machinery of the Fair has been carried on : the lithographs of ENDICOTT ; the fireworks of EDGE , were then in turn touched on , followed by allusions to other articles , in more or less detail . He gave an interesting account of the way in which our manufacturers make cheap veneered door knobs and table tops , so as to equal the costly imported ones , and explained the process by which this home competition begets cheap production , and makes the article cheap . So with a thousand other articles . The display of the working bees , and of their delicious production , excited a great deal of interest . The ploughing and spading matches were then alluded to with great minuteness and unction . The show of fruits and flowers , with the caveat that they were only to be looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. WALKER , of Boston , and Mr. BRIDGEMAN , of New-York , who had taken charge of the floral and horticultural department . Mr. UNDERBILL , of Croton Point , in this connection , received a fitting tribute , for his splendid grapes ; and a long list of horticultural productions were all shown up in order , with some very pleasant remarks . He adverted to the attacks made in some papers on the purposes , conduct and management of the Institute , which he indignantly contradicted .
