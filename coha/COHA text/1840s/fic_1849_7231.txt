When Henry Maudsley arose from a brief and feverish slumber , upon the morning following the May-day revels , he was for some time at a loss to determine whether the strange events of the preceding evening had not all been a delusion and a dream . The wild accents of the mysterious youth who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still haunting his imagination , but who the stranger was , whence he derived such singular knowledge of his own history and most secret thoughts , and for what reason he had conceived so lively an interest in his welfare , it was beyond his power to imagine . " She shall yet be thine , Harry Maudsley , " the promise uttered by that melodious voice still rang in his ear . As he repeated the words mechanically to himself , lifting his hands as he did so towards his head , he suddenly felt something unusual about his throat . What was his surprise , as he sprang forward to the light , to find suspended from his neck the very golden chain which he had seen Esther present to Gardiner at the conclusion of that fatal interview which had so lately destroyed his dearest hopes ! He gazed at the glittering relic , emblem of the perfidy of one for whom he could have found it in his heart to forfeit both earth and heaven , in speechless bewilderment . He clasped it to his heart for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck and dashed it to the ground with the fury of a madman . Suddenly he recollected more of the mysterious words of his late companion . He remembered the bold prophecies with which the stranger had flattered his heart ; he remembered the promise that a proof of his power should be displayed to him upon the dawn of this very morning , and behold already the glittering pledge was there . The mystery now was more perplexing than ever . It was almost impossible for him to resist the conviction that he was the victim of some magic spell . Witchcraft could alone account for the mysteries which were spread over him like a net . And to what end had these subtle sorceries been woven ? What was to be the issue of the strange and twilight companionship which had suddenly sprang up between himself , and , as it seemed to him , this shadowy wanderer from some unknown world ? Were his purposes good or evil ? Was he abusing the mystic power which he possessed over his mind , to lead him to destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him as he stood upon a fearful precipice , to warm him of his danger , and to lead him back into the paths of happiness whence he had wandered so far ? Was Esther likewise subject to the influence of this mocking spirit ? ' T was mystery all . Again he lifted the chain from the ground , and gazed long and anxiously upon it , as if he would examine every slender link till he learned wherein lay concealed the heart of its mystery . But the chain revealed not the secrets of the magician , although it indeed seemed endowed with a magic of its own . For an instant , as he dwelt upon the pure image of Esther , he felt that he could have prostrated himself before her as at the feet of an enshrined saint , and have expiated his unworthy and degrading thoughts with repentant tears . Had he worshipped her so long as if she really dwelt in a purer sphere than his own stormy world , and was he now to disown all the past ? Was not this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all devised as a fiery ordeal to test the truth of his devotion ? ' T was impossible that there could be one spark of sympathy between two such characters as those of Esther and Sir Christopher Gardiner . More delicate and sensitive than the Venetian goblet , the crystal purity of her character would instinctively reject the subtle poison of that artful mind . He would seek her presence once more ; once more he would pour out his heart to her , and , what his pride had hitherto forbidden , he would lay his destiny in her hands and swear that his future life should be guided by her own wishes . Thus struggling against his convictions , hoping against his hopes , the heart of Maudsley was tossed to and fro upon a stormy sea of passion and of doubt . Then his eyes again fell upon the fatal chain . The snake-like smile of Gardiner , as he stood in the twilight of that eventful evening , again flashed upon his memory . Again the words of the mysterious unknown recurred to him , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a chain . ' T was strange indeed , he thought , as he gazed upon that fragile plaything , that the fate of so many beings should be entangled in those slight and golden meshes . It so happened that the earnest enthusiasm of Esther 's character had just began to awaken a corresponding emotion in his own breast , even at the moment when all his hopes had been dashed to the earth . He had made his way originally to New England with but one object . He was determined , if possible , to tear Esther from the life of gloomy solitude to which she had so fanatically devoted herself . He had been baffled . His stormy nature vainly dashed itself against the placid but unyielding enthusiasm of her character , as the wild surge dissolves in foam against the marble cliff . The estrangement which had resulted from the ill success of his violent entreaties and reproaches , would have proved but temporary . The love inspired by such a woman could not be uprooted like a worthless weed . On the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion a thousand fold , for enthusiasm is apt to inspire respect , even where it fails to elicit sympathy . The wild scenes into which he had plunged , to bury , if possible , the recollection of his love  --  the profligate and fantastic creatures who had surrounded him like a horde of unholy spirits , had produced a strange and sudden effect upon his mind . His nature , although not fickle , was impressionable . All that surrounded him in the wilderness was odious , and his heart panted after the serene image of Esther with a renewed and redoubled devotion , as if her presence alone could give light to this dreary and desolate land  --  could exorcise the evil demons who seemed ravening for him as their prey . His mind was indeed beginning to awaken to a deeper appreciation of her lofty character . The contrast between the purity of her life and the unhallowed ribaldry in the midst of which he had lately dwelt , had spoken to him in trumpet tones . His heart was softened , his pride humbled , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a durable impression , perhaps at their very next interview . Deep was already calling unto deep , and from the profoundest recesses of his heart , there had arisen at last an answering murmur to her own . It was at this very point that the great misfortune befell him . A few hours before his presence at the fatal interview between Gardiner and Esther , and he knew not what sacrifices he was not prepared to make . He was ready to lay himself at her feet , to implore her guidance along his benighted path . And now he would indeed see her once more . He was impelled towards her irresistibly ; but alas ! who should say in what such an interview might result ? Upon the afternoon of the same day he found himself at the residence of the Ludlows . Walter was seated under a tree in the neighborhood of the house , lost , apparently , in one of those pensive reveries which were habitual with him . Maudsley looked anxiously around for Esther , but she did not at that moment appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not unwilling to gain a little time to collect his scattered thoughts . " The heats of summer are already upon us , " said he , accosting Ludlow . " Aye , " said Ludlow , acknowledging Maudsley 's salutation , " the climate of New England is more intense and more exciting than that of our own land . It is , however , to be considered fortunate that the approaching colony will not arrive like the early Plymouth settlers in the very midst of a rigorous winter , but that some few months will be afforded them to make preparations for withstanding the winter 's siege . But I cry you pardon , Master Maudsley , I believe you feel but little sympathy with the matter to which I allude . " " Not perhaps so lively a sympathy , " answered Maudsley , " as that which is felt by one who is near and dear to you . It might have been  --  but no , the time is past , the feeling dead . I have sought you , Master Ludlow , to inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you in England , " concluded he abruptly . " And do you purpose returning thither ? " answered Ludlow . " Such is my intention ; " replied Maudsley . " I regret , " continued Ludlow , " that no spark of sympathy hath been awakened in your bosom for the sacred cause . There was a time when I had hoped , that in the pure and fervent sentiment which seemed to bind you to the destinies of one very dear to me , there might be found an element of a still more elevated emotion . I grieve to think that this should be all past , Master Maudsley ; but I have no disposition and no right to read your heart . " " The heart of man is inscribed with strange hieroglyphics , " answered Maudsley , " and happy is he who possesses the key to read the mysteries of his own . For myself , I hardly hazard a conjecture at what may be passing within the souls of those around me , when I find it so difficult to understand my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , Master Ludlow , yet wo to him who would tear the grinning masks from the features of his companions . " " You are almost oracular this evening , " answered Ludlow , somewhat perplexed by the singular humor in which his companion seemed to be indulging ; " but to recur to what I before observed , I regret extremely to find that no change hath come over your soul , for sooth to say , I had fondly anticipated some such event . ' T is a disappointment to me , Henry Maudsley , for I felt a warm confidence that the bright morning of religious relevation was really about to dawn upon you . Nay , after the extraordinary conversion of the proud and ambitious knight , it seemed not fantastic to hope for a similar change in so muclr younger and fresher a soul . " " To whom do you allude ? " cried Maudsley , with a sudden start . " To one whom men call Sir Christopher Gardiner , " was the reply . " And is he , indeed , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Maudsley , governing his emotion by a violent effort , and speaking with perfect calmness . " Aye , he is , indeed , a striking and living testimonial of grace , " answered Ludlow . " I have had long and intimate interviews with him . Without revealing to me the details of his past life , he hath confessed to me that he hath been but little better than one of the wicked . But the Lord hath revealed himself to him suddenly , and at the dead of night . The very hour and moment of his new birth he has been able to fix with singular precision . I have a firm conviction that this erring man hath made already a comfortable progress in grace , nor do I entertain any doubt of his final justification . " " Indeed , " said Maudsley , with an imperceptible sneer , and still speaking with forced composure , " indeed it rejoiceth my heart exceedingly to hear such comforting assurances of one , of whom I had scarcely expected such tidings . If Sir Christopher Gardiner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his residence in the wilderness is likely to be a protracted one , I may surely congratulate you upon such a valuable acquisition as his habitual companionship must be . " " Aye , " answered Ludlow , dropping his voice , and speaking in a confidential tone , " and I have even hopes that the intimacy between us may be hallowed and cemented by a still closer bond of union . You have known me well enough , Master Maudsley , to be certain that it was for a long time the dearest wish of my heart , that the union , which at one time seemed a most likely event , between my sister and yourself , might sooner or later be arranged . Without having been entirely in your confidence , I have , however , at last arrived at the knowledge that Providence , from the first , hath not ordained such a consummation . I am , however , very conscious of the defects of my own character . I can at times look clearly upon the position of Esther and myself ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proceed , Walter Ludlow , " answered Maudsley , waving his hand impatiently . " It is then desirable , as you will easily admit , " continued the other , " that Esther should have a protector and a companion . How long I may remain a sojourner in this weary world , I know not , but I am at best but a wayfarer and a pilgrim , and it is not right nor fitting that she should thus devote her existence to one whose path is every through the valley of dark shadows . I repeat it , Esther needs a protector and companion , and such I believe I have at last found for her . You see , I speak with perfect frankness , Master Maudsley . " " I am honored by your confidence , " replied Maudsley , speaking calmly , but in tones so hoarse and unnatural , that almost any one but Ludlow must have been struck by them , " and I am to understand then that the protector and companion so desired for Esther Ludlow , hath at last been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even so , " answered Ludlow quietly . " To me , the adventures of his past life , whatever they may have been , are as nothing , for I feel an earnest conviction that he is a regenerate man , within whom the Lord hath vouchsafed to renew a right spirit . I believe you have but a slender acquaintance with the worthy knight , Maudsley ? " " Death and furies , " muttered Maudsley , who still stood there with wonderful composure , while the blind and dreaming dotard was searing his nerves as with red-hot irons , " am I to endure these tortures forever ; pray Heaven he may not urge me to use my influence with Esther in favor of her new suitor and protector ! Aye , " continued he aloud , in reply to Ludlow 's question , " my acquaintance with the worthy knight is but slender , but I trust that an opportunity will soon be afforded me to improve it . He is not at present sojourning in the immediate neighborhood , I believe . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarrying , for certain private reasons , at New Plymouth . But he is expected to return to his old residence before many days . I am glad to find you disposed to improve your friendship with him . " " Trust me , " answered Maudsley , grinding his teeth and speaking in almost sepulchral tones , " I am only too anxious for an opportunity . May death alone separate us afterwards ! " Ludlow elevated his eyebrows slightly , as he listened to what he considered the somewhat exaggerated expressions of Maudsley , but he was very far from suspecting what was really passing in his heart . He was indeed one of those who are incapable of reading the most common events which pass around them , to whom the souls of their immediate companions are as sealed volumes , and who are therefore thoroughly incapable of sympathizing with or of benefitting those who are nearest and dearest to them , even with the warmest and purest intentions . If Maudsley had remembered the character of his companion , if he had reflected upon the profound ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those around him , he would perhaps have appreciated more justly the value of the singular communications which had just been made to him . But he was at the moment the slave of passion , and the whispers of reason were powerless . His soul , upon reaching the residence of Esther , had been filled with the most conflicting emotions . The slow , hesitating communication of Ludlow was the match to the mine . He had , however , governed himself , and the simple-minded Ludlow possessed not the smallest knowledge of the tempest which was raging in his companion 's bosom . " You will find Esther in her garden , I believe , " said Ludlow , with sudden abruptness , " and it is fitting that you should confer with her before your departure , which it grieveth me to hear you announce as so imminent . A few letters , however , I may possibly desire to intrust you with . For the present , I crave your pardon for retiring ere the daylight be spent , for I have left a task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find you at our humble evening meal . " With this Walter Ludlow suddenly entered the house , leaving Maudsley almost overwhelmed . The evening was dreamy and delicious . Even at that early period of the summer , a few fireflies were already flitting over the moist fields , looking like disembodied spirits , as they fitfully shone , disappeared , and again twinkled into existence , hovering gently and noiselessly over the damp earth . The shades of evening were gathering , as Maudsley , advancing a few steps from the spot where Ludlow had left him , suddenly saw Esther approaching from the garden . In spite of all his resolution , and notwithstanding the time that had been afforded him for collecting his thoughts , his heart , which had been beating violently , seemed to stand stock-still . His coward blood seemed to retreat upon its citadel , and his whole frame shivered . It was passing strange . But a moment before , and he had felt as if he could have bidden her farewell without the quivering of a nerve . He gazed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes wilfully to the precipice upon which he was standing , and forgot his stormy past , his dreary future , reckless of all except his idolatrous and irrepressible love . The lava torrent which had overwhelmed his existence had spared one single flower , and with the calm avarice of despair , he slowly plucked it as it grew there upon the edge of desolation . He stood still , and gazed upon Esther , who was not yet aware of his presence , as if in this , his last interview , he would crowd into one brief moment the rapture and the agony of years . Never had she seemed more beautiful . As she stood there , surrounded by the dark and solemn scenery of the forest , where the murmuring pine and the time-hallowed oak mingled their shadows in the advancing twilight , she seemed like some fabled forest spirit , some fountain-haunting Egeria , some rapt and mysterious priestess , suddenly arisen in the silent wilderness to embody the softest dreams of poetry . Esther started , as , upon drawing nearer , she perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the thoughts of this approaching interview . Although it was impossible for her to forget the past , and although she felt that the feelings which had , as it were , grown with her growth , could never be eradicated from her bosom , yet she had taken her resolution . She had long felt convinced that it was an unfortunate destiny which had thus entangled , as it were , rather than united , the existences of two persons whom Heaven had created so unlike in character and opinion . The bright hopes which she had conceived for the future , in the midst of her joy at the sudden appearance of her lover in the wilderness  --  the conviction which had been forced upon her , of the earnestness and depth of that passion , which had impelled him to pursue her thus across the world  --  had all been destroyed and buried in the disappointment which she felt as she discovered that he still remained unchanged . She greeted him coldly , but without embarrassment . " We meet again , Esther Ludlow , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " we meet once more , and for the last time . " " The last time ! " answered Esther , with a trembling voice . " Aye , " answered Maudsley , gloomily . " What hath such an one as I to do in this wilderness . The prize for which I fondly strove has been snatched from my eager grasp . Surely none knoweth better than Esther Ludlow that this desert is no place for me . " " ' T is true , " she answered , mistaking his meaning , and speaking with greater firmness . " This gloomy desert is no place for one so light-hearted and so impetuous as yourself . Truly , I marvelled much when you appeared so suddenly in this distant world . I marvel less that you have so soon grown weary of it . " " You know too well , " resumed Maudsley , " why I am in this wilderness , but you know not how utterly and absolutely I was ready to lay myself at your feet . When I remonstrated with your determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cherished projects ; even then I felt the influence of what seemed your sublime enthusiasm stealing over my heart . " " Is this indeed true , Henry Maudsley ? " interrupted Esther , with a rapturous expression of countenance . " Even then , " continued Maudsley , in the same gloomy tone , without noticing the interruption , " even then I felt a strange influence subduing my nature . How it was I knew not , and cared not , but it seemed to me that an exalting ecstasy had suddenly mingled with and hallowed my earthly passion , when in one fatal moment the spell was rudely broken . " " You speak indeed in parables , " interrupted Esther , once more gazing upon him with an expression of wonder . " And yet I am no prophet nor soothsayer , " answered her lover , " but a weak , deluded , erring fool . Whence , and of what nature , was the sublime vision which seemed at one moment to have swept over my senses ? Was it a subtle poison distilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my very being by the dark magic of a woman 's eyes ? And was this , only this to be the result of my enraptured trances , which I mistook for the presence of the divine spirit ? " " Henry Maudsley , " said Esther with calmness , " so far as I can discover the meaning of your mysterious language , you have dared to couple the term of treachery with my name . " " Aye , " answered Maudsley , still speaking like a man in a dream , " aye , ' t was indeed a rude awakening , but better thus than that the dark poison should have quite overpowered my senses ; and yet , who would dare even to believe his senses ? who would not rather brand them as liars and slanderers , than reject the record which an angel 's pencil hath written . " " Henry Maudsley ! " cried Esther , in an accent of despair , for it suddenly flashed upon her , as she listened to this utterly incomprehensible language , that her lover 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of God look not thus wildly upon me . Look me in the face , if you have ever loved me , and tell me in plain language what is this dreadful mystery which seems to cast a shadow over your mind ? " " My suspicions may be baseless , " he continued , " pray God they prove so ! for your welfare even now is dearer to me than my heart 's blood . Remember this , however , else one day the reflection may flash upon you , like lightning from the dark clouds , which seem gathering over both your life and mine . Remember this , " continued he , looking fixedly upon her , " that with all his faults and follies , Henry Maudsley was no hypocrite . May God protect you from the inextricable snares of hypocrisy ! " " Hypocrisy , Master Maudsley ! " exclaimed Esther , with flashing eyes , " do you dare to charge me with hypocrisy ? " " God forbid , Madam ! " was the reply . " I know your spirit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocrisy , but I meant not that the hypocrisy was in your own heart . Less than I have said , I could not say ; more , I have neither claim nor wish to say . Farewell , Esther Ludlow , farewell forever . ' T is a word which I came hither to speak , and now ' t is spoken . But one word more , and my task is accomplished . Whatever betide us both , now that we are forever separated , believe me that I have forgiven you . Believing this , you may yet trust to the sincerity of a heart which has been wholly yours . Should that dark day come , as sooner or later my soul prophecies it must , when Esther Ludlow shall require a friend in her utmost need , remember that there is one , if he still exists upon the earth , will cross sea and land , and encounter every danger to avert evil from her head . " " ' T is time that this strange and inexplicable scene should cease , " answered Esther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed with wonder at what seemed to her the insulting and outrageous demeanor of her companion . " To what hypocritical snares you allude in such a mysterious manner , I know as little as I do the nameless crimes for which you forgive me with such strange magnanimity . I thank you truly for the confidence which you still place in my character , although I think it would be more kindly exhibited if you would deal more frankly with me . Your riddles are all beyond my intelligence , and seem to me unworthy of yourself . For your generous offer of assistance in the time of trouble , I thank you , but I trust never to be so utterly forlorn , as to require the protection of one who hath been so unjust and so insulting . " With these words , which she uttered with great dignity of manner , although her eyes were blinded with tears , Esther was turning from the spot , when Maudsley hastily detained her . " But one moment , Esther . I answer not one word to your reproaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand here in the midst of a wild and mysterious world , whose superstitions we know not , the spiritual tenants of whose forests we know not . That there are spirits , whether of good or evil , who haunt these solemn and sequestered scenes , I know , for I have myself communed with such . But this is from my purpose . I designed to leave with you a pledge of my promise . Despise that promise , if you will  --  the day may come when you may lack a true and loyal friend . Should that day arrive , look on this chain , and remember Harry Maudsley . And now , farewell , farewell , Esther Ludlow . " As he uttered these concluding words , he suddenly flung the mysterious chain around Esther 's neck , and , with a hasty stride , disappeared into the twilight shadows of the forest . CHAPTER II . THE ESCAPE . The expectations of Sir Christopher Gardiner had indeed been proved to be well founded . The lord of Merry-Mount had at last rendered himself so obnoxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproarious proceedings during the May-day festival had been deemed so outrageous , that at last they had determined to eject him from the colony . Their aversion to him was no doubt mainly founded upon his hostility to their religious tenets , and upon his rantipole mode of life , which was necessarily shocking to their rigid manners . Besides this , he was supposed to be engaged in certain mysterious plots , contrary to the interest and comfort of the Puritanic settlers . He was , moreover , openly accused of dangerous dealings with the Indians , and in particular of supplying them with fire-arms , and teaching them the use thereof , which , according to a proclamation of King James , was an offence against the laws of England . As for the merry potentate himself , he stoutly maintained that the only crime of which he was guilty was that of being more skilful and successful than they in his trading with the savages , particularly in the beaver trade , which superiority he himself attributed to his better knowledge of the Indian language and character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exert over their minds . According to himself , he was ever upon the most friendly and harmonious terms with his dusky neighbors , and he repeatedly asserted that he had received infinitely more kindness and hospitality from the heathen than he ever did from the Christian inhabitants of New England . Envy of his own success was in his opinion the main cause of the grudge which the Plymouth people bore him , and the main reason why they had at last determined upon open hostilities against him . Although he had , as we have seen , been repeatedly warned of his danger , yet the reckless buoyancy of his character had led him to place but little faith in the evils which impended over him , so that he had in the very time of danger conducted himself like a most unskilful general , and a most impolitic monarch . His forces , which should have been concentrated at his own capital , to protect him against the threatened invasion , were unhappily engaged in distant forays far away in the interior , and the sovereign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from his palace , suddenly confronted and made a prisoner by his most redoubtable enemy . The apparition of Captain Standish had been so sudden and so unexpected , and the capture of Morton so instantaneous , that it seemed almost as if the Plymouth hero had really been possessed of some of the marvellous attributes ascribed to him by the lunatic , who had just disappeared into his cave . There was something too , in the savage scene around  --  in the wild and fitful appearance of the threatening sky , in the distant mutterings of the thunder , the stifling atmosphere , and the unnatural light which was streaming from the sky long after the shadows of evening should have covered the earth , which might have inspired a lively or a timorous imagination with a sensation of awe . There stood the famous captain , armed to the teeth , with uplifted sword and threatening eye , motionless as a statue ; and there stood the luckless Morton , with his arms securely pinioned , and surrounded by half a dozen stout fellows , suddenly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just been scoffing . Morton stood stock-still , looking at the calm and immovable image before him , and for a moment could not but believe himself the victim of a horrid night-mare . ' T was impossible that it could be real . He had heard no footsteps , seen no movement in the thickets , not a leaf had rustled . These six armed men , with that dreaded commander at their head , had risen out of the earth to daunt him . ' T was an invention of the evil one . He had the night before seen the portentous vision of the flaming sword in heaven . It had not moved his soul  --  why should this terrestrial vision appal him ? " Aroint thee , Sathanas ! " said he at last , striving as it were to arouse himself from a dream . " Aroint thee , evil one , and keep thy bugbears to frighten madmen and children withal . I fear them not , they move me not . Justum et tenacem proposi '  --  " " By the Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it be , ' t is a damned obstinate and chronic one of its kind , " added he upon finding , after struggling and shaking himself very vigorously , that the armed phantoms did not fade away , and that he was still retained in durance by his captors . " Thy struggles are useless , thou foolish mischief-maker , " said Standish , speaking at last , although still remaining in the same motionless attitude . " Thou art my prisoner , and if thou inclinest to retain that giddy head upon thy shoulders , I would earnestly recommend submission . " " So , the ghost hath a tongue as well as a sword , hath he ? " said Morton to himself , in a low , bewildered tone . " And yet , truly , I heard his voice before , but ' t was then a fancy of my brain , I thought . By Jupiter , Son of Saturn , here is a pretty predicament for a sachem and a sovereign ; " and with this , he relapsed again into meditation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversary . Miles Standish , who thus confronted the Lord of Merry-Mount , was as small of stature as he was heroic in spirit . Scarcely elevated above the dimensions of a dwarf , he yet possessed so well knit and muscular a frame , that no man who looked upon him , much less one who had seen or felt the vigor of his arm , but would have almost preferred an encounter with a giant than a contest with this small but intrepid hero . His countenance was bronzed with exposure , his features were bold and martial , and his eye was full of fire . Although he was not much past middle age , his temples were bare and his beard grizzled . He was at this moment arrayed in the military costume of the period , and wore a round iron morion , with a narrow rim , upon his head ; a cuirass and back-plece of steel , a doublet and hose of tawny leather , and held a long double-edged sword in his hand . His six followers , who were picked men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive armor . They were morever armed with long , heavy snaphances , or matchlocks , held long forked staffs , which were called rests , in their left hands , while from their left shoulders and across their chests were suspended broad bandileers , holding a string of charges for their muskets , contained in small tin cylinders . It was very evident that they were out upon an expedition which was considered serious and important . As for Captain Standish , enough was known by Morton of his character and history , to give him ample assurance that he was not a personage to be trifled with . Although the master of Merry-Mount was very prone , when at his own palace and among his own adherents , to indulge in various witticisms at the expense of the pigmy of Plymouth , yet in his heart he well knew that he was a most intrepid champion and a most dangerous adversary . Miles Standish was indeed one of the most striking and picturesque characters which appear upon the first and most heroic page of New England 's annals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in England , and the legal heir to the family estates , which had at last devolved upon him as the head of the family , but which were surreptitiously and unjustly detained from him , he had become wearied of prosecuting his claims amid the thousand obstacles interposed by unjust power and the law 's chicanety . He had sought and acquired honorable distinction in the pursuit of arms . He had served with distinction in the Low Countries , in the army which Elizabeth had sent to assist the struggling Hollanders , and after the truce he had served with honor upon other battle-fields . He had made the acquaintance of the pilgrims of Robinson 's company , while sojourning at Leyden , and when the emigration to America was resolved upon , he had either volunteered or received an invitation to associate himself with them . Although no rigid Puritan himself , and not a member of their church , his sympathies had been entirely enlisted in their cause , and he had sailed with them in the Mayflower . From the first moment when these poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the intrepid Standish had proved a most invaluable assistant to them . His bravery , military experience , iron pertinacity of purpose , insensibility to fatigue and privation of every kind , were qualities which constituted him a most admirable champion and military leader for this small and feeble colony in their dangerous enterprise . Always foremost in every expedition , whether to explore the country , to treat with the savages , or to give them battle when they were disposed to hostility , he was equally serviceable at home in laying out their town , constructing their fortifications , and training and disciplining the colonists in the use of arms . Considering himself the military servant of the company , he had accepted , without hesitation , the expedition which had been determined upon against the troublesome master of misrule , as the Puritans designated the Lord of Merry-Mount , and had taken with him six trained and trusty fellows , in whose conduct and valor he most confided . Although it was supposed that Morton had a very considerable body of adherents domesticated near him , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to take possession of his strong hold and to secure his person . With about the same number , Standish had crushed the great Indian conspiracy , and quelled forever the spirit and the hostility of the Massachusetts savages . It was by pure accident that Standish , upon his way by sea to Merry-Mount had paused at Wessaguscus , and by a still more singular accident that he had chanced then and there to find all alone and unprotected the object of his search . Proceeding towards his pinnace , from which the party had disembarked during a calm , Standish , who was in advance of his followers , had heard voices through the thicket along which he was passing . With his usual caution and readiness , he had enjoined silence and secrecy upon his companions , and had crept , unperceived by the unsuspecting Morton , close to the spot from whence the voices issued . There , to his no small astonishment and gratification , he had suddenly beheld the well-known form of the sovereign of Merry-Mount , quietly conversing with the miserable , crack-brained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon trifling and indifferent matters . At a nod of their commander , his followers had noiselessly surrounded and captured their prize , as we have already seen , at the very moment when a jesting and contemptuous allusion to Captain Standish was falling from his lips . Morton had stood gazing for a few moments in utter bewilderment at this sudden and unexpected apparition , but was slowly obliged to acknowledge that it was , indeed , no vision of his imagination . " By Jupiter Diespiter , " muttered he to himself , " this is the valorous Shrimp in propria person , and with a lobster 's shell on his back , armed in proof , and making night hideous . I think ' t is no vision after all . Most valiant gentleman , " continued he suddenly aloud , and addressing himself to his enemy , " would it be presumptuous to inquire whether you are in reality the illustrious Captain Miles Standish , " ( it did not seem at that moment natural to call him Captain Shrimp , ) " or merely some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " answered the person addressed , " is probably as well known to thyself as to me . That I am here in substantial flesh and blood , hath been sufficiently made known to thee already . Furthermore , I would request thee to spare me thy stale witticisms . We of Plymouth have but small relish for the buffoonery which is so rampant at Merry-Mount . And I would , moreover , advise thee to collect what reason thou mayest possess in that crazy brain of thine , that thou mayest be better prepared than at present thou seemest , to answer the interrogatories of the grave fathers of Plymouth . " " Truly , most valiant captain , " answered the crest-fallen Morton , " I have not , at this present time and tide , the smallest intention to seek the society of those grave and respectable personages . Therefore , it would hardly seem necessary in me to prepare answers to any catechism with which it might be their desire to indulge me . " " But I tell thee , " answered Standish , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is many days older , whether it be thy intention or inclination to visit them or no , for it is most assuredly my intention to escort thee thither , with as brief a delay as may be . " " This , then , is what I should term enforced hospitality , " answered the other , " for which I shall be likely to render but little gratitude . You have basely and surreptitiously obtained command of my person , contrary to the laws of the English realm , under whose protection I presume that I dwell , even in this Ultima Thule , or , for thy better apprehension , in this remote wilderness . The majesty of the law is not to be trifled with , Master Standish , and evil consequences may alight on the heads of those who dare to be guilty of so grave an offence . I warn thee to detain me at thy own peril . " " I am no pettifogger , Master Morton , " answered Standish , " and I have neither ability nor inclination to argue legal points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite skill enough to read and to understand my orders . Those orders are to assure myself of thy person at all hazards , and to bring thee presently to the plantation of New Plymouth , and those orders , look you , I purpose to execute . " " And by what authority , may it please your most arbitrary captainship , " answered Morton , " do you dare thus to lay violent hands upon an unoffending subject of his Majesty , King Charles ? " " Truly , as I neither consider myself the prisoner in this instance , " answered Standish , whose quick temper was already ruffled by the cool , complacent , and somewhat ironical demeanor of his captive , " nor thyself as the judge appointed to try the cause between us , I shall no longer brook thy insolence , and I counsel thee to imitate my discretion in this particular , and forthwith to hold thy peace . " " This little chimney is soon fired , " quoth Morton to himself , " a taller one might quietly consume within itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puffing and smoking . I pray the , good Master Standish , " continued he aloud in a more courteous and good-humored tone , " be not so easily inflamed by the natural resentment of a free denizen of the wilderness as well as a loyal subject of his Majesty , at losing his natural birthright of freedom , and , as he humbly conceives , without due cause . I did but purpose to try conclusions with thee upon this matter ; surely it would be no extraordinary stretch of condescension upon thy part , to inform me a little touching the crimes with which I stand charged , and the authority by which I am arrested . " " The squall will soon be upon us , " said Standish , abruptly , to his followers , without heeding the last observation of his prisoner . " We shall hardly expedite our journey by taking to the pinnace to-night . Moreover , as the object of our expedition is already accomplished , and our journey considerably abridged by this fortunate encounter with the merry gentleman , whom we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up our quarters for the night at the ruined fort , whence , with the earliest dawn we will set sail for Plymouth . " The night had , in truth , advanced , as they stood parleying with the prisoner . The atmosphere , however , still retained its lurid glare and its suffocating stillness . The tempest , which was brooding in the distance , still delayed its coming . The place where Morton had been captured , was in an open hollow , surrounded by wooded hills of moderate elevation , and not far from the mouth of the river which gave its name to the abandoned plantation . A difficult pathway , overgrown with brushwood , wound through the ravine , and led to an ancient clearing upon a more elevated plain , where a few scattered and dilapidated huts still stood , the last remnants of the unsuccessful settlement . Thither it was the intention of Captain Standish to conduct his prisoner , because , as he had already informed his companions , the threatening aspect of the weather rendered it advisable to postpone the voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope , securely fastened about his loins , and placed in the immediate custody of two sturdy and grim-faced Puritans , who were expressly ordered to shoot him down , if he offered to make his escape . In this ignominious condition , the Lord of Merry-Mount was obliged to follow close upon the heels of the small hero whom he had so often derided , and who now led the way through the bushes , and along the almost impenetrable pathway , with a firm and rapid step . Morton , whose confidence in himself had not deserted him , and who still nourished hopes of escape from the awkward dilemma in which he found himself , affected the most perfect submission , and followed patiently after his leader , slily testing the strength of the knot , however , as he advanced , and eagerly watching an opportunity to slip out of his noose , and to roll down the side of the hill , when he trusted easily to elude pursuit under cover of the almost impervious thickets . His hunting-knife , which was the only weapon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment of his capture , and he found the knot so securely tied , and the cord so obstinately tough , that all his efforts to loosen or break it proved fruitless . As they were passing , however , through a very deep shade , and along the edge of a somewhat precipitous ledge of granite , he suddenly gave the rope a furious jerk , and threw himself bodily over the sloping precipice . His manoeuvre was only partially successful ; his two sturdy guardians , who had wound the cord securely about their wrists , retained their hold upon him , although they were unable to maintain their balance , upon this sudden and unexpected strain . All three rolled headlong down the precipice , which might have been some twenty or thirty feet in descent , and plunged with a crashing noise into the thick underwood at the base of the rock . One of the matchlocks was harmlessly discharged in the catastrophe , and the three lay for a moment struggling together in the darkness and confusion . Standish , who was a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably occurred , and sprang like a tiger down the cliff , in the direction whence came the confused noise of the struggle . There was light enough remaining , to enable him to observe that the prisoner 's attempt had been unsuccessful , and all the party being already upon their legs again , having sustained no farther damage than a few scratches and bruises in their descent , he ordered them forthwith to make the prisoner 's bonds still more secure , and then to follow round the base of the ledge , till they could ascend again to the narrow pathway which they had lost . " So thou wouldst bid us farewell so soon , " said he , in an angry tone , to his captive . " Trust me , thou knowest little with whom thou hast to deal , or thou wouldst desist from such trifling . I advise thee to follow at my heels quietly for the remainder of thy journey , or I shall send thee on a longer journey at a moment 's warning , and one for which thou art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiser , then , scapegoat ; a further attempt will be fatal to thee . " " Scapegoat in thy teeth , " muttered Morton , considerably vexed , and somewhat battered , by the unsuccessful result of his attempt  --  " scapegoat in thy teeth , thou peppery , waspish , unmannerly drummer 's boy ! A plague upon it , " continued he , in a louder tone , " ' t is bad enough to be bruised in body , by an accidental plunge from yonder precipice , and truly there needs no browbeating in addition . I tell thee I was cast down from the rock against my will , even like the Tarpeian virgin of ancient story , and by the Lord , was I well nigh suffocated by the martial ornaments that were showered down along with me . Escape ! and why , truly , should I care to escape ? What crimes am I charged withal ? Integer vitoe , scelerisque purus , ' et cetera , et cetera . " Muttering and discoursing in this fragmentary and voluble manner , Morton followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquence lost upon Standish , he soon relapsed into solemn silence . No further opportunity for escape presenting itself during the remainder of their brief and rapid tramp through the woods , he soon found himself emerging with his companions into the open plain which was to be the termination of their journey . Though the night was already somewhat advanced , it was not so dark but that Morton could easily note the appearance and bearing of the different objects about him , with which he had long been familiar . There were at that moment , so far as he knew , no tenants in the dismantled and decayed huts which were here and there scattered along the clearing , but within the centre of the plain he knew that there was a larger tenement , which had been kept from time to time in tolerable repair , for the use of the trading and fishing parties who occasionally resorted thither . This was the building which had been designated by Standish as the ruined fort , because it had in truth served as a blockhouse or citadel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now only enough left of it to serve as a tolerable protection against the weather , and although it was never occupied , except temporarily and at distant intervals . Hither , accordingly , the party bent their way , and soon entered the dilapidated tenement . It was a dismal looking edifice enough , although , for a summer 's night , its dismantled and uncomfortable condition was hardly of consequence . The party would naturally have preferred bivouacking in the open air , as was their usual custom upon such expeditions , but as the night threatened to be stormy , and as they had a prisoner to guard , it was thought more advisable to take possession of this building . The house consisted of two rooms , the larger opening directly from the door-way , and the second , which was smaller , communicating only with the first . There was an old oaken bedstead in the inner room , which had accidentally escaped destruction , and was the only piece of furniture in the whole mansion . There was a single narrow and unglazed window placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly the whole of the opposite side was occupied with an immense fire-place , which at that season of the year was not likely to be used . It would have hardly dispensed much comfort , had the weather been colder , as the chimney itself had toppled down at some previous period , making a chasm in the roof , and leaving a large heap of bricks and rubbish scattered over the earthern floor . In this cheerful abode , the whole party were now assembled , and a light being soon struck , and two or three pine torches lighted , Morton was , much to his satisfaction , relieved of his bonds , and allowed to seat himself upon the ground along with the others . None of the party having taken any refreshment since the morning , and their appetites having been sharpened by their rugged march , they now produced their stores of dried bears ' meat of which they invited Morton to partake . He , however , thought proper to decline their proffered hospitality , knowing that fasting would keep him watchful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his leisure the appearance of his new companions . The rude apartment , with its walls and roof formed of naked and smoke-stained rafters , the damp and earthy odor from the clayey floor , and the wild glare of the yellow torchlight , harmonized well with the grim figures who occupied that lonely dwelling . They had disencumbered themselves of their defensive armor , and were all seated in their buff jerkins upon the ground , seeming , with their closely shorn heads , stern features , grizzled beards , and rigid demeanor , about as formidable guardians and uncongenial companions to the merry Lord of Merry-Mount as he could possibly have desired . Their iron head-pieces , corslets and matchlocks were piled together in the centre of the apartment ; the outer door was barred , and one of the soldiers sat with his back planted against it , while the others sat together in a circle . The one who seemed to be the oldest of the party now pronounced a long , enthusiastic prayer , in which a blessing was asked upon the food of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal success which had crowned their expedition , and fervent ejaculations of horror were added at the graceless condition of the profane sinner , whose misdeeds had at last provoked chastisement from the fleshly arm of authority . This preliminary concluded , the party proceeded to devour their food in solemn silence , and for many minutes no sound , save the steady crunching of their iron jaws , disturbed the quiet of the scene . The lively spirit of Morton began to grow impatient at the imperturbable repose which pervaded the assembly . He had determined to fast that he might be more watchful , for he was resolved to make his escape during the night , if the slightest chance for doing so should offer itself . Being , however , of a sociable disposition , not being a whit abashed nor provoked by the very pointed allusions to his own unregenerated condition , contained in the somewhat lengthy exhortation of which he had been an auditor ; feeling , moreover , his spirits recovering their buoyancy as he revolved in his mind a variety of projects for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself upon better terms with his captors , that he might , if possible , disarm their vigilance and thus procure a greater chance of success for his efforts , he was sorry to observe the absolute and rigid silence maintained by the whole party . " Truly a loquacious and cheerful company , " muttered he impatiently to himself . " Madwags , all ! Now , by Jupiter , I could even find it in my heart to request yon granite-faced fellow , who hath been prophesying so much to my discredit , to strike up the hundredth psalm , by way of enlivening the repast . Shade of Heliogabalus ! is it not appalling to witness the steady grinding of provender between those ponderous jaws of theirs . Thank Heaven , they have some signs of grace , still , and I have still hopes of them . He who will moisten his clay a little , however hard baked and rigid it hath become , is not to be despaired of . " This last muttered ejaculation was elicited by observing that as the meal drew near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouches certain round flasks , of comfortable dimensions , which they passed about among each other , occasionally diluting their potations with draughts of water , with which one of the iron head-pieces had been filled from a spring near the house . Morton was briefly invited to partake of this refreshment , and not to appear singular , and to avoid exciting suspicion , he complied , although he prudently refrained from doing more than moisten his lips . Pipes and tobacco were now produced , and upon the whole the party began to assume , in the eyes of Morton , a more favorable aspect . The silence was at last broken by the elderly person who had held forth before supper , and who , after Standish , seemed the most considerable person of the party . " What thinkest thou , brother Standish , of the result of Isaac Allerton 's recent voyage to England ? " said he . " I have had small opportunity to confer with him since his late return , but methinks two hundred pounds at thirty per cent . is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as thou well knowest , " answered Standish , somewhat testily ,  --  for he had , himself , not many years before , been sent upon a financial mission to England , the result of which , as the honest soldier was but little skilled in money matters , was the procurement of one hundred and fifty pounds , for the use of the colonies , at the moderate interest of fifty per cent .  --  " truly I am , as hath been sufficiently proven , but a child in mercantile matters , nor , if the truth were known , do I care to increase my skill , seeing that my profession and natural temper do but slightly fit me for such pursuits . I was born and bred a soldier , Master Neegoose , and am perhaps better fitted to deal with a bear or a Pokanoket savage than a money-changer , whom I take to be a more dangerous animal than either . As for Isaac Allerton , truly I believe that what man could accomplish , he hath done . Thou well knowest , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alone , and of his own free will , to the abode of Massassoit , and I will say that it required no small amount of bravery on the part of one like Master Allerton , not bred to arms , thus voluntarily to venture , as it were , into the lion 's mouth , for nothing was known , at that moment , of the temper and disposition of the red-skins . " " Most true , brother Standish , " answered Neegoose , " I entertain no doubt of Master Isaac 's courage , but even as thou hast thyself but just observed , other qualifications may be necessary to bring about a negotiation of lucre to a hopeful termination  --  " " Well , well , Master Neegoose , " interrupted Standish , who was not much more of a logician than a financier , and who had no inclination to pursue the topic  --  " the negotiations of Master Allerton have doubtless been as successful as my own , and I have small cause to cavil at his proceedings . As for me , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony would have suffered but little loss , had the Turkish corsair , which ran away with the ship which accompanied my own , even taken possession of my unworthy person also , or had the plague , which devoured forty thousand wretches in London during the year of my visit , even swallowed me likewise . So I say again , far be it from me to censure too severely the course of Isaac Allerton . " " Ah , brother Standish , " answered Master Neegoose , " we well know the dangers both of flood and field , which threatened thee during thy voyage , and at London . Well do I remember the lamentations which were loud upon our tongues , when we heard of the fearful pestilence walking by noon-day , to which thy valuable life was exposed . Truly , most thankful were we to the Lord at thy escape , and most devoutly did we sing praises to the God of Jacob that he did deliver our blessed turtle-dove from the multitude of dangers which compassed him around . " The small but truculent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this happening to be the only scriptural quotation which the worthy Neegoose had on hand at the moment , he was obliged to content himself therewith . Having found , moreover , that his worthy captain was not particularly inclined to discuss and criticise the result of Master Allerton 's embassy , which was at the moment the latest topic of interest at New Plymouth , he proceeded to discourse somewhat at length upon the probability of the same gentleman 's being able to procure a patent from the company in England , for the territory which the colony then occupied without permission of the owners . " I am no lawyer , " answered Standish , after listening to a long and somewhat confused harangue upon this topic , from the worthy , but somewhat prosy Abraham Neegoose , " but I will venture to pronounce this opinion , that neither Master Allerton , nor any other agent of the colony , is likely to find a patent for our territory , unless he carry a golden key with him , to unlock the cabinet where they keep such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Henry Rosewell , Sir Richard Saltonstall , and other wealthy and influential knights and gentlemen of the Massachusetts colony , in procuring their patent , and the first ships are even now upon the way . But we of New Plymouth are weak and poor , and must even bide patiently for a season . " " Aye , " answered Master Neegoose , " we are as yet but a handful of corn in the earth upon the top of a mountain , but the fruit thereof shall shake Lebanon . Still it may be that we shall be overshadowed by the new colonists who are speeding hither . ' T is a pleasant country the Massachusetts , and I could wish we had ourselves been seated there . " The comforting fluid had during this conversation been circulating decorously , but freely , and Morton , observing that the rigidity of the company had somewhat thawed , drew nearer , and appeared attentive to the conversation , by which he was apparently much edified . Thankfully accepting the flask which was again handed to him by one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bowing politely to brother Neegoose , he remarked ,  --  " Hunc scyphum tibi propino , which in the vernacular , " added he , upon observing the grim stare with which that respectable individual received this outlandish address , " is , I drink to your very good health , worthy Master Neegoose , and a pleasant ending to an acquaintance so auspiciously begun . " " Firstly , " answered the worthy corporal Neegoose , for such was his rank in the little army of Plymouth , " firstly , I do hold the drinking of healths to be a profane and unnecessary invocation ; secondly , I entertain doubts whether it be lawful for an unregenerate man even to pray in company with the elect , and I feel a conviction that it is unlawful for him to drink in their company ; thirdly , thy whole character and proceedings are distasteful to me , and that thou mayest be sure I have small cause to affect thy society , know that the worthy and pious Faint-not Mellows , whom upon a recent occasion thou diddest so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this being the case , thou mayest suppose that I , even I , am somewhat inclined to resent his wrongs . " " Whew  --  " whistled Morton to himself , at this agreeable piece of information , " I have indeed treed the wrong bear , and had I possessed the smallest suspicion of thy distinguished matrimonial relationship , I would have seen thee damned ere I meddled with thy most grisly saintship . Master Neegoose , " continued he aloud , " touching the third head of thy discourse , and waiving the two preceding as likely to lead us into longer argument than may be desirable at this time and tide , I would even beg leave to inform thee that the worthy and pious Faint-not Mellowes , as you very properly term him , hath received no injury at hands of mine . True he was somewhat disconcerted at the rude gambols of certain waggish retainers of mine , but they meant no mischief , and I have checked and corrected them therefor , and they repent . This leads me once more respectfully to inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , without paying much heed to the conversation between the prisoner and the corporal , was solacing himself with a quiet pipe of tobacco in a corner of the room , " why I have been tied thus by the loins like a monkey , and forcibly haled hither like a colt to a fair , in manner and form altogether derogatory to my dignity , and prejudicial to my comfort ? In short , of what crime , or misdemeanor , am I accused , and by what authority am I thus deprived of my liberty ? " " By the authority of the Governor and Company of New Plymouth , " answered Standish , drily , without taking his pipe from his mouth . " I know no such governor nor any such company , " returned the prisoner . " Thou art likely soon to become better acquainted with them , " answered the captain , " as I purpose to present thee to them within four and twenty hours . " " Aye , " persisted Morton , " but the Governor and Company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves wrongfully occupy , nor royal charter for exercising jurisdiction in any part of New England , or any other portion of the universe . How dare they then intermeddle with a peaceful settler , far removed from their plantation , and forcibly deprive him of his liberty ? " " I am no pettifogger , " answered Standish , " and meddle not with matters not pertaining to my profession . If thou art inclined to argument , my life for it , thou shalt hear reasoning enow from the worthy magistrates themselves , therefore I counsel thee not to waste thy wisdom and thy wit upon me , but to reserve them till they be wanted . " " And I counsel thee , " continued Morton , somewhat nettled at the cool and contemptuous manner of his captor , " and I counsel thee to think twice ere thou carriest out , to its consummation , the foul conspiracy in which thou art engaged . " " And I tell thee , Master Mischief-maker , " answered Standish , " that I have seized thy body , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had ordered me to bring thy head simply , I should have brought thy head , by which proceeding I should have been spared much trouble , besides the necessity of listening to thy tedious and irrelevant discourse . " " Here 's an arbitrary giant , " muttered Morton to himself , " here 's a most hot-headed and hyperbolical Hop-of-my-thumb . A man 's argument against his own kidnapping is tedious and irrelevant forsooth , and I suppose if the tiny little devil had his knife at my weasand , it would be an impertinent pleonasm upon my part to strike it away . " " Master Standish , " continued he aloud , in a very lofty and dignified tone , " it is by no means my intention to quarrel personally with you . I do not purpose to undervalue your strength , your valor , nor even your geometrical height . I am aware that the renowned Wittewamutt , who derided the smallness of your stature , was himself made a head shorter for his insolence . I am aware that you brought home the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keepsake for those gentle employers of yours at New Plymouth . I am , however , well aware also of the motives of this violent assault upon my personal liberty . " " Then why , in the name of Satan , " answered the doughty little hero testily , dashing his pipe upon the earth as he spoke , " then why , in the name of the foul fiend , hast thou asked me so many questions about it ? Being so wise thyself , methinks thou mightest have spared me the din of thy discourse . How much longer , I pray thee , will that damnable tongue of thine be wagging ? " Corporal Neegoose , and the rest of the company looked some-somewhat shocked at the irreverent expressions used by Miles Standish in the first ebullition of his wrath . Being , however , not altogether unused to such demonstrations upon the part of their commander , who was not famous either for moderation of temper , or for puritanic daintiness of language , they looked composedly on , as the choleric soldier strode up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clanking after him at every step , and vented his indignation in a few abrupt sentences . " How long am I to be pestered with thy insolence ? " said he . " Is it not enough that I must be troubled with thy entertainment and transportation to Plymouth , but thou must weary mine ears also with thy endless prating ? How long , I demand again , wilt thou continue to wag that accursed tongue of thine ? " " In sooth , " answered the imperturbable Morton , who rather enjoyed the ill humor of his antagonist ,  --  " in sooth if I wag my tongue , Master Standish , ' t is because I have nothing else to wag . Stood we foot to foott together upon the outside of this dungeon where thou now holdest me cribbed and pent , and were I equipped with a blade as trusty as thine own , perhaps thou mightest find me apt to wag other weapons than my tongue . " At this magnificent effusion of heroism on the part of Morton who would , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wrath of the hot-tempered Standish became quite incontrollable . " By heaven ! " he shouted , as he turned upon his prisoner , like a tiger , " by heaven ! I can hold no longer . This insolence shall be forthwith dealt with . Though the servant of the pious and peaceable pilgrims , I am , perhaps , more of a soldier than a saint , and since thou demandest it , insolent braggart , thou shalt be indeed put to the proof . " As he uttered these words in a voice of thunder , still raging up and down the little room , he made a sudden dart at the pile of arms upon the centre of the floor , apparently with the intention of ferreting out a sword for the express behoof of the Lord of Merry-Mount . That worthy looked a little uncomfortable , as he saw the effect produced by his last sarcasm , but was soon relieved from what might have proved an embarrassing position , by the worthy Neegoose , who now thought it necessary to interfere , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ails thee ? valiant brother Standish , " said he advancing with great solemnity of voice and manner , and endeavoring to calm the impetuosity of Standish , who was pacing about with great vehemence  --  " What ails ye , ye mountains , that ye skip like rams , and ye little hills , like lambs ? ' Why art thou so sorely vexed at the idle and vain buffoonery of him who is little better than as one of the wicked . Bethink thee of thy own position , of thine own character , and the dignity of the grave and reverend magistrates . Forego thy rash intention , and let not the child of Belial gain advantage over us . I pray thee conduct thyself rather like a calm and skilful commander than as a hot-brained man of wrath . " " Truly , Master Neegoose , I believe thou art right , " answered Standish , whose wrath was beginning to cool again , almost as suddenly as it had waxed hot , as he reflected upon the absurdity of his proceeding , and upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus yielding to the dictates of his angry temper . " Truly , thou art right , and I am an ass , a peppery , uncomfortable blockhead , thus to be flouted of my humor by the taunts of a worthless vagabond . " Thus rebuking himself as testily as he had but just now abused his prisoner , the worthy champion of Plymouth seated himself , by a violent effort , plump upon the floor again , and lighting a fresh pipe , began to puff so furiously , that his head was soon enveloped in smoke , and the tempest of his wrath seemed for a time obscured and overcome by the clouds compelled from his pipe . " Well , well , " said Morton , taking up the thread of his discourse , when he saw that this sudden storm had subsided , and that the only danger at present to be apprehended from indulging his license of speech , was merely that the dialogue would prove a soliloquy  --  " well , as I before had the honor to observe , I know well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merry-Mount is a trifle too flourishing ; the beaver trade is a trifle too successful . Ye of New Plymouth were but bears ' whelps once , and I feared ye not ; but ye have grown to be bears now , ( and very gruff and uncomfortable bears ye are too , ) and would eat up all the cakes and honey-combs to be found in Canaan . I know the cause of your high-handed proceedings , and I promise ye the star-chamber shall hear of it before I have done with ye  --  . " " Cease , vain man , from thy idle and frivolous discourse , " said Corporal Neegoose , who , observing that the commander of the party only silently puffed at his pipe with redoubled fury during the continuance of Morton 's disjointed abjuration , thought it necessary to interpose to check the current of the prisoner 's invective . " Let me assure thee , once for all , that thy conspiracies are all discovered , and it shall go hard but that the dissolute nest , which thou with vain-glorious folly dost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground . Crushed shall it be , even like a nest of hornets , and its idle and licentious brood of tenants scattered to the angry winds of heaven . Moab is my washpot , over Edom will I cast out my shoe , saith the Lord . ' I tell thee , Merry-Mount , which should be rather termed Mount Dagon , shall be destroyed , it and all that therein dwells . Aye , thou Master of Misrule , even so hath it been ordained . " " You have spoken , " Corporal Neegoose , answered Morton , " but whether wisely or not , let the night-owl , whom I hear screeching just now , decide . As I find , however , that my conversation is so little relished , I will even address myself to sleep , and have accordingly the honor to wish rosy dreams and peaceful slumbers to ye all . " No one seemed inclined to oppose this resolution on the part of the prisoner , which , as the night was already well advanced , seemed on the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander that Morton should be placed for greater security in the inner room , and that Corporal Neegoose should occupy a part of the old bedstead with him , provided the prisoner should choose to avail himself of that luxurious piece of furniture . The Lord of Merry-Mount accordingly took up his quarters in the interior apartment accompanied by the worthy corporal . The others , including the valiant captain , disposed themselves according to their pleasure upon the floor of the outer room , one of the party stretching himself for additional security across the outer door . It was not long before a general concert of discordant and inharmonious sounds announced that the whole party were fast asleep , all save the prisoner , who , in his own language , describing the occurrence afterwards , was as wakeful as the geese of the capitol . He had , upon first lying down , affected great drowsiness , and had taken pains to fall very soundly asleep , in appearance , before the senses of the corporal were steeped in forgetfulness ; so that the simple-minded functionary , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was completely disarmed of all suspicion , and resigned himself tranquilly to his slumbers almost as soon in reality as Morton had done in appearance . Morton lay very quietly for nearly an hour . The night was already far advanced , and as the days were at the longest , it was not safe to delay his attempt at escape too long . Much to his surprise , the weather , so far as he could judge from the faint glimmering at the window in the other room , seemed tolerably clear . What had become of the storm which had worn so threatening an aspect in the afternoon , and which had been so alarming to the nerves of the subterranean philosopher of Wessaguscus , did not distinctly appear . Morton had lain there , reflecting upon a thousand different topics , listening to the discordant variety of nasal melody which proceeded from the outer room , and endeavoring to detect the particular organ of the heroic Standish amid the general concert , till it seemed to him that he had been lying there since the creation , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became at last so nervous and impatient that he felt the moment was come when he must absolutely arise and make the experiment , or else remain there the whole night through . A peal of distant thunder now suddenly broke through the external silence and confirmed him in his intention . The storm was , after all , coming on , and a sharp squall , with thunder and lightning , would be sure to make such a pother about the crazy tenement that the party would be awakened and kept watchful for the remainder of the night . He determined to arise , but there were two difficulties which presented themselves at the outset . In the first place , the dreaming corporal , in the unconscious expansiveness of sleep , had wound his arms around Morton 's neck , and it would be difficult to loosen his hold without awaking him . In the second place , if he was even fortunate enough to extricate himself successfully from this iron embrace , he had to make his way in the dark across the floor of the outer room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the upturned faces of his captors . Of course he dared not strike a light , and to make his way to the door , which , moreover , he knew to be barricaded with the body of one of the party , without awakening any one , seemed a very difficult task . " Truly , " muttered he to himself , " Master Corporal Neegoose , I could find it in my heart to dispense with these clinging arms of thine , which , however endearing they may be to the worthy good wife Neegoose , if such an enviable female exists , are , just now , most particularly in the way of your humble servant . By thy leave , then , most evangelical of corporals , " continued he in an inaudible monotone , as he daintily and dexterously untwisted the hard knot in which the corporal had tied his bony arms about his neck , without awakening him , " by thy permission , I will even leave thee to thy chaste and solitary slumbers . " Muttering thus , he groped his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other room , when he paused for a moment upon the threshold , deliberating how he should proceed . It was so dark that he could only guide himself by the ear , and he was particularly anxious not to plant his foot upon the face of the sleeping Standish , feeling well assured that if that fiery hero should be awakened , he would , if necessary , stop his further progress with a brace of bullets , without the smallest hesitation . While he was thus taking counsel with himself , and wondering how he should be able to make his way to the outer door without having a more definite notion of the condition of the floor than he at that moment possessed , the scene was suddenly illuminated by a flash of lightning . Morton readily took advantage of the circumstance and rapidly examined the appearance of the apartment . The single glance was almost sufficient to dash his hopes to the earth . The ground was covered with the prostrate forms of his captors , all of them , however , wrapped in deep slumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in a sitting posture against the door , flanked upon either side by a grim and substantial man-at-arms . As for the solitary window , it was so very small , besides being at such a distance from the ground , that there was not the slightest possibility of retreat in that direction . " By Jupiter , these be stubborn impediments , " muttered the Lord of Merry-Mount , to himself , as he stood in a contemplative and somewhat discomfited mood upon the threshold of the outer apartment . " Though this crazy old shell of a fort be not so strong as London Tower , yet it will do , after all , to hold in durance vile even as eminent a state criminal as the Prince of Passanogessit . Truly do I seem like a very reckless old rat who has allowed himself to be caught in a mouldy trap , but one which will hold him tightly in spite of his grimaces . I could take it as a particular and personal favor , now , if the earth would but open and swallow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate signs of any such catastrophe , Morton was obliged to bethink himself of some other means of relief . As the storm was evidently coming on apace , and as it was likely that the sleepers would soon be startled by the crash of the elements , he thought he might as well relinquish his efforts at escape , for the present at least , and he accordingly was about returning to the embraces of Corporal Neegoose , when another and still more vivid flash of lightning afforded him another opportunity of examining the scene of action . At the instant when the room was thus illuminated , his eyes happened to be turned towards the ceiling , in which , as will be remembered , a considerable rent had been made by the falling of the chimney . He had already rejected the idea of escape through that aperture , which , although it was larger than the window , and in fact of sufficient dimensions to admit of the passage of his body with some little compression , was at so hopeless a height from the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment when the lightning illuminated the gloom around him , his eyes were accidentally fixed upon the ceiling . Was he deceived by a too sanguine imagination , or did he really at that instant behold a means of unexpected and easy escape ? Either a phantom of his brain was deluding his senses , or else he had seen a rope dangling from the roof , and reaching nearly to the floor . The flash was past , however , in the same instant , and all was darkness again . " Fair and softly , " said he to himself , as he stood pondering for a moment in the same position which he had retained since he left his couch , " fair and softly ; yonder slender and waving line , which the lightning hath revealed to me , looked very like a good honest hempen rope , but it may after all be but the counterfeit presentiment , the phantasma of a rope . If it should prove but an airy picture , a fanciful figment of my heated brai , why truly I fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ghost of a rope , faugh , this savors too strongly of a certain leafless tree which bears human fruit . Why , precisely at this moment , should the fantastic vision of a rope 's end present itself ? They lie in their throats , these slanderous Puritans , who seek again to crush me to the earth with their accusation of foul crimes in England , of which they know me innocent . They would send me home , would they , again to be badgered and worried by a pack of yelling curs ? I know the mouths of the blood-thirsty hell-hounds are slavering at the thought that they are sending me home to a gibbet . But they lie in their throats , and  --  . " As Morton muttered these exclamations with more earnestness and passion than was usual with him , there came another flash of lightning , which again revealed to him the appearance of the mysterious rope . Moving almost as quickly as the flash , and dexterously avoiding , as he dashed forward , the upturned faces and prostrate forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rope before the darkness had again enveloped him . Giving it a desperate pull with all his might , to ascertain whether it was a real , substantial cord , capable of sustaining his weight and assisting him in his escape , or only a spiritual noose to entangle him in some new and indefinite embarrassment , he soon decided that it was indeed as honest and material a rope 's end as was ever twisted . Without more ado , and waiting for no more illumination of any kind , he climbed rapidly and with uncommon agility to the roof , coiled himself through the narrow aperture like a serpent , and then crouched for a moment till another flash should show him the proper means of descending , without breaking limbs or neck . While he was thus hesitating , he heard a low , hoarse voice directly below him . " Hist , hist , Master Morton , " said the voice , " knowest thou me not ? " " Faith , " answered Morton , " he must have good eyes that knoweth his oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I mistake not , thou shouldst be my subterranean philosopher of Wessaguscus , he who smelleth the thunder when it is brewing , even in the bowels of the earth . " " Thou diddest me a kindness once , " said the voice . " Exactly so , " answered Morton . " I could have sworn it was thou . By Jupiter Diespiter , thou hast requited it a thousand-fold , and if I reward not thy grateful heart , if fortune do but extricate me from my present dilemma , I wish I might be choked in the very rope which thy disinterested benevolence hath furnished me with . Verily , I have not found such gratitude , no , not in Israel . But , how shall I get down to thee , my fine fellow ? " " Feel for the hickory bough , Master Morton , it will bear thy weight . " So instructed , Morton groped cautiously about , moving very gingerly along the crazy roof of the edifice , which , having been originally constructed for a fort , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude dwellings of that day . Feeling that a broken leg or a dislocated ankle would hardly expedite him in his nocturnal march , Morton conducted himself so warily , that it was long before he found , at the extremity of the building , a long hickory branch , extending almost to the roof-tree . Grasping it , as soon as it was found , and trusting implicitly to the counsels of his enigmatical friend , he swung himself boldly out into the darkness . The branch yielded gently with his weight , and he felt himself descending till he knew he must be very near the ground . When the branch would bend no more , he relinquished his hold , and dropped easily upon the ground . As soon as he found himself fairly out of his prison , he cast a rapid and anxious glance around him . The darkness was not so intense as it had first appeared , or else there was something of the extraordinary and preternatural light returning , which had so strongly arrested his attention upon the previous evening . At any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of the dismantled fort , the dim and portentous forms of the gigantic trees , were visible , and he even fancied that he saw the faint and shadowy appearance of his mysterious friend creeping stealthily out from beneath the shadow of the hickory . " Hillo , hillo , sweet philosopher , " said he in a shrill whisper , " is that thine own worthy self , which I behold stealing from the bushes ? " " I am glad you have escaped from the mighty man of wrath , " said the other , creeping close up to him ; " pray Heaven , the plague be not let loose for this . " " Poh , poh , a fico for the plague , " answered Morton , gaily ; " and now listen to me , my good fellow . If I do not warmly urge thee to accompany me this night to our poor palace of Merry-Mount , ' t is because I am somewhat out of suits with fortune , myself , just now , and because my patronage would be like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , by thy most opportune assistance , eluded the grasp of my pursuers this night , I may yet momentarily expect that the attack will be renewed upon me , even in my stronghold . Thou wilt return to thy subterranean receptacle , that is to say , thou wilt burrow in thy hole again this night , I suppose . " " I shall go back to my den , " answered the other , shuddering , " but alas ! Abamoko is fearful , my flesh will be torn with red-hot pincers . Did not I tell you that I smelt the thunder coming ? " " Well , no matter about Abamoko and his pincers just now , " replied Morton ; " I must be off , and that speedily , but before I go , let me say thus much . These matters will blow over ere long , at least I hope so , and then , if thou wilt but accept my offer , I promise thee a place of honor and profit at Merry-Mount , to be followed up by still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones wot of , shall have ripened into fulfilment . In the mean time , and as an earnest of my good intentions , take this , my fine fellow . We have not yet discovered a gold mine at Passanogessit , nor hast thou , with all thy thunder-smelling propensities , discovered the philosopher 's stone , or I am mistaken . Therefore , take these few poor pieces , and come to me when the storm is over . Good-night my good fellow , I have a longer tramp before me than thou hast , and the nights be short . " So saying , Morton slipped a few pieces of money , the only ones which he had with him , into his companion 's hand . The philosopher received them mechanically , and stood stock-still for an instant . Suddenly , as he jingled the pieces , a thought seemed to electrify him . He uttered a shrill laugh , jumped high into the air , and clapped his hands in a paroxysm of delight , quite extraordinary and wholly unwarranted by the circumstances . " Ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho , ho , ho , solid silver ! crosses of solid silver . No more digging , no more pinching , no more hot irons . Ho , ho , ho ! a fig for Abamoko ! " With this highly intelligible ebullition of triumph and gratitude , which was certainly not justified by the magnitude of the present which he received , the wild man again sprang high in the air , and then dashed off at full speed into the darkness . The shrill wizard laugh was wafted fitfully back from the gloom which had suddenly , as it were , ingulphed him , and was caught up by the echoing hills and reverberated through the mirky and savage silence , till it seemed to Morton as if a thousand invisible demons of the wilderness were mocking him in the darkness . Suddenly there was a stir in the fort . Morton , who had only advanced a few rods in the opposite direction from that in which his mysterious friend had disappeared , crouched under a tree , and strained his eyes anxiously through the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly a light was struck . At the same instant , a gun was discharged at a little distance from the house , then another , and another . Then through the light , which streamed from the solitary window , Morton could distinctly perceive the forms of his late captors issuing from the house , and rushing madly with many confused and angry cries , in the direction of the fugitive . He had evidently been heard and seen in his moment of triumph , and had as plainly been mistaken for Morton himself . Shot after shot was fired , but without success , for , after the last discharge had died upon his ear , he still heard , above all other sounds , the ringing , wizard laugh , sounding more and more faintly in the distance , and repeated by the echoes in still more ghostlike and fantastic tones  --  Ho , ho , ho ! CHAPTER III . THE HURRICANE . This accidental diversion in Morton 's favor was fortunate . The pursuers , having started off in the darkness upon a wrong scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him during the next few hours . He accordingly hoped to gain sufficient time to enable him to reach Merry-Mount and fortify himself there , before the enemy should besiege his stronghold . He was at that moment some eight or ten miles distant from his home , because it was necessary for him to go considerably about , to cross the head of the Monatoquit River , which separated the plantation of Wessaguscus from that of Passanogessit . He stood upon the edge of the plain , and was just starting upon his tramp through the forest , when his attention was arrested by the extraordinary appearance of the atmosphere . We have already noticed the singular illumination of the heavens a little after sunset . This remarkable brilliancy had now returned at the dead of night , and a large portion of the upper sky was covered with yellowish vapor , which emitted a wild and sickly glare , contrasting strangely with the pitchy darkness which had for the last hour or two enveloped the scene . The thunder still rolled , and the lightning flashed at intervals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it seemed as if the parched and arid earth had absorbed so much of the fierce sunshine which had prevailed for many days , that it repelled and dissipated the gathering moisture in the clouds . Whether the storm had spent its fury in other directions , or whether it was still brooding and impending in the distance , seemed doubtful ; but there was something in the calm and lurid atmosphere , something nameless and indefinable , which inspired sensations of awe . It was so death-like a calm , that not a single leaf quivered upon the poplars . The crackling of a dried twig , under Morton 's foot , sounded like the report of a fire-arm . He still stood upon the plain which we have described , upon which grew here and there several gigantic oaks and chestnuts , and had advanced nearly to the edge of the forest which surrounded the clearing . He had paused , bewildered by the extraordinary light which had so suddenly returned . He was at first inclined to believe that the woods had taken fire , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an event . Moreover , the total disappearance of the phenomenon for some hours , with its sudden and startling recurrence , both forbade the idea of a conflagration . Suddenly the breathless silence was broken by a distant , rushing sound , as if the air were swept by myriads of invisible wings . The volume of sound increased fearfully every second , and now the forest roared as if the ocean had burst its bounds , and were sweeping over the land . The unnatural light glared still more fitfully upon the scene , and as the hardy Morton looked with terrified eyes around , he saw the mighty wood fluttering , writhing and tossing its myriad arms madly for a moment . In that single moment , ten thousand trees were whirled from their roots , and dashed to the earth , before his eyes . There was a short , wild crash , as these forest giants , which had braved the storms of centuries , fell before the furious blast , and at the next instant , the whole forest bent flat to the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careered over it in its majesty . The thunder-cloud , which had so long delayed its coming , now sailed up from its resting-place with fearful velocity , obscuring with its black wings the preternatural glare , and then descended with sudden swoop upon the earth . The rain fell in floods , the inky blackness of the air was pierced incessantly by the arrowy lightning . The thunder crashed above and around in one unbroken roar . No breathless interval between the flash and the bolt , whispered of any slight removal of the dreadful artillery of heaven . The rattling thunder rode upon the lightning 's wings . Peal followed flash , and flash succeeded peal , in ceaseless and fearful succession . At the instant of the hurricane , Morton had thrown himself flat upon the earth . As he prostrated himself , he saw a solitary and gigantic chestnut tree , which stood near him upon the plain , flying through the air like a feather , its ponderous trunk snapped like a last year 's reed . The next instant a thunderbolt shivered a mighty oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during the breathless moments which succeeded , as he lay with his face upon the ground , the rain pouring like a cataract , it seemed as if the earth must be powerless to absorb the thunder-bolts , which fell incessantly around him . How long he lay in this condition , he knew not . The moments seemed ages , in that fearful convulsion of the elements ; but the summer tempest was soon over . The hurricane was brief as it had been terrific , and it was soon extinguished , as it were , by the floods of rain , which were still falling . In half an hour , the violence of the storm had abated . The lightning still glared , and the thunder rolled in the distance , but the clouds were broken , and a star or two glimmered faintly through the rifts of the tempest . Morton aroused himself at last from his recumbent position , and looked ruefully around . The storm had subsided , but the night was dark , and his journey was likely to be obstructed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said he to himself , " the elemental pother is over , and , as far as I can judge , am I neither blown into the sea , nor blasted by lightning , nor ignobly drowned in a puddle , which seemed latterly most like to be my fate . Jupiter Diespiter ! Igni corusco nubila dividens ! ' Ah Flaccus , Flaccus ! what boots it that I strive to soothe my ear with the limpid gurgling of thy verse , when the howling hurricane and the wrathful Shrimp , both raging through the gloomy forests , have filled my soul with discord ? Farewell , Flaccus , for the present , and farewell , ye bowers of Wessaguscus ! " With this the undaunted Morton set forth resolutely upon his journey . The atmosphere grew lighter as he advanced , and revealed to him the ravages of the tempest . Vast trunks of prostrate trees , upturned roots , and ponderous , broken , interwoven branches , obstructed his passage at every step . Still on he toiled manfully and patiently . In an hour and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself engaged in passing a vast and gloomy swamp . The earth quaked beneath his feet as he struggled on , springing from one tufted hammock to another , and in danger every moment of being swallowed up in the black , yielding ooze , whose treacherous nature had been aggravated by the deluge of rain which had been falling . Still , with the adroitness and knowledge of woodcraft which he possessed , he was enabled to escape from this , as well as from the other dangers which beset his course . He reached the sources of the Monatoquit . As he had anticipated , the slender stream was swollen into a torrent , but he found , to his gratification , that a large tree had been torn up by its roots in the whirlwind , and thrown directly across the boiling flood . Across this natural bridge he nimbly made his way , and again dashed into the forest . On he sped , the distant lightning ever and anon flashing across and illuminating his path , and assisting him in threading his difficult passage through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the east , as the exhausted Morton at last reached the outer barricade of Merry-Mount . The gate was heavily and carefully barred ; but the faithful Bootefish , attentive to his master 's signal , although , of course , as drunk as usual , hastened to admit him . Morton ordered him to make all secure against an impending attack , and to awaken him in two hours . He then plunged into the palace , threw himself , all smoking and reeking as he was , upon a bear-skin , and fell instantly into a profound slumber . CHAPTER IV . THE SIEGE OF MERRY-MOUNT . The only inhabitants of Merry-Mount , at that moment , were Bootefish and the Canary Bird . The other retainers and vagabonds , who composed its ordinary population , had gone up into the interior of the country , to trade with the Indians , and to supply themselves with beaver . As for Henry Maudsley , he had some time before become disgusted with the ribaldry which prevailed at the palace , and had abandoned entirely the temporary residence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have soon occasion to narrate , he still lingered in New England ; there had been for some time very little sympathy or communication between him and the Lord of Merry-Mount . Bootefish bustled about , during the brief slumber of his chief , with a good deal of importance and alacrity , making prompt and efficient provision for the approaching siege . There was a goodly store of matchlocks , and plenty of ammunition in the palace , which he now was busily employed in arranging , feebly assisted by the Canary Bird , who seemed that morning to have grown considerably more yellow of hue , at the same time that he had lost a good deal of the blithe and chirping vivacity which usually distinguished him . There were three small apertures in the outward palisade , which inclosed the buildings at Merry-Mount , which had been intended for three murtherers or small cannon , which had never been mounted , but which Bootefish knew to be lying somewhere about the precincts . After considerable delay , he at last was fortunate enough to find them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Doryfall , in placing them in their destined position . The responsibility , which had been cast upon him , had for the moment dissipated the drunkenness of the heroic chief butler , and , as is usual with all truly great men , his genius seemed to rise in proportion to the emergencies of his situation . He never seemed more calm and self-collected than in this hour , so big with the destinies of Merry-Mount . " Here be twelve good snaphances , Master Canary Bird , " said he , complacently , addressing his lieutenant , and not observing the very rueful expression of the little man 's face , " twelve snaphances , three murtherers , and one hundred pounds of good dry powder , besides a goodly heap of bullets of all sizes . By the beard of my father , methinks ' t is enough to blow these bloody Puritans sky high ; confusion upon the damnable croppies , Bernaby ! Here , pledge me the same . " " Confusion to the croppies , " gasped Bernaby , after swallowing eagerly a mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desperate intention of inflaming his courage , which was growing rapidly torpid  --  " confusion to the croppies , Robin Bootefish ! Marry and amen . " " Right , Bernaby !  --  but I wish thou wouldst get a little color in those parchment cheeks of thine . Look at me , man ! Seest thou aught of the lily in my countenance ? " cried the worthy butler , turning full upon his companion a face like the rising sun of midsummer . " Truly , no , good Robin , and I could wish there were twenty like thee at Merry-Mount . Alas ! we be , after all , but three . An ' we had swashing Numps Rednape now , or Dick Shorthose , or even Peter Cakebread , with his damnably ugly face , methinks ' t would be more comforting . Besides , ' t is a pity that we two should gain all the glory of a triumph over Captain Standish . Is it not so , Master Butler ? " " Fire and fagots , no ! " roared Bootefish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Merry-Mount , are enough to toss an army of psalm-singers into the sea . Humphrey Rednape be damned , for a brawling , blustering bully ; as for Peter Cakebread , I had rather than forty shillings that he were here , that thine own cowardice might be fairly scared out of thee , as thou witnessed the scurvy shifts which the old baboon would be put to , to escape the dangers which might beset him . But by the Lord ! while I am talking thus the moments are passing . ' T is time to call the master . " " Quite time , I should say , worthy Robin , " said the gay voice of Morton , who suddenly joined them , looking as fresh and jovial as ever , having found time , since arousing himself from his brief slumber to exchange his soiled and way-worn habiliments , and to array himself , as he said , in becoming costume to greet the distinguished visitor whom he was expecting  --  " Quite time , I assure thee , Robin , but , luckily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to tell me when to rise when danger is nigh . I see thou hast completed thy preparations , for I have already been the rounds , and I commend thee therefor . I do not so highly commend thy present employment . ' T is not now the tempus dapibus . ' The sun is half an hour high , and thou must even defer the rest of thy potations , till we meet when all is over to pour out our libations upon the altar of victory . For the present , sobriety and decorum are most befitting . " " And prithee , your worship , how knowest thou of the approach of Captain Standish ? How knowest thou whether he be not even now at New Plymouth ? " asked the butler . " From the very best authority , worthy Master Robin , " answered Morton , " I feel quite sure that Captain Miles Standish hath already left New Plymouth , and is even now upon his way to invade Thomas Morton of Merry-Mount . " " And prithee , if I might ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this expedition of late  --  prithee , who hath told thee this ? " " No less a person , honest Robin , than the aforesaid Captain Miles Standish himself , " answered Morton . " Captain Miles Standish ! echoed the honest butler , perfectly astounded at this piece of intelligence , which his sovereign so flippantly conveyed to him  --  Captain Miles Standish !  --  and how , I pray thee , good Master , in the name of Satan , hast thou happened in his company , and how  --  " " And how in the name of Beelzebub have I happened out of his company when once in it ? thou wouldst say , " interrupted Morton . " ' T is a long story , and must be reserved in all its details to some more quiet opportunity . Suffice for the moment that the heroic Shrimp circumvented me by stratagem at Wessaguscus . " " And how , I prithee , didst thou so wittily circumvent him ? " cried Bootefish . " I tell thee thou shalt know all in good time , Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee now , that I have reached my palace in safety . But in faith , thou shouldst have seen them butting their heads against each other in the dark , like drunken rams , and outbellowing the thunder in their rage , when they found their prisoner gone . As for the heroic Shrimp , trust me , he tore his leather jerkin for spite , and Corporal Neegoose , even the venerable Abraham , in whose bosom I had slept , would have torn the very hair from his head for vexation , had it not been too short to lay hold of.But no more of this . To the look-out , Bernaby , and tell me what thou seest . " At this moment there was a loud knocking at the outer gate . Bootefish , at a nod from his master , advanced to the palisades , and reconnoitred the supposed enemy through a narrow lookout . " ' T is a red-skin , " said Bootefish , returning-to his master . " A red-skin ! then by my life ' t is no enemy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again , Robin , and learn his errand . " Bootefish again advanced to the palisade , held a short parley with the savage , which was inaudible to the others , and then , after the lapse of a few minutes , returned to his sovereign . " ' T is a red-skin from Wessaguscus , " said he , " and one who wishes well to the Master of Merry-Mount . He hath been informed by a white man , who sojourneth in that neighborhood , that Captain Miles Standish is even now upon his way to Merry-Mount , having set sail with his followers in his pinnace after the tempest of last night had abated . Fortunately , the wind hath been wondrous light , or the mighty man would have been here before the friendly scout . " " Admit the scout , Robin , he will be one more man-at-arms for our feeble garrison , " said Morton . " Truly your worship , " answered Bootefish , " he utterly declined all invitation to that effect , although it was warmly extended to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message sent by the white man of Wessaguscus , and having accomplished his errand , he hath vanished into the bushes . " My life for it , this is another friendly office on the part of my subterranean philosopher . But thou knowest not my gem of sages , " said Morton , " the solitary subterranean of Wessaguscus , who  --  " " Sail , ho ! " cried the Canary Bird from his perch . " The devil ! " ejaculated Morton , suddenly interrupting himself and mounting with wonderful rapidity to the lookout , in order to survey the scene for himself . After straining his eyes for a few seconds into the clear blue distance , he became convinced that the white sail which was first visible upon the edge of the horizon could be nothing else than the pinnace of Standish . " Truly , the Philistines be upon us , " cried he to Bootefish , " and the tug of war approacheth . Look again to the barricades and see that the murtherers are in fit condition to do their duty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Merry-Mount . " " ' T is all in readiness , your worship , " hiccupped the butler , whom matutinal potations , added to the excitement of his preparations , had now rendered magnificently drunk . " All is in readiness to receive the damnable brawlers of New Plymouth . Down with the profane despisers of our holy liturgy ! Down with the bloody separatists ! All is ready for them , your honor . " " All right , Robin , " said the sovereign , descending from his watch-tower and setting himself busily to work to examine the arms and ammunition of the little fortress ; " all very right , but I wish thou wert not always so cursedly drunk when thy sobriety would be worth its weight in gold to thy master . What a piece of ill luck it is , too , that my garrison should be so feeble just at this moment  --  " " We are enough , your worship , " roared Bootefish ; " enough and more than enough to swallow every one of the rascals . I pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Merry-Mount , pledge myself to chop them all into mince-meat , and stuff sausages with them for your worship 's breakfast . Confusion to the drunken Puritans , your honor , and  --  " " Tush , Robin , " interrupted Morton . " I like thy spirit , but I can not commend this braggadocio of thine . And , by the way , what hath become of your other man-at-arms , the stalwart Canary Bird ? Go seek him out , Robin , for ' t is time to muster our garrison . " " Certainly , certainly , " hiccupped the butler . " ' T is proper that the garrison should be mustered . But your worship should know that this Canary Bird is a drunken knave , and what is more , a scurvy coward . I will look for him , your worship , but I pledge myself that I shall find him creeping into a rat-hole , or the bung of an empty ale-butt , to escape the  --  " " So saying , the valiant butler staggered off , and after an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the ear , the recreant Doryfall , who , as he had rightly conjectured , had been found stowed away in the cellar among the empty casks . " Here be the Canary Bird , your worship , " cried Bootefish , " marvellously ill of the pip I assure ye , and ready to moult all his feathers , white as well as yellow . Here , my good fellow , " he continued , extending his flask to the trembling Canary Bird , " take another drop . Why , thou lily-livered , ague-shaking mountebank , what ails thee , then , that thou swallowest not thy liquor ? " " ' T is nothing , " murmured the unlucky Canary Bird , in a feeble voice , and utterly unable to swallow the proffered libation . " I have a slight touch of the lockjaw . My aunt was a martyr to it . " " Your worship sees , " said Bootefish , turning away from the cowardly Canary Bird with an expression of profound disgust upon his countenance , " your worship sees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put not your trust in Canary Birds , saith the wise man . No matter , your worship , we two are enough to carbanado all the Puritans of Plymouth . I pledge myself , your worship  --  " " Enough of thy pledges , honest Robin , " interrupted Morton , " and do me the kindness to ascend once more to the lookout , for I believe that our unfortunate friend here might as well return to the cellarage ; he is not even fit to serve as a warder . Go to the lookout , and that instantly . Death and damnation ! " he continued , as the drunken butler , after pompously staggering towards the ladder which led to the lookout , fairly rolled over upon the ground , as he attempted to ascend . " By Jupiter Diespiter ! here is my garrison reduced to myself . Why , Bootefish , thou drunken lobster , art thou really deserting me in my utmost need ? Why , thou miserable , pot valiant , human hogshead , thou  --  " " Fair and softly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slowly assumed a sitting posture at the foot of the ladder . " Fair and softly , your worship . Good words are due to the future bishop of Massachusetts . Ceremony is a proper thing , even from a sovereign to his subjects . I was born to be an usher , a genteel usher . Your worship shall see the genteel ceremony with which I will receive the bloody-minded Puritans . Down with the accursed Brownists ! Cherish piety  --  piety and ceremony . A curse upon all Canary Birds , and a fig for Miles Standish . " With these disjointed ejaculations , the heroic Bootefish fell into a profound lethargy . Morton , stepping lighly over his prostrate carcass , now hastily ascended his watch-tower . As he reached the summit , he saw that the pinnace of Miles Standish had already cast anchor under the cliff , and that the party who had captured him the night before were disembarking upon the beach . " By the Lord , " cried he to Doryfall , who still stood the image of mute dismay near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invincible armada hath arrived at last . By Jupiter , the odds are something heavy , nine to one as I count them , for of my garrison of two , one is drunk with fear and the other with liquor . O , thou heroic and most truculent of Puritan captains , am I to fall into thy hands after all ? O , Miles , Miles ! thou lengthy brevity , thou gigantic pigmy , thou confounder of dimensions ! O , thou , who art Miles in name , leagues in valor , and but a few paltry inches in stature , why the plague could not the plague have swallowed thee in England , when thou didst so manfully brave its fury , and why , O why did it spare thee to plague me here with thy fury , in New England ? " As Morton thus soliloquized , the invading party had all disembarked upon the beach , where they remained stationary , and seemed to be listening to the orders of their commander . " There they are , every one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centurion , the corporal , Standish , Abraham Neegoose , and all the rest of them . Antimachumque , Helimumque , Securiferumque , Pyracmon . ' O , Miles ! why could not the ferocious Pecksuot have sent an arrow through thy jerkin ? So should I have been saved the trouble , and the whole of New England the expense , of this tremendous invasion . " Morton 's soliloquy was now cut short . The party upon the beach began to move , and the sovereign of Merry-Mount hastily descended from his elevated position , to prepare for their reception . He was now , unfortunately , in solitary grandeur , for the Canary Bird had taken advantage of his master 's temporary abstraction to again effect his escape into some unknown hiding-place , and the butler being in a hopelessly lethargic condition , there was none left but himself to defend his castle . Morton now took one more hasty survey of his artillery and ammunition , and then arming himself with a snaphance , he stationed himself at one of the little apertures which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they advanced . In a few minutes , the whole party , with their commander at their head , had arrived within fifty yards of the palisade . Morton now hesitated as to the course which he was to pursue . If he had not been entirely alone , if only two or three faithful followers had been at his side , it would have been perfectly easy for him to have defended his castle against the present invasion . It was now , however , evident that the palisade was to be attacked upon two or three points at once , for he already observed that three of the party were detailed in an opposite direction . It would have been easy for him , as he stood there at the embrasure , to have taken deliberate aim at Standish , and have picked him off at the head of his company . It would have been easy for him to have fired one raking shot with the murtherer , which would have inflicted serious damage , although the nature of the ground , and the clumsiness of his field-pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At all events , it was not likely that he could destroy the whole of his assailants with his single arm , nor defend his place against a desperate attack for any considerable length of time . Had the Canary Bird but been a little less chicken-hearted , or the butler a little more abstemious , it would have been possible for him , perhaps , to have beaten off his assailants , but alone as he was , the attempt seemed almost hopeless . His palisades were weak and easily broken through , and it was entirely out of his power to defend them at more than one point at a time . Moreover , if his adversaries should become inflamed by obstinate resistance upon his part , the terms of his final surrender ,  --  and to that under the circumstances he felt that he must come at last ,  --  would be more disadvantageous , particularly if any of them should suffer loss of life or limb in the attack , than perhaps might now be secured by diplomacy . While Morton was thus holding council with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palisade . At that moment the life of the Plymouth hero hung by a hair . Morton covered him deliberately with his piece , the barrel of which he thrust through the embrasure , and for an instant 's space , he was inclined to yield to the promptings of the busy devil within him . After all , it would have been but an act of self-defence . The invaders of his domicile were attacking him without the slightest shadow of legitimate authority derived from any source under heavens . The principles of natural law , all authorized him to defend himself and his castle by every means in his power . At the same time there was something in the manly bearing of Standish , that forcibly appealed to the generous part of Morton 's nature . Small was the love which the Lord of Merry-Mount bore to the champion of the Puritans , and still his soul revolted at the thought of slaying the gallant soldier like a dog in a ditch . And yet he had himself , within the last fifteen hours , suffered insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . He had been treated like a base cur , bound , handcuffed , outraged , degraded , and all this he felt without cause , and without right , except the right of brutal violence . The man who had most vilified , persecuted , and insulted him , by whom he had been entrapped in the forest , caged , tormented , and , after his escape , hunted down to his lair as if he had been a wolf , that man stood now within a few yards of the muzzle of his gun . A motion of his finger , and the vanquisher of Wittewamutt , the heroic champion of the Puritans , the terror of all the savage tenants of New England , was sent to his long account . All these conflicting thoughts rushed rapidly through Morton 's brain . Generosity united with prudence finally triumphed over the desire of vengeance . His character was more politic than desperate ; and as he reflected how infinitely complicated and disastrous would be his relations with the settlers , should his hands be stained with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely , his grim companions in arms should leave his death unrevenged a single hour , he relinquished his first and deadly purpose . During the infinitely small fragment of time , during which his life had been thus rapidly but minutely weighed in the balance of Morton 's mind , Miles Standish had advanced very near to the palisade , closely followed by Corporal Neegoose and four of the men-at-arms . " Thomas Morton , " he cried at last , " by authority of powers committed to me by all the planters of New England combined , I summon thee presently to surrender thyself , without further delay , into my hands . " " Faith , " answered Morton from the embrasure , " the courtesy I have so recently experienced at thy hands , when my evil genius led me unwittingly into thy clutches , hath inspired me with small relish for a further continuance of thy acquaintance . Retire , Captain Standish , or I shall most assuredly do thee to death where thou standest . Verbum sapienti '  --  thou knowest the proverb . Retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Fire , if thou darest , " replied Standish , without blenching , although the muzzle of Morton 's matchlock still pointed full at his breast ; " fire , if thou darest , my death will avail thee nothing . If thou wouldst have another murder upon thy guilty hands , do as thou threatenest . " " ' T is a calumnious lie , " shouted Morton , stung by this insult into renewed passion . " I marvel much , that a gentleman and soldier , like thyself , Captain Standish , can stoop so low as not only to wear the livery and obey the commands , but even to repeat the falsehoods of these base-born curs . But I will not be fretted out of my reason , and moreover  --  " " Master Morton , " interrupted Standish , in a peremptory tone , " this parley hath lasted till I am weary . In one word , wilt thou surrender at discretion , or shall I use violence ? Choose , and that instantly , for I swear to thee by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed without a moment 's further delay . " Morton was a prudent and politic man . During the interval which had elapsed since the first arrival of the pinnace , sufficient opportunity had been afforded him for reflection upon his position . Even when giving way to an explosion of passion , his reason was by no means clouded , but he had the wit to preserve a method , even in his rage . He had been , throughout the whole interview with Standish , collected , if not cool . He had reflected upon all the probable consequences of his action , even while his matchlock pointed at the heart of Standish ; he had reflected , during the brief parley , upon his future prospects , even while apparently yielding to a tempest of passion , and he had at last arrived at the conclusion , that all the golden visions which had solaced his exile , and to convert which into reality had been the cherished object of years , must inevitably be dispelled , did he not extricate himself skilfully from the dilemma in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , to fall into the hands of his enemies , for to resist single-handed the present invasion , was but fool-hardy . It was only the part of a desperate man to sell his life dearly , and to defend himself to the last . His situation was not yet desperate , but with the blood of Standish , or that of any of his followers , upon his hands , it would be utterly hopeless . On the other hand , if he surrendered himself into the hands of Standish , the worst result which he anticipated was a voyage to England . Under the present complication of circumstances , he felt that more was to be gained than lost by such an event . There was much in the recent history of his affairs that might be handled by him with advantage , to circumvent the projects of the new planters of New England . An immediate interview with Sir Ferdinando Gorges would be of service at the present juncture , in forwarding the enterprise of Sir Christopher Gardiner , upon the success of which depended the fulfilment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , and giving one despairing glance at the motionless carcass of the chief butler , he at last resolved to surrender . Within less than one minute after Standish had uttered his last peremptory demand , Morton called to him , through the embrasure , in a voice which had resumed all its native gaiety ,  --  " As the result of the present parley , the garrison of this fortress is disposed to capitulate . The general of the besieging forces will please to propose his terms . " " Master Morton , " replied Captain Standish , " I have neither time nor taste for buffoonery . Thou wilt forthwith unbar thy gate , or I shall give my signal at once for an attack . " " The garrison , " continued Morton , with much magnificence of manner , " the garrison , to save the effusion of blood , and to preserve many valuable lives , doth consent to capitulate ; but it demands to go forth with all the honors of war . " " With the honors of a halter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Unbar the gates instantly , or I swear to thee by  --  " " Swear not at all , most waspish of warriors , " interrupted Morton , " for lo , am I not already obeying the behests of the cruel conqueror ? Surely , it is legitimate for the commander of the garrison , in the present state of the siege , to whisper a word or two touching the terms of his surrender . I require , therefore , a pledge from the besieging general , that no violence shall be offered to me , or to any of my garrison ; and that , furthermore , my flag shall be saluted by my garrison , after it is struck . Do you assent to these conditions ? " " Corporal Neegoose , " shouted Standish , in a tempest of rage , " I delay no longer . " At the word of command , the corporal and the men-at-arms rushed after their commander , in a furious assault upon the gate ; while , at the same instant , at a concerted signal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt a breach in the palisade with their partisans . At the instant of the attack , Morton quietly and slowly unbarred the portal , saying , as he did so ,  --  " Fairly and softly , my masters , fairly and softly . Silence giveth consent , saith the proverb , and thus do I understand my terms to be allowed . Be not over hasty , most valiant general , nor thou , most evangelical of corporals ; but enter calmly , and take possession of this virgin fortress . " The gate swung open as he concluded , and displayed Morton , standing quite alone at the entrance to his domain , with his matchlock in his hand . The party , headed by Standish , rushed furiously into the inclosure , and , suspecting some ambush , as they found Morton , whom they supposed surrounded by twenty followers , in such perfect solitude , Corporal Neegoose and two others made a sudden onset upon him , threw him to the ground , disarmed and bound him , and were upon the point of hand-cuffing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desist . " Master Morton , " said he , " you are my prisoner ; but from your recent behavior , I am inclined to believe you satisfied that it is useless to resist . I am , therefore , disposed to liberate you from actual bondage , assuring you , however , that any attempt at rescue , on the part of your followers , will be punished by instant death . " " Captain Standish , " replied Morton , after he had shaken himself free , " ' t would have been perchance more becoming to have treated me less like a felon , and more like a gentleman , after I had thus surrendered at discretion . Yet I do hereby volunteer my parole , assuring thee that it is neither my intention nor inclination to attempt my escape . I shall follow thee to Plymouth as patiently as the wild ass 's colt followeth its dam . Touching the matter of a rescue upon the part of my followers , thou wilt believe that to be most unlikely , seeing that with the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either dead or alive in some cranny in the cellarage , yonder motionless lump of humanity constituteth my whole garrison . " As he concluded , Morton pointed to the prostrate Bootefish , whom several of the followers of Standish had just discovered , tranquilly enjoying his slumbers at the foot of the lookout , and whom they now were dragging forward for the inspection of their commander . As he listened to the last observation of Morton , and contemplated the lethargic form of Bootefish , Standish looked at his corporal with a somewhat disconcerted expression of countenance . To the hero of New Plymouth , his present achievement seemed not likely to bring fresh laurels . Giving one contemptuous glance at the butler , the testy Standish turned his back upon Morton , and striding towards the farther extremity of the inclosure , seated himself upon a log , struck a light , and began to solace himself with a pipe of tobacco . In the meantime , Morton , throwing himself into a gracefully recumbent attitude upon the turf , and looking benignantly around upon his captors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this poor palace of ours , my masters . All is yours , I fear me , by the rights of war . I can not flatter ye that ye have broken down my spirit yet , although ye have conquered my territory ,  --   --  Et cuncta terrarum subacta Prter atrocem animum Catonis . ' Hast ever solaced thyself , Master Neegoose , with the crystal numbers of the Venusian bard ? " Footnotes See Note VI . CHAPTER V. THE DOUBLE LABYRINTH . Several weeks had elapsed since the matters just related , when one afternoon Esther Ludlow was wandering in the neighborhood of her residence . Summer had long been scorching the wilderness . After a day of breathless heat and cloudless sunshine , she had come forth from her humble cottage as the afternoon was closing , to watch for the coming of the evening wind . But the leaves stirred not yet , but hung shrivelled and motionless in the brazen sky . The oppressiveness of the atmosphere was so excessive , that even the sounds of nature seemed languid and feeble . The melancholy cat-bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the squirrel sat motionless upon his tree ; the snake lay basking upon the rock . All was silent , save the ceaseless hum of the locusts , whose shrill and all-pervading monotone , struck upon the ear like the audible voice of heat . The great heart of nature seemed to beat feebly in her bosom . Esther lingered in the cloistered depths of the forest , now gliding with the noiseless movements of a nun , through the long , green naves , now gazing upwards at the vast and solemn arches ; now losing herself among the clustering and interlacing ranks of gigantic and aspiring shafts , or watching , as she sat upon some prostrate column , the play of the chequered sunbeams , as they streamed in a horizontal flood through the branched and foliaged tracery of the grove . Long and deeply she mused . At times she doubted whether , in her conduct during the last few months , she might not have committed some irretrievable error , but no tongue had whispered Maudsley 's name , since the memorable interview in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still lingered in New England , or whether he had already departed to more genial scenes , she could not tell . At times , something whispered in her heart , that her bearing towards him had been too harsh , and that she had not dwelt kindly enough upon the constancy of his love . But she reflected that constancy and devotion could not atone for suspicion and insult . She became every day strengthened in the sad conviction , that fate had allowed two hearts for a brief period , and almost in their own despite , to cleave and grow to each other , only to be rudely and forever torn asunder , and to shed their life-blood in the separation . She felt convinced that there was an utter want of sympathy between their natures , and that a reconciliation was hopeless . What the mystery of the chain betokened she could not imagine ; the idea of Sir Christopher Gardiner as a lover had never presented itself to her mind . She had not the slightest idea in what way Maudsley had possessed himself of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the only interview which had since taken place between herself and the knight , and which had passed in the presence of her brother , from alluding to the circumstance . Maudsley 's language had been so incoherent and incomprehensible , that at times she feared that his brain had been unsettled , at others she was almost ready to believe in the reality of the preternatural influence to which he had alluded in such a passionate manner , and to imagine that it was even extending itself over her own fate . She struggled long and deeply with these emotions , as she wandered in the silent forest . At times she doubted whether the sacrifice which she had made to her brother , a sacrifice of a whole life , was indeed a just and worthy one . Even if it were right to consecrate her own existence to his , was it just to trifle with the welfare of another ? and if , without any thought but Maudsley 's happiness , and laying aside all useless , although womanly reserve , she had approached her lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole mystery which enveloped them , would it not have been better for all ? Exhausted and harassed by her unprofitable musings , she violently aroused herself with the intention of returning to her home . To her surprise , she found , after making one or two turns , and becoming at each turn more bewildered , that she had unconsciously wandered farther than she intended ; and that she had , for the first time for many months , entirely lost her way . As the day was drawing to a close , she became , in her anxiety to hurry to the right track again , still more and more embarrassed . It had been an unusual thing for her to venture unattended to any considerable distance in the wilderness ; but the day had been so sultry , the freshness of the forest so inviting , and her reverie so deep , that she had unconsciously wandered too far . It was now in vain for her to attempt to recognise any familiar feature in the landscape . Although there was still a sufficiency of daylight left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet it would have required a more practised eye than hers to have read the language of that sylvan scene . To one educated as she had been in the quiet , cultivated gardens of England , the maze of the forest was an inscrutable mystery . It was no longer possible for her to select any single and well-remembered landmark . Still her self-possession was not easily disturbed , and after wandering for a few minutes longer , she arrived at a small natural opening , where she felt certain that she had never found herself before . A high ledge of granite rose from the edge of this valley , swelling upwards through the forest in a westerly direction . Esther began to ascend this cliff to obtain , if possible , a distant view which might enable her to form some conjecture as to the path which she was to follow . With much effort she arrived upon the broad flat summit of the granite mass , where she sank for a moment exhausted . As she lay there upon that isolated promontory , she seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From east to west , from north to south , the unfathomable forest flowed round her , like a sea . The myriad leaves , already agitated by the evening wind which had so long delayed its coming , now murmured like the awakening surge . Recovering from her exhaustion , she arose and looked anxiously around . Alas ! she could not discover the slightest indication of any thing familiar to guide her footsteps . In whatever direction she strained her eyes , still rose and rolled before her sight that green and boundless ocean . She took a silver whistle which hung at her waist , and which she had been accustomed to use as a signal to her brother and his servants , and blew a shrill blast upon it , without the slightest expectation that its tremulous and slender note could penetrate to her own abode . The faint vibration soon died upon the air , but just awakening a slight and feeble echo which floated back to her ear like the voice of some gentle wood-spirit . Again and again she mechanically sounded the slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she listened to the gentle but unearthly tones , by which it seemed to be mocked and mimicked in the distance . Suddenly , as she blew her final and despairing blast , and was about descending from her elevated position , her ear was startled by another and most mysterious sound . Just as the delicate echo which had responded to her own last signal , had melted into air , the tone seemed suddenly caught up and repeated ; gently at first , and then more loudly , till she was surprised to hear , as it were , an answering signal to her own . A hope sprang up in her bosom as she listened to this distant note , and yet she was still more perplexed and bewildered , because it was not the signal that had been concerted between her brother and the other inmates of her household with herself . Again she awoke the silence with her instrument ; and now as the last echoes subsided , the clear tones of a distant lute rose upon the air , in a strain of exquisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed as if some enchantment were spread over the forest . The instrument was struck by the hand of a master . The music , although plaintive and touching , was highly intricate and artificial in its character , and Esther 's bewilderment , as she listened to this spirit-like melody , was complete . The strain was finished , and silence again brooded over the scene . Who the invisible artist was , and what his purpose might be , she could not guess . Was this vast wilderness peopled by aerial spirits , of which the old world 's grey mythology had not dreamed ? Were these viewless wanderers of the wood beneficent or malignant in their nature ? Had this mystic strain sounded upon her ear only to perplex her still farther , and lead her on into still deeper and more hidden intricacies of the forest ? She stood in that lonely spot , pondering upon the strange circumstances which surrounded her , and irresolute what course to pursue . Suddenly , as she looked towards the wood , which inclosed on all sides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motions of a living creature amid the branches of a tree . A feeling of terror came over her , and she remained with her eyes fixed upon the spot . She was not mistaken . It was not the evening wind which stirred the foliage . Presently a slender branch was moved cautiously aside , and Esther heard a low , whispering sound . Her blood began to freeze , the tongue clove to the roof of her mouth , and she remained motionless as a statue , awaiting , in silent horror , the danger which was to befall her . As she gazed upon the spot where she had perceived the motion of the foliage , with senses sharpened by apprehension , she now distinctly saw two bright , savage eyes glaring directly upon her face . What wild denizen of the forest it was , whether savage beast or still more savage man , she knew not . Her suspense was but short , for presently a shrill whoop struck her ear , and at the next moment a painted Indian , with bow and tomahawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her upon the rocky platform . Esther uttered not a sound , but dropped upon her knees raising her clasped hands in mute supplication . For a brief space the Indian stood stock-still , gazing at her in grim admiration . ' T was a strange , but fearful sight , could one have looked upon those two breathing statues , placed upon that rocky pedestal  --  upon the bronze , impassible savage , upon the motionless marble of Esther 's kneeling figure . How long they remained in this strange position , she could not tell , for into each of those moments was crowded an age of agony ; but it had at last its termination . The savage moved towards her , as she still remained there upon her knees , and with a succession of rapid gestures intimated that she must follow him . Finding her still immovable , he made use of one or two distorted English phrases , which produced as little effect . Becoming impatient at last , he strode forward , seized her by the hair of her head , and attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth in one wild shriek . The savage , unheeding her screams and struggles , and still bent upon his purposes , seized her in his powerful arms , lifted her from the ground , and was bearing her away , when suddenly another yell rose upon the air , and caused her foe to pause for a moment where he stood . In the next instant two other Indians , armed to the teeth , sprang nimbly upon the ledge , and confronted the captor and his victim . Finding himself thus beset , the foe of Esther placed her gently upon the ground , and stood for a moment at bay . It was but an instant , for he was soon desperately beset by the two new-comers . His resistance was but momentary , for finding himself so much overmatched , the wary savage , dexterously avoiding a blow which was near cleaving his skull , suddenly threw himself bodily over the high and precipitous rock , caught at a projecting branch of a stunted oak which grew half way down , and swinging himself nimbly from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esther remained , more dead than alive , upon the very spot in which her enemy had left her , hardly able to lift her eyes towards her new captors , and venturing scarcely to doubt that she had but escaped one danger to fall into another to the full as formidable . There was a brief pause of a few moments , during which she remained mute and motionless , but not insensible , when at last the silence was broken by a shrill and peculiar cry , uttered by one of the savages . After a brief delay , the cry seemed to be answered at a slight distance , by a clear , exquisite melody , played by the same instrument which had excited her wonder but a short time before . Esther knew not why , but her heart , which was almost dead within her , began to beat with a vague and trembling hope , as that delicate strain fell upon her ear . Earthly or aerial , the invisible musician seemed to be in league with her present captors , and it seemed impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . It was strange , but at that moment it seemed as if her curiosity was even stronger than her fears . She started to her feet , looked for the first time at her new companions , and was more pleased than astonished to find that the expression of their painted faces was not ferocious , and that their gestures seemed respectful . She stood anxiously awaiting the termination of the adventure with more of hope than terror . Presently a light step was heard in the thicket at the base of the ledge . She turned in the direction of the sound , and saw a slight but active figure ascending the cliff . The new comer was no savage . Esther saw it at a glance . There was still ample light to read his countenance , and she felt a sensation of relief as she looked upon the stranger , who was advancing softly towards her . His countenance was smooth and very fair ; the features were those of a delicate and beautiful youth . He was dressed in a somewhat fantastic but European garb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist , and held a kind of partisan or spear-headed staff in his hand . A small musical instrument , of peculiar structure , which hung carelessly upon his shoulder , left no doubt that the invisible musician , whose strains had so excited her wonder , stood in reality before her . If her fancy had been bewildered before , when she had but heard those singular melodies and knew not whether they proceeded from earth or air , she was not much less perplexed , now that she gazed upon the singular being who had thus presented himself before her . In the mean time the youth had approached , and stood gazing upon her face with eyes which spoke strange language . The expression of his countenance was earnest , at times tender , but changeable , and it ever and anon became wild and almost fierce . After gazing upon her for a few moments , he addressed a hurried observation , in an unknown tongue , to his two attendants , who , in obedience to what seemed a command , suddenly descended to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recumbent attitude upon the ground , awaiting the orders of him who seemed their superior . Esther and the youth were left alone upon the cliff . Observing that her new companion , whether friend or foe , remained silent and serious , gazing upon her countenance as if he would have read her soul , she felt a strange trouble . Determined , if possible , to put an end to this suspense , she collected her thoughts and addressed him , in low but firm accents . " I know not who or whence you may be , " she said , " but your looks are gentle , and your countenance shows you to be of English , or at least , of European lineage . " " You are right , lady ; " answered the stranger , in a low , musical tone . " My lineage is English , my birth-place England , although much of my life hath been passed in other climes . " " Then I can not doubt , " returned Esther , with more confidence , " that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless , by your agency that I have been saved from a fate of unknown horror . And , " continued she , with a shudder convulsing her frame , " if I lack words to express my gratitude , you can not doubt how sincerely it is felt . You know not who I am , but you see before you an English woman , not long a dweller in this wilderness , who hath unluckily lost her way in the forest . If you could guide me to the residence of Walter Ludlow , you would increase my debt to you a thousand-fold . Are you perchance acquainted with the spot where Walter Ludlow dwells ? " " I am , indeed , " said the stranger , with a wild and almost savage expression passing like a cloud across his beautiful countenance . " I know the residence of Walter Ludlow well . " Then I am sure , " cried Esther , " that I shall not urge you in vain to conduct me thither . " " I shall do so , Esther Ludlow , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have wandered far enough to perplex yourself , yet is the way homeward neither long nor difficult . I pledge myself to conduct you thither . " " Thanks , a thousand thanks ! " answered Esther . " I knew that your purposes could hardly prove unfriendly . But it seems that my name is known to you . " " Aye , lady , " answered the other , " your name and person are both well known to me . " " ' T is strange ! " cried Esther , " for surely never have my eyes looked upon you before . Is it , indeed , " continued she , musingly to herself , " is it indeed a gentle spirit of these ancient woods , sent hither to relieve me in my hour of peril ? " As Esther gazed upon the stranger , his very beautiful countenance , the gentleness and elegance of his person , so strangely contrasting with the savage scenery around them , and the romantic character of his whole appearance , almost authorized the belief that he was rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plighted clouds , " than a mortal denizen of the wilderness . " And know you my brother , Walter Ludlow ? " said she aloud . " I have never looked upon his face , " was the reply . " Why , this is stranger still , " thought Esther . " And are you a permanent sojourner in the wilderness ? " " Nay ; with me nothing is permanent , " replied the stranger . " Change , " continued he , " is the element in which I have my being . Ask of yonder purple cloud , " said he , pointing upwards , " which even now floats by the rising moon , and for an instant is steeped in its silver radiance , ask if its glory be permanent . Ask how soon it will be mingling its being in the tempest 's rack , and sweeping round the world , destroying and destroyed ? No , lady , change is my element ; alas , in all regards save one , save one ! " The enigmatical language of the stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something earnest and even tender in his looks and language , something gentle in his melancholy , that touched her heart and forced her to reject the fanciful supposition . " ' T is strange , " said she , " that my own person should be familiar to you , and that of Walter Ludlow unknown  --  " " Is Walter Ludlow the only dweller in the wilderness in whom you feel an interest ? " asked the stranger , abruptly . " Nay , " answer Esther , " there be many of the scattered settlers in this neighborhood who have my warmest sympathy . " " And yet , " continued the other , " there is one who hath sojourned here many months , whom one cause alone brought hither . ' T is strange , " continued he , abstractedly , " that there should be such power in a woman 's face , to lead across wintry seas , and to chain in howling deserts , one whose heart was careless , whose existence was bright . Let me look once more upon that face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Esther , laid his hand gently upon her shoulder , and gazed long and intently upon her , as if he would have read her soul . Esther started back and colored slightly , at this familiarity . A vague fear stole over her mind , but at the moment she seemed so entirely in the stranger 's power , that she was unwilling unnecessarily to excite his anger . Moreover , there was so much gentleness and delicacy in all his movements , that she felt , in spite of the loneliness of her situation and the mysterious character of her companion , a sensation of confidence , for which she could hardly account . " Fear nothing , lady , " said the stranger , in gentle tones ; " fear not that I should gaze too long or too fondly upon your face . Fate having thus accidentally placed me by the side of a sorceress , whose power I have dreaded , I did but desire to study the character of her enchantment . Fear not that I , too , shall feel the spell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may mutually and unwittingly inflict upon each other , when I swear to you at this moment that I wish you well , and that my intentions toward you are fair and friendly . One single question more , and I will lead you to the dwelling of Walter Ludlow . " " Speak on , " replied Esther , utterly perplexed by her companion 's language . " Do you love Harry Maudsley ? " asked the youth , with startling abruptness . Esther recoiled a step from her companion , as he thus addressed to her this extraordinary question , and hesitated a moment ere she replied . " I know not who or whence you are , " she said at last , " nor your motives , in thus taking advantage of my lonely situation to insult one who hath never injured you . It is base , it is unmanly , it is unworthy of an Englishman , of whatsoever creed or party he may be . " " Nay , lady , " answered the other calmly , " I meant not thus to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present situation , not to inflict injuries or insults , but to render you a service . I implore you to answer my question . Believe the word of one who wishes well to both of ye , when he swears that he hath no evil motive in asking a question , rude , perhaps , and sudden , but as honest as it is plain . Tell me , do you love Henry Maudsley ? " Esther felt extreme wonder that the extraordinary familiarity of the stranger did not , for some unaccountable reason , excite the indignation in her bosom , which she felt should have been aroused . The voice and manner of her companion seemed to divest his language of much of its intrinsic boldness . Something , too , of the indefinite impression that her companion possessed some weird influence over her destiny , and that his purposes were kindly , though mysterious , still lingered in her fancy , and was not without its effects . " I wish well to Henry Maudsley , " she replied , wondering , as she did so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " replied her companion , with even more excitement of manner . " I implore you for the last time , nay , I command you , to answer that question . Your own fate , his own , and that of others whom you dream not of , may be at this moment trembling upon your answer . An answer I will have , ere either of us leaves this labyrinth . Fate hath conducted me hither to read a riddle , and I swear to you that the riddle shall now be solved . " " Is this threatening language worthy of you ? " said Esther . " Is this an English gentleman 's courtesy to an unprotected woman ? " " Pardon me , lady , but I could set my life upon this cast . Whether I use threats , promises , or prayers , my object is the same , your welfare and my own . The moments are rapidly passing ; you know not how much of weal or woe your answer may effect . Answer me , I do not say truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but answer me at once . Do you love Henry Maudsley ? " " I do , " murmured Esther , in a soft , broken voice , overcome at last by the stranger 's passionate demeanor and her own vague fears . " Thank God for that answer , " cried the youth , with strange exultation . There was a pause of a few moments , during which Esther strove in vain to collect herself . The silence was broken by the stranger , who addressed her again in an earnest but a calmer tone . " Listen to me once more , " said he , " I give you a warning , which should have some value in your mind . Sport not with the happiness of two hearts which have grown together . Pervert not the destiny of Maudsley , nor your own . Maudsley loves you more than life . His fate is in your hands . " Esther , confounded , at times almost indignant at the language of her companion , uttered not a reply . There was another pause . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved towards Esther . " The night is advancing . Shall I not conduct you to your brother 's residence ? " said he . " Ah , let me entreat you to hasten thither , " replied Esther , " and spare me , I beseech you , for the remainder of our companionship , language like the mysterious words which you have lately spoken . Indeed , they trouble and perplex my soul . " Fear nothing , Esther Ludlow , " replied the youth ; " and now let me conduct you from this lonely spot . " As he spoke , he gently assisted her along the uncertain footing of the rock . When they had at last reached the bottom of the ledge the stranger whistled thrice . Forthwith two dusky figures sprang from the thicket as noiselessly as phantoms , and without uttering a word glided slowly before them through the thicket . The stranger seemed to be as familiar with every step of those bosky bourns as if he had been indeed a spirit haunting their sylvan solitude . A tortuous deer-path , winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead them from their leafy labyrinth . To Esther the path would have been almost invisible by daylight , but at night it seemed as if magic alone could enable their shadowy guides to pass thus rapidly before them through the thicket , and her slender and youthful companion to follow their track so carelessly and yet so accurately . After a rapid and silent march of some half hour 's duration , they emerged into a broad , open glade , which was familiar to her eyes . Through the majestic trees at the farther extremity , the level line of light streamed from the windows of her own cottage . Having reached this spot , the youth paused and once more addressed her : " We part at this moment ; whether we meet again I know not ; but remember my words of warning , and remember that I wish you well . There is one other warning which I meant to give you , and the hour has come . " " Speak , " said Esther , wondering what new mystery was impending , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her companion had in reality brought her in safety to her own dwelling-place . The stranger advanced closely to her , and once more laid his hand upon her shoulder . " Danger and distress threaten you , " he whispered hoarsely in her ear , " in the person of a certain mysterious knight . I tell you to beware of him . Shun him as you would shrink from a subtle and poisonous serpent . Distrust every word , every motion , every look . Farewell , Esther Ludlow , and may God preserve you from every danger . " There was a pause . Esther trembled , she knew not why , at the warning language of her companion . She collected herself , however , by a determined effort , and turned to thank the stranger for his safe guidance through the forest , but he was gone . She called in a loud whisper , there was no answer ; she advanced a few steps towards the forest from whence they had emerged , but the youth , with his shadowy attendants , had suddenly disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , she moved with a desponding step towards the cottage . As she approached her home , a tall , dark figure , bearing a lighted torch , suddenly crossed the glade , and strode rapidly towards her . " We have been searching for you far and near , " said a deep , earnest voice ; " thank God , you are found again . " Esther shuddered , for she recognised the voice of Sir Christopher Gardiner . CHAPTER VI . DISSIMULATION . A few moments later , and Esther sat within her own cottage walls . Every living creature had deserted it , for Walter Ludlow with his servants , alarmed at the protracted absence of Esther , were anxiously wandering through the forest in search of her . Esther was left alone with the knight , who , having found himself accidentally at nightfall in the neighborhood , had learned the alarming tidings of Esther 's absence from her brother , and had volunteered to assist them in the search . He was just returning from an unsuccessful expedition in a different direction from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments after the stranger had left her . Esther felt a sensation of despair as she found herself thus suddenly in the presence of one who had always excited a vague and unaccountable fear in her bosom , and against whom she had been at that moment so mysteriously warned . Overpowered by fatigue , and by the keen emotions which , for the last hour , had been agitating her , she sank almost fainting upon a seat . The knight gazed with a long , bold , impassioned glance at that form of majestic beauty , thus reclining before him , so helpless and so lonely . A wild fire danced in his eye . A cloud of stormy passion seemed sweeping across his brow . His features quivered , his frame shook with emotion . Suddenly he aroused himself , and with a strong effort seemed to control the struggling devil in his soul . " Fool , fool , " he muttered , " wouldst thou dash into fragments thus the work of years ? Has time brought no coolness to thy blood ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed himself in assisting Esther . He bathed her face with water ; he chafed her hands ; he employed all fitting expedients with the quiet but active tenderness of a woman . When she was partially recovered from her prostration , he administered to her a few drops of a potent restorative from a flask which he bore about him . After the expiration of a few minutes , she was herself again . She looked around in bewilderment , and started visibly , as she became aware of the presence of Gardiner , who , seated respectfully at a distance , was gazing intently upon her face . " Be not alarmed , Esther Ludlow , " said he gently , " although your brother is absent , he can not fail to return very soon . In the mean time , be assured that you are in the company of an earnest and sincere friend . " " Where is my brother ? " said Esther , faintly . " Alarmed at your disappearance , he is searching the forest , attended by his servants . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning alone from an unsuccessful search . " " Would that Walter were here , " exclaimed Esther . " He can not tarry long , " answered Sir Christopher ; " but if it be your pleasure , I will go forth and seek him . I may thus convey to him a little earlier the news of your fortunate appearance . " " Ah , do so , do so , " said Esther , with a shuddering , imploring accent , as if she were striving to exorcise a fiend from her presence . " I go , " said Gardiner , " although it grieves me to leave you thus unprotected ; it grieves me more , " he added with a sigh , " that my presence seemeth so odious in your eyes . " " Nay , nay , " said Esther , alarmed , lest her manner should have betrayed too much aversion , " but surely it is fitting that the anxiety of Walter Ludlow should be shortened as much as lieth in our power . " " Enough , Esther , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you shall be obeyed . Think not , however , that I should have been so base as to have taken advantage of this unguarded moment to urge a hopeless suit . You know , " he continued , seeming fiercely to control a rising feeling , " that these lips have never dared to speak of emotions which are older , deeper , fiercer , than dwell in many bosoms . Is it not strange that such a one as I have been , should be a changeling now ? Is it not strange that a wonderful and holy vision should have risen upon and illuminated my soul in this wilderness ? Aye , I have heard a voice crying out to me from the very depths of the desert . I looked , and behold , it was to me as if the gates of Paradise were opening upon mine eyes , as if I saw the celestial battlements thronged with the cherubim and seraphim , and heard the immortal strains of harp and sackbut , even from before the footstool of God ! I bowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And why speakest thou to me of these things , " interrupted Esther , " and least of all , at this place and season ? " " Because the floodgates of my heart have been for once broken open , and the long-imprisoned feelings rush forth beyond control , " answered Gardiner , with rising impetuosity . " I tell you , Esther Ludlow , that it is to thee , and to thee alone , that I owe this glorious vision . I care not what may be the issue of my mortal passion , nor to how hopeless a life of agony your fiat may condemn my heart . I shall always bless thee upon my knees , that thou , under God , art the cause of the new life that has been infused into my being . If , as I humbly dare to hope , the Holy Ghost hath descended like a dove upon the raging waters of my sinful heart , and at last found a resting-place there , thou , only thou , art the cause . Is this not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , if so poor a boon could in aught advantage you ? I speak not of earthly hope , but surely , surely thou wilt not reject the devotion of a heart which owes its salvation to your blessed example . " " Too much of this , too much of this , " cried Esther , rising from her seat , with a troubled and almost irritated demeanor , " let me implore you to delay no longer in seeking out my brother . This language , be it sincere or otherwise , sounds harshly in my ears , neither is this a fitting time nor place for such a theme . " Without uttering a word , and with eyes bent modestly and meekly upon the ground , the knight glided towards the door . He had scarcely opened it , when there was a noise without , the trampling of many feet , the blazing of many torches , and then Walter Ludlow , informed of Esther 's safety by a glance of Sir Christopher , rushed into the room , and folded his sister to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ludlow 's household , and fervent the thanks offered by them to Gardiner , who was supposed to have been a second time her deliverer from death . After a short time passed by the brother and sister in congratulations , Esther narrated her adventure briefly and succinctly . She dwelt as lightly as possible upon the singular and mysterious personage to whom her deliverance was owing ; but she was startled , as she alluded to the youth , to observe the dark and extraordinary expression of Sir Christopher 's face . He uttered not a syllable , but his dark eye seemed to plunge like a poniard into her heart . The expression , although fierce , was momentary . It had passed away sooner than the wonder which it excited in Esther 's bosom . Still , she felt an instinctive reluctance at dwelling upon the details of her adventure in Gardiner 's presence , and she accordingly related scarcely a syllable of the extraordinary conversation which had passed between her and the unknown . As the evening wore away , the conversation had rolled upon other matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Walter Ludlow that night , made some inquiries touching the expedition of Endicott , who was to have set sail many weeks before , and was hourly expected in New England . " I can conceive , " said he , " no nobler lot than his . To found an empire upon a great idea , to plant a seed silently in the soil of this wilderness , certain that , under the shade which will spring from that slender cause , whole nations will repose , is not an obscure , although it may be a painful and a self-denying lot . " " Only a petty soul , " replied Esther , who was pleased in spite of herself , at hearing language from Gardiner 's lips with which she could feel an honest sympathy , " only a petty soul would deem that destiny obscure by which a few humble individuals are singled out to lay the corner-stone of an empire such as the world hath not yet seen . None but petty souls would count the privations , the labors , or the tears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished . " " Aye , " said Gardiner , " to be not the Cadmus , nor the Romulus , nor the pirate chieftain , planting wild dynasties with the bloody hand , but rather the prophet and the lawgiver of an infant state  --  to be the Moses , the Joshua , of brave enthusiasts , who have turned their backs on home and happiness , only that their faces may still be turned toward God ; this is ambition worthy of a lofty soul ! " " Aye , " said Esther , " so seemeth it to me . England groans under the worst of tyrannies , the dreary tyranny of the mitre . Less dreary , less dead than such a land , is this howling wilderness . Whether such is to be forever the condition of our country , or whether at some distant day the star of hope is to arise , who shall be bold enough to prophesy ? For myself , I regret not my lot . " " Nor I , " said Gardiner , enthusiastically , " for if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be , methinks , after long and fearful convulsions . The promised land of religious freedom may be reached at last , but a red sea of human blood rolls between our suffering people and that distant shore . Better , far better , the air of the wilderness , better the wild altars , crowned with the virgin flowers of a purer world . " The hours rolled on . Esther was struck with the coincidence of sentiment and opinion between herself and Gardiner , and pleased , not only with the ready response which his eye and tongue seemed to render to her own language , but with the sympathetic anticipation by which he gave exact and eloquent utterance to her own thoughts even as she formed them . She seemed to lose something of her abhorrence of his person and character . " If Maudsley had but thought and spoken like this stranger , " thought she to herself , after the party had separated for the night , and she was alone with her own thoughts  --  " had Henry Maudsley thus comprehended the depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the aspirings of my soul . Alas ! he knows not how the heart which he hath outraged , might perhaps , with the blessing of God , have led his own to better and holier purposes . Alas ! Heaven smiles not upon us now ! " CHAPTER VII . AN ACCOUNT SETTLED . A few days after these events , Sir Christopher Gardiner was walking alone upon the beach of the western cove at Shawmut . He had come thither for the purpose of conferring with the eccentric hermit of the peninsula ; but had found him absent . Being anxious for an interview with him , he still loitered in the neighborhood of his cottage , hoping that ere long he would return . The knight was pondering deeply upon his position in New England , which was harassing and irritating enough , although he had already taken his resolution . As it will be soon more particularly related , the long expected colony of Puritans , under the guidance of Captain John Endicott , had at length arrived at Naumkeak . They were provided with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although , as yet , the grant was not fortified by a confirmatory charter from the crown , they expected that an ample one , in spite of all opposition and intrigue , would shortly be obtained . Thomas Morton , Gardiner 's chief confidant , ally , and instrument , had , as the knight used so frequently to prophesy , at last irritated the more orderly inhabitants of New England beyond endurance . The expedition against him , we have seen , had been successful . The Plymouth captain had at last , without the effusion of blood , secured the person of the Merry-Mount rioter , and had carried him off a prisoner to Plymouth . Here the defeated and deposed potentate had been summoned before the magistrates and elders of the colony , but had refused in a lofty manner to acknowledge their jurisdiction . After being detained several weeks a prisoner , he had been finally disspatched to England in a vessel sailing from the Isle of Shoals . He was placed under the charge of John Oldham , the man who claimed the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years before , had received such ignominious treatment from the Plymouth settlers . He had lately , however , for purposes of his own , become reconciled , in appearance at least , to those colonists , and it was a striking proof of their confidence in his character as well as his friendship , that the man whom they had , upon a former occasion , so bitterly wronged , should have been selected by them for so responsible a trust . John Oldham , in short , who had been buffeted , thumped , and literally kicked out of Plymouth in 1625 , was now charged with the guardianship of Thomas Morton . The lord of Merry-Mount was sent to England to answer to certain charges preferred against him here , the principal of which were , his dealings with the Indians , particularly his supplying them with gunpowder and fire-arms , and the riotous demeanor of himself and his companions at Merry-Mount . Gardiner had conceived a strong hope that the issue of the campaign against Merry-Mount , would , after all , tend to the furtherance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although his connection with Morton still remained a secret throughout New England , he feared it might be difficult to conceal their acquaintance much longer . The character of Morton was so reckless and boisterous , that it well nigh neutralized the advantage which might have been derived from his knowledge of the country , and his various accomplishments . If he could have held his tongue , he would have been an excellent conspirator . His brawling propensities made him mischievous . As for the knight himself , such was his natural genius for intrigue , and so highly had that faculty been cultivated during his adventurous life , that he really possessed at that moment only a dim and enigmatical existence in the wilderness . So mysteriously did he glide to and fro , now pausing a moment in the rude cabin of some hardy settler ; now roving over moor and mountain with the dusky children of the soil ; now mingling with the stern and melancholy Puritans in their severe and primitive worship , himself more stern and more melancholy than them all ; seen occasionally of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his residence and the time of his arrival in the country alike unknown ; he seemed but an unreal shadow , a phantom , appearing , vanishing , and re-appearing at different places and seasons , without a definite purpose , and almost without a real existence . So far , his mask had been securely worn , and the Plymouth people had no suspicion of his real character . This state of things could not , however , be expected to last indefinitely , and the knight , unfortunately , was obliged to consider his projects as postponed for a considerable time . It was therefore rather a relief to him than otherwise , when his anxiety as to Morton was terminated by the capture and deportation of that eccentric personage . In the next place , Gardiner conceived strong hopes from the fortuitous conjunction of Oldham and Morton . Here was a man expressly charged with the safe-keeping of his old ally , who had not only been deeply wronged by the Plymouth Puritans , but who had a powerful claim to a considerable part of the territory now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lawyer by profession , and possessed of no contemptible sagacity in the science , could not fail , in the course of a long voyage to England , to strengthen Oldham 's opinions as to the legality of his territorial claim . He was , moreover , almost certain , by his eloquent and sarcastic invectives , to arouse Oldham 's dormant indignation against the whole religious party in New England , to inflame his ancient prejudices , and to secure his valuable assistance upon their arrival in England . Much might be made before the New England Council , and more before the Lords Commissioners of the Oldham case . As for the charges against Morton , and the punishment likely to be measured out to him , Gardiner gave himself not a moment 's uneasiness . Letters which the knight , by the same ship which conveyed the prisoner to England , sent to powerful persons there , made it certain in his own mind , that the Lord of Merry-Mount would escape unscathed , and would be allowed to return to the new world whenever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still burning in Gardiner 's mind . Still he felt that his very soul was corroding in the wilderness , and he would have , perhaps , abandoned his enterprise altogether , dissatisfied as he justly was at the supineness of his English confederates , but for the sudden and extraordinary passion which had taken possession of his soul . Indeed , it is impossible to say how much influence the beauty and the imposing character of Esther Ludlow had exerted upon the destiny of this singular adventurer . In other scenes , and under other circumstances , a passion might not have mounted to such a sudden height , in a heart which had been swept by so many and such fierce emotions ; but he was idle , he was in the wilderness , and his jaded soul had just been sated with a passion which had burnt itself to ashes . At that very moment he had been aroused from the torpor which seemed to be creeping slowly over his existence , by the sudden emotions excited by the beautiful vision which broke forth upon him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than repelled , the depraved imagination of Gardiner . She seemed to him a priestess , a prophetess , a vestal ; and there was so much of the Clodius and the Catiline in his temperament , that the very sacredness of character which would have served as her protecting shield against many men , was in his eyes but as an enticing veil , enwrapping and enhancing her loveliness . And yet , when he found himself in her presence , he felt at times an unaccountable restraint . Like water dashed from the swan 's silvery but impenetrable armor , his impetuous thoughts seemed to recoil harmlessly from the innocence of her soul . It had been easy for him to ingratiate himself with the feeble and dreamy Walter Ludlow , but he felt that he had not yet obtained even the most precarious foothold in the mind of his lofty sister . It was this which impelled him forward , for to such absolute indifference he had not been accustomed during his wild career . Never had he found himself so absorbed by a sentiment , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastime . It was strange , but it seemed that , at last , his hour of infatuated passion had arrived . It was as if the hard remnant of his inmost nature , which , like the diamond , seemed the final essence of a thousand fires , had at last melted before Esther 's crystal purity , as the impenetrable gem dissolves in the burning-glass . Still at that moment , as he stood alone in the summer sunshine , his aspiring thoughts flew upward like eagles . To win so bright a prize was enough to repay his long and languid exile in the desert , even should his other lofty visions fade forever . But they should not fade . Though they seemed to roll themselves away into the azure distance , they were still gilded by the sun , and brightly in that imaginary splendor gleamed the gorgeous towers of his golden dreams . With his imagination bubbling like a witch 's cauldron , he paced to and fro upon that lonely beach , chasing the airy shapes which coursed one after another in long procession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he loitered in that solitude by the rippling waves , he was suddenly aroused from his reverie by the appearance of something white upon the water . It was a sail at the distance of about half a mile , advancing from the northward , and evidently making its way to the peninsula of Shawmut . Gardiner watched its motions , supposing that it was probably the solitary inhabitant of the promontory returning to his domain . As the boat neared him , however , his keen eye at once recognised the boat and its occupant , and a dark and singular expression shot across his features . He stood motionless , looking towards the little skiff , as it slowly drifted before the faint summer breeze . In a few moments the keel grated upon the pebbly beach within a few yards of the spot where he stood , and a man sprang hastily out , paused an instant to moor his boat , and then strode directly towards him . The new comer was Henry Maudsley . " Good morrow , Master Maudsley , " said the knight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visit to the hermit of Shawmut this afternoon , I fear , like myself , you are come but upon a fool 's errand . " " I thank you , Sir Christopher , for your information , which is doubly agreeable to me , " answered Maudsley , whose voice was low and husky . " I did indeed purpose a visit to Master Blaxton to-day , but I am fortunate , both in finding him absent , and in finding yourself as his substitute . " " Indeed , " said Gardiner , calmly , " and in what manner can I serve you , Master Maudsley ? In what way can I act as the representative of the holy clerk of Shawmut ? " " My affair , " answered Mandsley , with rising passion , " my affair with Master Blaxton can be deferred ; that with Sir Christopher Gardiner brooks no delay . " " Indeed , " said Gardiner , with a sneering affectation of curiosity , " have we such pressing business to settle ? Pray , let me remain no longer ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . " " With all my heart , " said Maudsley , unsheathing his sword with a sudden movement . " Hey-day , hey-day , Master Maudsley ! " said the knight , in an accent of astonishment , unbaring his own rapier , however , with lightning-like rapidity ; " was your voyage to Shawmut this morning made for the special purpose of my assassination ? If it be not presumptuous , I would fain ask your cause of quarrel . " " I have no inclination to waste these precious moments in idle brawling , " answered Maudsley . " Your own hypocritical heart will tell you in clearer tones than mine , our cause of quarrel . You have escaped me once , through , I could almost believe , supernatural agency . Should I fail a second time to chastise your villany , the fault would be mine . " " These be bold and bitter words , " returned Gardiner , who seemed for some mysterious reason to be singularly averse to an encounter with Maudsley . " But stay , the days are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searcher after truth . Enlighten me , for by St. John , you shall take nothing by your braggadocio humor , and shall lose nothing by a more perspicuous course of conduct . " Maudsley stared at the knight in profound astonishment . He was utterly at a loss to understand what possible motives could restrain him from accepting a combat thus fiercely urged upon him . Of his courage and skill at every weapon he entertained no doubt , and his imperturbable coolness at this particular juncture , proved that he was acting deliberately . Maudsley , as we know , before the particular cause for his hatred had occurred , had already conceived a peculiar and unaccountable detestation of Gardiner , which the knight had upon all occasions appeared very cordially to reciprocate . There had always seemed something more than caprice in Maudsley 's aversion , and Gardiner 's conduct had always been apparently dictated by some secret , but decided motive . In short , it seemd that Maudsley was governed either by interest , or presentiment , or by both , while Gardiner 's hatred was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for Sir Christopher , he seemed to have an especial motive for self-control , and he stood in a careless attitude of defence , like a reposing gladiator , calmly , but fixedly , regarding his antagonist in the eye , and silently awaiting his response . " I came nor here to play the fool , " said Maudsley at last , " nor to answer to any catechism . Neither am I disposed to enter upon a detail of grievances of which you are as well instructed as myself . If you must have reasons , let this suffice , " and , as he spoke , the impetuous youth endeavored to strike his antagonist with the flat of his sword . " Fairly and softly , " answered the knight , coolly , but adroitly , recoiling a few paces to avoid the proffered insult . " If there be really so many and such weighty reasons already existing , why invent fictitious and imaginary ones ? Tell me frankly and nobly , as befits the dignity of this imposing solitude , tell me plainly your wrongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , you shall have vengeance . " Maudsley was more and more irritated , and yet more and more perplexed . An impetuous , passionate man , particularly if he be very young , is very apt to be worsted in an altercation with a cool , adroit man of maturer years , and he is the more likely to be worsted if he happens to be entirely in the right . Feeling sure to be baffled in argument , because he felt himself too angry to utter an intelligible syllable , he took refuge for the moment in silence . " Then you persist in denying me your catalogue of grievances , " continued Gardiner , after a pause . " ' T is strange , but one would have even expected eloquence from your lips upon such a subject . Since , however , you will not speak , and since I have no more desire than yourself for prolonging this interview , I shall myself state your cause of quarrel . It lies in an almond shell , good Master Maudsley , even in the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made a fierce , quick , gesture of assent . " Jealousy is a common passion , " continued Gardiner , " a common cause of quarrel . I will not say that in some respects there may not be foundation for your jealousy . But , good Master Maudsley , where many strive but one can be chosen . " " In one word , " cried Maudsley , boiling over with his hitherto painfully repressed wrath , " I pronounce you a hypocrite and a villain . Whence and wherefore sprang the hatred which I have borne you since your dark shadow first fell across my path , I ask not . There may be hatred at first sight , it seems , as ardent as first love . That you are a hypocrite , I know . Your object is the perdition of one who , in her saintly purity , is as far above your sphere as heaven from hell . I know that your designs are all artful and base , and that your whole existence in this wilderness , of which you prate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And think you , " answered Sir Christopher , still preserving the same careless attitude , in spite of Maudsley 's violent language , " and think you to arrogate to yourself a monopoly of jealousy ? Think you that the dark passion finds its only home in your bosom ? Think you that I , even I , " continued he , with an ominous expression upon his dark brow , and with a voice of rising passion , " am a stranger to your sweet and stolen interviews with a certain gentle , blue-eyed , mysterious youth ? Think you that I am your laughing-stock and your dupe ? Hath your effrontery grown to such a height that you defy me to the teeth , with your saintly heroics touching the fair Puritan ? Shame on you , shame , Master Maudsley ! " A sudden light broke upon Maudsley 's mind as the knight gave utterance to these taunts . He stood for an instant bewildered , and hardly knowing what to reply , or whither this strange interview was tending . He was far from suspecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although so suddenly enlightened as to a part of the mysteries which had Page 098 enveloped him . He replied not immediately , but stood leaning upon his sword , and reflecting for an instant upon his course . " Fool , fool , " muttered the knight to himself  --  " Are my projects , after all , to be foiled by the rash temper of this hot-headed boy ? I thought him already in my power . Hath the charm failed ? By heavens ! it shall be decided , and at once . Hark you , my gentle master , I have a word for your most secret ear , " said he aloud . " And fear you , " said Maudsley , " that yonder crows will prate of your secret , that it must be whispered in the silent wilderness ? " " Nay , nay , my quick-tempered friend , " replied the knight , " but there be many words and many matters which sound more becomingly in a whisper , even though there be no lurking ear in the whole universe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I say  --  ! " With this , the knight strode hastily forward to Maudsley , and whispered in his ear for half a minute . Maudsley started , as if a serpent had stung him . " Liar and villain ! " he cried , almost beside himself with fury .  --  " It needed but this to set my soul on fire . Defend yourself ; for nothing human shall restrain me longer . " With this Maudsley threw himself madly upon Sir Christopher , who now entirely upon his guard , received his onset with perfect calmness and precision . Maudsley , by profession a soldier , was daring and skilful with his weapon , but he was inflamed by passion . Gardiner was a consummate swordsman , and besides , was wary and collected . Finding that his project of making Maudsley useful to him had failed , the knight was now desirous of being relieved of the embarassment caused by his presence in New England . The combat proved desperate but brief . Maudsley , after a few fierce passes , which were skilfully parried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushed within his adversary 's guard . His rapier 's point was upon the knight 's breast , and it seemed that his last and desperate thrust must necessarily , at that instant , terminate the adventurer 's career , when , to his astonishment and rage , the treacherous blade , encountering some hidden obstacle , shivered at the hilt . At the same moment as he stood disconcerted and defenceless , the knight sprang nimbly forward and passed his rapier through his body . Maudsley glared at his foe with a last look of defiance , and fell to the earth without uttering a sound . Sir Christopher stood stock-still for a few moments , gazing upon his prostrate adversary , while a thousand dark emotions chased each other across his brow . ' T was thy destiny , " he hoarsely muttered , " thy destiny and mine . I swear , I sought to spare thee , but thou shouldest not have crossed my path . Have I not avoided thee as my evil genius ? My God ! " exclaimed the knight in a still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maudsley , " what a terrible resemblance , closer and more fearful even than in life ! The same haughty features , the same chestnut locks . My God ! that icy look , that ghastly resemblance will haunt me to my grave ! " Muttering thus incoherently , Gardiner stood musing in that terrible companionship , till the cloudless midsummer 's sun was nearly set . His level beams poured full across the glassy cove , and rained a flood of light upon the spot where Maudsley lay . It was a fearful contrast ,  --  that virgin wilderness , that golden summer sunset , and that scene of blood . Sir Christopher Gardiner had been familiar with scenes of violence even from his boyhood , but there was something appalling to him in the solitude which had been just profaned by the desperate affray . It seemed to his heated imagination , as he gazed around him , as if the world had suddenly renewed its infancy , and that the first murder had at that instant been enacted . His brother 's blood seemed to cry to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he felt the hot brand searing his forehead , and fled from the spot like the guilty and conscience-stricken Cain . CHAPTER VIII . THE SECOND APPARITION . The hermit of Shawmut had devoted a long summer 's day to a solitary excursion in the wilderness . He felt no fear in rambling to and fro , either upon his bull , upon his feet , or in his boat , for he was regarded with considerable reverence by the natives , with whom he occasionally came in contact , and to whom his skill in pharmacy had often rendered essential service . He was indeed , as was natural , looked up to by those scattered and benighted creatures , as a being not belonging to earth , and possessed of superior attributes to mortals . His striking , and almost ethereal appearance , his solitary habits , and his abstracted and dreamy manner , contributed not a little to encourage this belief . That morning , he had been tempted by a summer 's breeze to put forth in his little skiff , which experience had taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after tossing about for an idle hour or two upon the billows of the cove , amused himself by entering the mouth of the river which discharges itself into the bay nearly opposite his abode . The slow and tortuous Quinobequin , as the River Charles was then more properly called , which , as Captain John Smith had already informed the world , " doth pierce many days ' journey into the entrails of that country , " was a river whose calm , deep , almost stagnant , and at the same time highly erratic character , was singularly in harmony with that of the profound , wandering , gentle , unimpassioned hermit , who , first of civilized beings , then dwelt upon its banks . A brawling , shallow , headlong stream , now whirling through gravelly ravines , now dashing down precipices of granite , would have been no fitting companion for the exile . Blaxton thought , as he idly floated up the long reaches , or rowed himself against the lazy current , in the short , sudden coils , by which the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream was a fit emblem of himself . Winding noiselessly and obscurely to and fro among the woods and meadows , the river flowed calmly along , with scarce an eddy upon its glassy surface , silent , but deep , hesitating , meandering , and yet , after leagues of its serpentine motion , accomplishing so little , that a child in a few bounds might measure the whole length of its actual progress towards its goal . Still , within its unruffled depths were ever mirrored Nature 's freshest charms . The forest-crowned hills came from afar to bathe themselves in its tranquil flood , the serene heaven , with its floating clouds , the silver majesty of the moon , the countless troops of stars , and even the effulgence of the day-god himself , were daily and nightly reflected in its placid bosom . And was not this a compensation for the absence of that restless energy which would have hurried it faster to the eternal sea , but would have shivered its transparent surface into a thousand fragments , and rendered its nature tumultuous and troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour he loitered in his bark along that solitary stream . Although gentle and quiet , there was still variety in his inland voyage . Here , the river coiled itself , like a silver snake , through a wide expanse of meadow , where , if he stepped ashore , the rank grass , unconscious of the scythe , grew higher than his breast . Anon , he floated into a more secluded reach , where the stream dilated for a moment to a mimic bay , where his oar would disturb a fleet of anchored wood-ducks . Again , as the river narrowed itself within its banks , a grey and decaying trunk of some fallen tree would almost obstruct his passage , from which the basking turtle would drop hastily and heavily into the stream , or the headlong frogs dash themselves off in nimble and grotesque alarm . At times , his course lay through broad and level meadows , where grew only the ringletted and drooping elms , the most graceful , the most feminine , and the most fragile of trees ; and which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes like bending , graceful , suddenly metamorphosed nymphs , with their green tresses sweeping the ground , stood , singly or in detached and picturesque groups , along the moist and open meads . Again , the river would lose itself beneath shadowy and deeply wooded banks , where the tangled forest grew close to the water 's edge , where the various melody of summer birds was never silent , where the whir of the strong-winged partridge would fall suddenly upon the ear , where the slender deer would steal timidly forth to slake its thirst at the river 's brink , or the grim figure of the brown , indolent bear would appear for an instant through the thick curtain of the midsummer foliage . There , the maple , the birch , the alder , and the oak , were all matted together , in intricate luxuriance , and the hermit would often pause to contemplate some Laocoon-like group of mighty trees , entangled , interlaced and suffocated in the vast coils of some serpent-like grape-vine . A thousand flowers of brilliant hues , decorated his lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its broad lotus-like leaves and flaunting flowers , now clogged his pathway ; and now , a multitude of white and fragrant water-lilies thronging around his bark , like troops of amorous , odor-breathing water-nymphs , seemed to woo him to repose . The delicate arrow-head , with its spikes of pale and tender blossoms , the intensely brilliant cardinal flower , which looked as if it should be transplanted to some ancient cathedral window-pane , where placed upon the bosom of some gorgeous saint , its vivid crimson should reflect the sunlight for ages ; the stately eupatorium , the fragrant azalea , the gaudy sunflower , and a host of other nameless weeds , grew in rank and tangled confusion along the oozy bank . The hermit moved slowly along his watery path , solacing himself with the accurate observation of nature , which was the business of his life , ever and anon pausing to cull his simples , to collect his herbs and flowers , with which his little canoe was already amply freighted ; now losing himself in the vague reveries , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some spreading tree , to take from his scrip and hastily to consume his slender repast . Thus , upon noiseless wings , flew the golden hours of that summer 's day . Towards nightfall , the solitary had returned from his excursion , and anchored his bark close to his cottage . Entering his humble dwelling-place , he busied himself a long time in assorting the additions which he had that day made to his collections of natural history . When he was at last wearied of his task , he knelt down and offered up a prayer of gratitude of Him who thus sustained his faltering steps in that remote solitude . He then turned over the leaves of his Bible , pondering as he read . The hours stole on , the slow-moving finger of his clock already pointed to midnight , his eyelids were already heavy with sleep , when the vast silence around him was suddenly broken by a fearful shriek . The hermit started to his feet , the scream seemed to pierce his heart . He burried to the window and looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starry . The scream was not repeated , and for an instant the solitary again strove to persuade himself that he had been deluded by his imagination . Sleep , however , had been scared for a season from his eyelids , and he sat listening to the loud beating of his own heart , and in anxious expectation of a repetition of the vision which had once before so much agitated him . He was not mistaken . Within a very few minutes , which , however , had appeared to be ages , there was a noise without as of a stealthy step . Blaxton sprang to the window again , and , as he did so , actually confronted the same mournful face , which had once before visited him at the dead of night . Exactly , as upon the previous occasion , the vision was of one very dear to him , who had been long laid in the grave . The beautiful face , with its deep prophetic eyes , was in startling proximity to his own , and looked in upon his midnight solitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggered backwards a few paces , overcome by the suddenness of the apparition . He recovered himself , however , very soon , by a powerful effort , but the face had already vanished from the window . He rushed from the house into the midnight air , and as he did so , he distinctly saw a figure gliding among the trees across his lawn . It seemed to bend its course towards the water 's edge , and to pause when very near the beach . As it paused , Blaxton thought he heard a repetition of the scream which had at first alarmed him , but it was so much fainter as to be almost inaudible . Impelled by an irresistible impulse , he followed unhesitatingly in the pathway of the mysterious figure , as it rapidly glided before him . After a moment 's pause , however , at a particular spot upon the beach , the vision seemed suddenly to fade away . Whether it was a figure of flesh and blood , which had evaded his pursuit by a sudden retreat through the briery swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hermit could not tell . In an instant , he had reached the spot where it had disappeared , but he could discover , however eagerly he strained his eyes in every direction , no further traces of its presence . While he stood agitated , and pondering upon the meaning of this second mysterious visitation , he suddenly heard a faint groan . It seemed to proceed from the ground , and almost from beneath his feet . He stooped to search in the dim starlight , and amid the rank grass , for the cause of this singular sound , when to his astonishment and horror he became aware of the presence of a corpse lying seemingly stark and stiff almost at his feet . There seemed now to be some cause for the various mysteries which had lately so perplexed him . Why he had been thus visited , and what was to be the result of these apparitions , he knew not , but he felt a vague terror taking possession of him , as he stood there in that midnight solitude , with that ghastly companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen an influence upon his imagination , a short time before , he had in a measure interpreted . The vision of the aerial ships he had explained by the arrival of the Naumkeak colony soon afterwards ; and now it seemed to him that the phantom sword had portended the scene of violence and bloodshed , which appeared so recently to have been enacted near his own threshold . His thoughts , which were wandering into infinite space , were , however , suddenly recalled to earth again , by a repetition of the groan . His sympathies were at once aroused , and bending over the prostrate form of Maudsley , he discovered , by the faint beating of his heart , that life was not wholly extinct . Without hesitating any longer , and exerting all his strength , he lifted the body from the ground , and bore it with difficulty to his cottage . CHAPTER IX . ENDICOTT AT NAUMKEAK . Many weeks had passed away . It was now early in November , and the hundred emigrants who , two months before had arrived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established at Naumkeak . That narrow tongue of land , covered with thick forests up to that epoch , and tenanted only by the two or three scattered families , of whom these pages have already spoken , had already undergone a considerable change . Walter Ludlow 's solitary residence was now upon the skirts of a little village . It was , to be sure , a village of but a dozen thatched and mud-walled hovels , and had been constructed with great rapidity during the autumn , that the emigrants might have some refuge against the rigors of their first Massachusetts winter . Although the coming winter had allowed , as yet , but few prognostics of its severity to be felt , although the climate still seemed tolerably mild , yet the sufferings of the settlers had already begun . The scurvy raged among them like a pestilence , fevers and inflammatory disorders , induced by low diet and exposure to a new and treacherous climate , had already assaulted almost every family , and in the immediate future the icy spectre of the approaching winter , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like threatening phantoms , but as terrible realities . In the centre of the little extemporaneous village , stood a mansion of much more considerable dimensions than the huts which surrounded it . A two-storied house , consisting of a skeleton of timber-work , filled in with bricks , and having a projecting roof , which was covered with red tiles , was the most prominent object upon the clearing . The materials out of which this edifice had been constructed had been brought from Cape Ann . Within the lower apartment of that dwelling were assembled several persons of grave and earnest appearance . A frugal midday meal had just been partaken of by the company , who were of both sexes , and a conversation upon serious and important matters had succeeded to the repast . At the upper end of the board sat a person of striking appearance ; and yet he was neither handsome in countenance nor commanding in figure . The man was a little under middle age and a little above middle stature . He wore a Geneva skull-cap , a doublet of dark-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other habiliments of so grave a character , that he might have been easily taken for a clergyman , had it not been observed that his hand rested habitually and rather caressingly upon the iron handle of his long rapier , and had not the bold expression of his features and the restless glancing of his eye , forbidden the supposition . The lines of his face were stern and energetic , but somewhat harsh and heavy . The short grizzly locks , the heavy moustache and chin-beard of iron grey , the decided brow , the inflexible mouth , were all expressive of command . It was the physiognomy rather of a man of action , than of a profound thinker , and yet there was much in its character which was deliberate , earnest and imposing . Altogether , the whole appearance of the personage who sat at the head of that humble board , gave assurance of a man . This was Captain John Endicott , the man who had been intrusted by the newly organized Massachusetts company with the command of the first emigration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs . " You understand me then , thoroughly , Master Conant , " said he , addressing a grave and hardy looking personage who sat near him , who was the most prominent of the few brave and persevering settlers who had preceded Endicott 's arrival at Naumkeak . " You understand my views , and that of the company whom I represent , entirely ? " " Truly , Master Endicott , I think we have at last arrived at a settlement of all disputes , " replied Conant , " and I rejoice that all our differences are fairly healed . " " The company , which has been organized for a great and sacred purpose , is determined to send hither none but pious , orderly and energetic men , " continued Endicott ; " and to send no idle drones , neither to permit any such to remain within the limits of their patent . " " I believe you have effectually destroyed one nest of hornets , " answered Conant , " by your late expedition across the bay . " " Aye , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caterpillars , " answered Endicott , " and I am truly beholden to our neighbors of Plymouth , and to their trusty captain , Master Standish , for his well executed capture of the master mischief-maker of that ungodly crew . How called you him , Master Conant ? " " Thomas Morton , sometime a pettifogger of Furnival 's Inn , " replied Conant , " and lately principal Master of Misrule at the place he has profanely denominated Merry-Mount . " " And which is henceforth to be denominated Mount Dagon , " answered Endicott . " The vile reveller is disposed of , and the places that knew him shall know him no more . I have dispersed his infamous crew , and have cut down the idolatrous May-pole , with which he dared to profane this pure and sacred wilderness . " " Aye , " said Conant , " it was almost your first deed in New England , and a worthy commencement of your career . The place was a den of infamy , and a rallying point for loose vagabonds and peace-breakers , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper motive even than the promotion of peace and order , by my immediate invasion of Mount Dagon , " said Endicott . " I am now awaiting instructions from the company , touching many matters . I am , however , already enjoined to assume immediate possession of all the important points , particularly the maritime points , within the patent , and to expel , at once , all persons who are not instantaneously obedient to my authority . These orders I intend to execute , and promptly too , " he concluded , slightly pounding the floor with his sword as he spoke . " The expedition of the three Spragues is , I believe , already successful , " said Conant . " It is so , " said Endicott . " It was all-important to occupy the peninsula of Mishawum , both from its natural advantages , and because it is the key to the whole portion of the territory claimed by a busy faction in England , which is adverse to the company . The three brothers have acted promptly . They found a solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they tell me , Walford by name , and a blacksmith by trade . Do you chance to know him , Master Conant ? " " I know but little concerning him , " was the reply ; " a bold fellow enough , and a hardy pioneer , but restless , I believe , and uncomfortable , and more than all , a boon companion of Master Morton . What said he to the Spragues ? " " He said nothing to the Spragues , " answered Endicott , " saving that the peninsula of Mishawum belonged to him , both by right of occupation , and by grant from the lawful possessors of the soil . He refused to acknowledge the authority of the Massachusetts Company , or to have any dealings whatever with us . " " He claims the peninsula of Mishawum under lease from one Oldham , " said Walter Ludlow , who was present at the meeting , but who had not yet spoken . " Oldham , Walford , Morton , and howsoever else they may be called , " answered Endicott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T is a proud and powerful race , and their chief , or rather the most energetic among them , is Sir Ferdinando Gorges . He is known to have many agents scattered about in the wilderness , under assumed names , and please God , I intend to scatter them all to the four winds . For what said Moab unto the elders of Midian : This company shall lick up all that are round about us , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field . " ' " There may yet be trouble from the efforts of John Oldham , who hath so lately gone for England , " resumed Roger Conant . " Never fear , Master Conant , " answered the governor , " the charter is as good as passed ; but there is one measure now in contemplation , which is likely to assure the prosperity of the colony beyond all peradventure , and to place it entirely above all the efforts of its enemies . " " And what may that be ? " asked several of the company in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , " answered Endicott , " but I see no reason why it should be not confided to our discreet and trustworthy associates here . Know , then , that it is contemplated by many of the most eminent and most wealthy members of the Massachusetts Company in England , not only to embark a portion of their worldly goods in this adventure , but to do a far greater thing . " " And that is to visit the country in person , perhaps ? " said Conant . " Aye , to visit the country , " answered Endicott , " and to leave their own forever . If the effort to obtain the charter be successful , of which I entertain not a doubt , the next move will be to obtain , either silently or explicitly , the royal permission to transplant that very charter to the wilderness . In case the right is obtained , a large number stand engaged to transplant themselves hither . The worthy Winthrop , of Suffolk , hath resolved , in this event , to convert his manor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and all his worldly goods for America . Many of the Lincolnshire folk have taken the same resolution . " " These be good tidings indeed , " said Conant and others , " and I rejoice as unfeignedly as even you could do . Truly , when I first heard of the formation of the new company , my mind did much misgive me , whether we old planters might not be likely to suffer some injustice at their hands . Thanks to your upright and Christian conduct , however , Master Endicott , we have exchanged the spirits of heaviness for the garments of joy . " The conversation now turned on many local topics . The arrangements to be made by the company touching land allotments , ministers ' support , and the beaver monopoly were discussed , upon all which points Endicott made satisfactory statements to the old planters . " And pray , Master Governor , " said a withered little old man , who sat near Roger Conant , " doth the company reserve to itself likewise a monopoly of tobacco ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the company disapprove of the planting ; firstly , because they do account it a pernicious weed , and secondly , because the profits upon it are likely to be but small ; yet they are disposed to be indulgent in this respect to the old settlers , if tobacco planting be by them considered necessary to their proper sustenance and comfort . " " Aha ! this is , indeed , generous and equitable , " said Goodman Musselthwaite , whipping out a tobacco pipe as he spoke , which he proceeded very deliberately to light . " Tobacco , worthy Master Governor , is meat , drink , and feather-beds to us rusty old pioneers of the wilderness . Without tobacco , look ye , it is hard to be fat and comfortable , with one 's head upon the same pillow with a wild cat 's . " " Or with tobacco either , " returned Endicott , looking gravely at the parched and shrivelled physiognomy of the old planter ; " howbeit , the company hath determined to forbid the cultivation of the weed to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be permitted to raise the vegetable for their own consumption and for exportation , but it is upon no account to be sold within the limits of the patent , being considered by the government of the company as contrary to good health and good morals . " " Truly , you surprise me , worthy Master Governor , " ejaculated Goodman Musselthwaite , with a whiff of astonishment and tobacco smoke  --  " I regret to learn at this time and season , that my health and morals are in so perilous a condition , for I could find it easier in my heart to forswear board and lodging than my tobacco-pipe . " " Forgive me , Goodman Musselthwaite , " returned Endicott , " I am enjoined to forbid the use of the weed to the new comers only , saving and excepting ancient men , and such others as may through illness occasionally require it . " " I hold that the company is wise in these regulations , " replied Roger Conant , " and I am well pleased that you have been enjoined to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rather that such things have necessarily been much neglected in this wilderness . " " Ye can assist me in many respects therein , " answered Endicott . " Observe well the morals of those in your immediate neighborhood . See that no loose habits be tolerated for an instant . Govern all the sinfully inclined with a rod of iron . Smite them hip and thigh . Above all , tolerate no new-fangled heresies in religious matters . We have sought the wilderness to build up altars upon the true and only model . Demolish all other altars , should any such be raised . " " The company , then , " said Walter Ludlow , " are not inclined , I perceive , to a toleration of the various forms of the Christian religion . " " May God , in his infinite mercy , forbid , " thundered Endicott , indignant at the very idea of toleration . " I tell ye all that there is but one road to heaven , but ten thousand ones to hell . All they who live under my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have not undertaken this great business that we might erect a general haberdashery shop , where every canting coxcomb or fribbling madam might purchase a new fashioned religion every day to suit their sickly fancy . No , Master Ludlow ; keep a strict watch upon the restive imaginations and frothy consciences of the novelty seekers . Cooper them up , and that roundly and soundly , my worthy friends , with the strong hoops of comfortable coercion . Otherwise , these effervescent and yeasty consciences will explode every day , to the manifest detriment of our infant commonwealth . " " And so I understand , " said Ludlow , " that you hold by the Geneva creed , and that you are not inclined to recognise fellowship any longer with the Church of England . " " Most truly , " replied Endicott , with continued sternness of manner , " and of all matters which do most move my spleen , Master Ludlow , the chief is that mischievous vice which men call toleration . No , no , my good friend , tolerate me no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grindstone , and sharpen them , if you can , till they have a keener scent for the road which leadeth to heaven . If that will not serve their turn , why , even grind them off as soon as may be . " A general approval of these sentiments , so dogmatically laid down by the doughty governor , was manifested by a grave shaking of heads and wagging of beards , by his sad garmented , earnest looking companions . CHAPTER X. THE PESTILENCE . There was a slight pause in the conversation , during which a person entered the room , and whispered to Endicott , and then to Esther Ludlow , who had been sitting all this time , listening in attentive silence to what was going forward . As soon as the person had communicated his message , she arose from her seat , and quietly left the room . A shade passed over the stern brow of the governor , and his iron features seemed to be moved by a momentary convulsion . The emotion , however , whatever it was , seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation with his companions . " Look ye , Master Conant , and you , Master Ludlow , " said he , " these be blank register books , which , at the company 's request , I propose shall be kept in every family of the colony . I purpose to appoint an overseer to each family , whose duty it shall be to keep an authentic history of each day 's business . Idleness is the mother of mischief , Master Ludlow , and I mean that every hour of every day shall be chronicled , with the employment and the amount of work of each member of each family , from the father down to the youngest child . I purpose that every child born in the colony shall be brought up to some useful occupation , whereby he will be more likely to obey his spiritual instructors , and to walk in the way of the Lord . I intend , by means of these registers , that the governor and the council shall at any moment be able to read the lives and the characters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their authority . href= " http : **52;1549;TOOLONG ? i d=eaf285v2 &image=285-359.jpg"; name=f285-359Page image - Page 116 . Thus shall the patriarchal days of the old world be restored , and sin , thus busily watched for , shall be scared out of our infant community . " So saying , the governor gravely distributed to Conant , Ludlow and to others , whom he had appointed overseers , the registers , in which the history of the little colony was thus minutely and daily to be recorded . " I believe , " continued he , " that the objects of our present meeting , which were duly to discuss all matters which might create difference between the old planters and the new , have at last been satisfactorily adjusted . " " Even so , " answered Conant , " the company hath been wise and fortunate , both in their prudent resolutions , and in their selection of so discreet and upright an agent as Master Endicott . " " I furthermore propose , " said the governor , " in view of this peaceful settlement of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new comers and their predecessors , to baptize this spot of the wilderness by a new name . Nahumkeak is its present denomination , in the barbarous language of a barbarous people . " " So is it called , " replied Walter Ludlow , " but I am inclined to believe that the term , even like these wandering tribes themselves , is of Hebrew origin . I am not altogether unskilled in that tongue , in which the blessed Scriptures were first promulgated , and I find there an apt and happy derivation for the word by which this wilderness spot hath hitherto been known . " " And what may that be , Master Ludlow ? " asked the Governor . " Nahumkeak , " continued Ludlow , " deriveth plainly from two Hebrew words , which , being interpreted , signify the haven or the bosom of consolation , and a pleasanter or more prophetic designation than this , I could not desire for our new settlement . " " And so think I , " said Roger Conant , " and I confess a desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of suffering . " " Nevertheless , I propose to change it , " returned Endicott , in a somewhat peremptory and arbitrary manner , " and henceforth I propose that it shall be called the City of Salem , in memory of the covenant of peace , this day concluded between the new comers and the ancient planters . In Salem is my tabernacle , and in Zion is my dwelling-place , saith the Lord . " ' " Be it as you will , " said Ludlow , " although I should be even as well contented to know my old resting-place by its old name . " " I could be as well content likewise , " said Conant , " and do desire to have no hand in changing its appellation . Nevertheless , I say with Master Ludlow , be it as you will . Peace is , at least , happily established among us . " " And therefore shall it be commemorated by this new and sacred name , " said the governor , " and so no more of these matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been puffing his pipe in solemn silence , during this long session , and whose voice now sounded like the boding raven 's , " verily , I marvel that ye should discuss the prospects of this little colony so closely . The pestilence walketh among us by noon-day , and assuredly the ill-starred colony must perish speedily . " " I tell thee , man , that this colony shall never perish ! " thundered Endicott , striking the ground fiercely with his sword , as he spoke . " No , although , as in Egypt of old , there be not a house where there is not one dead . No , let the pestilence stride among us , let the grave yawn and swallow us . Still shall this goodly work go on , for the finger of the Lord is in it . I fear not the savage , nor the winter , nor the pestilence , and under God , I have sworn to fulfil the sacred trust reposed in me . I , even I , with the blessed Redeemer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this right arm be withered , bone , marrow , and muscle , if it doth not cheerily bear up the load imposed upon it , so long as this heart of mine beateth within my bosom . " The stern and choleric Puritan strode forth into the middle of the apartment , as he spoke , and looked around him with flashing eyes . His rude but impressive figure seemed to dilate into colossal proportions , as he stood in the centre of that earnest group , looking and speaking almost like an inspired prophet . Stern , sudden , choleric , but earnest , undaunted , untiring , he seemed more like Joshua , the son of Nun , rebuking his faltering followers , and invigorating them with his own overflowing inspiration , than like a mortal of earth 's mould . " What tell you me of famine , of pestilence , of danger ? " he continued . " I tell you , man , that my people shrink not , for the Lord sustaineth them , and the road to heaven is no nearer from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But should their hearts faint by the wayside , should they cry to me , even as the children of Israel cried unto Moses , saying , because there were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us away to die in this wilderness ; even then do I feel that within me , which could lift them up from the sloughs of despair , and sustain their footsteps even till they reached the firm ground . " The withered little old planter , somewhat abashed by this burst of fierce enthusiasm , which his observation about the pestilence had elicited , seemed desirous of withdrawing himself from observation beneath the smoke-cloulds which he furiously emitted from his pipe . In the mean time Conant , looking respectfully towards the governor , observed ,  --  " Since the subject hath been mentioned , let me express my deep regret , that the worthy Dame Endicott should be , even now , dangerously ill with the fever , which hath made such havoc in the colony . " " Aye , " replied Endicott , calmly , " the wife of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even unto death , but God in his mercy may yet withdraw this cup of bitterness . Her sufferings are , at this moment , but light , and an angel from heaven , even now , is ministering at her bedside . " " What mean you , Master Endicott ? " asked Conant , in some surprise , and as if he believed the governor 's mind bewildered by the stern suppression of his natural emotion . " I mean , " said Endicott , speaking with some difficulty , for his voice seemed choked at times , in spite of his sternness , " I mean that her sufferings seem at the moment light , and that all which could be done by the gentle hand of woman , to alleviate pain , is rendered to her hourly by one who seemeth to me to walk among us more like an angel than a woman . I need scarcely add , Master Ludlow , that I speak of your sister . " The brother was already gone , but Brackenbury spoke ,  --  " You may well say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel than a woman , for it hath , truly , often seemed to me , that she must possess powers greater than human , to sustain herself amid the trials and the dangers to which she hourly exposes her life . Since this fearful pestilence first began to rage among us , she hath been untiring . Not a cold hearth but hath been warmed , not a starving family but hath been fed from her bounty , not a bedside at which she hath not ministered . Providence hath been more bountiful in worldly goods to Master Ludlow and his kindred , than to most of the indwellers of the wilderness , but Esther Ludlow holdeth her substance as a sacred trust from the Almighty , and dispenseth it accordingly . " " And may the blessings of those who were nigh to perish , descend upon her head ! " said Endicott . " Who dares murmur , when this fair and feeble creature alone seemeth endowed with strength enough to sustain , upon her own shoulders , so heavy a burthen of suffering and sorrow ? Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers , she alone , would be more than sufficient to uphold and to comfort the people , and with her own weak hand , directed by the Lord , to establish them beyond all peradventure in this goodly land . " The company now began to separate , each gravely saluting the governor as he departed . Endicott followed the last guest to the door of his dwelling-place , and walked forward a few steps upon the clearing . As he stood , musing and solitary , at a short distance from his door-step , a young man , who was one of the recently arrived colonists , saluted him . " A shrewder atmosphere this , than the air of England , most worshipful governor , " said he , with a certain flippancy of manner which jarred upon the ear of the stern Joshua of New England ; " and a marvellously sickly climate I fear me . Marry , if this pestilence continue longer , I shall even leave the dead to bury their dead , and take shipping for England . " The governor suddenly turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignation as he spoke . " Peace , Master Crowther , " he cried , imperiously ; " such peevish repinings vex me to the soul . I had hoped that the grain had been well winnowed and sifted before we took this goodly work in hand ; but I find , to my sorrow , that there are still some grains of worthless chaff left in the bushel . " " If your worship meaneth to reproach me as being the chaff in the bushel , " replied the young man , with increased pertness of demeanor , " I could be well contented to be cast unto the wind , so that it might blow me over the seas to merry England again . Marry , chaff or wheat , I have at least been well ground between the upper and nether millstones of famine and pestilence , like the rest of your misguided followers . " " Peace , babbler , I say ! " thundered the governor , deeply incensed , both at the pusillanimity of his follower , of which he had been for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that ye shall find let or hindrance from me . I will myself provide shipping for all the chicken-livered dullards whose cowardly stomachs yearn already for the fleshpots of Egypt . " " Beshrew me , most worshipful governor , " said Crowther , " but it seemeth to me , that one who is so unlucky as to find himself , against his will , in the midst of tribulation and scurvy , might be at least spared such scurvy language . Why , pray thee , am I to be so sternly rebuked ? " " For three different reasons , young man , " replied the sturdy governor , " each of which is enow to prevent all friendly converse between us two at this moment . First , because thy cowardly desertion of a good cause , into which thou rather forcedst thyself than wert chosen , hath moved my indignation . Secondly , because thy insolence , in the presence of thy magistrate , deserveth chastisement . Thirdly , because the very hair of thy head witnesseth against thee , and with its preposterous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy apostles , long ago , forbid such sinful bedecking of the head ? Know ye not that the longest hair hides ever the emptiest brain ? " " Marry , good Master Governor , " said Crowther , somewhat provoked in his turn , at the rebuke thus roundly administered to him ; " I am yet to learn that the Lord hath especially commissioned thee to superinted the decking of our outward man , or that any such authority hath been granted by the company . I understand thoroughly , however ; thy aversion to long hair . Men say thou wert educated as a surgeon , a barber-surgeon , and doubtless thy fingers and scissors itch for the handling of our hair . " " For the cropping of thy ears , insolent whelp ! " muttered Endicott , repressing by a strong effort his indignation at the increasing insolence of his companion . " We have all our aversions , good Master Endicott , " continued Crowther , with arms akimbo . " You can not abide a head of flowing locks . For me , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with  --  . " More had the flippant Crowther , perhaps , spoken in this vein , had not the choleric governor , inflamed beyond all bearing by this last sally , suddenly dealt him a swinging box on the ear . The young man ; stunned as well as surprised by this unexpected buffet , which the governor did not vouchsafe to accompany with a single word of explanation , measured his length upon the grass . Upon recovering his consciousness and perpendicular position , he ventured to suggest , but in a marvellously discomfited and crest-fallen tone , that this was a kind of treatment to which he was unaccustomed , and which he considered thoroughly unbecoming upon the part of the chief magistrate of the colony . " Get home , Master Malapert , " thundered the governor in reply , cutting short all further remonstrances , " get home upon the instant , or I promise thee that within fifteen minutes shall a pair of stocks be constructed , and that thou shalt have the honor of sitting in them for the first time , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy superiors . Haddest thou tarried at Jericho till thine own beard was grown , thou wouldest have had less occasion to insult the grey hairs of thy elders , and the colony would have been well rid of a drone . " The governor concluded with a peremptory gesture , at which the discomfited Crowther sneaked away without any further observations . Endicott remained standing upon the spot for a few minutes , and began to rebuke himself severely . He was a man of quick temper , accustomed to military command , requiring implicit obedience , bigoted in his religious opinions , but of indomitable courage and great sagacity . Such a man of iron , rigid , unyielding , incisive character was , perhaps , the true and only instrument by which the first foundations of the Puritan commonwealth could have been hewn out in that stern and rocky wilderness . After rebuking himself , more perhaps than he deserved , for the excess into which his warm temper had carried him , his mind reverted to his wife , who had followed his fortunes with the unshrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but whose tender frame was evidently sinking under her situation . He had watched by her couch with a tenderness such as could hardly have been looked for beneath that rigid exterior ; and his labors had been alleviated , as we have seen , by the assiduity of Esther Ludlow . He returned pensively towards his home , and , with a slow step , ascended to the chamber where the sufferer lay . It was a low , mean room , with one small window . The floor as well as the walls were of rough planks , and the scanty furniture , as well as the equipments of the humble couch where the dying woman reposed , were of the humblest description . The private apartment of that Puritan governor was not luxurious . It was almost squalid , although in the best and fairest house of the village , and looked more like the den of a starving pauper than the chamber of a magistrate . Some large logs were smouldering upon the hearth , which , as the only window was darkened by a cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solemn light throughout the room . Upon a rude block of wood , close by the pillow of the sufferer , sat Esther Ludlow , her eyes overflowing with silent tears . There sat that fair Puritan , over whose head there almost seemed a halo , a visible emblem consecrating the presence where all that is most gentle and heroic in woman , seemed embodied . Endicott entered the apartment noiselessly , and paused for an instant upon the threshold . A tear trickled down his iron cheek as he looked towards the rude pallet , where she , who had forsaken all to follow him into that desert , now lay struggling with death . The mortal reward which she had reaped for her devotion , was a few months of sorrow , and a death in the wilderness . But to the exalted enthusiasm of Endicott , as confident in the shadowy compact which he had long since made with the ruling power of the universe , as in his agreements with his terrestial employers , a crown of glory seemed already descending upon her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as she was aware of his entrance , to indicate that the weary sufferer was asleep . He fell upon his knees in silent , fervent prayer . Life was still fluttering about the feeble heart of the victim . Motionless , upon outspread wings , the death-angel seemed to hover above her head , lingering , reluctant , as if his purpose had been changed by the mutely-appealing , protective form of Esther . CHAPTER XI . THE WARNING . Late in that November afternoon , Esther Ludlow walked from the governor 's house towards her own home . Dame Endicott still lingered , but in a hopeless and insensible state , and Esther , whose rude but commodious dwelling-place had for some weeks been converted into a hospital for the many exiles , whom the pestilence and famine had stricken , now bent her steps homewards to fulfil her duties there . She had , herself , recently dispatched a messenger to Plymouth , who bore a letter from Endicott to Governor Bradford , praying that the services of the worthy and eminent Doctor Fuller , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older colony , might be extended to the suffering colonists of Naumkeak . In the mean time the whole superintendence of this hospital devolved upon her brother and herself . The enthusiasm of Esther sustained her in these dark hours . She flitted among the suffering people like an angel of mercy , shedding blessings from her wings . She had at last found her sphere . The vision which had been displayed before her exalted imagination so long , seemed at last to change to reality . The foundation of that great religious asylum beyond the sea , seemed , al last , securely laid . Not appalled by the gloom which hung over the birth-day of the colony , not daunted by the dangers which rose like spectres along its course , she felt her heart beat high within her as she contemplated the sublime motives , the unwavering courage , of the leaders of the undertaking . She rejoiced that Providence had at last revealed to her a mode in which she might prove , otherwise than in idle rhapsodies , her deep devotion to the cause which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She rejoiced that her comparatively wealthy condition , and her habituation to the climate , enabled her to render essential services to those starving , perishing martyrs . Charity , in marble or on canvass , is an attractive , adorable image , but the exercise of the virtue in reality , and in detail , is far less picturesque . Esther was true to her mission , which she felt had been intrusted to her by the hand of the Lord . She never faltered , she never repined , not a cloud obscured the brightness of her face , which diffused a radiance around the gloomy hovels where she was a daily visitant , and where to many a weary soul she seemed like one clad in the shining garments of a better world . Yet she had sorrows of her own , and her heart was sad when she thought of Henry Maudsley . To her it seemed that they were hopelessly separated . She had not seen him , she had heard no tidings of him since that inexplicable interview in which he had heaped so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had thrown around her neck the chain , of which he had possessed himself in so mysterious a manner . She supposed that he had already crossed the ocean , never to look upon her face again , and that he believed her fickle , deceitful , capricious . As she thought of this , as she thought how incapable he had proved himself of reading her soul , as she remembered the stinging words , more poisonous than adders ' , with which he had tortured her when last they met , her proud soul mounted , indignant and resentful , to a height from which she looked down with pity upon one so perverse and so misguided . And yet she could not but acknowledge , in her heart of hearts , that life had forever lost its brightness , and that a portion of her soul was withering never to blossom again . Brooding over these melancholy thoughts , Esther strayed pensively homewards . The twilight was gathering , and she had already left the last hovel behind her , which intervened between the little village and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of the vast pine trees which skirted her own domain , she felt a sudden , but gentle touch upon the shoulder . She turned quickly around , feeling but slight alarm , for she supposed herself probably accosted by one of the settlers , when to her surprise she beheld a person whom she had certainly never seen before , and who , at least by that dim and uncertain light , seemed hardly human . A withered , leathern , apish , malicious face , lighted by two sparkling , toad-like eyes , a supple , lithe , baboon-like figure , whose restless and erratic movements seemed altogether involuntary , were the characteristics of the personage who now presented himself to her astonished eyes . As soon as this extraordinary creature found that he had attracted her attention , he suddenly threw a somerset high in the air , and alighting upon one leg , he thrust forth a carefully sealed packet in his brown and shriveled paw . As Esther , manifesting considerable repugnance and alarm , seemed reluctant to take the letter , and anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shrill voice , the name of Henry Maudsley . As the loved name struck her ear , Esther instinctively reached forth her hand and snatched the packet , whereupon the singular creature uttered a chuckling laugh , threw another somerset , and disappeared in the thicket . As soon as her strange companion , who was no other than Peter Cakebread , had taken his departure in this whimsical manner , Esther hastened to her own cottage , tore the seals from the mysterious packet , and read , by the light of a pine torch , the following lines : " A fearful danger is impending over thee , Esther . Thine own hand only can avert the blow . One who hath no further claim upon thy heart , hath yet sworn to devote his life , if necessary , to solve the mystery which envelopes at this moment thine own destiny and his . But all efforts will be fruitless , if these words do not alarm thee . I know , I deplore the infatuation which hath involved thy fate with the fortunes of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this my farewell missive , to beware of him , Shun him as thou wouldest perdition . Power or right to say more at this present , I have not . Within a few days , I purpose to take shipping for England , with but one purpose in view , to enable myself to solve my own doubts , and to arm myself with authority to tear off the garments which disguise a hypocrite , a villain , and a malefactor . Think not that wounded pride or petty jealousy dictate my course . No , Esther , thou wilt not judge me thus harshly . Were I doomed to perish at this hour , still , with my latest breath would I implore thee to break forever from the meshes which surround thee , before thy destruction be accomplished . One word more , and I have finished . To thy loyalty I trust that this communication may be buried in oblivion , and that no living being hear from thy lips of my existence , either in this wilderness or in the world . Henry Maudsley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitude of Shawmut had not yet been invaded by any detachment from Endicott 's colony . Although the brothers Sprague had already established themselves in the neighboring promontory of Mishawum , where , until their arrival , the burly blacksmith had dwelt in undisturbed repose , yet the hermit Blaxton still maintained himself upon his beautiful peninsula . He had , however , for many weeks past had a companion . We have seen at what a critical moment he had found Henry Maudsley . The hermit 's skill in pharmacy , aided by the vigorous constitution of the wounded youth , had at last frustrated the malice of Sir-Christopher Gardiner . The knight , never doubting of his death , had been withheld by a feeling not natural to him , but which , for particular considerations , was an overpowering one in this case , from putting foot upon the peninsula . The corpse of his victim , lying unburied upon that solitary beach , was a sight from which he shrank . Although , at times , he felt disposed to summon up his old energy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all forced to submit to what seemed a decree of destiny . However much he essayed to conquer his repugnance , however important it had been at times for him to visit Blaxton , still would the spectre of the murdered Maudsley rise up before him , and scare him from his purpose . The reasons , which so excited his imagination , will be more fully developed hereafter . Maudsley still lived , however , and after many struggling weeks , during which his life had been trembling daily and hourly in the balance , he had at last recovered . It was a singular dispensation which had placed him in Blaxton 's hands . Had this opportune succor been extended to him by any other person , the whole wilderness of New England would have rung with the strange adventure . As it was , no living soul but himself knew all the circumstances of the case . His antagonist believed him dead . The Ludlows believed him in England . Blaxton knew not , for he never inquired in what manner he had received so desperate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been impossible , in the hermit it was perfectly natural . His extreme abstraction from all worldly interests , as well as a singular delicacy which instinctively forbade him from intruding upon Maudsley 's confidence , had kept him not only silent , but perfectly incurious . During his patient 's convalescence , he had peremptorily refused to listen to a disclosure , which he saw was offered with a secret unwillingness , and induced by a feeling of gratitude . The two companions were thus at once put at their ease , and the cause of Maudsley 's involuntary intrusion upon the hermit 's solitude , was never again alluded to during its continuance . Their discourse , when they did converse , was wholly upon other matters . The solitary 's thoughts , as we know , were discursive , and seldom closely related to surrounding circumstances , so that during the protracted period of the wounded man 's convalescence , they had ample opportunity to put many a girdle about the universe , but were never once in danger of descending to details which might perhaps have embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mornings which are sparingly sprinkled through the earlier half of a Massachusetts November . There was a thin , golden haze in the sky which the faint breathing of the south-west was not sufficiently powerful to lift , the water of the western cove sparkled like silver , and the gently diversified amphitheatre of hills which surrounded it , was softened by that purple , cloud-like tinge which is so characteristic of Italian landscape , and which occasionally usurps the place of the vitreous and dazzling clearness which more peculiarly belongs to American scenery . The woods , with the exception of the oaks , where the shrivelled foliage still tenaciously clung , were leafless and desolate . Gaudy October , with her robes of a thousand dyes , had vanished , her glittering diadem lay crushed upon the ground , while sad November , like a grey , discrowned queen , with pensive brow and mourning weeds and melancholy pace , followed in the jocund footsteps of her departed sister . The dark pines still lifted on high their fadeless plumes , but throughout the rest of the forest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the yellow , starry blossoms of the witch-hazel , that mysterious plant which adorns its leafless sprays with golden flowers , just at the approach of winter , as if it loved to decorate the pale and lifeless corpse of nature . Blaxton held a flowering twig of this weird and singular shrub in his hand , as he strolled that morning by his forest fountain , indulging in an erratic conversation with Henry Maudsley . Inspired by such an accidental circumstance as this , he could wander off into illimitable space , torturing the subject of his observation into a thousand similes . " Observe these golden stars , " said he to his companion , who looked abstractedly at the branch , but whose thoughts were far away , " are they not aptly clustered upon this wizard plant ? ' T is fitting that the tree , whose every twig is a divining rod , able to guide the skilful seeker to mines of unsunned gold , should wear such golden stars . It wears them in winter , too , for are not the flowers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile at winter 's impotent cold ? " " They are indeed pretty flowers , " answered Maudsley , carelessly , for his thoughts were upon other matters ; " I remember that you informed me of their importance in pharmacy ; of their singular healing properties . " " And yet , " continued the hermit , who had informed him of no such thing , but who , as usual , did not hear a syllable that was addressed to him , " and yet is there not a prophetic warning in this late blossoming ? The divining tree puts forth its flowers when all the gladness of the green earth hath passed away ,  --  even so do the golden flowers of wealth too often delay their unfolding till the hair of the seeker is grey , and his blood cold , and his heart as withered and leafless as this shivering forest which surrounds us now . " As he spoke , he broke off all the little twigs from the branch which he held , leaving only a bare and forked stick , the proper form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk to and fro about the open glade near the fountain , holding the rod between the thumbs and fore-fingers of both hands , in an elevated position . " The rod , as thou knowest , young stranger , " continued the solitary , who had never yet inquired Maudsley 's name and history , about which he was profoundly indifferent , " the rod serves as well to indicate the crystal veins of living water , which fill , like innocent milk , the maternal bosom of nature , as to direct the thirsty gold seeker in his feverish pursuit . " The hermit continued gravely pacing to and fro along the withered turf , holding his divining rod lightly in his hands , while Maudsley , lost in thought , scarcely attended to what was passing . At last , the rod which had obstinately maintained its elevated position , began slowly to turn in his fingers , and after a little while pointed directly down upon the earth beneath him . " Were I a gold seeker now , " said he , standing perfectly still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divining rod pointed , " I should feel sure that this indication could not mislead . Thank God , however , I am not a money digger . In all the vagaries of my useless life , I never sought for gold . How melancholy , my friend , seems to a contemplative recluse , the pursuit of wealth . Unhappy the wretch who , holding ever a divining rod in his weary hands , pores still with bent shoulders and aching eyes upon the dark recesses where nature hides her gold , and never sees the blue sky above him , nor the bright sunshine , nor the gay flowers which blossom for rich and poor . " ' T is strange , " continued he half unconsciously , after a pause , " but the rod hath pointed almost exactly to the little cellarage where I have buried my iron box of papers . Perhaps Sir Christopher 's documents which lie with them may be as golden as his visions . " As the solitary thus soliloquized , he tossed away the twig . Maudsley had not heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about speaking upon another subject , when the whimsical figure of Peter Cakebread suddenly presented itself . That respectable and practical individual had evidently heard the hermit 's concluding observations , and very gravely , secretly , and accurately , took note of the spot , which Blaxton had thus carelessly indicated . As soon as he had done so , he made a triumphant leap into the air , and stood for a moment upon his head , by way of announcing his arrival to Maudsley . As soon as the hermit became aware of the presence of this personage , he turned upon his heel , sauntered away in search of his bull , and was a few minutes afterwards seen sweeping through the park at a headlong pace . Maudsley , in the meantime , eagerly accosted Cakebread , from whom he received not only an account of the safe delivery of his missive to Esther Ludlow but also a small parcel of papers , which the messenger took with a mysterious air from his bosom . A singular expression passed over Maudsley 's countenance as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's apparent hesitation and reluctance he began eagerly to devour their contents . The respectable Peter Cakebread , as we have omitted to inform the reader , had gone into the service of Sir Christopher Gardiner , after the lamentable overthrow and departure of his former master , the Lord of Merry-Mount . It will be , however , remembered , that he had received a certain memorable flagellation at the hands of the knight , which a person of his particular temperament was not likely to forget or forgive . He had , however , entirely dissembled his hatred , in order more fully to gratify it in the sequel , and he was accordingly very glad , upon the general breaking up of the establishment at Merry-Mount , to accept Sir Christopher 's offer of employment . It is unnecessary to state the details of the manner in which he was first presented to Maudsley 's notice at Shawmut . Suffice that he had been bound to secrecy by the most cogent of arguments , and that the existence of Maudsley was still quite unknown , as well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peter Cakebread , with the tendency to investigation which marked his character , had omitted no opportunity , at odd moments , thoroughly to search the house of Gardiner , and in so doing had discovered many papers which threw some light upon the private history of the man who had excited his curiosity as well as his deadly hatred . Although Gardiner had deposited with Blaxton , some months before this epoch , a large portion of his important papers and correspondence , yet there were enough remaining , which related more to his own personal matters , to excite if not to gratify the malicious curiosity of Cakebread . It may be judged with what satisfaction he had heard Blaxton 's accidental remark , although he carefully avoided mentioning the matter at that moment to Maudsley . Now it chanced that the papers already found seemed to bear some relation to the Maudsley family . Having been sent upon an errand to Blaxton , in consequence of the knight 's repugnance to visit Shawmut , he had been accidentally brought into contact with Henry Maudsley , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired . Maudsley would naturally have shrunk with horror from a surreptitious examination of papers obtained thus by stealth , even from one who was his deadly foe . The name of Edith Maudsley upon one of the documents , however , happened to strike his eye at the first glance which he threw upon them . Thereafter , and for very sufficient reasons , he felt no restraint , but without the slightest compunction , was ready to plunge , by any means , into the very heart of the mystery . Still , however , he was doomed to be baffled , for the information which he gained was but fragmentary and unsatisfactory . He acquired a clue which led him to some distance and awakened some deep and decided suspicions , but still the affair remained perplexed , and the proof incomplete . It was necessary for him to visit England , immediately and secretly , to probe the matter to the bottom , and he waited his restoration to tolerable health and strength with great impatience . He had , in the solitary perverseness of a jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief in Esther 's infatuation for the adventurous knight . He felt that she was lost to him , but his generous nature recoiled from the thought of permitting her to lose herself forever . But there were other and still more powerful cords which bound him and the knight in one destiny . At least his suspicions , founded upon something much stronger than surmise , were now added to the inexplicable sensations which the first sight of Sir Christopher had excited in his mind . As far as he knew , he had never met him in any other part of the world , and yet there was a mysterious feeling excited by his presence  --  a feeling like a dim reminiscence of a previous existtence , for which he could not account , and which , he could not , by any effort , wholly banish from his imagination . Had he been acquainted with the connection of the knight with the Gorges family , he would probably have made much more rapid strides towards an elucidation of the mysteries , but it so happened that the documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Ferdinando , and related mostly to a period of time long past away . Later papers , which very probably might be in existence , had not yet been found by the diligent Cakebread . Under a full view of the circumstances , therefore , Maudsley could do no more than write the enigmatical letter to Esther , previous to his departure to England . To him , henceforth , Esther was as nothing , but his own honor demanded a thorough investigation of the character of the person at whose hands , as he now believed , he had suffered more than one outrage , and whom , he hoped ere long , to punish as a felon , not as a rival . Cakebread had informed him of the safe delivery of his mission to Esther , and there was now nothing more to detain him in New England . A small vessel was to depart the next day from Naumkeak , with a cargo of furs to the company in England , and in that vessel he had determined secretly to embark . CHAPTER XIII . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low , purple bank of clouds brooding along the south-western quarter of the horizon . In spite of the genial temperature of the atmosphere , and indeed in consequence of it , Maudsley , who had lived long enough in the climate to understand its character , knew that a storm , and probably a heavy snow-storm , was impending . He had , however , taken leave of his hospitable and eccentric entertainer soon after the interview with Cakebread , which took place early in the forenoon , and , assisted by a favoring breeze , he had made a rapid passage to Naumkeak in Blaxton 's little skiff , which Cakebread was to restore , upon the succeeding day , to its owner . It was not his purpose to make his presence known , either to the Ludlows or to any other of the colonists , and he had already placed his effects on board the vessel which was to sail for England early the following day . Late in the afternoon he wandered about the woods in the neighborhood of the little settlement , carefully avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself from the observation of any casual wayfarer from the village . The scene was bare and desolate . The short-lived glory of an Indian summer 's morning had long since given place to the chill , leaden atmosphere of a winter 's afternoon . The rising north-easterly wind sighed mournfully through the leafless forest . The withered leaves , eddying and whirling with every sudden gust , swept around him with a ghost-like sound . The dried branches crackled beneath his foot . The waving branches of the pine trees sent forth a dirge-like sound , in which he seemed to hear the requiem of all his earthly hopes . The boding cry of a sable company of ravens , which were winging their way across the tree-tops , jarred upon his ear like a funereal wail . A few flakes of snow were already flitting through the gloomy atmosphere , which was pregnant with the coming tempest . All around him looked barren , desolate , and in gloomy unison with his own broken existence and withered hopes . As if in mockery , it seemed that the example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural effect upon his impressionable temperament , just at the very moment when she seemed lost to him forever . Bitterly did he reproach himself now , for the wanton reproaches which he had so profusely dealt upon her faith , or , as he had then termed it , her fanaticism . Every idle word which he had uttered in his scornful moods , recurred to his fancy now with vivid distinctness . Each word seemed a scorpion whip , and memory an avenging fury ; and yet it was all too late . Whence , he thought , except from some juggling fiend , could come these holy promptings , at a moment when every thing swam around him , and when his faith in every thing pure and holy was destroyed by the discovery of Esther 's feebleness and falsehood . It was all a mockery . He beat down the rising feelings of religious faith , as he would have trampled upon a tempting demon . Thoughts like these were whirling through his brain , as he moved now slowly , now rapidly , through the melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the irregular clearing , at the extremity of which the infant village was situated , he heard a dull sound , as of an iron instrument striking the frozen turf . He stepped forward in the direction whence the sound proceeded , and found a solitary individual digging a rude grave . He gazed upon the scene with a gloomy kind of satisfaction . The snow was already falling thick and fast , the shades of evening were prematurely approaching , all nature seemed arrayed in gloom . The grave-digger was a thin , feeble figure , and as he ever and anon laid aside his rusty pickaxe , and struck his arms to and fro across his breast , to arouse the warmth in his shivering frame , he looked almost like a shadowy creation of the fancy . As he resumed his labor again , there seemed something in his countenance familiar to Maudsley , who presently recollected the features of Faint-not Mellowes , the Suffolkshire weaver and pilgrim from New Plymouth , whom , as has appeared in the earlier pages of this history , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His gloomy task required no little labor , for his arms were weak and the earth was rigidly frost-bound . It seemed that the inhospitable wilderness , which had greeted those early pilgrims with so cold a welcome , and inflicted upon them so many fearful sufferings , would almost deny to their dead a resting-place in its bosom . It was a melancholy scene , in which , at that moment , Maudsley and the grave-digger were the only actors . They stood at the edge of a clearing of some twenty acres , at the opposite extremity of which were huddled together the few miserable mud-walled and coarsely thatched hovels , which , with the " fair house " of the governor , constituted the village of Naumkeak . A thin wreath of smoke rose above the forest a little beyond the farthest house , indicating to Maudsley the hidden residence of her who was all the world to him , and who yet was lost to him forever . The ground immediately around him was rough and broken . Vast , blackened stumps , looking like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for centuries , encumbered the soil , and among them were thickly strewn the many recent and rudely finished graves , where the stricken settlers , day after day , ever since their arrival in that desert , had come to deposit their dead . There , in their wild resting-places , hastily and scantily hidden from the prowling wolf , slept those early victims , those obscure but unforgotten martyrs . The soil of the wilderness was already hallowed ground , and if England contained the ashes of their forefathers , New England already held the green graves of those who had been nearer and dearer to them . Maudsley looked on for a few moments in silence , and then stepping forward , he gently saluted the grave-digger ,  --  " ' T is sorry weather , Goodman Mellowes , for so melancholy a task as that which occupies you , " said he , " and your strength seems hardly sufficient to accomplish it . " Mellowes desisted from his labor , and stared , with marks of great surprise , at the individual who thus suddenly addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , " thou hast caused me to drink of the wine of astonishment . Lo ! is it not Master Maudsley who saluteth me ? " " Most truly , " answered Maudsley , " but in what respect is my appearance so astounding ? " " Verily , I did opine that you had long since returned to the flesh-pots of Egypt , " answered Faint-not  --  " and yet do you now present yourself to me thus suddenly in fleshly garb , but pale and haggard , and rather resembling a visitant from the land of spirits than the stalwart youth whom I do remember some months ago . " " I have been indisposed of late to be sure , " answered Maudsley , " but I hardly thought that I wore such a death 's head upon my shoulders , that even the Naumkeak grave-digger would shrink from my society . But be of good heart , my worthy friend , I am neither ghost nor goblin , and furthermore , rest assured that you at least shall not have the task , which seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this wilderness , inasmuch as I purpose to effect my retreat before that last friendly office shall be necessary . " " Alas ! worthy master , " replied the weaver , " I regret that thy heart hath not been regenerated , that thou mightest know how sweet is the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in a justified person . But while I am prating thus , my work languisheth ; lo , Iam forgetful . " So saying , the grave digger again applied himself to his task . " My friend , " said Maudsley , after looking compassionately at the feeble Faint-not 's painful efforts , " let me prove to you that my frame is not so exhausted as you think . Give me your instrument , and with your permission , I will even assist you in hollowing out this trench . A grave in this wilderness will be a quiet resting-place enow , even if an unregenerate hand hath helped to dig it . " Notwithstanding the remonstrances of Goodman Mellowes , who was , however , nearly fatigued and not unwilling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the spade and pick-axe , and steadily set himself to his voluntary task . There was a nameless instinct which impelled him to the work , besides a simple and good natured desire to lighten the load of the weary Mellowes . " I regret , worthy master , " said the weaver , continuing his conversation , as he stood upon the outside of the grave and occasionally directed the labor of his companion  --  " I regret , in very sooth , that thy heart is , as thou callest it , still unregenerate . I do remember me full well , how , and where , and at what very moment , the Lord was graciously pleased to reveal himself to me . It was of an October evening , five years now past and gone , that , at three quarters past nine of the clock , during a smart shower of rain , even as I was taking a pipe of tobacco in the kitchen of my cottage in Great Brixsted , in Suffolk , my wife and children being then all soundly asleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereupon I  --  " " I pray thee , Goodman Mellowes , " said Maudsley , purposely cutting short the worthy but somewhat prosy weaver 's history of his religious experience , to which , at that particular moment , he felt no inclination to listen ,  --  " I pray thee , hast thou really abandoned Plymouth and established thyself permanently at Naumkeak ? " " Truly , I have , " was the reply , " although many months ago , I did , as thou knowest , purpose to bring my children and wife even back to New Plymouth . " " I recollect , " replied Maudsley , still busily pursuing his task , " but why did you change your mind ? " " Owing , as I would humbly and with reverence believe , " answered Faint-not , " to a special interposition of Providence , who deigned , in my poor behalf , to visit me corporeally , wearing the form of a mortal female , but who seemeth rather to my apprehension , as one wearing the garments of light . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but little attention to the enigmatical observation of his companion . " Aye , " continued the other , " although Mistress Esther Ludlow was habited in fleshly garments  --  " " Maudsley started as the name struck his ear , and he was upon the point of springing from the grave . He checked himself , however , by a sudden impulse , and before his emotion was observed by his companion , who gravely continued ,  --  " Although she was habited in the garments of earth , yet did never a tabernacle of flesh contain a more precious jewel . She hath been , as one might say , the guardian angel , under Providence , of this little settlement . " " And you say , " continued Maudsley in a husky tone , " that she was the cause of your change of residence . " " Verily yes , " said Mellows , " for besides , that I was never wholly and blindly given to the tenets of the New Plymouth church , which , to my poor apprehension , savor more of strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Maudsley impatiently , " but what of Esther Ludlow ? " " My wife was dying , my children were sorely ill , and almost famishing  --  I was homeless , and we were all nigh unto perish . But the house wherein I now dwell , and which , though lowly , is not inferior to any except the mansion of the governor , I owe to the generosity of that virtuous maiden , who , moreover , did minister unto my helpmeet when she was sorely stricken . The same wise and charitable virgin , moreover , did pour out upon our hearts the oil of Christian sympathy , when the Lord did take away , one after another , all our blessed babes . " " Indeed , " said Maudsley , affected by the uncouth but sincerely grateful language , with which the devout weaver acknowledged his obligation to Esther , " have you been then so unfortunate as to be left wholly childless ? " " Truly , the Lord gave them to me , and he hath taken them away , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me for bread , and I had naught to give unto them but a stone . But they are dead now , Master Maudsley , and I feel none the richer . " Maudsley addressed a few common-place words of consolation to his companion , steadily , the meanwhile , pursuing his work , at which he had been so diligent , that the grave was now nearly finished . " A little more hollowed at the edges , I pray thee , " said Goodman Mellowes , indicating to Maudsley , with considerable pedantry of manner , the mode in which the bottom of the grave should be finished . " Ah , I have some little skill at the business , albeit I was , by trade , a weaver , and have also , in the wilderness , performed the functions of goatsherd . " Truly , the shades of evening are approaching , " continued he , in a brisker tone , " and it is time that she should be brought hither . Her grave is ready now . Alas ! poor Esther Ludlow ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the archangel 's trumpet . An indefinite , icy feeling , had withheld him from questioning his companion as to the health and present condition of Esther . He thought , if she had been ill or suffering , that the garrulous grave-digger would probably have enlightened him on the matter , and yet he feared to hazard a direct question . At the last words uttered by Mellowes , a sudden light seemed to flash upon him , and it seemed to him , that he had now , blindly obeying the instigations of a fiend , actually come hither , upon the night before his departure from New England , to dig , with his own hands , the grave of his beloved . He confronted the grave-digger with a countenance of ashy paleness . " Tell me , " he cried , in a voice which was chocked to a whisper , and which was yet distinctly and fearfully audible , " is this the grave of Esther Ludlow ? " " God forbid ! " exclaimed the weaver , who believed that his eccentric companion had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dame Endicott , the spouse of the worthy governor . Esther Ludlow , God be praised , is alive and well . " Maudsley staggered backward , almost insensible , and sank for a moment upon the ground . His frame enfeebled by long illness , and his mind exhausted by emotion , had both lost much of their elasticity . He found time to recover himself , however , as his companion continued ,  --  " Dame Endicott hath passed away , the virtuous spouse of the worthy governor of this colony . In my mention of the name of Mistress Ludlow , I did but compassionate the unavailing exertions of that pious virgin , to arrest the heavy blow which hath fallen upon this worthy family . But stay , they are bringing the corpse hitherward , " continued he , looking towards the settlement ; " yonder come the mourners , the worthy governor and his friends , attended by Master Ludlow and his virtuous sister . " Maudsley recovered his composure at once . He had come hither , determined to avoid all communication with any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was unwilling to meet the melancholy company , which was already slowly picking its way across the rugged clearing towards the rude burial-place . He accordingly gave a few hurried directions to Mellowes , earnestly forbidding him to mention their interview , or even to hint that he was still in the country . Upon parting , he presented the weaver with a considerable sum of money which he had about him , and for which , as he was to leave upon the next day for England , he had no further occasion . Instead , however , of leaving the neighborhood , he concealed himself beneath the foliage of a white-pine tree , which grew in the immediate vicinity of the grave , and calmly awaited the arrival of the corpse . Since fate had so willed it , he was even willing to look once more upon the face of Esther , although he had not purposed it , and till that moment could not have believed himself possessed of the necessary courage . While he was thus establishing himself in a position where he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot . Four men bore the coffin , which had been hastily and rudely fashioned of rough boards , and gently deposited it in the grave which Maudsley 's hands had dug . But a few other persons were present , besides the bereaved Endicott , Walter Ludlow , and his sister . The snow was falling fast . Ludlow offered up a fervent , extemporaneous prayer , but the services were necessarily hurried , for the storm was rapidly increasing . As the last words of the prayer were spoken , the grave-digger threw the first spadeful of hard and frozen clods upon the coffin . The stern visage of the governor was convulsed by the harsh and rigid sound , and a single tear ran down his iron cheek . He commanded himself , however , and stood , an image of simple and pathetic dignity , erect , uncovered , offering up a silent prayer for support in that hour , but unbowed by the misfortunes and the difficulties which were thickening around him . " It was not my design , " said he , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our first voyage to this inhospitable wilderness . I would have urged her to tarry at the house of her kinsman Cradock , until the rough places had been smoothed for her feeble footsteps , but she would not be gainsayed . " As Endicott paused , overcome for an instant by his emotion , Maudsley at last heard the gentle voice of Esther , which fell upon his ear like music , although he could not accurately understand the words of consolation which she addressed to the mourner , in a low and murmuring tone . As Esther ceased speaking , the company slowly left the spot , the governor remaining a little after the rest , and then walking homewards with unfaltering step . When they had all departed , Maudsley stole forth , and stood for a moment by that lonely grave . He had been so near to Esther , during the whole ceremony , that her robe had been waved against him by the wind ; he had looked upon her face , he had listened to her voice ; and now that she was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his heart seemed to be dead within him . Upon what slender threads hang the destiny of blind and erring mortals ! A few simple words might have been exchanged between the grave-digger and himself , which would have swept forever the delusions from his brain , and restored happiness to his stormy soul . Twenty words which might have been spoken , instead of the wandering discourse which had really occurred between them , and much of the mystery might have been dispelled forever , which now seemed to envelope his fate . But the words were not spoken , and a wintry sea soon rolled between the lovers . Maudsley had carefully observed the exact place where Esther had stood , and he now knelt down and passionately kissed the print which her foot had left upon the snow , with which the earth was already covered . A wreath of the lowly , trailing evergreen grew upon that spot of ground . He tore off a little twig , and placed it carefully in his bosom . He then stood till the rapidly descending flakes had obliterated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the place . CHAPTER XIV . THE FALCON 'S LAST FLIGHT . On a bright morning in September , 1630 , Sir Christopher Gardiner and Thomas Morton sat together in a small apartment of the Merry-Mount palace . More than eighteen months had elapsed since the events which have been last related , but although the political aspect of affairs had much altered during that interval , the relative position , and the individual fortunes of the principal personages who have figured in these pages , had not yet been materially changed . Morton , against whom nothing of importance had been found in England to warrant his detention , or to justify any interferfence with his rights as an Englishman , aided , moreover , by the intervention of influential friends , had returned to New England during the past year , in company with Isaac Allerton , the confidential agent and leading financier of the Plymouth colony , who brought him out from England in the capacity of secretary . The banishment which had been inflicted upon him accordingly proved but temporary , and upon his return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " old nest at Merry-Mount . " The number of his retainers or subjects , as he facetiously called them , had , however , very much diminished during his absence , and , with the exception of the faithful Bootefish , the Canary Bird , and one or two stragglers who dwelt in the adjacent huts , the merry potentate now reigned in solitary grandeur Peter Cakebread still remained in the employment of Sir Christopher Gardiner , who had himself been absent from the neighborhood of Massachusetts , no human being knew where or wherefore , and who had returned to his old haunt , still accompanied by the mysterious Jaspar , whom he called his cousin , a short time previous to the period at which this chapter opens . The room in which they sat was Morton 's sanctum . The rude rafters were adorned with trophies of the chase , with Indian weapons , and with countless implements for fishing , hunting and hawking . A broken-winged eagle , partly tamed and wholly melancholy in his deportment , hopped disconsolately about the floor , presenting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaying in his hoarse and indignant scream , and the furious blows of his remaining pinion , that the wings of his spirit at least were not yet wholly broken . Upon a rough table , stood a flask of some very transparent fluid , two or three pewter mugs , and a much thumbed copy of Horace , bound in vellum ; but by far the most interesting objects in the room , were two hawks , which stood upon their perches , one very near the head of Morton 's couch , and the other a little farther removed . Morton , who was certainly the very first , and probably the very last , person in Massachusetts who ever indulged in the graceful diversion of hawking , was an adept in that art , which was at that moment in the zenith of its glory in Europe , although , in consequence of the improvements of fire-arms , it fell , before the close of the century , into total disuse . He was at that moment , while conversing with Sir Christopher , busily employed in preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called them , which were to be imped or inserted into the wing of one of his favorite hawks , who had sustained some trifling damage during his most recent exploits . " And so you tell me , " said he , continuing the conversation which had commenced some half an hour before , " that you have never visited Shawmut , since the catastrophe to which you allude ? " " Never , " answered the knight , with a gloomy expression ; " and by heaven ! it seems as if an evil demon dwelt in that lonely spot , into whose clutches I must be delivered soul and body , should I dare to enter his accursed circle . " " ' T is strange , " said Morton , holding up the point of his feather to the light , and examining it with critical nicety , " and yet you tell me that it was a fair and legitimate duello , and that Peter Cakebread officiated afterwards as sexton , and in humed the body as decorously as circumstances allowed ? " Gardiner made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowning silence . " Poor Harry Maudsley ! " continued Morton , in a voice of unaffected sorrow , " an unlucky chance sent him to this wilderness . Poor fellow ! I had a sincere sympathy with him . He was the only human creature whom I ever met with in this pagan wilderness , who had a real appreciation for the polished strains of Flaccus . I would to heaven he had remained at home , where , as I have been informed , his connections were highly respectable . Hadst thou ever any acquaintance with others of the Maudsley family , Sir Kit ? " concluded he carelessly . " No more of this ! " cried Gardiner , with sudden and passionate emphasis ,  --  " no more of the stripling ! Alive , he wilfully crossed my path till I crushed him against my will . Dead , he haunts me like a curse . No more of this , I say ! " The knight sprang to his feet , and strode impatiently about the narrow apartment , with the supple , muscular restlessness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat again , and said in an altered tone , and with assumed tranquillity ,  --  " The lunatic Blaxton dwells still upon his peninsula , and still alone , I think you tell me . " " Aye , " answered Morton , observing , without comment , the singular agitation of his companion , " unless he hath removed since the beginning of the week , which is not likely . Still I think he shows signs of great impatience since the arrival of Winthrop 's colony at Charlestown , as the Mishawum promontory , it seems , must now be designated . " " And Walford has not yet been forced from his dwelling-place ? " " Not yet , " answered Morton , laying his feathers carefully upon the table , and walking round the chamber in search of some implement , which seemed to have been mislaid ; " Walford still remains , but , by Jupiter , he hath met with but churlish treatment from the psalm-singers , who have taken such forcible possession of Canaan . I fear he will soon abandon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , by Saint John , " replied the knight , " I will not be fooled any longer thus . As for John Oldham ,  --  " " Exactly , " interrupted Morton , " John Oldham , who is my very good friend and gossip now , having been , as you know , appointed by the Plymouth brethren to be my jailor ; John Oldham , who was thoroughly instructed by me touching the legality of his own lease , and of the Gorges patent in general , hath brought all the influence he could to bear against the Massachusetts company , but I am satisfied now that it is to be unsuccessful . " " By heavens ! " said the knight , impatiently , " they shall yet be overturned root and branches . If Sir Ferdinando had been ruled by my counsels , all this business would have never happened , this whole territory would , at this moment , have been in his undisputed possession , and I should have been GovernorGeneral of New England . But it is not too late yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " With submission to your better judgment , Sir Kit , " answered Morton , who , with characteristic philosophy , had already begun to look upon the prostrate position of his airy castles , with something of a child 's indifference , at the destruction of his card palace , so soon as the first ebullition of spleen is over , and who now seemed exceedingly interested in the amusement for which he was industriously preparing , " I very much fear that the right worshipful Sir Ferdinando hath grown marvellously lukewarm in the matter . He hath wasted so much gold in this business , that he hath begun to draw his purse-string very tightly . Your vigorous demand for men and money somewhat appalled him two years ago . " " He is no such niggardly coward , I tell you , Morton , " replied Gardiner , peremptorily . " His letters still speak warmly and encouragingly . " " Perhaps so , " answered Morton , " but it is still my opinion that Sir Ferdinando 's zeal hath very much abated of late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so suddenly and secretly the transfer of the charter itself into New England , our friends have been very much disheartened , and look , I fear , upon our enterprise as hopeless . So many people of wealth and station , both among those who have emigrated , and those who remain in England to assist the colony , make their party very strong . " " By heaven , his zeal shall not cool , while I have a voice to warn him , " cried Gardiner , angrily . " Well , well , " said Morton , carelessly , " thou mayest be in the right after all ,  --  Nil mortalibus arduum , '  --  but I own that things are looking slightly complicated . Here , Ajax ! come here , my old hero ! " With this Morton whistled in a peculiar note to one of his hawks . There were two of these birds stationed upon their perches in the room . Of these , the one which was nearest the bedside , was hooded and belled , having not yet been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peregrine falcon , the bird which , after the ger falcon , which is unknown in Massachusetts , was most esteemed for his strength , docility , and audacity . Being a haggard , that is to say , a bird who had been taken after he was full grown , and had accordingly hunted upon his own account , he had been more difficult to reclaim and man , although , under the skilful tuition of Morton , he was already admirably and almost perfectly trained . As , however , he still retained a little of his native wildness , Morton kept his perch near his bedside , that he might constantly call to him and arouse him frequently during the night , so that he might never forget the sound of his voice or the habit of obedience . He was also , unlike his companion , not allowed to use his eyes when at home , and as he stood there reposing upon his perch , with his leathern hood , surmounted by an artificial crest of plumes , drawn closely over his head , through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his wings hanging motionless at his side , exposing to view his broad chest , whose lighter-colored feathers were plaited closely upon each other like a shirt of mail , with his sinewy legs terminated by immense yellow pounces and long golden spurs , he presented a fanciful resemblance to some fierce warrior monk , brooding in slothful and gloomy captivity . The other bird , a little larger in size than the falcon , was a goshawk , who sat quietly but unhooded upon her perch , glancing restlessly at every thing around her , with her large hazel eye . Being an " eyess , " that is to say , a bird whom Morton had taken from the nest , and brought up in natural tameness , she was as obedient to her master 's voice as the best trained spaniel , and as thoroughly accomplished a creature as could have been found , at that moment , in either hemisphere . The bird 's eye flashed quickly , as she heard her master 's whistle , and fluttering directly from her perch , she settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , stroked her back caressingly with his hand , and gave her a few bits of meat , from the scattered fragments of his own breakfast , which still remained upon the table . " ' T is a gallant hawk , by St. John , " said Gardiner , looking at the bird with admiration , " and fit for an emperor . " " Pardon me , Sir Christopher , not for an emperor , " said Morton ; " and although I know you skilled in the generous craft , yet I find you not so conversant as a knight of your degree should be , with the scale of precedence among falcons . An eagle is for an emperor , a ger falcon for a king , a peregrine falcon for an earl  --  " . " For an earl ! " cried Gardiner ; " and what do you then with yonder fellow in the leathern night-cap , for he is a peregrine if I know a hawk from a  --  " " From a hernshaw , as the immortal swan of Avon hath it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when thou art Prince Palatine of Massachusetts , I am to be Earl of Merry-Mount . In the mean time I have even solaced myself with manning and reclaiming yonder fellow , who , from as wild a haggard as ever preyed upon crows and pigeons , is now as well bred a falcon as ever flew . " " And what is a simple knight to do for a hawk ? " said Gardiner , humoring his companion , who loved nothing better than to indulge the quaint vein of pedantry , which , upon all sporting topics , so particularly characterized his mind ; " what is a poor errant knight to do for a hawk , if the great dignitaries have thus monopolized the varieties ? " " Marry , the sacret is for a knight , " answered Morton , " and the devil a one is to be found in New England . " " Then the knight must even content himself with the goshawk , " answered Gardiner , " and if there be many like that fellow upon your fist there , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bird hath been injured ? " continued Gardiner , looking with a sportsman 's interest at the wing which Morton had now opened , and in which he was inserting the two feathers which he had prepared in a most artistic manner to replace two which had been broken from the pinion . " Slightly , " answered Morton ; " but there , my trusty warrior , thy wing is imped , and thou art whole again , off to thy perch . " As Morton spoke , the obedient bird fluttered to his station again , where he remained as motionless as before . " Let me now entreat your attention , " said Sir Christopher , with much earnestness . " As you value my friendship , and the fulfilment of your ambitious hopes , beware of prematurely offending these Puritans of Massachusetts , as thou hast done those of Plymouth . " " Marry , Sir Christopher , I am schooled , " answered Morton ; " but touching my ambitious hopes , their wings have been marvellously clipped of late , and indeed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominion , under the auspices of the great Joshua himself . " " And who in the devil 's name is the great Joshua ? " demanded Gardiner . " The great Joshua Temperwell ,  --  heaven save the mark ,  --  know you not the great Joshua ? " replied Morton . " Who should he be but the great governor of the Puritans , the man who hath borne out into the wilderness the ark of the covenant , videlicet , the charter of the Massachusetts Bay Company , who should it be but the great King Winthrop , John the first , Dei Gratia ? " " And do you mean that you have been threatened with an attack on the part of Winthrop ? " asked Gardiner impatiently . " Even so , " was the reply ; " they hold solemn courts over at Mishawum yonder , in a lumbering tenement which they call the great house , where they wag their grizzled beards in each others ' faces , and ponder unutterable things , with all the gravity of owls . I have a shrewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal , although what crime I have committed I have not yet discovered . " " They will not dare to do so , by heaven ! " cried Sir Christopher ; " the rebuff which the accusations brought against you by the Plymouth brethren met with must have taught them wisdom . " " I know not . These same brethren are never taught wisdom , " answered Morton , " seeing that they are all born into the world as wise as serpents , if not as harmless as doves . " As he spoke , Morton shouted to his attendant Bootefish ,  --  " Come hither , thou prelate , thou grave and reverend dignitary , " he cried , " and attend us in our sports . Although the canons of the church most expressly forbid hawking to the clergy , and thou art in training for a bishop , yet we well know that the clergy have been devoted to the amusement from time immemorial , and despite the prohibition . Perhaps ' t is not the only forbidden pleasure which holy men have permitted themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the marshes , thou shalt see how a New England hawk can fly . " " I am here , your worship , " answered Bootefish , presenting his rubicund visage at the doorway . " Bring us then the poles and the game-bags , most reverend bishop , and hold thyself in readiness to take charge of my hawks when our sport is over . The Bishop of Ely , in bluff King Henry 's day , excommunicated seven persons who stole his falcon . Do thou not only excommunicate , but flagellate any living man , be he pagan or Puritan , who should dare to meddle with my hawks . " So speaking , Morton , who had already hooded Gaunt , now proceeded to hood and bell Ajax , and taking the haggard upon his own fist , he brought the other to Sir Christopher , saying ,  --  " Although I kept Gaunt in Tom Walford 's smithy for ten days , to tame him with the sound of the hammering , yet is he not yet manned enough to sit upon other fist than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a better goshawk never flew a flight . " " Willingly , " answered Gardiner , " but to tell you the truth , I marvel at your nomenclature . Both these hawks being female , as they should be , the female of all falcons being the fiercest and strongest , ' t is strange you should thus accommodate them with names of the other gender . " " Thou art right , " answered Morton , " and ' t is a humor of mine own . The only matter in the noble craft of hawking which mislikes me , is this very unsexing of the species Sooth to say , I never saw a tercel gentle , in company with his ferocious spouse , who was , sans compliment , his better half , without offering up a silent thanksgiving , that among my other misfortunes , that of matrimony hath not yet befallen me . Such unequal and uncomfortable matches are sometimes the lot even of the lords of creation . What think you of the institution of matrimony in general , Sir Kit , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The countenance of Gardiner looked ferocious and forbidding again , as Morton , who seemed peculiarly unlucky in his allusions that morning , made this careless query . He answered nothing , however , and the Lord of Merry-Mount , not observing his companion 's mood , continued ,  --  " ' T is for this reason , " he said , " that I choose , thus arbitrarily , to designate my favorites . I choose not to associate any thing ferocious with the female idea , which , to my mind , should never awaken any images but the gentlest and most caressing . And accordingly , if  --  " " Doth the pestilence still continue in the bay , among the settlers at Naumkeak and Charlestown ? " said Gardiner , abruptly changing the conversation . " Yes , the poor devils are undergoing a severe seasoning , " answered Morton , leading the way out of the palace , followed by Gardiner and Bootefish  --  " They are dying very fast of the scurvy and fever . No people but Puritans could bear such peppering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would live through all the plagues of Egypt . " " And I suppose they have poor medical attendance , and a scanty supply of drugs , " said Gardiner , who seemed to take a particular pleasure in dwelling upon the sufferings of the settlers . " Why , as to that , " answered Morton , " they have the illustrious Doctor Noddy , the great soul-saver , and body-snatcher of New Plymouth . " " And who and what may the illustrious Noddy be ? " said Gardiner , " preacher or physician ? " " Both the one and the other , " answered Morton , " the illustrious Noddy , whom mortals call Fuller , is , as we should say at Clifford 's Inn , a qui tam ' doctor , administering quite as much to the spiritual as the bodily ailments of his patients  --  one , in short , who maketh a point of preparing his victims for heaven , as a compensation for abridging their allotted period upon earth . " " Would he might send them all , men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , even to Abraham 's bosom , " cried the knight savagely . " By heavens ! I could hug the very pestilence , which has strode hither to fight so fiercely in my behalf ! May they wither like frost-bitten weeds ! may they perish like famished wolves , the prowling hypocrites ! " " A cordial anathema , " replied Morton , in a cheerful tone , " but I hardly sympathize with your ferocity . I am not of an atrabilious temperament . Perhaps I should have been more useful if I had been less good-natured . What they intend against me , I know not . The Plymouth brethren would have had me hung , but marriage and hanging go by destiny , and the hemp is not yet grown that is to serve me for a neck-cloth . " " I have already spoken to you concerning the necessity of caution upon these matters , " answered Gardiner , " but one word more concerning this pestilence . You say that this Noddy or Fuller is the only quack whom they are provided with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Morton , " he cured the great Captain Littleworth , whom the settlers call John Endicott , of a desperate disease . " " I was not aware , " said Gardiner , " that Endicott had been afflicted by any illness . " " He was troubled , " said Morton , " with a chronic disease called a wife , and Doctor Fuller relieved him thereof handsomely . " " Aye , I heard , " said Gardiner , " that Madam Endicott sank early under the climate . I did not know the part which Doctor Fuller played in the matter . " " T was his masterpiece , " continued Morton . " But now , Mistress Gaunt , if it like Sir Christopher better , I will even give thee one trial in the air , before we look for any game . " They were standing at this moment upon that long , elevated knoll , to which the name of Merry-Mount peculiarly belonged , and upon which the hands of its sovereign had erected , and the hands of Endicott demolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene around was still unchanged . The barren cliff , destitute of trees , was covered with a scanty herbage , and adorned with a few stunted golden-rods , a goodly store of mullens , and a profusion of the aromatic weed called everlasting , which loves the most gravelly and barren soil . From this elevated summit the eye wandered with delight on that magnificent September morning , over the panorama of land and ocean , which glowed and sparkled in the bright sunshine and the invigorating breeze . Morton , who had been caressing the beautiful falcon , which sat upon his fist , during his rambling conversation with Sir Christopher , now advanced a few yards into the wind . He then stopped , turned about , and suddenly unstriking her hood , tossed her into the air with an encouraging shout . The falcon expanded her strong wings with an impulse of delight , and rose directly over head , mounting in airy circles higher and still higher , till diminished to a hardly perceptible point , she hung stationary for a moment , in the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , and searching for a quarry , she sailed slowly along with gently flapping wings , until , apparently disappointed in her observations , she commenced again her spiral ascent till she was lost to view . Morton now whistled . The piercing note seemed to penetrate the arch above . There was a moment of suspense , during which nothing was visible in the sky , and Sir Christopher , who had been watching the falcon 's motions with eager interest , shook his head suspiciously at Morton , as if to intimate that the haggard had borne away her bells after all , and was not likely to obey her master 's whistle . Morton answered the look with a confident smile , pointing upwards as he did so . At that moment the black point was again visible , at the next there was a rushing sound , and the hawk falling through the air with closed wings , and with the speed of lightning , suddenly settled , as if by enchantment , upon her master 's fist . " Bravely done , sweetheart ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd trust thee with a thousand golden guineas , had I so much filthy lucre ; and now to look for something to strike at . If a gaggle of geese would come by now , for it is time they should begin to congregate hither on their journey southwards  --  but who comes here ? the gentle Jaspar , as I live , " continued Morton , who had been hooding his falcon again , and who now courteously saluted the new comer . " I had almost grown weary of waiting , " said the youth , acknowledging the civility of Morton , " and had I not known that the long and unutterable ponderings between you and my cousin were something tedious , I should even have broken in upon your consultations . However , my patience hath been well rewarded . Of every thing which is delightful in the world , a falcon 's flight is most delightful . " " Spoken like a young cavalier , " said Morton gaily , " and now let us descend upon the marshes . " With this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advanced along the creek , which meandered through the salt marsh , by which his domain was separated from the ocean . They now began to move very cautiously , because , as the season had already commenced , during which those meadows , and particularly the neighborhood of that creek , were the resort of innumerable water-fowl , including many of the varieties which yield the greatest amusement in falconry , Morton feared to flush the game before he desired it . " Having no spaniel just at this moment at Merry-Mount , " said he to Sir Christopher ; " I have even brought the dignified Bootefish along with me to spring the fowl . Robin Bootefish , by the way , is destined for my chief falconer when I receive my earldom . " " Besides which , " added Gardiner , " thou art thyself to be hereditary grand falconer of all the Massachusetts . " " I have no objection , " answered Morton , " to any number of dignities , but a truce to trifling now , for this business must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable distance in front of the others , holding a long pole in his hand . Gardiner held the goshawk 's jesses loosely in his fingers , and held himself ready to unstrike her hood , as Morton designed that Ajax should fly at the game , which was first started , in order to afford a lesson to the haggard . As had been rightly conjectured , Bootefish had not advanced very far , before he came suddenly upon a stray black duck , who happened to be feeding by himself in the plashy ground near the creek . The fowl rose screaming into the air , to the height of some dozen yards , and then flew in a straight line , and with great rapidity , almost directly over the heads of Morton and Gardiner . The knight , as quick as thought , jerked off the hood from the goshawk , and tossed her after her prey . The well-trained creature , her eyes flashing upon the quarry with unerring instinct , flew like lightning at her victim . Straight as an arrow flew the duck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falcon pierced the air in his pursuit . Five minutes elapsed , and the pursuer and the pursued , flying in a perfectly straight line at the rate of a mile to the minute , had entirely disappeared from view . The sportsmen , using their long poles to assist them in leaping continually across the winding creek , in which exercise none was more adroit than Jaspar , followed as nearly as possible in the direction first taken by the duck , which was obliquely across the marshes , towards the sea . Morton paused at last , and shook his head . The duck had flown so low , so straight , and with such wonderful rapidity , that he deemed it almost impossible for the hawk to have overtaken him . As the party stood , however , breathless with their violent exercise , very near the margin of the sea , a black speck in the air became suddenly visible to the eagle eye of Gardiner , who pointed it out to his companions . " You are right , by Jupiter , Sir Christo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pursuer , and has lost the advantage of his straight flight . Ten thousand pounds to a guinea , he is a dead duck in five minutes . " As Morton spoke , the quarry flew again over their heads , at about double the height at which he had started upon his course , and with somewhat diminished rapidity . He had evidently become disconcerted and confused by his fears , and now flew wildly and with frequent windings . The falcon , steady and unrelenting as destiny , followed close upon him , gaining at every turn . It was now that the chase became keenly interesting . The quarry , flying swiftly still , but in irregular circlings , and hotly pursued by her enemy , was easily kept in sight by the active sportsmen , who dashed hither and thither , running and leaping in every direction taken by the game . The airy chase rapidly approached its termination . The unfortunate victim , distracted and despairing , flew with diminished vigor . Already the wings of her enemy seemed to overshadow him , when suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mounting in short and rapid circles . " Mark now , Sir Christopher , " said Morton , looking with delight at the motions of his favorite , " mark now how beautifully she is going to stoop . " The words had scarcely left his lips , when the peculiar , hurtling noise was heard , and the goshawk , falling through the air like a meteor , struck the quarry with her pounces , and despite its struggles , flew upwards , holding it aloft in triumph . " Beautifully trussed , by Jupiter ! " cried Morton , whistling loudly as he spoke . The obedient hawk descended to her master 's call , and laid the palpitating body of her victim , whom she had beaten to death with her muscular pinions , directly at her master 's feet . That done , she settled upon his fist again , shaking her silver bells , and turning her lustrous eye upon his , as if to read his approbation there . " Prettily done , Mistress Ajax ! " said Morton , who had in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bootefish , that he might hold and caress the goshawk for an instant . He had hardly resumed possession of the haggard , who was intended by him to fly at the next game which was started , when a hoarse cry of " whauk , whauk , whauk , " sounded suddenly in the air , far above their heads . Quickly as lightning did Morton launch the falcon into the air . " Now , my gentle peregrine , show the mettle you are made of , " cried he , " for yonder comes the first gaggle of geese I have seen this season . Strike me now one of those screamers , goose or gander , I care not , and prove to me that the pains taken for your education have not been all in vain . " The falcon , who flew that day for the first time without a leash , rose like a rocket into the air . Singling , without hesitation , one from out the noisy flock of some twenty or thirty wild geese , who were swiftly winging their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arrival , he scattered confusion and dismay among them all . Uttering discordant screams , the flock flew hither and thither , seeking each to escape , by the best means it could , the fearful enemy . " Looks yon falcon now , " cried Morton , as all the sportsment together dashed off in the direction taken by the hawk , " looks she not like a glorious old piratical Norman baron , pursuing a shrieking horde of base-born peasantry ? Upon them , my jovial freebooter , down with the churls . Gloriously struck , by Jupiter ! " While he was speaking , the falcon , true to her breeding and her instinct , had selected and overtaken her quarry . Then suddenly stooping , she extended her enormous pounces , seized her victim with prodigious force , and broke its neck with one blow of her beak . Finding the dead body of her game too heavy to be raised aloft for an instant , and yet desirous of obeying her master 's whistle , which sounded as soon as she struck the quarry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing with her the dead fowl , which she obediently deposited at her master 's feet . " A hawk of a thousand , " cried Sir Christopher , looking with admiration at the gallant bird ; " call her haggard no longer , for my life for it , there never flew a stauncher or more obedient falcon than she hath proved herself . " " Truly hath she done no discredit , " answered Morton , " to her trainer , the future grand falconer of the Massachusetts . " So saying , he rewarded the hawk by tearing out the palpitating heart of the game , and presenting it to her . The hawk having devoured the morsel with relish , was now again hooded , and the party proceeded in search of more game . There was no lack of it that day . Those wide marshes which skirted the sea abounded in water-fowl , and it was the commencement of the season when many varieties are just making their appearance on their way from the north . Ducks , brantgeese , curlews , were started from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , the peregrine falcon established her reputation forever , and the party had as much sport as they desired . They had been reposing for a little time , being somewhat tired themselves , and desirous of affording some respite to the indefatigable falcons . Indeed , both Gardiner and Jaspar had been quite satisfied with their morning 's amusement , and were upon the point of abandoning the sport altogether . Morton , who was never weary of the chase , and was particularly devoted to falconry , reluctantly consented to accompany them . A little sport was , however , in reserve for the party . As they were passing leisurely along the border of the creek , upon their way toward Merry-Mount , they suddenly surprised an enormous blue heron , who stood fishing in the stream . It was some unusual accident which had allowed them thus to surprise this melancholy , hermit bird , who is as keen-sighted as he is solitary . The lonely fisherman , vexed at being thus disturbed in his privacy , rose into the air , uttering a few morose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and long legs dangling behind him , sailed off before the wind . The heron was of the largest size , standing nearly five feet in height , measuring more than six from wing to wing , and being at least double the weight of either of the hawks . Quickly did Morton jerk the hood from off the haggard falcon 's neck , and toss her down the wind , after the stately quarry . " Bind me yon moody , long-legged misanthrope , " cried he , as he whistled off his hawk , " kill me him handsomely , and like a gallant falcon as thou art , and thou shalt win a crown of glory both for thy master and thyself . " " ' T is no child 's play , either , " cried Sir Christopher , as they all eagerly followed the heron 's flight , " for the fellow will stand at bay if he is caught , and thrust with that long bill of his like a gladiator , so that the falcon will need all her mettle and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear the peregrine , " cried Morton gaily , though somewhat out of breath ; " my life on her courage and her success ! " The heron had risen high in the air , and then flown off before the wind , with a powerful and rather rapid stroke . The falcon gained upon him very fast , but seemed somewhat wary in approaching him . Although not courting a combat , but on the contrary evidently desirous of escaping his enemy by ignoble-flight , yet there seemed something dangerous in the melancholy bird , which made the high mettled falcon cautious in her attack . As she neared the quarry , however , which she did within a very few minutes after she had been first launched in his pursuit , she seemed to be thrusting forth her mighty talons to grapple with her prey . Then , as if altering her intention , she suddenly rose spirally far above the heron , till she was almost entirely lost from view . During all this time , Morton , who had advanced far beyond his companions , stood gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the heron , somewhat perplexed , was steadily beating the air in the same direction which she had at first taken , the hawk suddenly appeared , falling as it were out of the heavens , from some invisible height , and swooping down upon her prey . When within a few yards of the quarry , however , she suddenly turned upon her wing , recovered herself , and slowly mounted again . " How magnificently she cancelliers , " cried Morton , still gazing intently upwards , and wholly rapt in the issue of the sport . There was no answer , but Morton would have heard none , had it been made . The heron meanwhile , somewhat puzzled by the manoeuvres of his adversary , doubled upon his course , and now flew in rather a circling and hesitating manner . Again the rushing sound struck the ear , and the falcon stooping again from a prodigious height , fell like a thunderbolt upon her prey . This time there was no cancelliering , but descending in a concentrated mass , she struck the quarry full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , desperately wounded , and struggling vainly to elude her clutches , at last flew slowly off , bearing his audacious enemy upon his shoulders . The falcon , meanwhile , strove to break the neck of her foe by repeated and powerful strokes of her beak , and made no effort to alter the direction of their flight . These ferocious blows were for a few seconds skilfully parried by the heron , who twisted hither and thither his long flexible neck , and dexterously foiled the murderous attack . Finding it difficult , however , to continue this game much longer , no longer hoping for safety in flight , and suddenly inflaming himself with the courage of despair , the heron , by an unexpected and dexterous movement , extricated himself for a moment from his enemy 's pounces , threw himself backwards , and furiously attacked his enemy with his long , sharp , powerful bill . Now had the falcon need of all her strength and spirit . The enemy , colossal in comparison with herself , was animated by fury and despair . Desperate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who handled his long bill like a rapier . Gallantly did the falcon parry the furious thrusts , and return blow for blow . The champions were not unfairly matched , the falcon making up for her inferior length and weight by superior concentration of muscle and greater strength of wing . Eagerly did Morton , totally lost to every thing in the world below , gaze upwards at the combatants , who now hung suspended in air a few hundred yards above his head . The aerial duel was desperate , but short . The falcon , full of wrath at being thus for the first time baffled , rose again for an instant into the air . She then descended with all the force and fury of her nature upon the quarry , recklessly received a desperate thrust , which pierced her through and through , and at the same instant smote her adversary to death with a furious blow which she was thus enabled to inflict upon his spine . At the next instant , both hawk and heron fell headlong to the ground , and lay locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooped eagerly down , extricated his favorite from the deadly weapon of her antagonist , which still transfixed her , tore her talons from his palpitating body , and placed her in his bosom . The fearless falcon turned her glazing eye upon her master , with an expression full of spirit and affection , shook her pinions gallantly for a moment , and then was still forever . " Thy last flight is flown , my matchless haggard , " said Morton , with a tear in his eye , gazing with unaffected sorrow upon the body of the falcon , and then laying her down side by side with her powerful enemy , who lay stone dead at his feet . " Ye shall be buried together in one grave , " said he at last , after contemplating the pair long and mournfully . " My poor hawk , who came to my whistle day and night ! Sawest thou ever a falcon in all the world , who stooped more gallantly , Master Jaspar ? " concluded he , turning suddenly round . " Shame upon thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side , which sounded very unlike that of Gardiner or of Jaspar . " How often , O , thou Master of Misrule , wilt thou provoke us in the wilderness , and grieve us in the desert ? " " And who the devil art thou , " cried Morton in astonishment , " who art thus prophesying upon the salt marshes ? " Morton might well have been surprised , for as he looked about him , there was not a trace to be seen of Sir Christopher and the gentle Jaspar , and in their places he found himself surrounded by a party of grim-visaged Puritans , armed to the teeth , who evidently intended to devote themselves that morning exclusively to himself . So absorbed had he been in observing the struggle between his falcon and the heron , that the party had advanced upon him and made him their prisoner , before he was in the least aware of their approach . Sir Christopher Gardiner , however , whose eagle eye , keener than that of hawk or heron , had observed the party at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unsuccessful search at Merry-Mount , they descended upon the marshes , had eluded their observation , and , accompanied by his cousin , had glided unperceived away , at a time when Morton , in his eagerness , had advanced to so great a distance that it was wholly out of the knight 's power to give him warning . As Sir Christopher had repeatedly , but fruitlessly , reminded his reckless companion of his danger , and as he had no desire unnecessarily to expose his character to suspicion , by allowing himself to be found in the company of one whom the Puritans considered so disreputable and odious , he had felt no hesitation in thus disappearing as rapidly as possible . Morton , being used to such scenes , saw at once that all resistance would be useless . Moreover , after the first surprise was over , and he had found himself captured beyond all peradventure , his thoughts reverted to his dead falcon . That he was arrested did not surprise him , and he had long since exhausted his indignation at the tyrannical persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He should soon extricate himself , he thought , from this new dilemma , but who could restore to life his gallant hawk , who he had been training so long , and who was as dear to him as the apple of his eye . Looking with profound contempt at the rigid countenances of his captors , he again raised the dead body of his favorite from the ground , and placed it in his bosom . Absorbed in his melancholy reflections , he stood there fondling the creature , whispering and whistling to her , as if his endearments could recall her to life , and hearing not a single word of the long exhortation with which the leader of the party was indulging him . Finding his eloquence so utterly lost upon the hardened sinner , Captain Underwood broke off in his address , saying only in conclusion ,  --  " Thou wilt follow me now , and that obediently , O , thou Master of Misrule , else shall it go hard with thee ! " " And whither , most peremptory of Puritans ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Charlestown , even unto the magistrates who have ordered thy instantaneous arrest , now effected by their unworthy servants . " " And what have I to do with the magistrates of Charlestown , or they with me ? " replied Morton ; " truly , I have as little relish for their company as they for mine . " " Verily , " answered Captain Underwood , " Governor Winthrop , the deputy , and all the assistants , hold a solemn court to-morrow , to which thou art formally cited , then and there to answer for thy various misdemeanors . Verily , the magistrates do intend to erect their authority throughout the land . They shall smite their enemies in the hinder part , and put them to perpetual reproach . " So saying , the captain of the party led the way , and his soldiers , taking Morton in their midst , started on their march to Charlestown . CHAPTER XV . THE SUZERAIN OF MERRY-MOUNT DEPOSED . Upon the day succeeding his capture upon the marsh , Thomas Morton , in custody of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stood in the corner of the large room in the Great-house at Charlestown . This building , which had been constructed with especial care , by Mr. Graves , during the previous year , expressly to serve as a government house , was a timber-work mansion of very respectable dimensions , and stood upon the open plain below the Mishawum hills . In its neighborhood were huddled together a miscellaneous collection of booths , tents , and wigwams , in which the emigrants had established their temporary residence , and in which they were suffering dreadful ravages from the sickness which still prevailed with unabated fury . As nearly the whole population were upon the point of removing to the south side of the Charles River , where , at least , they could promise themselves a supply of wholesome water , which was denied to them at Mishawum , the infant village of Charlestown presented rather the appearance of a temporary encampment , than of an organized town . Still , however , the forms of government were rigidly observed , and the governor , with most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benevolent in relieving the sufferings of the people , still maintained , throughout all the difficulties which beset them , an elevated and decorous deportment , which invested their responsible offices . The potentate of Merry-Mount , with the good-humored expression which habitually characterized his face , was looking carelessly round him , whistling and talking to himself , besides making , occasionally , an unsuccessful attempt to draw some one of his attendants into conversation . The magistrates had not yet made their appearance in the apartment , although they were soon expected , as the third Court of Assistants , which had been held in Massachusetts since the arrival of Winthrop with the charter , was to be held that morning . Besides the armed attendants upon the magistrates , who answered Morton 's flippant remarks with forbidding silence , there were clustered together , in the different corners of the room , a few stragglers , who appeared to be awaiting the arrival of the court , and who , in the mean time , were conversing in a low tone with one another . These persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The seat of government is to be fixed at Trimountain , yonder , " said a leathern-visaged , sinewy-looking individual , addressing a companion who stood near him ; " at least , I understand that the governor , as well as the worshipful Master Johnson , have already decided upon removing thither immediately . " " Aye , Goodman Faunce , " replied the individual addressed , " who rejoiced in the appellation of Jonathan Jellett , " and I have likewise decided to take my staff in hand and accompany their worships . The mortality which prevails upon this promontory is appalling . Verily it trieth the heart and the reins . " " Truly , the pestilence shooteth its arrows among us unsparingly , " answered Faunce , " but it is in vain ; the Lord is the rock of our refuge . " " ' T is said , " said a third person , who had not yet spoken , " that the company have determined to re-baptize yonder peninsula of Trimountain , which the heathens call Shawmut , seeing that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And by what name do they propose to baptize the promontory , Goodman Pid ? " asked Faunce . " ' T is to be baptized Boston , " answered Pid . " In honor and commemoration , doubtless , " said Jellett , " of the Lincolnshire folk , and of the pious and learned John Cotton , who hath long time ministered in that ancient town , and who is shortly expected hither to prophesy unto us even at New Boston . " " Aye , " continued Pid , " and doubtless New Boston will be the centre and the metropolis of the Massachusetts . The site is a goodly one , and the harbor commodious and safe . " " I am of your mind , " said Jellett . It hath , moreover , become less necessary that one great fortified town should be built , according to the company 's first intention . The discomfiture of the great Indian conspiracy , which hath so recently occurred , and the peaceable deportment of the heathen at present , renders an impregnable fort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " answered Faunce , " the Sagamore John , who revealed that great conspiracy a few months since , hath merited richly of the Lord . But know ye , my brethren , who it is , who is said to have been the chief instigator of this foul conspiracy to cut off by savage hands the whole English population of New England ? " " Is it the Sachem Chickatabot ? " demanded all the others , somewhat impressed by the speaker 's air of mystery . " Not at all , " was the reply , " the heathen chieftain is well affected towards us . ' T is an Englishman , a vile and unworthy renegade , a papist , and a secret emissary of Sir Ferdinando Gorges , the arch-enemy of our company . Such an one it is who hath fostered and guided the savage plot against us , thus revealed by the friendship of the gentle Sagamore . " " And who is this Englishman ? " demanded all the speakers , with frowning faces and eager voices . " " I confess , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute certainty his name nor whereabouts . Still I am informed that the company 's officers have yesterday arrested for various mal-practices a certain rantipole disturber of our Canaan 's peace . This man is called Thomas Morton , and I say unto you , that , beyond all peradventure , if any Englishman hath indeed thus foully conspired with the heathen against the lives and happiness of the Christian settlers , Thomas Morton is the man . " " And I say unto thee that thou liest ! " cried the Lord of Merry-Mount , who had been intently listening to this conversation , " and were it not for these importunate friends who hold me so tightly , by Jupiter Tonans , I would make thee swallow the falsehood again , with a few inches of cold steel to digest it withal ! " The leathern visage of Goodman Faunce expanded like a pair of bellows , and he uttered an explosive ejaculation of amazement at this interruption . None of the party had observed the presence of Morton , so intent had they been upon their own conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . As his whole appearance , however , indicated a character of an entirely different stamp from their own , they now looked upon him with great curiosity , as he stood boiling over with indignation at the foul calumny which he had just heard concerning himself . " I say thou liest ! " roared Morton , continuing to vent his indignation in words of ludicrous vehemence , while his guards held him tightly in their arms , and vainly endeavored to stop his tongue  --  " I say thou art a slanderer ! thou sour-faced , steeplestoppered vinegar-cruet ! What ! is an Englishman 's good name and fame thus lightly to be dealt with by such cold-blooded , canting  --  " " Silence , thou indecent and lewd babbler ! " cried the menat-arms , holding him tightly , and at last succeeding in stopping his mouth , just as the door opened  --  " seest thou not that their worships are about to enter ? " As these words were spoken , the magistrates , preceded by two sergeants with halberts , entered the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company present pulled off their hats and made a respectful obeisance . Governor Winthrop came first , a tall , erect figure in the prime of manhood , whose plaited vandyke ruff , dark-flowing robes , and magisterial chain , harmonized entirely with the simple and natural dignity which distinguished his presence . As he placed himself upon a slightly elevated seat , behind a large table at the upper end of the room , while Dudley and Johnson occupied the seats upon either side , and the rest of the assistants arranged themselves around the table , even Morton himself could not look upon him without respect . The governor 's features were prominent but regular . The hair and beard were dark , the complexion olive , the hazel eye large and pensive , the forehead full of gravity and deliberation . The whole countenance expressed elevation of sentiment , earnestness and decision , tempered with great gentleness , and somewhat overshadowed with melancholy . All these characteristics dwelt particularly in the upper part of the face . The eyebrows , which were delicately pencilled and remarkably arched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , the whole expression of the brow and eye would have struck an imaginative person as that of a man , whose thoughts were habitually and steadfastly directed to things beyond this world . Well contrasted with Winthrop was the erect , military figure , and stern , rugged features of the deputy Dudley . The low-country soldier , the bigoted and intolerant Calvinist , the iron-handed and close-fisted financier , the severe magistrate , but the unflinching and heroic champion of a holy cause , were all represented in that massive and grizzled head , that furrowed countenance , that attitude of stern command . Was it grief for the wife of his bosom , whose grave was still green , the gentle Lady Arabella , who had left an earl 's palace to lie , after a few short months , in the same wilderness grave with her husband ; was it grief alone for that flower so early withered on this inhospitable shore , which darkened the melancholy countenance , and bent the slender form , of the youthful magistrate who sat at Winthrop 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own impending fate mingled with his grief for the departed ? Did Azrael 's wing , hurtling so near him , already overshadow his soul ? Gazing with an air of abstraction , Isaac Johnson sat at the board with his brother magistrates , but his thoughts seemed to be far away . His pale face and retiring figure mingled with the sterner and ruder heads of Sir Richard Saltonstall and the other assistants , and presented a pathetic contrast to them all . After the teaching elder of the new church , which had so recently been gathered upon that spot , the Rev. John Wilson , had offered up a fervent exhortation , the record book of the company was opened , and the governor read a brief report of the proceedings of the court which had been held during the previous week . " The next Court of Assitants will probably be holden , my brethren , " said he , addressing his associates , " upon the same spot wherein we are now assembled . All subsequent ones will take place in the town hall , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Trimountain . It is desirable that , as soon as may be , a general court of all the freemen of the company should be holden , but I would suggest that it be deferred until the people have established themselves at Trimountain . " The suggestion was received with approbation . " Touching the names which are to be respectively borne , " continued the governor , " by the various plantations now , with the Lord 's help , commenced , it was reserved to the present court to act thereupon . Mr. Deputy hath some proposition to make upon this head , as I have been given to understand . " Dudley arose , and read an order as follows : " Ordered , that the plantation at Mattapan be henceforth known by the name of Dorchester ; that the town farthest up the Charles River , be called Waterton ; and that the plantation at Trimountain , be called Boston . " The order was unanimously accepted by the court . After a few other legislative matters had been disposed of , Deputy Dudley arose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be brought in to receive their sentence . No objection being made , the sergeant proceeded to call for David Phippen . David Phippen , a lean-favored , unshaven , and marvellously unprepossessing individual , was then brought forward to their worships ' table , and was thus addressed by the governor :  --  " David Phippen , thou having been found guilty of gross and repeated drunkenness , art hereby sentenced , to the end that thou mayest soon amend thy life , and for the glory of the Lord , to receive forty lashes at the whipping-post , and to wear a red D around thy neck for the space of thirty days  --  the time and place of punishment to be appointed by the court . Take him away , sergeant . " " But your worships ,  --  " stammered the culprit , evidently desirous of making some observations upon the subject . " Silence , drunkard ! " thundered the grim deputy , looking at the trembling Phippen with an indignant countenance . " Take him away , sergeant , and obey the governor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhat uncleanly but good-humored and honest looking personage , being brought forward , " Goodman Dibble , " said the governor , thou having been convicted , upon thy own confession , of having killed a partridge upon the Sabbath , contrary to the express injunctions of Moses , art hereby sentenced by the court to receive forty stripes save one , at the whipping-post . " " But your worships , " interposed the criminal , " my good woman was sore afflicted with the prevailing sickness , and I thought a bit of wild fowl  --  " " Take him away , sergeant ! " said the deputy , who seemed to take a grim satisfaction in dispatching as much of this work as possible , while , on the contrary , the gentler governor read the sentences of the court , which he was obliged to deliver , with manifest repugnance ; " call Master Zaccheus Smeedley . " " Master Zaccheus Smeedley , " said the governor , as the next culprit was brought before the board , " thou having been convicted of the heinous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , art hereby sentenced by the court to forfeit thy title , and to be henceforth called plain Zaccheus Smeedley . " " Take him away , " said the deputy , " and call Humphrey Rednape . " Morton , who had been listlessly observing the course of criminal jurisprudence adopted by the colony , and awaiting with some curiosity the decision of their worships upon his own case , now pricked up his ears , as he heard the name of the last culprit announced . Humphrey Rednape , who had long ago left the domain of Merry-Mount , having deserted his sovereign soon after his first deposition by the military power of Standish , and having afterwards led a vagabond life in different parts of the country till his late arrest , now presented himself before the magistrates . The worthy unicorn retained a lingering relic of his swash buckler air , but he was evidently in a state of decay , and presented a bedraggled and chopfallen appearance . " Quantum mutatus ab illo Hectore ! " muttered his former suzerain , as he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the governor , in a solemn voice , " thou hast been accused of divers and sundry offences , whereof habitual drunkenness is among the least . Especially thou hast been convicted of the high and unpardonable crime of censuring and blaspheming our church , and of reviling the magistrates , for the which offence the court adjudges thee to be branded upon the forehead , to receive fifty lashes at the whipping-post , and after execution of said sentence , to depart without the limits of the patent , not to return again , upon pain of perpetual imprisonment . " " Numps , Numps , poor devil ! " muttered Morton , compassionating the unlucky predicament of his former vassal ; " could not thy lesson , learned at the Plymouth whipping-post , make thee wiser ? Cynthius non aurem vellit et admonuit . ' Could not Apollo twitch thee by the ear ? But I forgot , perhaps he pulled the wrong one , which hangs upon Plymouth pillory , and ,  --  " " Silence ! " roared Dudley , looking towards Morton , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence ! and hear the governor . Thy time will come soon enough , lewd babbler ! " A loud noise and scuffling , at the door-way , just at that moment , attracted the attention of the court , and a sergeant was ordered forth to inquire into the disturbance . Just at that moment , however , the door was flung violently open , and a man of gigantic dimensions , twirling a sledge-hammer in one hand , and holding the grinning head of a wolf , from which the blood was still dripping , in the other , strode into the apartment . " Ye have fined me two pounds , " cried the new comer , flinging the ghastly trophy upon the council-table , " and ye may even take your payment out of yon brute 's pretty face , or ye get nothing from Thomas Walford . " The magistrates looked with some surprise at this unceremonious proceeding upon the part of the reader 's old acquaintance , the Mishawum blacksmith , while he in the mean while continued , with much ferocity ,  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or else perhaps ye would have taken payment out of my hide , as I see ye do daily with the miserable creatures who submit to your saintly authority . Before long , perhaps , ye will set a bounty upon the scalps of Episcopalians , or of blacksmiths . Ye have hunted me like a wolf , and perhaps ye mean that I shall die like one . I have committed no sin , and yet ye deal with me as if I were a felon , because I am not of your communion , or your company . " " Peace , brawler ! " roared Dudley , venting his indignation at last . " Peace ! peace ! where shall I find peace ? " cried the blacksmith , glaring at the deputy , with an evident inclination to demolish his skull with his sledge-hammer  --  while the granite-faced magistrate met his furious gaze with an expression as stern and unflinching as his own . " I was peaceful enough by my solitary forge , till ye intruded upon my settlement , and destroyed my peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly turning to the court ? " Thou art accused and convicted , " said Winthrop , gravely , " of confronting and maltreating the company 's officers , thereby bringing the authority of the magistrates into contempt . The company regret to have brought matters to such a pass with thee , and would have been well pleased hadst thou been contented to abide peaceably and lovingly within their patent , with acknowledged of their jurisdiction . The company do not desire to deal harshly with thee , but thou claimest to hold thy land under an adverse title to our own . Furthermore , thou art the agent of John Oldham , a stubborn and litigious man , who hath not ceased to create trouble for the company . Still the magistrates are disposed to be gentle with thee , and for my own part I declare sincerely that I would willingly be thy friend , if thou couldest be disposed to dwell peaceably within the patent . " The governor 's soft answer seemed to mitigate the blacksmith 's wrath . At any rate , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment , with their worships , and accordingly having made a respectful obeisance to Winthrop , and exchanged a ferocious look with the deputy , he turned towards the door , satisfied , for the moment , with the easy manner in which he had paid his fine . As he was about departing , his eye fell upon Morton , who was standing near the door-way , and who was at that moment recognised by Humphrey Rednape , as the sergeant was leading him away . " Beshrew my heart , " said the blacksmith , good-naturedly , " how camest thou in this plight , my worthy gossip ? " " How indeed ! " said Morton , " demand rather , how can a living man keep out of a scrape , now that the kingdom of the saints be fairly established . Here be three of us now , who are no better esteemed than the wicked , Numps Rednape , thou , my indomitable Vulcan , and myself , who , sooth to say ,  --  " " Silence ! " roared the deputy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insolence of the blacksmith . " Remove the criminal , sergeant , and call Thomas Morton . " There was a considerable sensation among the spectators , as the name of this last culprit was announced , for the fame of the uproarious monarch of Merry-Mount had spread far and wide throughout the bay . The magistrates looked with a severe expression upon him , as he advanced with his usual air of careless confidence , and the straggling groups , who were stationed in different parts of the chamber , clustered together to look with curiosity at the prisoner . " Thomas Morton , " said the governor , gravely , as the criminal stood unabashed before the magistrates , " thou hast been convicted of high and unpardonable crimes . " " Convicted , am I ? " interrupted Morton , " convicted before trial . By Jupiter Tonans , that may be the law as laid down in Deuteronomy , but it would not sound so well at Clifford 's Inn . Your charter , most worshipful governor , requires you to administer justice according to the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor ! " cried Dudley , in a voice of thunder . " So I intend to do , may it please the worshipful magistrates , " continued the imperturbable Morton , " but the governor must even borrow the archangel 's trumpet to outbray the voice of this respectable person , whom I take to be the crier of the court , and who , with submission , seems to me unnecessarily vociferous in proclaiming silence . " Thus coolly rebuking the grim deputy , Morton turned demurely to the governor , who said in reply to his first observation ,  --  " We do not intend to argue any legal points with you . Let it suffice , that we are aware of the responsibility of our position , but that we are determined that no man in the land shall treat our authority with contempt , or abide within our territory without acknowledging the lawful authority of this company . To our king and to our God we are responsible . To thee we intend but to announce our decision , regarding thee as one who hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the manifest notoriety of his manifold offences . " " Would it be entirely superfluous , " said Morton , " on the part of the Court , to give the criminal a trifling hint of some few of the high crimes and misdemeanors he is charged withal ? Although convicted without trial , it would be a gratification to a pardonable curiosity , could I be instructed as to my offence , before receiving sentence . " " Thine own conscience must inform thee of all thy atrocious acts , " interrupted Dudley , fiercely ; " let it suffice that thou art thoroughly known to be a graceless reveller , a lewd mischief-maker , and a ravening wolf . " " Sayest thou so , my gentle lambkin , " cried Morton , filled with indignation at the injustice with which he considered himself treated , and venting it as usual in the most rigmarole terms . " Callest thou me a wolf indeed ? By Jupiter , then have I fallen among the most truculent and blood-thirsty lambs that ever nibbled in Old Canaan or New , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath it . " " Peace , peace ; listen to the governor , " cried several of the magistrates in a breath , indignant at the prisoner 's insolence , and determined once for all to put an end to the scene . " Thomas Morton , " resumed the governor , " in consideration of thy manifold crimes and misdemeanors , whereof the principal have consisted in distributing fire-arms and ammunition among the Indians , contrary to his late and to his present Majesty 's proclamation ; in lewd and riotous behavior , and in divers depredations and cruelties exercised towards the savages ; for these and other offences , the court ordains , that thou be set in the bilboes at such time and place as they shall afterwards direct ; that thou be afterwards imprisoned , until such time as the company shall find a vessel to convey thee back to England ; that thy house at Mount Wollaston be burned to the ground , in order that the habitation of the wicked be no more seen in Israel ; and all thy worldly goods be confiscated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries which they have suffered at thy hands . " " Tantoene animis celestibus iroe ? " cried the culprit , astonished and indignant at the severe sentence thus communicated to him  --  " To be set in the stocks , I Thomas Morton of Clifford 's Inn , Gentleman , Lord of Merry-Mount , and Sachem of Passanogessit , my worldly goods to be confiscated , my house to be burned ? Wherein , I pray thee , right worshipful governor , consist these mighty offences by me committed against the peace and comfort of the savages ? " " Thou hast unjustly taken a canoe from one of them , " said Winthrop , " and complaint to that effect hath been entered against thee . Furthermore , it hath been proved that thou hast discharged fire-arms against them and wounded several , for refusing at once to furnish thee with the said canoe , and to row thee therein across the river of Wessaguscus . " " O Jephthah ! Judge of Israel ! O Minos ! Radamanthus ! and all the puisn justices of Pluto 's grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignation , " is this the jurisprudence practised in the kingdom of the saints ? Then may the Lord deliver me into the hands of sinners from this time forth and forever ! Now could I find it in my  --  " " Silence , silence , thou lewd , impious , blasphemous babbler ! " cried Dudley , indignant at the prisoner 's boldness . " I will not be silent , " cried Morton , with rising rage , " by heavens ! I will tell thee the truth to your grisly beards ; my tongue shall wag for once , even if ye bore it with red-hot irons afterwards . " " Have a care , " cried Dudley , " lest thou be taken at thy word . " " I tell ye , " continued Morton , " that it is all one long , ludicrous patchwork , this your list of charges against me . I know your hatred of me ; I know ye suspect me ; I know ye fear me . Even in the babble of your chamber here have I learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fostering and encouraging the late Indian conspiracy against the Christians . If I were guilty of such a crime , hanging and quartering were too good for me , but  --  " " Thomas Morton , " interposed the Governor , " no such charges against thee have been preferred to this court ; neither do I , speaking in my individual capacity , entertain any such suspicions concerning thee . " " And so then , " resumed the prisoner , " I am really to be punished for cruelty to the salvages , I their sagamore , suzerain , shepherd , pow-wow ! Why , the creatures love , reverence , and obey me . They frisk round me like lambs ; they will bleat their hearts out with grief when they see my palace in flames , and  --  " " Enough of this , " interrupted Winthrop ; " the court hath declared its sentence . Nothing can alter its resolution . Its decress are binding , and they who are aggrieved by its acts have their remedy at home , but not here within our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I counsel thee in the most friendly manner not to aggravate thy offence by unnecessary recalcitration and recrimination . " " Aye , I suppose I should go down upon my marrow bones , " persisted Morton , " and offer humble and hearty thanks that ye have left my head upon my shoulders , or at least my ears upon my head , after the atrocious crimes of which I have been convicted and condemned without a trial . But I promise ye that the bowels of the land shall be stirred for this ; the king and council shall hear of it , and may my soul perish in everlasting  --  " " Take him away , take him away , he blasphemeth , " roared the deputy . " Remove the criminal at once , " added Winthrop , gently but decidedly . And with this the men-at-arms led the Lord of Merry-Mount into confinement . CHAPTER XVI . THE GENERAL COURT . It was the middle of October . An autumnal day , such as exists only in the western hemisphere , was shining upon Shawmut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stately groves , which adorned without encumbering the picturesque peninsula , the scattered trees of colossal size which decorated its triple hills , wore the gorgeous drapery of an American fall . Unlike the forests of the older world , which , thinly clad in their beggar-weeds of brown and russet , stand shivering and sighing in the dark and misty atmosphere , the monarchs of the western soil had arrayed themselves in robes of Tyrian purple and crimson , scarlet and gold , and like reckless revellers in some plague-struck city , attired in all their carnival bravery , and beneath a vault of crystal radiance , were awaiting the destroyer 's stroke . The recent pilgrims from the older world , wandered through these glowing and glittering woods with admiring eyes . The forests seemed like the subterranean groves with which the African enchanter charmed Aladdin , where rods of blossoming rubies , and boughs overladen with topaz , emerald , sapphire , and diamonds , dazzled the eye with their luxuriant and intertangled magnificence , and where every footstep fell upon countless heaps of crushed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hill , covered from base to summit with its radiant foliage , where every prismatic color seemed flung at random in one confused and gaudy mass , a vagrant fancy might have deemed it nature 's mighty palette , with all the blent and glaring colors wherewith she paints the rainbows , myriads of which seemed struggling and wreathing themselves through the forest branches to float into the cloudless heavens . There is no power in language to represent , certainly not to exaggerate , the brilliancy of an American forest in autumn . The precise reason for the peculiarity which the foliage exhibits , has never been satisfactorily ascertained , but every species of tree and shrub seems to have a tint peculiar to itself . Upon that memorable morning , which may be called the birth-day of the Massachusetts metropolis , the woods which decorated the promontory , or covered the chain of hills which encircled it , were still virgin from the axe , and were robed in all their natural glory . The oak still retained his foliage undiminished , but every leaf , though green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted with purple ; the sumac , bare and leafless , lifted its crimson crest ; the grape vines hung around every cliff festoons of clustering coral ; the red maple , first to be transfixed with the frost-arrow , stood with every leaf crimsoned in its blood ; the hickory looked like a golden tree transplanted from some vegetable mine , as it displayed its long leaves of pale metallic yellow ; the birch looked like a flaming torch , fit for the hand of autumn 's goddess , when seeking through the world her ravished Proserpine ; while mingled with and contrasting solemnly with all , the dark pines held on high their plumes of fadeless green . Such was the scenery which surrounded the infant village of Boston . Since the date of the last chapter , nearly all the inhabitants , accompanying the governor , most of the magistrates , and the minister , Mr. Wilson , had removed to the triple-headed peninsula , leaving only seventeen male inhabitants at the opposite promontory of Charleston . Blaxton , who claimed the whole of Shawmut , both by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlers thither , having been touched by their sufferings , and , as it then seemed , the inadequacy of their first location to supply their wants . He still dwelt at his hermitage , separated by the whole breadth of the peninsula from his new neighbors . His cottage , as we have already described , was placed upon the edge of the western cove , while the lowly church , the rude town-house , the market-place , and the thatched cabins which constituted the little village , were placed upon the eastern or seaward verge of the promontory , nestled beneath the commanding summit which was soon afterwards fortified upon one side , and protected from the northern gales by the tall cliff which rose upon the other , and which still holds the ancient tombs of the Pilgrims . Walter Ludlow and his sister had some time before removed to the new settlement , which was evidently destined to become the principal position in the new colony . Henry Maudsley was still absent , but a change had come over the relative position of the lovers during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it had been absolutely necessary for Maudsley to make to Walter Ludlow , had led to some mutual explanations . Maudsley discovered the extent and the wilfulness of his errors at a moment when it seemed too late . Still , if he had remained in New England , it might have been even longer before the perverse fate which seems to delight in perplexing lovers , would have allowed them fully to understand each other . Moreover , as has been already hinted , a total revolution in his feelings upon the subject concerning which they had been so disunited , had taken place Circumstances , which were in the very process of development , had contributed much to this change , which the love of Esther had commenced . The example of Winthrop , Johnson , and others , had made a deep impression upon his excitable imagination . Moreover , he had been recently brought into intimate connection with many of the leaders and eminent persons concerned in the Massachusetts emigration , who remained in England . Had not an imperious necessity forbidden , he would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so simply unsealed his eyes , have abandoned a country which now had assumed an entirely different aspect in his sight , have hastened across the ocean , never to return , and have united his destiny forever with that of Esther . Alas ! at the very moment when this revulsion first commenced in his feelings , he had found it impossible to indulge and to foster it ; and , now that a total change had indeed come over him , now that the groundlessness of his fears and suspicions had been explained ; now that none of the obstacles which had formerly impeded the current of their loves , existed , a new and almost an insurmountable one seemed to have interposed itself , which time only could remove . It was , however , a source of happiness to Esther , even in this the period of their separation , that now at least , and for the first time , her lover and herself understood and confided in each other . She felt a firm and unwavering hope , now that their hearts and souls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other , and flow on together to the end . At this moment , however , she had cause for real anxiety , for a long and an inexplicable silence upon the part of Maudsley , had given rise to doubts of every thing but of his truth . Other exiles of note , besides Walter Ludlow , had recently taken up their residence at Shawmut . Among others , the eccentric Maverick , the first slaveholder of Massachusetts , had established himself and his negroes upon Noddle 's Island , where he had built himself a fort , defended by four pieces of artillery , and where he treated all comers with a generous and noted hospitality . Among others , he had entertained Governor Winthrop and his friends , upon their first arrival in the bay , although his politics and religion were opposed to those of the company , and although , in the course of time , but little cordiality existed between the new comers and himself . The first general court had been that day held at the new metropolis . It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rude town-hall , where they had been gathered , stood where now stands that respectable edifice , which having been successively state-house , city hall , and post-office , has at last retired in its old age from public employments , and devoted itself to private affairs . The thatched and humble church where Wilson ministered , stood nearly opposite ; while , around the open field between , which served as a market-place for the little village , and which accommodated their pillory , stocks and whipping-post , were clustered the mud-walled cabins where the settlers had established themselves , in anticipation of the coming winter . A stream of solemn visaged personages had poured out at last from the rude capitol . The court was over , but many stragglers , in their steeple-crowned hats and sad-colored garments , loitered about the agora , or , accompanied by their demure wives , were wandering among the primitive groves which covered the greater portion of the peninsula . A good deal of earnest conversation was going on among the loiterers in the public square . Besides many very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed , several topics had been broached at the general court , which threatened to sow the seeds of future dissension among the colonists . The great points of the compatibility of offices , whether ruling elders should be magistrates , and the reverse , whether the political influence of the ministers required enlargement or contraction , whether the civil power was justified in punishing breaches of the first table , and many other kindred topics had been touched upon in the town-hall , and were discussed with great fervor by the straggling parties who were still sauntering in the October sunshine . Several respectable individuals , among whom might have been observed Goodman Faunce , with his friends Jonathan Jellett and Peter Pid , stood under a mighty oak which spread its rainbow foliage over half the square . Being all freemen , they had of course been present at the general court , the regular organization of the assembly requiring the personal attendance of all those who were free of the corporation , until the increasing numbers , a few years later , required the introduction of the representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative body under the charter , although the Court of Assistants , which had been designed by that instrument to wield only executive and judicial functions , had already begun , by a patriarchal assumption of authority , to exercise the law-making power of its own will . So little of the democratic element , however , seems to have existed at that early day in Massachusetts , that this usurpation on the part of the magistrates , unconscious as it almost seems to have been , excited no jealousy upon the part of the freemen , to whom the legislative power exclusively belonged , and at this very first general court , holden at Boston , it had been unanimously voted , by simple erection of hands , " that in future the freemen should choose the assistants , by whom the governor and deputy should be chosen from among themselves , and that , furthermore , the said governor , deputy , and assistants , should have full power to make the laws , and to choose officers to execute the same . " Such a quiet and voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body in favor of their rulers , is unexampled , and speaks volumes in favor of the patriarchal , pure , and unambitious characters of those early rulers . How often in the world 's history has such unlimited power been placed in a few hands , and been restored without a struggle , and without the faintest attempt to establish a regular and unlimited oligarchy ! The respectable Faunce , however , seemed to have a glimmering notion of the tendency of the measure which had so recently passed by acclamation , and was taking some pains , now that the vote was taken , to point out its consequences to his companions . " The worshipful governor , " said he , " is free from self-seeking , and desires nothing but the temporal and eternal advantages of the colony . But look ye , my friends , the government may come in time to be administered by hands which are not so clean , and I , for one , should be well pleased to have a voice in the making the laws which are to govern me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given me the right to do so . " " Thou wert even a caviller in politics , Goodman Faunce , " answered Jellett ; " now I confess for my part that I feel but little calling for such knotty subjects . If the worthy and worshipful magistrates are willing to take this troublesome burthen off our backs , why I must even feel beholden to them for their kindness . They know more of law-making than we do . To make laws , brother Faunce , is a trade , I take it , like any other . Now if it comes to mending a kettle or a stew-pan , I , being by temporal calling , a tinker , may very  --  " " Nonsense , nonsense , " exclaimed Faunce , with some excitement , " although I have the deepest veneration for the character of our worthy magistrates , or rather for our chief magistrate , for truly there are times when the deputy is little more than a vessel of wrath , and is a hard-handed man at a bargain , moreover , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I mislike this laying the reins on the back of a horse , however good-tempered he may be . The best of us are but sinful , and the bit will get between the teeth . " " It is highly generous upon the part of their worships , " modestly suggested Peter Pid , " to take this troublesome office of making laws , as well as of seeing to their execution . Few would be willing or able to do this double work in a holy cause . But they are competent . Issachar is a strong ass , though he coucheth between two burdens , " concluded Master Pid , intending to be complimentary to the magistrates . Dismissing the discussion of the recent vote of the assembly as a topic , upon which , perhaps , too many words had been wasted , although without their consciousness , it had effected a political revolution in an instant , the three worthies passed to a warm , although somewhat unprofitable discussion of some knotty points in divinity , which had already begun to distract the metaphysics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much to the horror of his associates , broached the doctrine of justification by sanctification , which he doughtily defended , while Pid treated the doctrine of good works with indignation , and stood manfully out for a covenant of grace . Several persons , both male and female , joined the party in the discussion , and the sun was high in the heavens before it had terminated . In the meantime , however , as the usual hour for such ceremonies approached , the centre of the market-place was cleared , in order that punishment might be inflicted upon several persons who had incurred it during the past few weeks . All the whipping and branding , however , which had been ordained by the last Court of Assistants , had been dispatched upon the preceding day , so that the whipping-post was idle . Culprits , however , who had committed offences of a lighter nature , were now led forward . First of all came a beadle , leading along two women , with their hands tied together , and with their heads and faces covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingeniously fitted across their tongues , compelling them to keep their mouths open , and the unruly member quiet . These were notorious scolds , a kind of culprits which the wisdom of those patriarchal days punished in common with drunkards , vagrants , Quakers , Antinomians , and other disturbers of the public peace . After being solemnly paraded up and down the market-place for half a dozen times , each was tied in a chair , and seated before the door of her own house , where she was to be left till evening . Next came a quizzical figure , led along by a sergeant armed with a halberd . It was a famous toper , undergoing punishment for his manifold deviations from the path of total abstinence . He was attired in what was called the drunkard 's cloak , and which was nothing more nor less than a beer-cask , with the lower end knocked out , so as to allow him to use his legs , with a hole through the other , through which appeared his head , and two apertures in the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the emblem of his sins , the culprit was several times solemnly paraded up and down the square , and then tied to the whipping-post , which stood very near the stocks . As the culprit had , however , upon this occasion , been only sentenced to public exposure till nightfall , and not to personal castigation , he was left standing in his cloak at the post , to endure the jibes , the rebukes , or the silent pity of all the inhabitants . In the mean time , this being the day appointed for Morton 's penance , and the hour of noon having arrived , a sergeant , with four men-at-arms appeared , bringing with them in durance vile , the luckless Lord of Merry-Mount . He appeared to have used all his philosophy to show himself superior to his fate . He walked along between two severe looking Puritans , with a firm and dignified step . His countenance wore its usual frank and bold expression , although an occasional nervous twitch at the corners of his mouth , showed that a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , to be seated upon the rough log , lifted one leg after another to be inclosed in the appropriate apertures , and saw the plank duly let down and fastened without a struggle . When he was thus properly ensconced in his ignominious position , the soldiers left him to his fate , to be a mark for the curiosity or malevolence of all who passed across the market-place until evening . The knowledge that the celebrated Master of Misrule at Merry-Mount was that day to be set in the stocks , was , of course , very general among the settlers , so that he had sat there but a very few minutes , before half the inhabitants of Boston , besides many from the neighboring plantations , thronged to that wilderness-square to look at him . He preserved his equanimity , however , as if determined not to let the Puritans observe how deeply he felt his degradation . " Quid omnium vultus in unum me truces ? " muttered he , quoting his favorite Horace to the last . " Why the devil are ye all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cavalier in unfortunate circumstances before ? Look your fill , I beg ye ; ye have won the day , ye rascally croppies , so even enjoy your triumph . " With these and other similar ejaculations , uttered , however , in an inaudible tone , did the deposed potentate vent his spleen and console himself in his downfall . He had not sat there long , before he had been examined and commented upon by nearly all the inhabitants , after which , the first curiosity having been appeased , he was left at times in total solitude , interrupted at intervals by the visit of some straggling wayfarer . As the square was for a moment empty , the Lord of Merry-Mount cast his eyes upon the rueful individual in the wooden cloak , who stood upon the other side of the field . The careless look , however , which he threw upon his brother in affliction , became a fixed and concentrated stare , as he suddenly recognised the familiar features of the individual who stood there in such fantastic plight . " Hey-day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for greater certainty , had his hands not been tied behind him ; " hey-day , is it thou , indeed , most cherished of my vassals . Is it thou , indeed , my butler , my Bootefish ? Proh pudor ! " " This be that individual , your worship , " answered Bootefish , for it was no other than that worthy person , who was terminating thus ignobly a vagrant career in different parts of New England , which he had begun upon Morton 's first capture by Miles Standish ; " this be the individual , if a man in a wooden jerkin like this can be called by that honored name . This be the way the bloody psalm-singers have coopered up your faithful Bootefish . Truly they hate us of the true church , your worship . " " Ah , they have got the upper hand of us , " said Morton , " and they show no generosity in their victory . And yet , by Jove ! I could laugh at the figure we cut here . Here sits the potentate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his robe . What a termination to our golden visions ! " " Truly , your worship , I have had no visions of late , " answered Bootefish , " but of the whipping-post . And yet , may I be damued ! if I would not take that as soon as this . To wear a hogshead under my jerkin is what I have ever done , thus carrying out , as best I might , the merciful intentions of nature . But a hogshead outside is a disgrace which I can not brook . A pretty figure do I cut , forsooth , in this ridiculous cask . " " Not a whit , not a whit , " said the indomitable Morton , gaily . " It becomes thee like a robe of honor . Was not Coeur de Lion kept in a cage ? Did not Diogenes live in his tub ? Nay , thou lookest like the ancient philosopher , seeking among these sour-faced Puritans for a man ; and for a lantern , hast thou not that radiant nose of thine ? " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly and earnestly , first at one of the culprits , and then at the other . Last of all came Walter Ludlow and his sister , accompanied by an individual with the most peaked and pointed hat , the most staid and starched collar , and the most dismal cloak that could be found in the whole patent . The step of Esther was less elastic , and her countenance more dejected than it had ever been . A shadow was upon that beautiful face , as if projected from afar by coming evil . She threw a hurried glance of sincere compassion at the criminals , and past hastily onward with her brother towards their new domicile , which , much superior in character to the rude hovels around , had been constructed in part of the materials brought from their old residence at Naumkeak , and stood more than half a mile south from the church , and not far from the " governor 's green , " where Winthrop 's mansion was soon afterwards erected . The individual , however , who accompanied the Ludlows was observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward with a kind of holy horror , as the prisoners met his view . The Ludlows passed on , but this person still lingered in the square , influenced , apparently , by curiosity , or by a desire of administering a rebuke to the two unhappy culprits . He stood for a moment in the centre of the square , looking alternately at Morton and at Bootefish ; heaved a deep sigh , and then seemed almost to prostrate himself upon the ground . Whether , contrary to Puritanic custom , he intended kneeling down in prayer in behalf of the prisoners , did not for a moment distinctly appear . He said not a word , however , but rising up , a moment afterwards , he suddenly flung a cabbage-stalk at Bootefish with such unerring precision , that it hit him full upon the nose ; and then turning round , he bestowed the same favor , although with less success , upon the unfortunate Lord of Merry-Mount . Then lifting the steeple-crowned hat from his head for an instant , he disclosed the grinning , malicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , gathering up his long black cloak about his waist , he threw a somerset , such as was never executed before or since in Puritanic garments , and then left the square . " Alas ! " muttered Morton , whom this last indignity , inflicted by the meanest of his former vassals , wounded deeply  --  " alas ! is this the end of all my splendid visions ? Was it for this that I have abandoned my country and my profession ? Was it for this that I gave up the lord keeper 's wig ? To sit in the stocks and be pelted by Peter Cakebread ? My race is run ; my sun is set . Still , although the saints have conquered the sinner , shall they not crush his spirit ? Do your worst , ye chosen of the Lord ! degrade his person , confiscate his worldly goods , ye terrify him not ,  --  Si fractus illabatur orbis , Impavidum ferient ruin . " ' CHAPTER XVII . THE KNIGHT 'S LAST SCHEME . Several weeks after the occurrence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking in the neighborhood of her new home . Her destiny seemed still perverse . Now that the great cause , to which her soul had been devoted , had triumphed over every obstacle , and had already established itself upon foundations never to be shaken ; now that she could have gone exultingly forth , like Miriam , with timbrel and song of triumph , was she yet oppressed with a deep sense of her own personal disappointment ? A change had come over her destiny during the interval which had elapsed . Maudsley was still away , and nothing concerning his fate had reached her for a long time . But although an ocean rolled between them , their hearts were no longer separated by an unfathomable gulf of suspicion and mutual distrust . Maudsley had left New England , believing that Esther 's affections had been alienated from him , doubting , indeed , whether there had ever been the faintest response upon her part to his deep and absorbing passion . He had , however , previously to his departure , allowed himself , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching the character of the man who appeared to have exercised over her some mysterious and unnatural fascination . He would have been incapable , moved by jealousy alone , to have traduced the character of one , concerning whom he knew little , while he suspected much ; but even had Esther been nothing to him , he would still have felt it his imperious duty to warn her of her danger , such reliance did he place upon his presentiments , his dim reminiscences , and the fragmentary knowledge which he had acquired through Cakebread 's treachery . Neither did he hesitate , although a delicate sense of honor would at first seem to have forbidden it , to make full use of all the information conveyed to him by that crafty knave . The reader will judge in the sequel , whether the nature of the circumstances did not more than justify him in such a course . The very first letter received by him after his departure from New England was from Walter Ludlow . His own answer paved the way in the most natural manner possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of the brother and sister . The clear sunlight of truth dissolved all the misty phantoms which had disturbed his reason , and he bitterly acknowledged and deplored the wilful and blind impetuosity by which he had both suffered and inflicted so much distress . But Esther was happy , when she reflected that her lover now sympathized fully , deeply with her own feelings ; and his letters , which reached her at long intervals , breathed at once the most passionate devotion to herself , and the most ardent affection for the great cause which , in accordance with the enthusiastic temperament of that age of religion , his impressionable spirit had felt itself suddenly called upon , as was St. Paul 's , by a supernatural voice , to reverence , and with all his heart to serve . Still his absence was protracted , and although Esther was aware that matters of deep import had occupied him , and required his presence in different parts of Europe , yet she felt sick at heart , when she reflected upon the many dangers that might still lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters , Esther lingered that morning in the leafless grove which extended westerly from her new abode . A presentiment of coming evil , for which she could not account , and which she could not shake off , weighed upon her spirit , as the coming thunder-storm oppresses and surcharges the yet cloudless atmosphere . The radiant autumn was no more . Bleak December , with its long nights of stormy darkness , and its short hours of pale and broken sunshine , sat upon its gloomy throne . The day was chill , the landscape brown and dreary . Suddenly Esther heard a step in the forest ; she looked up , and for the first time in many months saw the form of Sir Christopher Gardiner . The warning images which had thronged her brain for the past hours , now seemed to have had their meaning . They seemed suddenly to have been compressed and concentrated into one threatening phantom , and that phantom wore the form of the hated and mysterious knight . She had thought him absent , never to return ; she had almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the conviction that his dark countenance was never again to be bent upon her own , that his stealthy step was never again to cross her path ; when lo ! at the very instant when her soul was most gloomy , when her heart hung like lead in her bosom , at that very instant Sir Christopher Gardiner stood before her . ' T was strange , she had certainly seen him , gliding beneath the leafless branches of an oak . That spare , Arab-like figure , those dark and frowning features , could not be mistaken ; and yet , as she looked again , he was not there . Could he have passed her by without observing or without recognising her ? Had he gone forward to the house which stood at no great distance from the spot ? Was the apparition but a creation of her boding and disordered fancy ? Had the earth suddenly gaped and swallowed him ? It was a mystery , but every thing connected with the knight was a mystery . All that she knew was , that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , and that now he had disappeared . While she was thus ruminating upon the strangeness of the circumstance , she felt herself suddenly seized from behind , with determined although gentle force . She would have cried aloud , but even as in the motionless tortures of a night-mare , her tongue clove to the roof her mouth . She would have struggled , but her limbs refused to obey her will . A sensation as if , after all , she was but suffering the short-lived agony of a waking dream , overpowered her . In an instant afterwards her face was muffled in a cloak , her arms were bound , and thus pinioned , blinded , and deprived of all power of motion or utterance , she found herself rapidly borne away she knew not whither . Within five minutes afterwards , she felt herself gently deposited upon a seat , and after a brief delay , she learned by the rocking motion and the noise of dashing waves , that she had been placed in a boat , and was now upon the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew not . Not a whisper reached her ear , not a ray of light pierced the thick veil by which her vision was carefully shrouded . Gardiner 's dark image rose again to affright her soul , and she entertained not a doubt that he was the author of this fearful misfortune , which had now befallen her , and seemed to threaten her destruction . Whether the knight , still brooding angrily over her absolute and peremptory rejection of his addresses , had returned after so long an absence to wreak that vengeance upon her which he had so darkly and obscurely threatened at their last and decisive interview ; whether she had fallen suddenly into the hands of some prowling party of savages ; whether she was now floating in a canoe , to be borne away into fearful captivity in the remote wilderness ; whether she was to be placed on board some outward bound vessel , of which she knew there were one or two to set sail immediately from the colony , to be borne beyond the ocean , she knew not ; and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror as intense as could pervade , without absolutely overmastering and destroying , a solitary woman 's reason . An eternity of anguish seemed to have passed over her , although she could not form with the slightest accuracy an opinion as to the actual length of time which had elapsed since her first capture , when the sails of the boat seemed to be flapping heavily , and then to be furled around the masts . Directly afterwards the light keel seemed to touch a pebbly shore , and she was then again lifted from her position , and borne rapidly away . After a few moments , a door seemed to open , and she was carried within a building . She was then placed with great gentleness upon a cushioned seat , and directly afterwards , the cords which bound her were loosened , and the cloak by which she was muffled was removed . For a moment she dared not to open her eyes , and she sat collecting all the energy which was left her , before she should venture upon the new scene of horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fearfully round . She found herself in a strange apartment , spacious but uncouth in its appearance , evidently the abode of civilized men rather than of savages , but resembling in its equipments nothing which she had ever before seen . She deemed herself alone , and was uttering a devout thanksgiving for even this momentary respite , when a stealthy step struck her ear , and then she found herself in the company of Sir Christopher Gardiner . " We meet again , Esther Ludlow , " said he , in a gentle and melancholy tone , " we meet again , never to separate . " Esther , as pale as ashes , looked in his face without power of reply . " Since we were last together , " resumed the knight , " I have dwelt amid savage scenes , and with men more savage than the deserts where they dwell . I intended to beat down , to annihilate the passion which had taken possession of my soul . The idleness to which the wilderness has doomed me has , I suppose , rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these odious professions , " said Esther , looking at the knight with a pale and impassible visage . " I have but very few words to speak , Esther , " he continued , " and those will soon be spoken . I intended , both for your sake and my own , to conquer a fatal passion . I have not been used to hear words of contempt and repugnance from woman 's lips , and yet I endured your disdain without resentment . " " Till this moment , " interrupted Esther , her blood mounting with indignation at the calm and measured language of her persecutor , " till this moment I hardly knew what disdain and hatred were . Heaven forgive me that I want words to express my loathing for you now ! " " I have already told you , " he continued , " that such language from your gentle sex is new to my ear . I never knelt so long in abject adoration to living creature as I have done at your feet , and I have received nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then release me , restore me , if you are not in truth a very demon , " said Esther . " Pardon me , " continued the knight , " I fear that my habits of life , and the philosophy in which I have been schooled , have rendered my character incomprehensible to a person as single-hearted and pure-minded as yourself . You are now within my power . " " If you are a man , " exclaimed Esther , " you are incapable of abusing that power . " " If I were not a man , " coolly resumed the knight , " perhaps I should be . You are , I repeat it , absolutely in my power . I am a man bound by no ties , recognising no laws , obeying the will of no living creature but my own , respecting nothing , fearing nothing , loving nothing , but yourself . " " May God in his wrath blast such blasphemous love ! " said Esther , with ungovernable scorn . " Your hatred keeps pace with my hourly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is proverbially perverse to lovers . Let me then waste words no longer . You are , at this moment , the mistress of your destiny . Let me remind you that , upon one subject in times gone by , there was sympathy between us . To be the creator of an empire in the desert , was a great thought , which created the same lofty emotion in your bosom as in my own . " " You know better even than myself , " replied Esther , " that pretence of sympathy between us is a mockery , but most of all , upon the subject to which you allude . I have learned to despise your hypocrisy and falsehood in all things , in nothing more than this . " " We , perhaps , have contemplated the same object from different points of view , " continued Gardiner , " but let that pass . Let me now inform you , that before a few months are over , this whole wilderness of New England will call me undisputed master . The whole rich province of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to me alone , and transmissible to my descendants forever . All the efforts of these besotted Puritans are silently inuring to my benefit , and this infant empire , with all its inappreciable future of wealth and grandeur , belongs to me alone . " " These are the ravings of a madman , " said Esther , looking with mingled fear and wonder at the dark countenance of her companion . " Believe it not , beautiful Esther , " he continued , with a little more excitement of manner , but in the same deliberate accents . " I am no enthusiastic visionary . My kingdom is of this world . My schemes are positive , solid , material , not the delusive raptures of a dreamer . I repeat that , at this moment , the choice is in your own hands . " " You can offer me nothing but misery , perdition , infamy , " said Esther , who seemed to feel the icy hand of death upon her heart , as she contemplated her forlorn position . " I have received letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had not the incorrigible and mischievous recklessness of one of my agents , thrown many obstacles in my way , my plot would not have been so long in ripening . Know , however , that the boasted patent of your colony is not worth the parchment upon which it is written , that thousands of men and millions of money are to be instantly placed at my disposal , and that ere six months have past , I shall be proclaimed hereditary Lord Proprietor and Palatine of Massachusetts , and Governor-General and Admiral of all New England . " " Is the blessed charter indeed revoked ? " murmured Esther , feeling , in spite of her own fearful position , a pang of regret at the downfall of the great cause . " Aye , the charter is worthless and already annulled ! " exclaimed Gardiner , scrupling not to hazard a falsehood , which he , however , believed would shortly become a truth , " and it is now for you to decide . Forget the disdain and the hatred with which you have repaid my passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the councils , and to direct the destiny of one who adores you , as man never worshipped before . " " Never , never ! " cried Esther , shutting her eyes and holding up both her hands , as if to hide some dreadful vision . " Be not too hasty , " quietly resumed the knight , " the wife of the Lord Palatine of the Massachusetts , will hold no mean position , and have no little amount of human happiness within her high control . Wild though her domains , at this instant , may be , an empire which stretches across a continent , and plants its feet upon two oceans , is worthy to occupy an ambitious soul . Of this wide territory you shall be mistress . " " Your words are vain and idle , " replied Esther , with cold and icy contempt , " now that I understand your trifling and vulgar ambition , your sordid schemes , I loathe you more than ever . I never will be your wife . " " Then live to be my hand-maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knight in ungovernable passion , " refuse to be the sharer , the controller of my destiny , and since it likes thee better , be the plaything and the solace of my lighter hours . You are at this moment irrevocably within my power . I accept not your decision now , but accord you six hours of deliberation . Escape is impossible , and I leave you to deliberate at your leisure . " Uttering these concluding words in a gentler tone , the knight subduing his emotion by a powerful effort , arose , saluted Esther respectfully , and then left the apartment . His prisoner heard him fasten the door securely behind him , and then , exhausted with the agitating events and emotions of the last few hours , she sank back almost insensible . How long she remained in this condition she could not tell . A keen sensation of her fearful position suddenly aroused her from her trance . She found herself still alone , and collecting all her strength , she moved rapidly about the apartment , examining the doors and windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alas ! every thing had been too securely fastened , and the efforts of a weak , solitary woman , were utterly hopeless . The house where she was a prisoner , and which was no other than the deserted palace of Merry-Mount , was surrounded , as she saw , by an expanse of hill and dale in one direction , by the boundless forest in another , and by the sea upon the third . But although she saw no means of making her way homeward , utterly ignorant as she was of the place of her imprisonment , yet a death in the forest would have been welcomed with rapture in preference to the doom which seemed impending over her . But she at last felt convinced that escape from the room where she was a prisoner , was utterly hopeless . Exhausted and despairing , she again fell into a half insensible state . It seemed to her that her reason was slowly yielding to the fearful excitement of that day , and an irresistible and benumbing lethargy seemed taking possession of her senses . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at last again aroused to a consciousness of her situation by a movement upon the outside of the door . In another moment , Sir Christopher Gardiner stood again in her presence . She shuddered convulsively as he approached , but had no strength to utter a syllable , when he inquired in the most courteous and honied accents , if she were not inelined at last to relent in her determination . Gardiner , vexed at her silence , paced up and down the room , his brain whirling with a thousand conflicting passions , but ever and anon paused in his disturbed and impetuous career , to satiate his eyes with a long , ardent gaze at his victim 's beauty . Suddenly he threw himself with apparent frenzy at her feet . " Why will you compel to crime , " he exclaimed in passionate accents , " one who would willingly live your slave forever ? Maddened by your beauty beyond control of every law , divine or human , even thus abjectly do I implore you to recall your fatal decision . " Tears of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusky cheek , he wrung his hands in frantic supplication , he kissed her feet , her garments , he raised his eyes towards her face , as if he lay in devout prostration before an enshrined divinity . " Not to me , kneel not to me , " murmured Esther faintly , finding a voice at last , " not to me , but to thy God . Pray to the Omnipotent , to crush in his mercy , the demon to whom thou hast devoted thyself , soul and body . " An indescribable sneer succeeded the softer expression upon Gardiner 's swarthy features . He sprang to his feet , and extended his arms towards Esther . At that instant a shrill and peculiar whistle was heard without . " Confusion ! " muttered the knight , springing to the door . " What means Skettwarroes by this sudden signal ?  --  " Thrusting his pistols hastily into his belt , and drawing his rapier , he threw open the door , and advanced cautiously a few steps outside . Quick as light did Esther , recovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he had time in his surprise to draw the bolts . She was ready to brave every unknown danger , rather than remain an instant longer in the hated presence of her persecutor . Gardiner had already strained his eyes in every direction , but had seen no trace of the suspected enemy . The shadows of a winter 's afternoon , however , had already gathered over the boundless forest , by which the house was inclosed on three sides , so that it was difficult precisely to ascertain from whence the danger was to be anticipated . He had answered the signal of the faithful Skettwarroes , who occupied the look-out upon the watch tower , and with whom he exchanged a few unintelligible words , when suddenly he observed that Esther had already reached and unfastened the small door which opened through the palisade . He sprang forward like lightning , dashed through the gate in her pursuit , and seized her in his arms just as she was on the point of plunging into the forest . " By your leave , lady mine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so readily , though ' t was a pretty sortie , I confess . " Esther screamed and struggled with all her spirit and strength . The hope of escape , which had been so nearly accomplished , yielding thus suddenly to despair , seemed to produce a frenzy in her soul , and to endow her frame for an instant with preternatural strength . " Exhaust thyself not , " said the knight , " with these idle struggles . Indeed , thou must back to thy cage again , my pretty bird of paradise . Nay , nay , be wise , there is none to help thee , beautiful Esther . " " ' T is false , cowardly ruffian ! " suddenly exclaimed a voice , hoarse with passion , but whose well known accents fell like music upon Esther 's ear . At the same time an elastic form bounded like a tiger from the thicket , seized Gardiner by the throat , and hurled him to the ground . Esther uttered a feeble exclamation , and then sank insensible into the arms of Henry Maudsley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his feet again in an instant . He strode forward to punish the intruder , who , occupied at that instant with the fainting Esther , seemed hardly capable of defending himself . Suddenly , upon perceiving the features of the supposed stranger , the knight paused , with his sword uplifted in his hand , and stood motionless as if changed to stone , with features grown suddenly rigid in their passionate convulsions , and with eyes gleaming with strange and unnatural fire . In the mean time , while Maudsley stood , with the senseless form of Esther in his arms , frantically imploring her to look up for a single moment , and while the knight stood spell-bound and immovable before him , several figures emerged from the forest , and silently ascended the slightly elevated , but upon one side , somewhat precipitous platform or ledge , upon which the groap was accidentally stationed . Before the knight could recover his self-possession , he saw himself surrounded by six or seven well armed soldiers , who had been sent by the magistrates to arrest him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maudsley for further orders . An unarmed person in Puritan hat and cloak , who had accompanied the party apparently in the character of guide , seemed desirous of concealing himself from observation . Gardiner at last seemed to awake from his trance , and to look around upon the grim figures , who , arrayed in steel cap and corslet , and armed with matchlock and rapier , had gathered in such formidable numbers about him , with an expression of contempt . " Little do I regard the malice of these crop-eared blood-hounds , " he muttered , grasping his rapier convulsively in his hand ; " the living move me not , no , nor the dead ! " " No ! " continued he in a hollow voice , with features expressive of a profound horror , but with an attitude of desperate determination  --  " no , though the grave gives up its dead ; though hell itself hurl back its victims to affright me , even then and thus do I defy thee , Harry Maudsley ! " The knight would have sprung forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of Gardiner , who submitted patiently to be held for a moment , while Maudsley spoke . " Be assured , " said he , " that ' t is no preternatural apparition who addresses you , but a man in flesh and blood , as real as your own . There will be ample leisure hereafter to explain why and how my recovery from the wound received at your hands was kept a secret from you  --  " " Verily , Sir Christopher , " cried a shrill voice suddenly interrupting Maudsley at this point , " verily , I made a grave as you desired upon the solitary beach , but the tenant , look you , was wanting , so I even buried the secret within it , and closed my mouth and the grave at the same moment . " " Perfidious liar ! " exclaimed the knight , starting as if a serpent had stung him , and glaring furiously at the malicious , mocking countenance of Peter Cakebread , who had hitherto eluded his observation . " Nay , nay , most worthy chevalier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a chuckle , " thou didst procure me once an ignominious and most painful chastisement . I have made thee wait a long time for payment , but I was even determined to leave no stone unturned , to return the obligation in one way or another . Vengeance is mine , and I will repay , saith the Lord ! a text which I learned from my new masters , although I do not yet correctly apply my learning , perhaps . " " If then , " cried Gardiner , turning furiously towards Maudsley , " you have , in truth , escaped the death to which I supposed you long since a victim , you can now , at least , have neither right nor inclination to defer an instant longer , the conclusion of our quarrel , which , if it had not been deadly before , would have been aggravated by to-day 's events . Order these armed attendants of yours to retire . " " No , Sir Knight , " said Maudsley , who had gently deposited upon the ground , and wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who had now advanced close towards his former antagonist  --  " No , even if a mighty change , such as you could neither understand nor dream of , had not changed the whole complexion of my life , and made me more cautious , at least , of shedding blood in private quarrel , still would I scorn to lift my sword against such a thing as you are proved to be . " " Insolent reptile ! " exclaimed Gardiner , fiercely . " All taunts are idle , " continued Maudsley . " I met you once as a knightly gentleman , in honorable combat . I stand here now commissioned to arrest you as a malefactor . " " What means this insolence ? " exclaimed the knight , in husky tones , and with a strange pallor upon his swarthy cheek . " Your own guilty soul tells you my meaning plainly enough , " exclaimed Maudsley , yielding at last to his long suppressed rage . " Know then that I have not in vain concealed my existence from you ; know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perplexed months of my absence . I have unravelled the whole web of your villany , and have returned to brand and chastise you , as you deserve . " " The boy raves , " said Gardiner , with a hollow laugh . " Aye , blaspheme not , struggle not , deny thyself not , " continued Maudsley . As surely as thou knowest me to be Henry Maudsley , so surely do I know thee to be Sir Fulk de Gorges , expelled and branded brother of the knights Hospitaller of St. John of Malta , husband of Lady Clara Hoveden , husband of Edith Maudsley , and murderer of her father and herself . Are you answered now ? " The knight 's dark eye seemed to emit sparks of fire as he glared at Maudsley , but he was still silent . " Aye , aye , " cried the shrill voice of Cakebread , " and know , moreover , that all your papers are at this moment in the hands of the magistrates . A divine hand hath directed my humble researches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasures of Shawmut . The officers have paid a visit , under my guidance , to your hermitage upon the bay . They have secured the person of the fair Magdalen Groves , commonly called your cousin , Master Jaspar , and have burned your house to the ground . All your plotting with the savages , particularly your foul connection with the great conspiracy revealed this summer by Sagamore John , and of which you are now known to be the instigator , all , all is discovered . Aha , aha , Sir Knight ! whose back will catch the bastinado now ? tell me that , tell me that . " The malicious creature , who at that moment looked like a very imp of hell , uttered a mocking laugh as he concluded , which , more than all which had been said , seemed to madden the knight 's brain to frenzy , and to endow him with a giant 's strength . His game was up , his plots baffled , his person revealed , his crimes divulged , the avenger panting for his prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great muscular agility , he threw off his three captors by a sudden and dexterous movement , discharged a pistol unsuccessfully at Maudsley , stretched the grinning Cakebread , desperately wounded , at his feet , with the other , and then , with the suppleness of a tiger , threw himself with one prodigious bound over the precipitous rock upon which they stood , and plunged into the almost impenetrable thickets below . By this movement , sudden , bewildering , apparently impossible , and which had hardly occupied a second , Maudsley , to his astonishment and rage , beheld the felon , whom he had toiled so long to convict and to apprehend , again escape him . Half a dozen shots were fired in quick succession ; but evidently in vain , and then the whole party , excepting Maudsley , dashed off in hot pursuit . However ardently he desired the capture of the knight , a legion of demons at that moment could not have moved him from the rock . The beautiful Esther , who had remained as it were in a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despairingly over her . Their eyes met . " Dearest , dearest Mandsley , my preserver , my saviour ! " she murmured , extending her arms gently towards him . Maudsley could not speak , but their lips clung to each other in a first and long embrace . There sat the lovers , upon that rock in the wilderness , and for an instant they forgot every thing but their deep love , and their boundless joy at this meeting . It was with a joyful although superstitious feeling , that Maudsley suddenly threw the fated chain around Esther 's neck , which he had taken from the ground , where it had fallen during her last struggle with Gardiner near the palisade . He reminded her that he had sworn to return from the uttermost parts of the earth , should that talisman inform him that danger threatened her , and he now urged her to accept it as a pledge that their hearts were no longer entangled in mysteries , but at last were united . They could have remained for hours together upon that lonely spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments ' duration . Half the party , who had been in pursuit of Gardiner , returned breathless and unsuccessful . It had been agreed that the others should continue the search all night . The adventurer , however , possessed such an intimate knowledge of the country in that neighborhood , beside being upon such intimate terms with many of the wandering savages , that it seemed probable the pursuit would be a protracted one , although Maudsley convinced Esther that his eventual apprehension must be certain . He bitterly regretted his want of adroitness in thus allowing the object , for which he had spent so many weary months of labor , to slip from his grasp , when he had already clutched it ; but he swore to rest neither day nor night , till the malefactor was apprehended and brought to justice . In the mean time , those of the party who had returned to Merry-Mount , prepared to execute that part of the order of the court in relation to Thomas Morton , which had hitherto remained unfulfilled . The magistrates , as will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be set in the stocks , that he should be afterwards imprisoned until sent to England , that his property should be confiscated , and his house be burned to the ground , " in order that the habitation of the wicked should no more be seen in Israel . " Morton was now in prison , hourly awaiting his transportation to England , and every other part of the sentence had been executed , excepting the ordained destruction of the Merry-Mount palace . This had , for a variety of reasons , been deferred , and the party who were that day charged , by the magistrates , with the apprehension of Gardiner , had likewise received orders to proceed afterwards to Morton 's domain , and to destroy his house . They had already burned Gardiner 's house to the ground , after having searched there unsuccessfully for its tenant , before proceeding to Merry-Mount . As has already been intimated , they had there captured the unfortunate Jaspar , and had , moreover , taken possession of a large collection of papers , including , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Ferdinando Gorges , in which their various intrigues and machinations were set forth , even to the minutest details . The party had then proceeded to Merry-Mount , where their adventures with Sir Christopher have been already narrated . By Maudsley 's orders , they now proceeded to set fire to the palace , as well as to all the log huts and hovels which were scattered about Morton 's domain . The buildings had previously been ransacked , by order of the magistrates , and every thing of importance removed . After the flames had fairly enveloped all the buildings , Maudsley carefully conveyed Esther to the pinnace , which was moored near the shore , and accompanied by the men-at-arms , embarked for the village of Boston . A gentle breeze was blowing , and the little vessel danced swiftly along the waves . Esther and Maudsley sat gazing at the burning palace , which , built of light and inflammable materials , was already a sheet of fire , and presented the appearance of an extensive conflagration . The twilight was already approaching , the air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitfully athwart the lowering heavens , and were reflected with sullen radiance from the darkening waves . Suddenly , as they turned for a moment in another direction , they saw the large hull of an outward bound ship , which was passing very near them . A solitary person , his figure darkly painted against the twilight , stood upon the quarter-deck , and seemed to be gazing sadly and earnestly at the distant flames . The vessel was the ship Whale , just starting upon her wintry voyage to England  --  the solitary spectator of the conflagration was the captive Lord of Merry-Mount . CHAPTER XVIII . THE HERMIT IN THE ASSEMBLY . The magistrates were assembled , next day , in the rude town-hall . William Blaxton , the hermit of Shawmut , had crossed the craggy eminence which rose between his still sequestered retreat and the lowly village of Boston , in order to hold an interview , at their request , with the government of the colony . His connection with the Gorges patent had ever been rather nominal and accidental than real , and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures which had been taken in regard to Morton , Walford , Gardiner in New England , and Oldham at home , he had dismissed from his thoughts the subject concerning which he had been used occasionally to hear discussions from the mouths of Gardiner and Morton . He had certainly never much interested himself in the merits of the rival claimants to the dominion of Massachusetts . He considered himself as a pilgrim in a wilderness , a hermit in a desert , and he had a whimsical but profound contempt for every species of human authority . He had allowed himself to be whirled by an eddy entirely aside from the rushing current of human affairs , and he had long since devoted his existence to solitude and nature . Had he foreseen that the band of emigrants who , in small companies and at different intervals , had been arriving during the last two or three years , were so soon to lay the foundation of a permanent empire , and so soon to scare the spirit of sylvan solitude from the lovely peninsula where he had established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted some means of counteracting their plans by any fair and amicable arrangement that was possible . He considered himself the sole proprietor of Shawmut , or , as it was now called , Boston , by right of occupation . He was the first Englishman who had ever slept upon the peninsula , and he had dwelt there in undisturbed dominion during five or six years . His gentle nature , however , having been touched by the sufferings of the colonists at Charlestown , he had voluntarily gone over to the governor and expressly invited them to his peninsula , assuring them of the sufficiency at least of fair water-springs , which were so much wanting at Mishawum . Although the governor of the colony considered that the dominion and property of the soil of Shawmut belonged unquestionably to themselves , yet the just and magnanimous mind of Winthrop could not brook the thought of any injustice towards the hermit , although the question of summarily ousting him from his adverse possession was fiercely contended for by the more intolerant of the brethren . The town had been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be apportioned ; but it was determined by the governor that an ample portion of the territory should be assigned to Blaxton , which , in a worldly point of view , now that a permanent settlement had been made , would be of more value than the whole peninsula , had it remained a wilderness . It was not probable , however , that considerations like these would have any great weight with the whimsical hermit . He already feared that his dearly loved solitude was lost to him forever , should he remain at Shawmut ; but he shrank at present from the thought of relinquishing a spot where he had dwelt so long . It was for the purpose of conferring with the magistrates upon matters of this kind , that he had made his appearance in the town-hall that morning . The conference had been long and desultory , for the character of Blaxton was singularly uncongenial to that of the majority of the magistrates , and they had found not a little difficulty in understanding each other . " It is therefore understood , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sympathy , " it is understood that fifty acres be set apart for your own use , Master Blaxton , including the tract more particularly occupied by your domicile . " " Acres , acres , " muttered Blaxton , dreamily , " the thought of admeasurements , and fences , and allotments , confoundeth me . I had forgotten that men carved up and subdivided in petty portions the green and beautiful earth . I have sojourned so long in the boundless wilderness , where my territory was wide as the continent as unfettered as my thoughts , that I am become a child , and can hardly understand the ways of men . " " But we mean nothing but brotherly dealing , " said Winthrop , " fair dealing and strict justice . " " I never dreamed , " said Blaxton , in a pathetic tone , " that my boundless territory would be contracted . I looked to have dwelt with my orchards , and my books , and my young fawn , and my bull , in undisturbed and harmless solitude . This new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was there not room enough for ye all ? Could ye not leave the hermit in his corner ? " " Your fifty acre lot , " said Winthrop , practically but kindly , " will soon be of more account and value than twenty wilderness promontories like this  --  " " What tell ye me of value ? " interrupted the hermit , pettishly . " I tell ye I am like a child in affairs of this world . I have dwelt so long in the wilderness , that the voices of many men sound strangely to me . I love my kind I believe , and would serve them if I could , but look you , I can not live with them . My soul lacks air , and can not brook confinement . I am a peaceable man , and have never injured living thing , and yet my spirit rebels at all law , and can not bear the dictates of any power but those of the Most High . " " Laws , my reverend friend , " remonstrated Winthrop , " are surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lambs , lions and kids , dwell together , and yet the fiercer animals not be restrained ? " " I can not abide with ye , I fear , " said Blaxton , following , as was his wont , his own train of thought , and heeding little the words which were addressed to him ; " I can not obey the laws of man 's making . ' T is for this I left my fathers ' graves , and buried myself in the desert . I am not of your religion neither . " " We shall soon bring thee round , " interrupted Dudley , peremptorily ; " we will have no spies in the company , no recusants , no blasphemers of our church . We have not come hither to find surplices and copes in the wilderness , nor to hear the massbook chanted in the forest . " " Gently , brother Dudley , " interposed Winthrop , " our reverend , learned , and contemplative friend hath acted towards us in a most friendly and Christian spirit ; let us have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law-makers and tyrants by nature , " continued the hermit , " even as tigers are carnivorous . When the lion dandleth the kid , shall I hope to repose calmly in the lap of civil authority . No , my masters , " said he , facing the magistrates in an attitude of simple dignity , and slightly elevating his voice , " no , my masters , I came from England because I could not obey the Lord bishops ; but I fear I can not dwell with you , for I can never obey the Lord brethren . " Dudley frowned as the eccentric solitary made this last observation , and was upon the point of uttering some harsh rejoinder , when the door opened , and the sergeant announced that the prisoner , whose presence their worships had desired , was now in attendance . " Let her be brought before the court , " said Winthrop ; and a female was accordingly introduced , wearing a thick veil , and wrapped in a dark mantle , which quite concealed her form . Thus attired , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mean time a number of colonists , directed thither partly by curiosity , partly by other motives , had found their way into the hall . Among the rest were Maudsley and the Ludlows , who gazed upon the proceedings with great earnestness . " The prisoner will declare her name , " said the imperious voice of Dudley . An indistinct murmur was heard , which failed to reach the ears of the magistrates . " The prisoner will remove her veil , " said Dudley . The order was complied with , and the woman throwing aside her veil , revealed a face of extraordinary loveliness . It was a strange , almost a patriarchal scene . That rude apartment thronged with its earnest , darkly-habited spectators , the stern , but expressive heads of the magistrates , and in the midst of all , and gazed upon with breathless curiosity by all , the shrinking figure of that young , beautiful , desolate woman . Blaxton , who had been upon the point of retiring , as soon as his conference with the magistrates was concluded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . As the prisoner lifted up her veil , his wandering eyes happened to be turned in that direction . As her countenance met his view he was observed to turn pale as ashes . Incapable for the moment of speech or motion , he stood for a brief interval transfixed and horror-struck , as if a thunderbolt had suddenly descended from heaven . At last he aroused himself , and feeling that a solution of many mysteries which had perplexed him , was near at hand , be glided close to the prisoner , and gazed long and wistfully upon her . " Art thou not Magdalen Groves , of Boirdly ? " said he at last . " I am , " said the woman , gently but firmly , answering the gaze of Blaxton with an earnest and imploring look . " They told me thou wert dead , " said the solitary . " Thou wert deceived , basely , treacherously deceived , " answered Magdalen , in a low and trembling voice . " And hadst thou part and lot in the deceit ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman sighed heavily , but was silent . " I am answered , " said the hermit , " the mystery is solved . And so without saying a single word further , he took his staff and went forth to his hermitage again . The examination of the prisoner now proceeded . A variety of interrogatories were addressed to her , but her answers were brief and unsatisfactory . She knew nothing , she said , of the present retreat of Gardiner , and trembled violently at every question concerning him or his plans . All that could be elicited from her in answer to their various queries , was , that she believed the knight to be a Catholic , and that she had understood him to be descended from the family of Stephen Gardiner , the celebrated Bishop of Winchester . Touching Sir Ferdinando Gorges , she knew nothing , and she had nothing to communicate concerning the intrigues of Thomas Morton , with whom she acknowledged some slight acquaintance . The possession of the papers which had been so recently delivered to the magistrates , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw so much light upon the whole history of the Gorges plot , that it seemed to them unnecessary to pursue the examination of the prisoner further . Her conduct was so close and impenetrable , and she really seemed to know so little concerning the designs and the whereabouts of the knight , that it seemed necessary to defer all further hope of entirely unravelling the business , until the apprehension of Sir Christopher Gardiner , as we must continue to call him , who was not yet taken , and who was supposed to have fled to the savages . " The prisoner may be removed , " said the governor . " Let her be kept in prison , and watched strictly , " said Dudley , " till her paramour be taken . Remove her at once , Sergeant Underwood . " " Perhaps , " said the governor , wishing to deal in more gentle fashion with the prisoner , " there may be some virtuous and well-disposed Christian matron who may be willing to take upon herself the custody and the care of the prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her presence . " There were a number of females present , among whom were observed the two respectable matrons who had not long previously been exhibited with their heads in a cage . All , however , more especially that worthy pair , tossed their chins in the air , and manifested a superfluous quantity of indignation at the contamination thus suggested . The sergeant was approaching to lead the unfortunate prisoner away , when Esther advancing from the corner where she had been watching the whole proceeding with tearful eyes , said modestly to the governor ,  --  " If the magistrates permit , I will readily offer the shelter of my roof to our unfortunate sister . My brother and myself will deal kindly with her , and will be responsible for her appearance when the court desire it . " Magdalen Groves , who had stood like a statue of ice during the latter part of this scene , chilled to the heart by the freezing looks which met her upon every side , at hearing these few words of womanly and Christian sympathy , trembled violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not Esther received her in her arms . For a few moments the unfortunate and deserted woman seemed overcome by silent but convulsive emotions . After a time , however , she recovered her composure by a strong and energetic effort , and then , supported by Esther , she silently withdrew from the hall . CHAPTER XIX . AN ADVENTURER 'S FORTUNES . Sir Ferdinando Gorges was the head of an ancient family , which deduced its origin , in unbroken masculine descent , from Fulques de Gorges , a Norman Knight , who came into England under the banner of William the Conqueror . A younger branch of the house , swerving from its allegiance to the red rose of Lancaster , had been ennobled in the reign of Edward IV . More than a century afterwards , an intermarriage had taken place between the two principal branches of the family . Lord Gorges of Ashford , the representative of the barony , and Sir Ferdinando Gorges , the acknowledged head of the family , were cousins . Both were rich , and both were devoted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been married ; Lord Gorges of Ashford had espoused , early in life , a daughter of Hugh Gardiner , of Clopton , a Somersetshire gentleman , who was descended from a brother of the celebrated Stephen Gardiner , the supple and subtle Bishop of Winchester , in the reign of Henry VIII. , and of his successors . From this marriage there had sprung several children . The youngest , the honorable Fulk de Gorges , had been a wayward and unmanageable creature almost from his birth . Rebellious and yet subtle , scheming , incomprehensible , perverse , licentious , deceitful , he had been , during his wild boyhood , a constant source of anxiety and sorrow to his parents . At the age of seventeen , he had quitted his paternal mansion in a fit of ungovernable anger , and had passed a few wandering months upon the continent . By means of his father 's powerful influence , he was at the expiration of this time admitted , at his own ardent desire , as a page in the order of the Knights of St. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other monastic institutions , had been deprived and abolished in England , under Henry VIII. , yet Englishmen of rank were still admitted into the fraternity , and the young de Gorges , finding no difficulty in proving the necessary four generations of nobility , was entered in the commandery of Toulon , of course in the language of England . His bravery , his remarkable talents , his great skill in the profession of arms , whether exercised upon sea or shore , soon won him an exalted place among the Hospitallers . The impetuosity of his temper , the mischievous restlessness of his brain , and the licentiousness of his manners , remarkable even in an order already signalized in its decay by extraordinary depravity , had , however , acquired for him almost as much distinction among his brethren , as had his nobler qualities . In many a bloody fight with the pirates of Dalmatia , the mercenaries of Austria , or the squadrons of the Sultan , he had led the war galleys of his order to victory . Disappointed , however , in his election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had skilfully and almost successfully intrigued , he had abandoned himself to an uncontrollable rage ; had torn the cross from his shoulder , trampled it under his feet , insulted his brethren , and made his escape by a stroke of unparalleled and fortunate audacity , before the punishment for his unpardonable conduct could be inflicted upon him . After this epoch he appears to have dwelt for a long time in Venice . It is , however , quite impossible , and would be , perhaps , irrelevant to attempt even a hurried sketch of his adventurous life . His memoirs , could they have been given to the world , would have formed a checkered , mysterious , and romantic piece of biography . For the sake of indicating only the manner in which his fortunes had been connected with those of several personages who have figured in our pages , we will but briefly glance at a few points in his career . He had dwelt long in Venice . As already hinted at in some of the earlier chapters of this work , he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic , and real plot against Naples , in which the Duke d'Ossuna had reposed implicit confidence in the crafty Englishman alone . As a barefooted monk , moving unsuspected from city to city , he had passed to and fro between Naples and Venice , and his identity with the brilliant and gallant Cavaliere di San Giorgio , by which name he had been known as a celebrated commander of picked condottieri in the service of the republic , had never been suspected . Although the conspiracy had proved unsuccessful , the chevalier had found no reason to regret his connection with the Duke d'Ossuna , who was munificent in his gratitude , and who remained always his most useful and powerful friend . He had subsequently to these events , while employed upon a secret and confidential mission from the republic to the court of Rome , become acquainted with an English family of rank then residing in Italy . Lady Clara Hoveden fell desperately in love with the accomplished Cavaliere di San Giorgio , who accordingly bestowed upon her his monkish hand in marriage . Perhaps he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently did not consider it worth his while ; for , after a few brilliant years , during which his wife inherited a peerage in her own right which added a lustre to their position , and a princely fortune , which he demolished in princely fashion , he one fine day decamped , nobody knew whither , leaving only a few debts , and a letter for Lady Clara . In this epistle , remarkable for its eloquent brevity , he informed his cara sposa , that the vows taken at his entrance into the Hospital of St. John rendered their mutual vows at the altar of comparatively little value . It was no act of generosity upon his part to absolve her from her obligations , because , in reality , they had never existed . At this epoch , he disappeared in a cloud to rise again in the east , and although nothing was absolutely known about him , it seems certain that he had for several years worn the turban , and acquired much celebrity in the armies of the grand Seignior . His oriental residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polygamy , and accordingly , after various adventures of flood , field , and bower , which befel him during his six or seven years ' residence in the east , we find him in the year 1623 leading a second English bride to the altar . This occurred in Paris , where he had made his appearance as Sir Fulk de Gorges , as suddenly as if he had been thrown there out of a volcano . Nobody knew whence he came . Many disputed his identity and denied his claim to the name he bore , although such freethinkers were singularly cautious in expressing their skepticism to his face . His father , who had not heard of him for nearly fifteen years , had lately died , having first taken the precaution to disinherit him of his younger brother 's portion . His striking appearance , romantic history , mysterious character , and brilliant qualities , made a vivid impression upon the young and impressionable mind of Edith Maudsley , whom he met at the court of Versailles . Her father , the representative of an ancient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Maudsley and herself . His consent was reluctantly gained to the marriage of his daughter with the singular adventurer who had fascinated her ; and had not her brother been , during this period , serving in the Low Countries and in Germany , it was probable that the marriage , notwithstanding the satisfactory evidences of his rank which Sir Fulk was enabled to adduce , would have been violently set aside . Henry Maudsley , however , was unfortunately in little communication with his family or with any one at that time . It happened to be exactly the epoch of his first and unsuccessful love for Esther Ludlow , and at that time , engrossed by his own emotions , he was fiercely courting a soldier 's grave in a foreign land . To hurry briefly to the conclusion of this rapid sketch of the knight 's biography , the newly married couple passed a year very happily together , partly upon the continent , and partly at Maudsley Court and in London . During an occasional tour by himself in the land of his nativity , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of an English clergyman , whom he had once known in Italy . The father , who had been chaplain to a British embassy , had resided many years in Tuscany , and his daughter , naturally of a romantic turn , educated in a romantic land , was both by temperament and circumstances exactly the person to be fascinated by the graces of the all-accomplished chevalier , with whom an acquaintance , began in her childhood , upon the banks of the yellow Arno , was suddenly and unexpectedly renewed in the solitude of Shropshire . She was at the time acquainted with a worthy but eccentric young man , a graduate of Cambridge , who had recently taken orders in the church . Her father had been desirous that she should have been united with him , although the young man , who was no other than William Blaxton , afterwards the eccentric hermit of Shawmut , does not appear to have been much more violently inclined to the match than was the fair Magdalen herself . They were however acquainted , and but for this accidental visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , the tenor of the lives of both might have been far different . This incident happened to occur but a few weeks previously to a great domestic catastrophe at Maudsley Court . It so chanced , that a certain Lady Hoveden ( sometimes called di San Georgio ) , one day made a pilgrimage to that retired manor house . Although her Alpheus , reversing the ancient fable , had sunk , as he thought , to the bottom of the Mediterranean , to escape his Arethusa , he had been traced through all his doublings , and the deserted and insulted peeress , after years of baffled pursuit , had almost come up with the traitor at last . The consequences of an interview between Lady de Gorges first and second , may be imagined . The gentle Edith Maudsley , learning that she had not only been married to a monk , but that the monk had already another wife , was wholly unable to survive the blow . The fearful intelligence was like fire to her brain , and she died in a delirious fever within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , went forth to seek his daughter 's destroyer , who , as already stated , was then absent . A fearful mystery , and one that was never fathomed , hung over the old man 's fate . All which was known , was , that he had been last seen in the presence of Sir Fulk de Gorges . Nothing more was known , nothing more could ever be proved ; but the old man , living or dead , was never seen again . When Henry Maudsley returned to his father 's house , he found it desolate . His sister was laid in a dishonored grave , and his father had perished by an unknown fate . He had searched long , and in vain , for the miscreant whose fearful crimes had entailed so much misery upon a happy fireside , so much disgrace upon an ancient house . Sir Fulk 's person was unknown to him , although he had a vague impression of having seen him , when he himself was but a child . It was , therefore , rather the awakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , as we have seen , occasioned him to doubt and suspect the unknown adventurer when he first met him in New England . Maudsley , however , sought for the fugitive in vain . Sir Fulk , fortunately for himself , had been , as we have before stated , absent from home at the memorable interview between his two wives ; and after a frantic and prolonged search in England and on the continent , Henry Maudsley had been obliged for a season to desist from the pursuit . In the mean time Sir Fulk , assuming the name of his maternal family , had appeared in Madrid as Sir Christopher Gardiner . His friend , the Duke d'Ossuna , who , better than any one else , was aware of the frequency with which he assumed a variety of characters , and the ability with which he supported them , was not at all surprised or unwilling to recognise , in the English Chevalier Gardiner , his old and trusty acquaintance , the Cavaliere di San Giorgio , and proved as well disposed towards his former confidant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Madrid , that the chevalier was attended by a young and very handsome page , who appeared exceedingly attached to his master , and desirous of avoiding the acquaintance of others . Magdalen Groves had , in fact , fallen an easy victim to the inconstant and capricious knight , who , at the very moment when the two noble dames , whom he had led to the altar , were disputing the priority of their claims to his hand , found it excessively amusing to carry off this romantic damsel , in the very face of the furious pursuit which he knew would be opened upon him . Deceived by a false marriage ceremony , the unfortunate girl had willingly followed the fortunes of the mysterious object of her idolatry . Unlike the two other dames , to whom his troth had been plighted , Magdalen , upon being frankly informed , upon their arrival at Madrid , of the true position of matters , asked but a single question . She was born to be the slave of passion , and all she worshipped in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have looked upon wedlock 's symbols with greater indifference , than she did both upon symbols and reality . She felt no resentment for the treachery which had been practised upon her , because she still allowed herself to be persuaded that love , imperishable love , the golden treasure for which she was willing to sacrifice her all on earth , and all her hopes of heaven , had been the cause of all , and that it still remained unchanged , unchangeable . To her the whole world was henceforth nothing , and she would rather have lived the slave of that unworthy knight , than the wife of an emperor . Without a murmur , therefore , at the intolerable deceit to which she had been a victim , and which she was now called upon to practise with regard to others , she allowed a fictitious and circumstantial account of her death to be reported in her native village . The tale , supported by forged testimonials , was made to appear so credible , that her few relatives and friends were entirely deceived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doom , was erected in the obscure church-yard at Boirdly , and many a prayer for the repose of Magdalen Groves was uttered by sincere but deluded lips . The other adventures of Sir Fulk de Gorges , or , as we prefer still to designate him , Sir Christopher Gardiner , we pass over in silence . We would simply observe that , some two years after his flight from England , his first interview with Sir Ferdinando Gorges occurred in Madrid , and that after a certain time spent in studying the old knight 's character , and in discussing his New England schemes , Sir Christopher decided upon revealing himself to his kinsman , after first exacting from him a pledge of secrecy . Sir Ferdinando found that he had , at last , discovered exactly the man for his purpose . Sir Christopher found an inexpressible charm in these projects of enterprise , in a new and untried field . His adventurous temperament and intriguing disposition , were all excited by the vigorous conceptions of his kinsman . It was an age of romance and adventure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chivalry , their projects were to be carried out in the fabulous El Dorado of the West . Bent upon rivaling Cortes and Pizarro , Sir Walter Raleigh , and John Smith himself , Sir Christopher engaged enthusiastically in the projects of Sir Ferdinando . It was , moreover , especially convenient for him to absent himself , for a term of years , from Europe . He had exhausted the golden Orient already , the West was full of new and enticing adventure . After considerable delays , the necessary arrangements were made , and Sir Christopher , accompanied by his page and a few servants , among whom was Skettwarroes the Indian , who had been captured in America , sold as a slave in Spain , and rescued by Sir Ferdinando , made his first appearance in the Massachusetts . The rest of his adventures the reader knows . How all his plans were baffled , how his gorgeous visions faded before the obscure and repulsive reality , how the enthusiast of worldly pomp and power , saw with bitterness the foundations of an empire laid before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort , while his own energies were doomed to rust in the most harassing inactivity , all this has sufficiently appeared . If this early chapter of New England annals has any meaning in it , it certainly illustrates the peculiar character of the Massachusetts settlement . Colonies of every other variety had been sent to that inhospitable region , but not an impression had been made upon its iron bosom . It was reserved for exalted , unflinching , self-sacrificing , iron-handed , despotic , stern , truculent , bigoted , religious enthusiasts , men who were inspired by one idea , but that a great idea , and who were willing to go through fire and water , and to hew down with axes all material , animal , or human obstacles , in the path which led to the development of their idea ; it was reserved for such men to accomplish what neither trading companies , nor fishing companies , nor land companies , nor schemers of satrapsies , nor dreamers of palatinates , were able to effect . It was a great movement , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a religious , perhaps a fanatical movement , but the movers were in earnest , and the result was an empire . The iron character of these early founders left an impression upon their wilderness-world , which has not yet been effaced ; and the character of their institutions , containing much that is admirable , mingled with many objectionable features , has diffused an influence , upon the whole , healthy and conservative , throughout the length and breadth of the continent . We have witnessed , moreover , the singular manner in which the fortunes of Gardiner became entangled with that of the other leading characters who have figured in these pages , and the striking fatality by which he was so suddenly brought face to face , in that lonely desert , with the avenger of his crimes . Hardly less singular was the re-appearance , to the eyes of the dreaming Blaxton , of one whom he had known in her innocent youth , who , he thought , had long been consigned to the tomb , and for the repose of whose soul he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder that the vision had at first appalled him , and that he had found it difficult , for a long time , to shake off the impression that he had been in communion with a visitant from the spiritual world . As for Henry Maudsley , at the moment when he left the shores of New England , believing that the mysterious knight had found the means of ingrtiating himself in the affections both of Walter Ludlow and his sister , he had received but a clue only to the character of the adventurer , by the papers brought to him by Cakebread . It was impossible for him to resist the sacred voice which seemed to cry out to him from the tomb , to lose no time , and to omit no possible step which might lead to the unravelling of these dark mysteries . Convinced , however , as we have seen , that the heart of Esther was irrevocably lost to him , he had not trusted himself to see her before his departure ; and moreover , even if a full and free understanding had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have felt under a no less imperious necessity to hasten across the sea , without delay , to commence at once an investigation into matters of such deep import . We have seen how the very first letter from him which reached the Ludlows , opened the way for a full and candid explanation of all causes of difference between himself and Esther . Thereafter , the interchange of letters was as frequent as in those days was possible between the old world and the wilderness ; but Maudsley , in the prosecution of his inquiries , was obliged to consume more time , and to traverse a greater space than he had at first anticipated . When he at last made his appearance again at so opportune a moment , in New England , he had fortified himself with the necessary proofs and documents to warrant the apprehension of Gardiner , and his transportation to England for trial . His chagrin at the evasion of the knight at a moment when he was himself so busily occupied in sustaining his long-lost Esther , may be easily imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day upon which the examination of Magdalen Groves before the magistrates had taken place , was gloomy and threatening . No snow had yet fallen since the commencement of the winter , but there were now indications of a storm . The unfortunate and deserted woman accompanied Esther , with whom as well as with Maudsley , it will be recollected , she had had previous but mysterious interviews , to her own residence . Her mind seemed , however , in an apathetic condition , as if the severity of the blows , which had been inflicted upon her , had left her almost insensible . Her replies to the kind words spoken to her by Esther , Walter Ludlow , and Maudsley were brief and unsatisfactory . She appeared humble and grateful , but incommunicative and preoccupied . In answer to various suggestions , she constantly repeated that she would seek out her cousin , as she continued to call Sir Christopher Gardiner . It was naturally difficult for persons , so differently situated with regard to that adventurer , to hold any very satisfactory communion together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened as to his true character and his perfidy . Of his former adventures and crimes she had some knowledge , but they had made no impression upon her . She had , however , more than suspected the nature of his feelings towards Esther , and had been nearly driven to madness in consequence ; but the knight , with his usual crafty eloquence , had been enabled at last to lull her jealousy to sleep , and during their absence from Massachusetts , there had , of course , been nothing to awaken it again . Maudsley , however , convinced that it was for the eventual repose of the deceived and deserted woman to be enlightened at last upon these topics , now , as briefly and tenderly as he could , gave her the true history of the previous day 's adventure at Merry-Mount , of which she had been in profound ignorance , and informed her , moreover , of the proposal which Gardiner had made to him in a whisper , at their memorable meeting upon the beach at Shawmut . The unfortunate woman received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poniard which thus struck her to the heart was so keen , that it destroyed her without inflicting a positive pang . She made no reply . Her eye seemed hot and tearless ; she trembled slightly , but uttered not a syllable of complaint or reproach . The slave of love , she who had sacrificed all for love , who had pardoned treachery , coldness , cruelty , while she still believed herself the object of love , now saw herself , beyond all possibility of doubt , both despised and hated . At her urgent entreaty , she was left to herself , for a little while . The night had already set in . The wind howled dismally through the leafless groves which surrounded the Ludlows ' cottage . The indications of the afternoon had not been deceptive , and a driving , blinding , snow-storm combined with the raging wind and the benumbing cold , to make a fearful night . It seemed impossible that any living soul would willingly brave the terrors of such a tempest . At about ten o'clock Esther looked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same attitude in which she had been left . As she , however , manifested considerable repugnance to any communication at present , and seemed still in a stunned and almost a lethargic state , Esther thought that it was useless to force upon her common-place consolation which was thus decidedly rejected . Earnestly imploring her , however , to address herself to God for support and consolation , and gently advising her to seek repose , if not sleep , as soon as possible , she withdrew for the night . About an hour afterwards , Magdalen , who had still remained motionless , in her solitary position near the hearth , where huge burning logs threw a fitful glare about the rude apartment , suddenly started to her feet , as if the whole truth had suddenly , and for the first time , glared upon her , with a horrible and unquenchable light . " I will seek the traitor , " said she to herself , in a low , hoarse voice . Without another word , and with noiseless steps , she went from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glided forth , like a ghost , into the midnight storm . The snow , whirling thick and fast before the hurricane , had already , like a white deluge , changed the face of the wilderness . She moved on without a sensation of fear , for she found something congenial in that opaque and boundless gloom , while the wintry cold and the driving snow felt grateful to her burning brain . For many minutes she moved along , abandoning herself as it were to the fierce delight of mingling with an elemental tempest , as wild and desolate as that which was sweeping her soul . At last the excitement of her brain gradually began to yield before the benumbing effects of the cold , and the difficulty of making her way through the heavy drifts and the constantly increasing storm . How long and how far she had wandered , she knew not ; but at last the fury of her emotions seemed to have abated , a delicious calm came over her , she sank upon the ground , breathed a prayer of forgiveness for herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The driving hurricane wrapped her as she slept in an icy winding sheet , and the wintry wind sounded her requiem in the tossing pine branches . CHAPTER XXI . CONCLUSION . Within the territory of the Plymouth colony , upon the banks of the Namaskett River , six figures lay closely concealed in a thicket of alders . Two of the individuals thus lying in ambush were officers in the service of the Massachusetts company , Captain Underhill and Lieutenant Dudley ; the other four were savages . The six composed a hunting party , which , after months of unremitting search , had at last come up for the first time with their game . The game was Sir Christopher Gardiner , and after having been often baffled , they were at last upon his track . Immediately upon his disappearance , as related in some of the preceding pages , the government of Massachusetts had sent in pursuit of him . He had , however , escaped their vigilance , and , assisted by the Indians of his neighborhood , with whom he had maintained friendly relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia . The winter had , however , proved so inclement that he had been obliged to defer his expedition thither , till the opening of the spring , and in the mean time , to lead a wandering life among the savages . Information had , however , been brought to Governor Bradford of Plymouth , by some of the Indians inhabiting that colony , of the place where the knight kept himself concealed . Communications upon the subject of the fugitive , and upon the importance of securing his person , having previously been exchanged between Bradford and the Massachusetts governor , orders were given by the magistrates of Plymouth for his immediate arrest , and a considerable reward promised to his captors . Many of the Plymouth Indians , desirous of earning the proffered bounty , were very willing to undertake the adventure , provided the price were set upon his scalp . Such was the knight 's reputation for desperate courage and skill , that the attempt to secure his person alive , as was proposed by the magistrates , was considered a very hazardous undertaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were absolutely forbidden by the government both of Massachusetts and Plymouth to take his life , the chase became more hazardous and less attractive . Had the price been set upon his head , it was probable that it would very soon have been brought before the tribunal . As his living person was required , it became at last very doubtful whether he would be secured , and it was even supposed by many that he had already effected his escape to Virginia . Upon a bright morning in the latter part of April , the party already mentioned lay concealed in the still leafless thickets which bordered the Namaskett River . Intelligence had been brought to them by a treacherous Indian , in whom Gardiner had been obliged to repose confidence , that he was that morning to descend the river in a canoe . The party lay with their ears close to the ground , listening and watching like blood-hounds for the faintest symptoms of his approach . At last , from a considerable distance above them , the light drip of an oar fell upon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived them . The Englishmen had their rapiers and fire-arms , as usual , but the savages were provided only with long poles , to which strong hooks were attached . As the necessity of taking their game alive had been so strongly impressed upon the party , the Indians had been deprived of their customary weapons of war , lest their forbearance should be too heavily taxed . After a few breathless moments of delay , the canoe came slowly floating down the stream . It was Sir Christopher Gardiner indeed who sat within that frail , birchen bark , but how changed in appearance from the brilliant Sir Fulk de Gorges . His dress was squalid , his features , emaciated by fasting , vigils and exposure , were almost overgrown by his coal-black beard ; while the fierce light which shone from his sunken and cavernous eyes , seemed an unholy and sepulchral flame . He appeared , however , calm and self-possessed , and his head , at the slightest rustle in the bushes , turned with its quick , snake-like movement , seeming almost to anticipate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe floated past the lurking place of the party , than , at a nod from Captain Underhill , two of the savages plunged into the stream , and swam boldly towards the knight . Although the movement had been as stealthy and as noiseless as possible , Gardiner confronted them in an instant with his match lock at his cheek . The Indians hesitated a moment , and then one of them advanced . In another instant , there was a flash , a report , a yell , and the blood of the foremost savage dyed the placid waters of the river . The other Indian dived below the surface , and regained the shore . The knight profited by the interval to re-load his piece . In the mean time , however , the two other Indians , running along in advance of the canoe , which was slowly floating down the sluggish river , had in their turn leaped into the water , and were now close upon the enemy ; while at the same time the savage who had at first retreated , finding himself supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the three , armed with their long-hooked poles , now surrounded the canoe . At this moment Captain Underhill emerged from the thicket , and , standing upon the edge of the river , called upon Sir Christopher Gardiner to yield to the authority of the Massachusetts company . To this the knight replied by a bullet , which struck a birch tree , within a few inches of the captain 's head . The tiger stood at bay at last , and it was evident that he meant to sell his life as dearly as possible . The odds were now five to one , and two of the five were well-armed Englishmen . Had the party not been hampered by their instructions to secure their fugitive with as little injury to his person as possible , the combat would have been of very short duration . As it was , before Gardiner had time to reload his matchlock , the three sayages had adroitly succeeded in overturning his boat . The knight fell into the stream , and unfortunately his gun and his rapier , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged with his fire-arm , both sank in the water . He had now no weapon but his dagger , with which he desperately defended himself , at the same time that he made an effort to swim to the opposite shore . The boldest and most active of the savages , however , strove to intercept him , but Gardiner , closing with him in the middle of the river , dealt him such a wound that he sank below the surface with a terrific howl , and was afterwards observed crawling , more dead than alive , upon the sandy margin of the stream . Meanwhile , however , the other Indians had been furiously belaboring the knight with their long heavy poles , with which they inflicted many severe and benumbing contusions , and both at last succeeded in fixing their hooks in different parts of his dress . At the same moment Captain Underhill and Lieutenant Dudley plunged into the stream , and swam straight towards him . Thus , in the middle of a deep river , beset by two savages and two armed Englishmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desperate knight gallantly maintain the unequal combat . It was evident , however , to himself as well as to his enemies , that his time was come . Fairly harpooned , as it were , and almost dragged under water by the savages , stunned and bruised by the blows which they had showered upon him , and attacked by two fresh and vigorous enemies , escape was now impossible . A surrender , however , he did not contemplate . On the contrary , he kept himself floating and almost motionless in the water till Underhill was within his reach , then suddenly clutching him by the throat , he raised his dagger with a last and desperate effort . At that very instant , Dudley , who had approached him upon the other side , struck the weapon , by a sudden movement , from his grasp . Thus disarmed , Gardiner threw his arms around Underhill 's neck , locked him in a fierce embrace , and sank with him into the stream . Here the two , clasped in each others arms , might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed the savages to drag at Gardiner with all their strength . The harpoons held , the savages soon gained the margin of the narrow stream , and with great exertion , but in a brief space of time , succeeded in dragging the bodies of Gardiner and Underhill from the river , and laying them upon the bank . Underhill soon recovered , but it was for a long time doubtful whether the suspended animation of the knight would be restored . After a long interval , however , during which the two unwounded savages watched for his recovery with great anxiety , fearing lest , with his departing spirit , should slip from their grasp the reward for which they had so vigilantly toiled ; after a period of great uncertainty and suspense , Gardiner at length recovered his senses . His iron frame was , however , fairly prostrated , although his heart remained as stubborn and undismayed as ever . This tale , protracted far beyond the extent originally anticipated , now draws to its close . Sir Christopher Gardiner , after his capture , as above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Boston , where he was kept in strict custody until despatched to England to answer for his various private and political crimes . In the same vessel with himself , was sent prisoner , one Philip Ratcliff , originally a servant of Matthew Cradock , who had been guilty of uttering reproaches against the church of Salem , and company of the Massachusetts . For this offence , the government had cut off his ears , whipped him severely , and banished him from the territory . Gardiner , although himself a prisoner , had remonstrated with the magistrates upon the severity of this punishment , and in consequence of his exhortations , the branding , which had formed a part of the original sentence , was omitted . Upon the arrival of Gardiner in England , he met with no punishment . The proofs of his principal offences were wanting . Maudsley , upon mature consideration of the effect of such a proceeding , and at the earnest solicitation of Esther , declined to prosecute him before the criminal tribunals , and Lady Hoveden had died some years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his altered person , there were none in England to recognise the once celebrated Fulk de Gorges , excepting always his kinsman Sir Ferdinando . Gardiner found that his friend Morton had been right , in supposing that Sir Ferdinando had grown lukewarm in the New England schemes . Morton , Gardiner , and Ratcliff , however , continued for some years to prefer complaints before the Lords of the Privy Council , against the government of the Massachusetts colony , in which they were sustained by Gorges . The despotic nature of their government , as illustrated in the savage punishment inflicted for a few idle words upon Ratcliff , was handled against the colony with considerable effect . A petition , exhibited by Gardiner , Gorges , Mason , and others , against both the Plymouth and the Massachusetts company , was heard before the privy council , and afterwards reported to the king . They were accused , by the petitioners , of " an intention to rebel and to cast off their allegiance , and to be wholly separate from the church of England , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , state , and bishops . " A general government was urged as a remedy . The colony was , however , powerful . Sir Richard Saltonstall , Mr. Humphrey , and Mr. Cradock , were heard before a committee of the council , and defended the cause of Massachusetts with such ability and earnestness , that all thought of a quo warranto against the charter was relinquished , and an order of council passed , expressing approval of the general conduct , both of the Massachusetts and Plymouth governments , and pledging the crown to sustain their liberties and privileges as by charter granted , with " any thing further that might tend to the good government , prosperity , and comfort of the people there of that place . " Sir Ferdinando , whose son had , in the mean time , married Lady Frances , daughter of the Earl of Lincoln , and sister to Lady Susan Humphrey and Lady Arabella Johnson , became probably less inclined to quarrel with a colony with some of whose most eminent names he was thus intimately allied . Tired with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contented himself with modelling and arranging his province of Maine in the most aristocratic and feudal fashion , obtaining , in 1639 , a confirmed grant of the whole province with the title of Lord Palatine . The great council of Plymouth had previously ( in 1635 ) surrendered their charter , the renewed attempt to divide the whole territory of New England into lordships , with a revocation of the Massachusetts patent , and an appointment of a general governor , having again failed . Gardiner never returned to New England . The Lord of Merry-Mount returned in 1643 , having , in the mean time , enraged the colonists by his satirical performance called the New English Canaan . He was kept in prison for a year , fined 100 , which he was unable to pay , and nothing but his " old age and craziness " saved him from the whipping-post . He went to Agamenticus within the palatinate of Sir Ferdinando Gorges , and " living there poor and despised , died within two years after . " Thomas Walford , the smith of Mishawum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same year in which our story closes , he and his wife were ordered to depart out of the limits of the patent , before the 20th October , under pain of confiscation of his goods . His offence was stated to be " contempt of authority , and confronting officers . " Two years afterwards his goods were sequestered and placed in the hands of one Ancient Gennison , to satisfy some debts owed by him in the bay . He removed to Piscataqua ( Portsmouth ) where he became an important and respected citizen . His wife , twenty-five years afterwards , when the bloom of youth had faded , was presented by her neighbors as a witch , but , the palmy days of witch-hunting not having arrived , she was not only acquitted of the charge , but recovered damages against one who had called her by the odious name . The blacksmith lived to a good old age , and left , at his death , a competent estate to his children . Bootefish and Rednape , soon after the lamentable decease of their compeer Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had flown before them . The domain of Merry-Mount was divided off in lots , and settled principally by citizens of Boston . As for the hermit Blaxton , he soon found it impossible to exist among what seemed to him the uproarious multitude , which now thronged his sylvan peninsula . He lingered irresolutely for a year or two , as loth to leave the scenes endeared to him by his long and solitary residence , but at last he made up his mind that there was no room left for him in his much loved Shawmut , and so , taking his pilgrim 's staff in hand , he wandered forth into the wilderness again . Upon the east bank of the river , which still perpetuates his name , a pyramidal mound of alluvial earth rises to the height of seventy feet . Near that mound , then covered with majestic forest trees , the exile again pitched his tent . His cottage he called Study Hall ; the mound , which became his favorite haunt , he called Study Hill . Thither he brought his library and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and there he lived to a good old age , and died with singular good fortune , a few weeks previously to the commencement of the bloody war of Philip , in which his house was laid in ashes , his collection of books and manuscripts destroyed , and nothing spared but his grave . Maudsley and Esther Ludlow were united in the summer of 1631 , and the happiness of their union more than atoned for the misfortunes and trials by which it had been preceded . And now , patient reader , if haply a spark of sympathy for the heroic souls , who in sorrow and self-denial laid the foundation of this fair inheritance of ours , hath been awakened in thy bosom ; or if but a single hour of thine own weariness or sadness hath been solaced by this feeble picture of a buried but an unforgotten age , my humble end will have been answered . With a gentle pressure of thy hand , I bid thee farewell forever . Back matter NOTES . NOTE I.
