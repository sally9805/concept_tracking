We know that different things were hoped for ; and we are pained that we can not record different things of the issue of this great trial . It would have been more manly , as far as we can see ; it would have been more what the friends of those principles in other communions would have felt they had a right to hope for ; it would have been more in the spirit of Luther and Zwingle , of Ridley and Latimer , and , we add , it would have been more in the spirit of the sainted Bedell-who never flinched when truth and duty called-if they had stood firm to those principles , and recorded their solemn vote , calling on the bishops to interpose the purity of their lawn ' when the church was in danger of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last against those errors , even though the consequence might be that they should never he allowed to vote in that body again .

Hitherto there has been but one of two issues in all such attempts-either the evangelical party has found the effort to be impracticable , and has nobly dared to go out-as in the case of the Puritans , the Methodists , the Pilgrims ; or they have bowed to the ascendency of the high-church claims , and have suffered their distinctive features gradually to be absorbed and lost in the superior love of unity , and the three orders , and forms .

THEORIES OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE. * WE have long desired to see an able treatise on the Philosophy of Religious Experience . It has seemed remarkable , that so interesting and important a field of inquiry should present itself , and no one be found to enter it , with the deliberate purpose of exploring it patiently and thoroughly . It is true , indeed , that a peculiar kind of preparation is requisite to qualify one to accomplish * Principles of the Interior or Hidden Life : designed particularly for the consideration of those who are seeking assurance of faith and perfect love . By Thomas C. Upham . Second edition . Boston : XVaite , Pearce &amp; Co. , 1844. such an undertaking . Not every sound thinker , nor every nice metaphysician , nor every acute reasoner , nor even every one who is all these combined , is capable of comprehending , and still less of laying open to the view of others , the true nature of the Christian life . That life is spiritual ; and without something more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural man must fail to understand it . He who would successfully attempt to study and develop it , must bring also the inward illumination and spiritual discernment produced by a rich personal experience . To // one in whom the power of philosophical analysis is joined to profound experimental piety , it would seem no very difficult matter , to ascertain and to exhibit , the laws which regulate the phenomena of renovated mind under the sanctifying influences of the Divine Spirit . That there are such laws , intelligent Christians will not doubt ; for , since that gracious agent does nothing in his peculiar work within the soul , which is not in entire harmony with the established principles of mental action , the results of his agency must have some definite and certain modes of manifestation . What these are , will of course be learned by carefully observing and classifying facts : and for ascertaining what are the facts of religious experience in its genuine forms , the very numerous and copious biographies which our times afford , and the various other means by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer materials as ample as could reasonably be desired . Doubtless it would tend greatly to save the church from the evils of spurious experiences , and false and transient hopes , could a clearer light on this subject be generally diffused . Prof. Upham 's treatise on the Interior or hidden Life , is not precisely an attempt to write a complete philosophy of Christian experience . Its aim is practical . It has nothing of the air of controversy , and contains but little of discussion in any form . It is a calm and simple statement and explication of the author 's views on the subject of personal holiness , written evidently with the desire of doing good . And yet , an examination of some of the elementary principles of the divine life in the soul was necessarily involved , even in such a mode of treating the subject . Few men are better qualified than Prof. Upham to do justice to such a theme . His able , well-digested , and justly popular works on the Philosophy of the Mind , written in a style even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart-which has been pronounced a model-are strong witnesses to his intellectual competency ; and none who know his per . sonal character , will doubt that he possesses in a high degree the moral , or rather spiritual preparation which is demanded . His work will accordingly , we think , be admitted , on all hands , to be written with decided ability . It bears no marks of haste . It is methodical and luminous in arrangement , transparent and tasteful in style , in spirit kind , in thought affluent , and bears throughout the marks of genuine spirituality . From some of the views which are advanced , we shall have occasion , before we have done , to state our entire dissent . But we shall first employ ourselves with the more grateful duty , of expressing our sympathy with the general object of the work , and of noticing those portions in which it seems to us , that some topics of great importance are very happily exhibited . We trust that we ourselves , we are certain that many in the various branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , we may say a special interest in the general object of the treatise on the Hidden Life . That object is the promotion of per . sonal holiness ; of a higher sense of obligation , and a more elevated , steady and consistent piety , among the professed disciples of Jesus Christ . Unless we have greatly mistaken the indications of the times of late , there has been kindling up among evangelical Christians generally , not only a strong conviction that there ought to be a great advance of the church in this direction - that there must be , if vital religion is to have a speedy diffusion through the world  --  but also not a little earnest , deliberate and fixed determination , that by the grace of God there shall be . Some of the palpable errors of the day , which in themselves // no sound mind can contemplate but with pain , have been not without interest in our view , as exhibiting the ill-directed and unenlightened efforts of impulsive minds to reach a real good . We are , also , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing number in the churches , who have been filled with ardent longings after a more thorough inward experience of the power of the Gospel , and richer measures of the indwelling and comfort of the Holy Spirit , than most Christians have ordinarily enjoyed ; and that many of these have learned , with holy gratitude , the faithfulness of the promise- " Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness , for they shall be filled ! " While it is pretty clear , that unless the church is moved to a higher life in Christ , she can not now go up and possess the world , but must be turned back to wander longer in the wilderness , there is , we think , some evidence that she has begun to receive , and is going on to receive , such a new baptism from on high , as to make it consistent that God should lead her on to speedy victory in her last great struggle with the powers of darkness . As she has but lately begun to awaken from centuries of comparative inaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of primitive Christianity , it is not strange that she should have many things to learn relating to vital godliness , in its nature and developments . Much , it must be obvious to all intelligent observers , has been learned already , in the religious movements of the last half century . On the dispensation of the Spirit , for example , as the grand feature of the Gospel economy ; on the obligation and extent of Christian liberality ; on the duty of aggressive Christian action , and on the power of prayer to draw from the inexhaustible fountain of God 's eternal fullness ; - nnd why , in connection with better views on these and similar subjects , should there not also be attained a clearer and better understanding among Christians generally , of the essential principles of the life of God within the soul , and the best means of sustaining and advancing it ? When Luther restored the well nigh lost doctrine of justification by faith , what a vast increase of light did he bring back on the nature of true piety ! What obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be godly , and what impulses impart to urge them forward ! When Edwards wrote his masterly treatise on Religious Affections , what mists were cleared away , what perplexities removed , and what certainty of judgment rendered possible as to the commencement of true religion in the heart ! and whoever can , in a similar spirit , and with like ability , develop and define the laws of the inward life , so as to impart to the minds of diligent disciples the clear . est and most simple views which the nature of the case admits , must certainly render great service to the cause of vital piety . We are aware that some are ready to condemn , as visionary , almost all that can be said about a hidden spiritual life ,  --  a life which can neither be seen nor comprehended by those who are without experience ,  --  which those who have experience , can not so describe as to enable the worldly mind to understand its nature . But we cease to wonder at this , when we remember that the natural man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they are foolishness to him ; neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned . XVe know , also , that the heated imagination of fanaticism , has sometimes perverted the simple and profoundly interesting teachings of the New Testament on the subject , into vague and chimerical enigmas ; pernicious in their influence on the intellect and on the life . But in this fact we only recognize one of the erratic tendencies of our nature , // which has exhibited itself elsewhere as well as under the influence of Christianity . Mysticism is as old as history . It appeared in ancient Egypt . It has always existed in connection with the religious systems of Buddha and of Brahma , of Confucius and Mohammed . It has beea the offspring of philosophy also , as well as of religion . The Stoic in his indifference , the Hindoo placing per . fection in the entire absorption of the soul in contemplation , and the quietest striving after the meditative calm of a literal self-annihilation , are only different manifestations of one and the same tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or characterized by a certain peculiarity oftemperament . We are not , however , to give up the truth that there is such a thing , in sober verity , as a spiritual life , divine in its origin and affinities in the renovated man ; a life hidden from the world in respect to its nature , its power and its enjoyments , because great and dangerous delusions have disguised themselves under the form of this truth , or have even seemed to grow out of it . We should learn to discriminate between the true idea of the life of God as disclosed to us in the Scriptures , and all mere semblances . To do this may be sometimes very difficult , while yet the difference is very great . The raptures of mere animal excitement , and those of a pure devotion , are both raptures , and on occasion may appear alike ; but they are as opposite in their nature as light and darkness . The calmness of a Hume , and that of a Brainerd on a deathbed , are both calmness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other that of a blessed soul . And so the elevation , and tranquillity , and superiority to sense , which mark a life of genuine faith , are , in fact , totally unlike the unmeaning and often affected abstractions of philosophic and religious devotees , and the reveries of poetic and meditative tem peraments . The former are not only compatible with a pure and healthful condition of the sensibilities , but actually indicate it ; the latter betoken a condition vitiated and morbid , or at least unnatural . We regard the design of Prof. Upham 's work , then , as legitimate and full of interest . He divides his consideration of the subject into three parts . Part first , treats of " The Inward Life in its connection with Faith and Love . " Part second , of " The Life of Faith and Love followed by the Crucifixion of the Life of Nature ; " and part third , of " Inward Divine Guidance . " This is an appropriate and logical arrangement ; it is the natural order both according to experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , then the full corn in the ear ; - in other words , first the elements of the divine life , or the becoming a new creature ; then the proximate consequence , the putting off the old man , as Paul expresses it ; and finally , the giving up of the soul to be led by the spirit of God , and to the enjoyment of the privileges of sonship . In going into the details , on these general topics , the writer touches on almost all the important aspects of experimental piety . Having opened his subject by explaining what according to his view the state of sanctification is , and endeavoring to show the practicability and duty of its present attainment , he goes on to indicate the way in which it may be reached . If we regard the succeeding chapters of the work , simply as describing the steps by which a Christian , anxious for progress , may rise to an elevated state of piety , a calm and peaceful region far above that in which too many are content to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such an end . The duty of self-consecration is insisted on , and a part of the form proposed by Dr. Doddridge quoted . It is well urged , that without this , it // is impossible to get nigh to God and to rise in the tone of spiritual affection . The exposition of the nature and importance of appropriating faith , is remarkably clear and happy ; indeed the chapters on faith and love , together with that on a life of signs and manifestations as compared with a life of faith , and that on the nature and relations of emotional experience , constitute we think a real , and valuable contribution to the philosophy of the Christian life . We know not where to find the truth on two or three points of special practical importance , exhibited with equal clearness and discrimination . We refer , for example , to the remarks on the faith of acceptance . It is quite a common thing to observe Christians whose assurance of faith and hope , and consequent inward comfort , are not at all what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to expect . We inquire into their views . They tell us that they have often endeavored , and heartily as it seems to them , to give themselves entirely and forever to the Lord ; that they are conscious that they do feel submission to his will , and delight in his character and in his service . But how shall they know that they are accepted ? Here is their difficulty . Their acts of selfconsecration have been followed by no voice from heaven assuring them that God accepts the offering ; and they can not see how they shall be certain whether he does or not ; and until they can he certain , their minds must be more or less disquieted . But they require evidence for which they have no right to look . God has said , Him that cometh to me , I will in no wise cast out . Do they come then ? Has his grace brought them , as dying sinners , to throw themselves upon his mercy ? This is the only point they have to settle . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are accepted , and so they should believe . This view , which offers the only relief to such a class of persons , is clearly stated . It is also shown that the same principle applies to prayer , in all cases where the things desired are specifically promised . Does the suppliant ask aright , then he has his request ; and by believing this enjoys the full benefit of the answer granted . Prof. Upham has carefully avoided here , the radical error into which incautious writers have often fallen . He makes faith in respect to our own acceptance , or to the answer of our prayers , to consist not in persuading ourselves , while yet without evidence on the point , that we are accepted , or that our requests are heard ; but in relying on God 's truth ; in believing that he actually does what he has promised . " The certainty of the result , says he , is necessarily involved in the veracity of God , and not , as is sometimes supposed , in the mere fact of believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's everlasting TRUTIr , and nothing but his truth , which is the real foundation of the great principle " on which this certainty rests . Equally discriminating and satisfactory are the views on the superiority of that experience which rests on faith and principle , to that of which the chief basis and ingredient is emotion . This is a topic on which there is great need of better knowledge , even among many who are in general enlightened Christians . But too many histories of religious experience , furnish evidence that a dangerous reliance has often been placed , even by eminently holy persons , on special states and frames of mere feeling , as evidences of piety , or of spiritual elevation and advancement . Such states and frames , when thus regarded , are earnestly sought as invaluable blessings ; and when at any time they are not realized , discouragement , doubts , and inward anguish follow of necessity , although there still exists the same conscious sincerity of devotion , and . // the same strength of purpose to live to God alone as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it certainly should have been , that the holiest have been the happiest Christians . Not that emotion is by any means to be regarded as undesirable . If a piety all impulses , is unsteady and often fanatical ; a frozen , calcolating piety is unlovely and inefficient . XVhere there is sound and healthful piety , principle ,  --  a settled steadfast faith , is the element of constancy and strength ; emotion the element of warmth , activity , and beauty . In the example of our blessed Lord , and of such men as Fenelon , Leigh ton , and President Edwards , we see that great elevation of religious character , may coexist with an impressive calmness , a sweet , we may almost say , sublime tranquillity of spirit . Temperament no doubt has its influence , and previous intellectual and mental training also , on the complexion of the spiritual life ; inward conflicts , and outward trials must sometimes discompose , in a measure , the serenest spirits ; but the scriptures clearly inculcate the idea of a state of collectedness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on God , as that in which the believer should be found . The teachings of the work before us , are in harmony with what has now been said , and deserve a considerate attention . In the second and third parts of the work , in which grace is exhibited as effecting the crucifixion of self , and bringing the soul , through the indwelling of the spirit , to a calm , elevated , peaceful life in God , there is also much to instruct and profit the devout disciple in his aspirations . That the duty of producing all the graces of the spirit in the life , of carrying out the purpose of the soul to be the Lord 's by steady vigorous persevering effort to bring all the appetites , dispositions and habits , and all the powers both of body and mind , into subjection to that purpose ; and also , of learning the blessed art of drawing daily and hourly happiness directly from the pure Eternal Fountain by the resting of the soul in God , has not been sufficiently insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of professing Christians , we believe . There is so much , in this age of hurried activity , to draw the attention outward , such a constant and rapid succession of important and often thrilling incidents , that there can not but be danger of a piety that looks in but one direction , and so is wanting in completeness of development and richness of experience . We earnestly wish that that part of practical religion which consists in self-discipline , might be made more prominent in the church ; that the obligation to strip Christian character , as it stands before the world , of those excrescences which too often mar its beauty , and to render it , in a far higher degree than it ordinarily is , the embodiment of whatsoever traits are pure and lovely and of good report , might be far more generally and deeply felt . If the church is to vindicate the great doctrine of justification by faith , and to make the world understand that it is indeed the articulus stantis vel cadentis ccelesice , she must practically illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the most admirable completeness and harmony of the exterior life . So far as the second and third parts of the work before us , bear directly on this result , they furnish many valuable hints , and will leave a happy influence on the mind of the thoughtful reader . We think their usefulness impaired so far as they exhibit prominently the author 's peculiar views in respect to the nature of sanctification or perfection . Without dwelling more particularly on those portions of Prof. Upham 's volume which , considered in themselves , we have read with satisfaction , it is time that we come to // speak of the peculiar theory of the Christian life which he adopts ; and on which he has proceeded in the preparation of his work . This theory continually appears throughout the work and according as this is found to be correct or otherwise , must the value of the work , when considered as a whole , be very much determined . It may be summarily stated thus . The hidden life is a " peculiar modification of Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attainment of what he denominates holiness , sanctification , and evangelical or Christian perfection . This attainment he regards as practicable , and as obligatory on all Christians in the present life . In order to make it , the Christian who is as yet only in the lower and ordinary stages of the divine life , must begin with a solemn act of self-consecration ; devoting himself soul and body to the Lord , and that forever . This is to be followed by the exercise of appropriating faith , or the faith of acceptance ; and hence will ensue the full assurance of faith and perfect love ; or in other words , the soul will become at once sanctified . As a necessary consequence , the predominant influence of sense upon it ceases , or nature is crucified , and it is led thenceforth wholly by the inward guidance of the Spirit of God . In setting ourselves to examine this theory in some detail , we have no intention to play the critic . We can not suffer ourselves on a subject of such grave and vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , of affecting piquancy or acumen . But as any mistake , in a matter of so much moment , must be especially pernicious ; and as the work before us has already found an extensive circulation , and carries with it all the weight of such a name , we deem it to be our duty to call in question the correctness of some of Prof. Upham s views . He himself , we are sure , not less than we , would regret that any but correct views on this subject should gain a general currency . We shall direct our attention particularly to his theory of the Christian life as above briefly stated . We say , then , that we are not entirely satisfied with the restricted and peculiar sense which Professor Upham gives to the phrase hidden , or interior life . We would not , of course , deny to any author the right , occasionally to employ epithets in a new and unusual sense , if he makes his own usage plain by proper definition . But if to change the significance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the change appears to be made for the sake of some advantage which the substituted sense affords to him who adopts it in his argument , the right is plainly not to be allowed . Both these objections seem to us to exist in the present case . it is commonly understood ,  --  and we think it would be difficult to show that it is not so correctly understood ,  --  that the Christian life as such , in all its degrees , and not any particular modification of it , is what the sacred writers , especially Paul , characterize as the " hidden life . " According to the apostle , the moment any man is in Christ " he is a new creature , " - has begun a new spiritual and peculiar life , unlike the life of nature or sense which he lived before , and unintelligible to those who are still natural men . The believer , even from the first , is alive from the dead ; is quickened together with Christ ; and is called not absolutely , but by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same persons who are thus characterized being rebuked severely for their inconsistencies , and their Christian attainments being clearly shown to have been but small . And further , to assume the term in question as properly descriptive only of those who have attained to what the author calls evangelical perfection , enables him to quote // such passages as recognize an interior life in such a way that they seem to favor his idea of such perfection , while really they do not . We must question , therefore , the propriety , the fairness we will say , of such a use of the language . We must object to it as unscriptural , and as giving the author an advantage in the support of his peculiar views to which he is not entitled . it is a concession , too , which we would be slow to make , and one which we should fear would he practically dangerous , that men can he Christians at all , who have not evidence that it is , in an important sense , true of them that they are dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is expressed again , that they are dead , and that their life is hid with Christ in God . If it be correct , to restrict the idea of the interior of life to those only who have reached a given point of Christian progress , we should be at a loss how to distinguish all who as yet are short of this from the unrenewed . But not to dwell upon the term in question , we pass to the state itself which Prof. Upharn uses it to designate . What is evangelical perfection , holiness , or sanctification in his view ? This inquiry is fundamental , in order to a right understanding of his book ; and we will endeavor to put our readers in possession of the answer , as briefly and precisely as we can ; reserving , for the present , what we wish to say as to the propriety of applying such language to describe the state intended . The nature of holiness , as described in the second chapter of the work before us , is substantially what Mr. Wesley defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian perfection . It does not mean sinless perfection . It consists with " imperfection of the physical system , and of the intellectual powers ; with liability to interruption or suspension ; with the weakness and vitiation of its exer cises by infirmity. ; with strong temptations ; and , also , with all unavoidable errors and imperfections of judgment , which , in their ultimate causes , result from Adam 's sin , and require atonement . " We quote verbatim these expressions . Positively , it is a state in which the power of faith and love preserves from all known deliberate sin . We are at pains to he exact where the author has not defined directly , but has only described in a somewhat vague and general manner ; and if we understand him , the above statement expresses precisely his idea . Is it asserting wholly a new doctrine , when he affirms that this attainment all Christians may make , and are bound to make , and that it is actually made by many in the present life ? We think not . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do not often , attain to such a degree of faith and love , as that they would sooner die than commit deliberate willful sin ; or who does not , on the contrary , urge the duty of attaining it on all . And the recorded experience of many eminent Christians shows , that they had so consecrated themselves to God , and had arrived at such an assurance of faith and purity of love , that they were willing to do any thing , to be any thing , or to suffer any thing , for Christ ; although it is true that the thought that they were entirely holy , sanctified , or perfect , in any proper meaning of these terms , never once occurred to them . Prof. Upham , then , and our standard Congregational writers , agree in this , that a certain Christian attainment may be reached and should be in the present life . To this state Prof. Upham applies the name holiness ; but these writers mean something widely different by this term , when they use it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which existed in Adam before the fall , and in the man Christ Jesus . He then affirms // that holiness , that is , in his sense , is attained in this life ; they affirm that holiness , that is , in their sense , is not thus attained . The parties mean to affirm entirely different things ; inasmuch as the admitted existence of a large class of sins , is not inconsistent with the idea of holiness which one adopts , while it is wholly incompatible with the idea of holiness adopted by the other . When , therefore , Prof. Upham assumes it as " the popular doctrine , that no man ever has been sanctified , or ever will be sanctified till the moment of death , " and speaks of " the common doctrine of the impossibility of present sanctification , " we can not but think that , however unintentionally , he misleads his readers ; and that all he says by way of opposing the common doctrine is gratuitous ,  --  a probandum non negata . It is not the common doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own definitions put upon them , which in reality he opposes . The common doctrine is , that absolute , sinless perfection is not attained in the present life , and this he also believes , according to his own statements . This inaccuracy in a matter so essential , is peculiarly unfortunate . It embarrasses the reader , throughout the book , by an ambiguity attaching to such words as holy , perfect , sanctified , whenever they occur . Justice , both to himself and others , as it seems to us , imposed on the author the duty of stating explicitly , in what sense he would maintain holiness to be attainable in the present life , and as explicitly , whether the " popular doctrine " denies it in the same sense . As we have said , we think it generally admitted by orthodox writers and teachers , that such a state , substantially , as Prof. Upham denominates sanctification or perfection , is not only attainable , but that its attainment is essential to a clear and and satisfying evidence of discipleship . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he says that he exercised himself daily to have a conscience void of offense towards God and towards men ; - and that his rejoicing is this , t hetestimony of his conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , and not with fleshly wisdom , he had his conversation in the world . Brainerd must have advanced so far as that his whole soul was bent on serving God , and that indulgence in deliberate sin was with him not to be thought of , when he could say , " I longed to be perpetually and entirely crucified to all things here below by the cross of Christ ; my soul was sweetly resigned to God 's disposal of me in every regard ; and I saw that nothing had happened but what was best for me . I confided in God that he would never leave me , though I should walk through the valley of the shadow of death . It was then my meat and my drink to be holy , to live to the Lord and die to the Lord . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The person of Christ appeared ineffably excellent , with an excellency great enough to swallow up all thought and conception . I felt an ardency of soul to be , what I know not otherwise how to express , emptied and annihilated ; to lie in the dust , and to be full of Christ alone ; to love him with a holy and pure love ; to trust in him ; to live upon him ; to serve and follow him , and to be perfectly sanctified , and made pure by a divine and heavenly purity . " And Henry Martyn , when such language as the following burst forth from the fullness of his heart : - " I do not know that any thing would be a heaven to me , but the service of Christ and the enjoyment of his presence . 0 , how sweet is life when spent in his service ! " Although the new-born soul is ordinarily defective , at first , in its views , and as it were feeble and trembling in its first steps in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  it naturally // comes in a longer or shorter period , as the case may be , to a point at which its views are clear , its evidence of inward grace in a good degree conclusive ; its love to God 's character , to his cause , and to his people , and its submission to his will , things of delightful consciousness ; its hatred of sin deep , and its devotion to God 's service firm and settled . There are those , indeed , and they are too numerous , who are by their own neglect , always faltering , always lingering amidst the rudiments of evangelical experience ; but there are many , also , who having passed the point just mentioned , are thenceforward steadfast , consistent , vigorous Christians ; in simplicity of faith and love , and in singleness and purity of purpose , steadily aiming at the glory of that Savior whom their souls adore ; and whose constraining love gives them their highest impulse . Such a state is , we conceive , inconsistent with the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The faith of such a state , is so full of assurance , that the soul rests with habitual comfort upon God ; and its love is so pure and so perfect , that it casteth out fear . Such we take to be the state of those who use language like that which we have just now quoted ; . - a state reached in all cases , by oftrepeated acts of self-consecration , by earnest longings for the inward unction of the Holy Spirit , and by a cordial acceptance of the promises . And yet Brainerd and Edwards and Martyn , and others like them , are found after having reached this state , mourning deeply over their daily sins . How is this to be interpreted ? Prof. Upham 's theory says , that such are sanctified , holy , perfect persons ; only that for want of rightviews , they do not rightly understand their own spiritual state ; that these sins of which they are still conscious , and which consist in the " interruption or suspension " of holy exercises , or in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors and imperfections of judgment which in their ultimate causes result from Adam 's sin and require atonement , " are not incompatible with perfection ; innsmuch as they exist not by the deliberate choice and purpose of the soul , but notwithstanding such a choice and purpose to be the Lord 's . The distinction which this theory makes between the sins which proceed directly from the deliberate choice of the mind , and those which , in opposition to the supreme purpose of the soul , result from the workings of depraved nature , and from the effects of long habits of sin , is a clear and important one . Doubtless the Christian who has the consciousness that he no longer knowingly and willjidly yields himself to be the servant of sin , and that he cordially relies for acceptance on the atoning sacrifice of Christ , while he struggles with the law in his members which wars against the law of the mind , is in a state which authorizes him to be calm and happy ; and to feel that to him there is now no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject unto sin , and has found refuge in Christ Jesus . He may say-Abba , Father ! with a sweet spirit of adoption ; he may repose in all his duties , cares and sorrows , calmly and fearlessly on the arm of everlasting love ; he may delight in God as his full , satisfying and eternal portion ; and be willing to leave all and to suffer all , to do his will . He may be , in short , a genuine , true-hearted , faithful , steadfast believer . But is it proper , is it safe to say , that he is now perfect , sanctified , holy , while he is still at so wide a remove from the state in which , as a man , his divine Redeemer lived on earth ? The church in general says , no ; and we think correctly . Is it then true , the inquiry will occur , that there is no real difference between the views of Prof. Upham // and those which generally prevail on the subject of his treatise ? Is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answer is , that his theory and that generally received , both agree that all Christians are bound to be as holy as they can be ; that they can , and often do , love God with a fervent and supreme affection , which prefers him , as the portion of the soul , above all selfish and carnal gratifications , and which trusts him so simply and implicitly , as that they sweetly and peacefully leave all their interests in his hands , and have no will but his ; and that they can keep themselves so unspotted from the world , as to be habitually led by the Spirit of God , and so as not to indulge in any known and willful sin .  --  but here are essential points of difference . The common theory holdsup before the mind of the believer , as the perfection at which he is to aim , the spotless , absolute perfection which the divine Redeemer exhibited in his complete obedience to the holy law of God . The other presents to him , as perfection , a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of this . The common theory supposes , that when the heart is first renewed , all its moral exercises , and faith and love among the rest , are feeble and imperfect ; that by grace and spiritual discipline combined , they are gradually matured ; that the causes which disturb them are gradually rooted out , and the powers of the spiritual man steadily developed and improved ; and that this process , by which the soul of the disciple is moulded into the likeness of Christ and prepared for heaven , is sanctification . The other requires the new-born soul to exercise perfect faith and perfect love at once ; and on condition that this is done , promises the gift of deliverance from the power of sin , by a simple act of God . Sanctification , according to this view , is this gift ; and like justification , is not a process , but an instantaneous work of divine grace upon the soul . It is easy to see that these differences , when followed out into details , are very wide . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection ; that which presents to the mind , as the mark towards which it is to press , absolute , Christ-like l ) affection , or that which presents a lower , and in many respects , a defective state ? We turn to the Scriptures : and we readily admit , that the sacred writers apply the terms holy , sanctified , and even perfect , to Christians in the present life ; not , however , as we think it entirely obvious , in their strict and proper meaning , but in a qualified and peculiar sense . If it is said that this is all that the theory of perfection in the present life requires , inasmuch as it is just this qualified sense in which the advo* cates of this theory use the term , the answer is , that when believers are called , in reference to their present state , holy , sanctified or perfect , in the Scriptures , it is never with respect to any certain point of spiritual progress which they have reached , or any peculiar modification of the divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are distinguished from other converted men ; but invariably to denote the simple fact , that they are truly pious men-men who have been born again , and have some gracious dispositions-and to distinguish them from the wholly sinful world . If any choose to call all renewed persons holy , sanctified , or perfect , in a comparative sense , and to distinguish them from natural men who have no holiness at all , we grant them without doubt the sanction of the Bible ; and we have no fear that this use of language will prove in any way pernicious . But we can not for a moment admit , that to take these terms to designate a particular state , or point of progress in the life of God , such as that to which Prof. Upham and others have applied // them , has any warrant in the Scriptures . And on the other hand , we understand our Lord and his Apostles to hold up continually to every Christian , absolute moral perfection as the prize of his high calling , and asapracticable ultimate attainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , he proposed to himself to open the door for a complete deliverance of those who , as transgressors , were cut off from access to God-were under the heavy condemnation of his law , and hopeless of relief from any means of their own devising . He meant to bring to those who should receive him as a Savior , a full release from the power of Satan , and from all the evils of a state of sin . Hence he did three things . He rendered pardon and justification possible , that is , consistent with justice , by the offering of himself a sacrifice ; he supplied the means and influences which were adapted to lead to holiness ; and finally , he placed clearly and distinctly before the minds of men , the true standard , the divine IDEAL , of moral excellence . In the Sermon on the Mount , for example , we have an admirable specimen of the manner in which he sought to exalt men 's conceptions of the nature of true goodness , and at the same time to enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of virtues as of the highest value , which are very lightly thought of by the world ; sanctions the moral law and upholds its spirituality ; and then sums up all by pointing us to the spotless moral purity of our Heavenly Father , and commanding us to take that as our glorious model ; to make that the measure by which to judge ourselves ; and never to rest satisfied till we attain an entire likeness to that unsullied excellence . " Be ye therefore PERrEcT , even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect . " The Apostles enforce continually this great lesson of their Master . Excelsior-higher - higher- is their watchword . The perfection of Christ it is that they continually hold up as that which the disciple must aspire to reach . " Be ye holy , for I am holy . " " As he which hath called you is holy , so be ye holy . " " Brethren , " says Paul , " I count not myself to have apprehended ; but this one thing I do ; forgetting those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which are before , I press towards the mark , for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus . " Now this absolute moral perfection , for which man was originally made , from which he has been utterly cast down by sin , and to which it is the design of the great plan of salvation to restore him , involves two things . The first is , right moral action . The infallible rule of moral action is the law of God . As God is infinite in wisdom , he perfectly understood , when he gave his law , all the relations and all the duties of man , and the limits of his capacities . While it is clear , then , that actual obedience to God 's law is within the reach of man 's ability , it is equally clear that this will make him perfect in his conduct , and that any thing short of this will destroy perfection . The second thing involved in true perfection is , a sound moral condition of all the faculties , propensities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly be called perfect , even if his actions are strictly right , unless all the powers , dispositions and propensities of his nature , are such as that he acts right easily , as it were , spontaneously , and without a struggle . God did not intend , when he created man , that he should find the doing of the divine will a burdensome and painful work . All the powers of the soul were so adapted to his service , that no painful ef // fort should be required , and no rigorous discipline necessary , in order to engage them in it . And all the propensities , also , were in the direction of duty , as prescribed by God . Had man continued in the perfection in which God created him , he would have had all his faculties , and all his mental tendencies , and the constantly increasing force of habit , in entire harmony with the dictates of conscience , and with the divine rule of action as revealed . He would have acted right , not by a constant warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but without a warfare ,  --  with a consenting and obedient nature . Any unfitness in the condition of the mind for any moral duty , any necessity of self-conquest in order to discharge it , is proof of a deranged and imperfect moral state . It may seem hardly necessary to insist on a point so plain , as that what we have now described is the only true perfection ; that no being can be considered perfect , of whom it is true , either that his moral action is in any respect defective , or his moral nature in any respect deranged . It is the glory of angels , that they perfectly obey God 's law with a nature that , like a harp with every chord in tune , is perfectly prepared . And we perceive at once , that if we suppose any thing short of this , even in the least particular , the idea of perfection ceases . For if , as is admitted by all sound moralists , there is an eternal and immutable distinction between right and wrong , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . The fundamental principles of right moral action , must be the same to God and to his creatures ; and there must be one rule of dutyone standard by which to test character-to angels and to men . The moral perfection of the Deity , is the perfect conformity of his conduct to right principles  --  and the perfect moral condition of all the attributes or faculties , so to speak , of his glorious nature . The moral perfection of angels , is the perfect conformity of their conduct to the same right principles , and the perfect moral condition of all the faculties of their nature . The moral perfection of man , is the conformity of his actions to the same right principles , and the perfect moral condition of all the faculties of his nature . And it is clear , in this view , that true perfection is one and the same thing in all beings . If it is said-Prof . Upham does not say this , but it has often been urged by others-that God is infinite and we finite ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the question of moral perfection . The objection entirely mistakes the case . It supposes that the degree of goodness in a being depends on the extent of the capacities which he possesses ; which is not true . A piece of mechanism may be very simple-may have few parts , and may be applied to a very humble purpose ; but if its parts are all in order , and it answers its end entirely , there is just as much and just the same perfection in it , as in a machine which is far more ingenious and complicated in contrivance , and is applied to a far nobler end . Each does all that it ought to do , and is all that it ought to be ; and the one as truly as the other . And even so , if man does all he ought to do , and and is all he ought to be , nothing better , nothing higher , nothing more perfect , can be affirmed of angels , or , with reverence be it said , of the Deity himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of true moral perfection , and of one and the same moral perfection . Man , in such a case , is perfect even as the angels ; and even as , in the language of the Savior , his Father which is in heaven is perfect . And further , is not the idea of an inferior sort of perfection in itself absurd ? Does not the language , indeed , involve a contradiction ? For what is an inferior kind // of perfection but an imperfect kind of perfection-that is , no perfection at all ? If moral perfection is complete freedom from moral blemish or defect ; if a morally perfect being is one whose nature and whose actions have no defect of a moral kind , is it not just as absurd to talk of a higher and a lower sort of moral perfection , as it is to talk of a higher and lower sort of infinity , or a longer and shorter eternity ? Beings may differ inconceivably in their natural constitution-may be of all ranks in the scale of existence : but the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , that which combines the two elements-perfection of moral action , and perfection in the condition of the moral nature . XVithout both these elements , no being can be morally perfect ; with them , all are alike perfect . As to the question , how this perfection which Jesus Christ requires , shall be attained ,  --  how sinful , ruined man , when he has been pardoned and renewed , shall become pure as God is pure ,  --  it is plain , that one part of the achievement consists in putting away all known sin , and striving after entire conformity in moral action to the law of God . To this course , the Gospel continually urges the believer . If ye love me , says Christ , keep my commandments . If a man come after me , and forsake not all that he hath , he can not be my disciple . Likewise reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin , but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord . How shall we that are dead to sin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man that hath this hope in him , purifieth himself even as he is pure , says John in the same spirit . Allowing one 's self in acts of sin , is contrary even to the very idea of Christian character ; and sin impairs the evidence of our abiding in Christ just so far as it gains any advantage over us . It is only by dying unto sin , devoting ourselves with all our faculties to God , acknowledging in our inmost souls that we are not our own , and taking God 's will to be ours , and his fullness to be our sufficient portion , that we can make progress towards the true perfection . It will only be when our moral conduct is so conformed to the divine requirements , that to the omniscient eye we are chargeable with no wrong action-that we shall have reached the line of duty . Till then , we shall not be perfect in action , and shall have need to mourn over our delinquencies and to be continually pressing on . And then it must be added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his moral nature from the ruins of the fall , and recover it from the dreadful derangements produced by a life of sin . Here is the labor ; a labor so great , that were it not for the exceeding richness of Gospel provisions , and the eternal and inexhaustible fullness of grace which is offered us in Jesus Christ our Lord , we must utterly despair . Sin has rendered the passions of the soul restless and difficult of control . It has so perverted the affections , that they are disposed continually to fasten on unworthy and forbidden objects . It has so blunted the moral sensibilities , and vitiated the moral taste , that even in the regenerated soul , the power of moral beauty ,  - -  the loveliness of goodaess ,  --  tnakes but a feeble impression and awakens but moderate admiration . It has placed the soul under the urgent influence of habit ; so that , from this cause , it is pressed towards evil with a mighty power . All these effects of sin are to be obliterated from the moral nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The violence of the passions must be // thoroughly subdued , and they completely subjected to reason and to conscience . The affections must be elevated and purified , so that they shall go out towards nothing but what is truly excellent and holy . The moral sense must be brought to that degree of tenderness and refinement , that it can perfectly appreciate and feel what is morally attractive . The tyranny of pernicious habits must be utterly destroyed , and all the force of habit be brought into alliance with what is good . When all this is done , and not before , there will be no law in the members warring against the law of the mind ; no flesh lusting against the Spirit ; no strife and conflict in the soul . When all this is done , then the ruined temple of man 's nature will appear in its original glory , with all its stones replaced , its shattered columns reerected , its arches restored to original symmetry and strength , and all its beauty and proportion as at first . Man will then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he came from the hand of his Creator . This will be perfection ,  - -  true perfection ,  --  the only true perfection . But here we meet another question . When does our blessed Lord require us to arrive at this perfection ? And to this we reply-with the least possible delay-as soon as the nature of the case admits . On this part of the subject what we have just been showing will be borne in mind , that sanctification to perfection , consists of two distinct parts  --  the abandonment of sin-and the restoration of the moral nature . If now we ask , when Jesus Christ will have his followers abandon sin ? - we say , at once without the delay of a single hour . God forbid , says the Apostle , that we who are dead to sin , should live any longer therein . It is asserting only a palpable truism , to say that there is no necessity that any believer should go on to allow himself in sin . Necessity and sin are incompatible terms . What is necessary can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wherefore , says Paul again , let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us , and let us run with patience the race which is set before us . If we mean to be Christ 's , and especially if we mean to make rapid Christian progress , we are to settle once for all the principle that we are never to give place to sin-never , on any pretence whatever , to suffer ourselves to do that which conscience and the law of God forbid , or to omit what they require . There is reason to fear that the views of many are very loose on this point ; that many who profess religion , do not feel that God requires , and their Christian profession requires them , now to cease from every sin ; and to yield themselves to God as the servants of righteousness . Yet this is the demand of the Gospel ; and we may be sure that our divine master never did , and never will , give us any license to commit what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , before we part with the sin that is most dear . In respect to the other thing which is included in perfection , the restoration of the moral nature , the case is different . This must of necessity be a gradual work . Nothing buta miracle can make it otherwise . The sick man , when his disease has begun to leave him , requires time , and exercise , and careful nourishment , to repair his wasted vigor , and bring back the elasticity of a healthful body . And even so it is indispensable that the soul , with its powers enfeebled and deranged by the disease of sin , should , when the Great Physician has ad ministered the effectual remedy for the deadly malady , have time to recover , under the influence of God 's truth and spirit , and disciplinary providence , and by means of a vigorous selftraining // and seif-dicipline . All we can say on this point , is ,  --  that the more faithful the believer is in the use of ' means , the more rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blessedness and glory of a perfect moral nature ,  --  a nature that shall truly bear God 's image ; and that he is most solemnly hound to give all diligence in the work ; to strive as one that contendeth for a crown , so that in the least practicable time , he may undo what his life of sin has done , to unfit his moral nature for God 's service . If he is faithful in his efforts , especially if he takes hold by an active faith , of the all-sufficiency of Christ , he will find himself gaining victories , one by one , over the corruptions of his nature . His passions will become more governable ; his moral sensibilities more acute ; his affections and tastes more pure and elevated and habit coming to his aid , will lend continually a stronger and stronger influence in favor of his duty . He will be more and more sensible that he is filled with the Spirit , and led by the Spirit ; and of course will have more and more of the witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will be able to see clearly , as he examines himself from time to time , that grace is destroying the old man which is corrupt , and making the new man to grow up unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ; and thus making him meet ,  --  fit in character ,  --  to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light . When this last point is reached , and the moral man perfectly restored , perfection is really attained . If now any are anxious to inquire whether this last part of the great work of rising to perfection ,  --  this perfect regaining of soundness in the moral nature , is ever accomplished in the present life ,  --  we answer that the question seems to us of very little practical consequence indeed . It is a clear case , that we are sob emnly bound to strive to attain it as soon as possible , be the time necessary for this purpose longer or shorter . It is also certain , for the Scriptures teach it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before attained it , a full victory over the body of sin , or the carnal nature at death . So that every one who is faithful to his master , does sooner or later , prove in his own experience the completeness of salvation , and the all-sufficiency of the Savior ; and thus attains to absolute perfection . If any are still disposed to press the question , we say that , for ourselves , we know of but two instances in which humanity perfect in action and in nature ,  - -  perfect as angels and as God ,  --  absolutely perfect , has been exhibited in our world : - that of our first parents in Eden before the fall ,  --  and that of the second Adam , the man Christ Jesus . We assert nothing on the subject . We only say , that if there have been other examples of the only true perfection , in the present world , neither sacred nor profane history has preserved the memory of them , and we know no evidence of the fact . If here it should be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attain perfection , according to the command of Christ , if we may not feel certain of attaining it until we die , we answer , that there are abundant facts to prove the contrary . Look at the painter or the sculptor . Each has his ideal of beauty . It is a glorious conception , far , very far beyond his powers of execution . His most laborious efforts do not reach it ; but the eye of the soul is ever gazing on it ; the imagination feasts on it continually ; and though there is , in this case , a certainty that it never can be reached , yet see what efforts are called forth by the desire to approximate it in some good degree . This desire forever fills and haunts the spirit of the artist , warms him with // a noble enthusiasm that quickens all his powers , and urges him on with an impulse , that makes years of the closest application and of wearisome labor , seem but trifles . He feels no want of stimulus , though pressing towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the contrary , is often urged to an intensity of effort , which wears out his body and brings it to the tomb . And look too at examples , which bear directly on the point . Who have hungered and thirsted after righteousness with intenser longings , who have striven after self-crucifixion and likeness to Christ with more earnest and persevering efforts , who have actually made greater attainments in the life of God , than the Augustines , the Luthers , the Paysons of the Christian church ? - yet these , and others of kindred spirit by thousands , were always ready to say with Paul ,  --  I know that in me , that is in my flesh , dwell . eth no good thing . In their view , the work of bringing back their moral nature to such a condition thr*t all its derangements should disappear , was so difficult , and required such various discipline and such thorough inworking of the grace of God , that while they were resolved to strive with all their powers to accomplish it , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come when they put off the mortal body , and then as the free gift of grace . The experience of all such , we may say of the brightest lights which the church has ever exhibited to a benighted world , disproves entirely the assertion ,  --  that men will not strive after the true perfection , unless they know that they shall attain it soon . Now let it be particularly observed , that our objection to Professor Upham 's theory , is not that it alleges that this absolute perfection is actually attained in the present life . It sets up no such claim . As we have already shown , although Prof. Upham , in form , opposes the " popular doctrine " in the early part of his treatise , he , in fact , maintains it as strongly as ourselves in the progress of his work . He disclaims , expressly , the idea that sinless perfection is attnined in the present life . He even goes so far as to admit , in his chapter on the confession of sin by sanctified persons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even from voluntary transgression . " There may be sins in us , says he , " and not merely those which result from infirmity and are involuntary , which are seen by the omniscient eye of God , but which may not be obvious to ourselves . * * Who , then , is able , either on philosophical or Scripture principles , to assert , absolutely and unconditionally , that he has been free from sin , at least forany great length of time ? " We confess , we are surprised at the extent of this admission . It looks to us exceedingly like an abandonment altogether of the doctrine of perfection in any sense . Either the exercise of perfect faith and love secures a state of sanctification , or freedom from all voluntary sin , according to the theory , or it does not . If it does not , the theory falls . But if it does , there is certainly no room for the admission , that it is impossible for any to be positive that they have been free from all such sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe , if the theory be true , undoubtingly , that they are preserved from all sins except those of mere infirmity . But not to insist on this , our difficulty with the theory is , not that in its real meaning , it places before the mind of the believer , as perfection , more than he is able to attain in the present life , but that it presents far less than the glorious idea to which the Gospel points him ; that while , in words , it seems to propose something higher than the ordinary aim of believers , as the // prize of their high calling , in fact , it brings down the mind from the familiar and habitual contemplation of the true perfection , to direct its attention to a fictitious or nominal perfection , which , of necessity , is tess ennobling and efficient in its influence on the mind . Prof. Upham is , indeed , very careful to guard his readers against the impression that progress ceases when what he calls holiness is attained . But after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to high and holy endeavor , a perfect perfection held up before the mind , has a vast advantage over an imperfect one ! So long as the Christian keeps his eye fixed on the exalted perfection towards which the Scriptures point him-that which involves absolute perfection of being and of conduct  --  a likeness to Christ and to the pure spirits about his throne ; so long he must feel himself powerfully impelled to struggle upward . But let him imagine himself perfect , while the carnal nature is not yet rooted out ; let him bring down the standard , and form to himself the notion of an inferior kind of perfection , and he will be in danger of ceasing to feel what mighty necessity there is for effort , in order to grow up into the image of God . In stating our own views , and what we suppose to be the prevailing doctrine , as to the nature of moral perfection , we have necessarily shown what we regard as the true idea of sanctification . The theory which we have been considering , places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these respects , that both take place instantaneously , and both alike by an act of faith . The difference which it makes between them is , that while the latter is a forensic act , a setting the sinner right as relates to the law , the former is the bestowmeat of a positive blessing , the blessing of grace so to deliver from the power of evil as to secure an habitual delight in God , and a victory over known sin ; or the state which this theory calls perfection . From this notion of sanctification , we of course altogether dissent . To sanctify , is to make holy ; and if the state of holiness or perfection to which the Gospel proposes to recover fallen man , be such as we have described it , the work of sanctification must be a process , carried on by the grace of God accompanying appropriate means ; and can not be regarded as completed , till the soul is fully purified from all traces of the disease of sin . T* speak of sanctification as completed in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen condition , and our connection with Adam , and require the application of Christ 's blood , " those who are not " able to assert absolutely and unconditionally that they have been free from sin , at least for any great length of time , " appears to us to be a very singular and unauthorized use of terms . The Bible speaks of all regenerated men as saved , although their salvation is yet incomplete , because their ultimate salvation is made certain . And so it speaks of them all as sanctified , although the work of sanctification is as yet but partially accomplished , because God is pledged to carry it on to perfection . But as we have said before , this use of the term proves altogether too much for Prof. Upham 's theory , which applies it only to such of the regenerated as have reached a given point of Christian progress . The practical part of the matter , is attended with equal difficulty . The young disciple , with the hope that he is renewed and justified , wishes to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere babe in Christ as yet . His graces are only beginning to be developed . He has no opportunity to confirm his confidence in God , by actual experience of his faithfulness ; or his love , by many rich discoveries of the glory of his character . Nevertheless // he is directed to make , at once , a perfect and permanent consecration of himself , with all his faculties of body and of soul to God , and to appropriate to himself the ample provisions of the Gospel with a perfrct faith of acceptance ; and this as a means to the end , that he may be brought immediately into a state of complete sanctification or perfection . Now this , we do confess , to us seems very much like saying to an infant , who is just able to totter about by the help of his mother 's linger ,  - -  walk , and you will be able to walk . It is telling the inquirer ,  - -  perform those exercises which are implied in a certain state , and you will be in that state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be perfect . No doubt , he replies , but how s/tall I attain at once , to such self-devotion and such faith ? That is the point on which I wish to be instructed . Certainly , to discover our title to the promises , and to learn to appropriate them to ourselves , and to offer ourselves to God in frequent and hearty self-consecration , are the appropriate means of attaining an elevated state of piety , and of enabling the soul to rest in God as its all-sufficient good . But it appears to us equally certain , that such directions in relation to these duties as those above described , must greatly embarrass the seriously inquiring mind . We have , perhaps , dwelt sufficiently on the peculiarities of the treatise under review . We have endeavored to exhibit the author 's views with fairness , and examine them with candor ; and have freely stated our objections . That the work will continue to find readers , and that its calm and temperate tone , and its spiritual views and judicious suggestions on various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do not doubt . It is due to the respected writer , to say , that his views are at a wide remove from much that has recently been written and said and acted out , on the subject of perfection ; and that he has so qualified and guarded his statements , generally , as to avoid , in a considerable degree , what might be considered practically pernicious in the bearings of the theory he adopts . He belongs to the sober , meditative school of Fenelon , and not to that which of late , in some places , has been led by impulse into all the extravagances of popular fanatacism . All this , however , does not prevent our wishing that the treatise on the Interior Life had been written in accordance with what we believe to be the scriptural doctrine of holiness ; in the spirit of Doddridge , rather than in that of Michael Molinos and Francis De Sales . That the attention of the ministry , and of the church , may be effectually drawn to the practicability and necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally prevails , is ardently to be desired . Without this we fear that great reverses await us in our religious enterprises , and that the withdrawment of God 's special grace , will leave Zion to long seasons of darkness and discouragement . And if there is something better within our reach , we are bound surely by every obligation not to rest contented as we are . Let each then look at the matter for himself , and feel his individual responsibility . Let pastors endeavor by the influence of their own example and spirit , and by steady and continued effort , to bring their churches up to the higher walks of the life of God . And if there are those private Christians , as we believe there are , who are earnestly desiring to understand better what it is to live by faith in Christ , and to have comfort in the Holy Spirit , let them not give over the pursuit , but rest assured that it may be successful . Deeply do we sympathize with the yearnings of every heart that // longs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they who are striving after entire conformity to God , and who feel that they can never be content , till they have his image perfectly restored within their souls ! Instead of checking the aspirations of such , we would give them a new impulse . We would persuade them , in place of calling any attainments they have already made perfection , while they are conscious that their shattered moral constitution has hut just begun to be restored , to feel like David when he said , I shall he satisfied when I awake in thy likeness ! Should any one attain in this life , what has been set forth as the true perfection , he would have no need to speak of it , in order that it might be known . Such an one , would shed a glory all around him which the world might see . He would be , in the midst of sinful men , like the evening star , when it looks out in serene and untroubled splendor , from among frowning masses of dark and angry clouds . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain it-having put off the body of death and put on immortality  --  the Scriptures tell us , that they shall shine forth as the sun , in the kingdom of their Father ! 0 , it is well worth a life of striving to mount up to such a glory ! We can well afford to fight the good fight of faith until we die , while we are sure of victory then ; - while we have the certainty , that in the language of John , we shall then be , in every moral lineament , like Him whom we adore ! THE PROSPECTS WHICH THE PRESENT AGE PRESENTS TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM . RELIGIOUS FREEDOM  --  the gift of Christ  --  the hope of earth ! Yet , on this subject , as on that of civil liberty , both in respect to its nature and its present condition and prospects , there is afloat much confusion of thought , and much vagueness of speech . Multitudes would seem to think that earth 's great battle on this subject has been fought , and it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of victory . Little do such understand of the full import of the thing itself and of its actual condition in the world at large ; and still less of the baptisms of blood that lie between it and universal conquest . We know not how to speak intelligently of its present prospects except in the light of its true nature and its real general condition.
