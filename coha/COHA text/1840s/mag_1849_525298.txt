txt THIS work appears to have been written poration , capable of acting as an individwith na hoaest iatention , and bears cvi- ual person . qwq under all circumstances ; what here and now impedes or thwarts them is bad -- can never be of service to them , must always work against them , and should nowhere and under no circumstances be tolerated for a moment . Constitutions are designed to maintain a fixed and permanent rule , and , if they answer their purpose , must not unfrequently control popular wishes and tendencies , and often restrain the majority , preventing them , for a time at least , from adopting measures which they are persuaded are for the interests of the country . Hence we must always expect under popular governments a party that will be dissatisfied with the Constitution , now with this provision , and now with that , and ready to agitate for its amendment , alteration , or total suppression . It can hardly as yet be forgotten , that , under the administration of General Jackson , the constitution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks from the Democratic party of the time . That party denounced the Senate as the aristocratic branch of the government , as repugnant to the genius of free institutions , and demanded its essential modification , because , just then , it happened not to be for them . Yet that party to-day find the Senate a purely democratic institution , and their chief reliance to prevent the administration from adopting a policy to which they are opposed ; for they happen to have a majority of Senators on their side . They no longer denounce it as aristocratic , and no longer demand that its constitution be modified . Ga the other hand , it is remembered that , in consequence of the use and abuse of the executive veto by General Jackson and some of his successors to defeat important measures which had received the sanction of a majority of Congress , many in the Whig party who were strongly in favor of these measures , believing them to be really demanded by the industry and business of the country , took up the opinion that the veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in its abuse throwing such undue influence into the hands of the Executive as to endanger our free institutions , and therefore a constitutional provision that should be either abolished or essentially modified . Yet who is prepared to say that the time may not even soon come when they will find the executive veto their best , perhaps their only , safeguard against measures which in their judgment would be ruinous to the country ? The tendency , when we are disappointed or defeated by some constitutional provision , to complain of the Constitution itself , and to propose an amendment which suits our wishes for the moment , is strengthened and apparently justified by certain false notions as to the origin of constitutions and as to the rights of majorities , which have become , or are becoming , quite prevalent in our country as well as in some others . It was pretended by some men in the last century , who then passed for philosophers , that to make a constitution is the easiest thing in the world , that nothing is simpler or more feasible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in a state of nature , to come together in person or by delegates and give themselves any constitution they please , and provide for its wise and beneficent practical operation . They put forth the most extravagant follies on the excellence and perfectibility of human nature , and virtually deified the people . They disdained , indeed , to believe in God , blasph*mously alleging that they " had never seen him at the end of their telescopes ; " but they did not hesitate to transfer to the people all the essential attributes of Deity , and to fall down and worship them as a divinity . The people could remedy all evils ; the people could make no mistakes ; the people could do no wrong ; and we bad only to clear the way for the free , full and immediate expression of the popular will , in order to have a perfect civil constitution , and a wise and just adtninistra4ion . Hence , there need be no hesitancy before overthrowing existing institutions , breaking up established order , or in trusting to the unchecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , or the reconstruction of society . In consequence of the prevalence of such a pleasant theory , all power of change was removed , all prudence in experimenting or innovating rendered superfluous ; all attachment to old institutions or to a long-established order appeared foolish , if not wicked ; nothing in heaven or on // earth was to be henceforth sacred or inviolable but the will of the multitudethat is , the will of the demagogues who could manage the multitude  --  and we were to surrender ourselves to that will with as much confidence , and with as little reserve , as the saint reposes on the *vil1 of God . Into this silly and impious doctrine the fathers of our republic did not fall . They were no vague theorizers , no mad visionaries ; they were plain , practical men , who looked at realities , and dealt with things as they found them . But this doctrine , which has for the last sixty years convulsed all Europe , overturned thrones , displaced dynasties , and left few things standing , except despotism on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found its way amongst us also , and spread its subtle poison through our own community . Our people , in large numbers , forget that constitutions are generated , not made , and that no constitution can draw up and impose a constitution which shall be really a constitution , unless its essential principles are already , through Providence , established in the wants , the habits , the usages , the manners and customs of the people for whom it is intended ; that the constitution can never be nrbitrarily imposed , but must always grow out of the pre-existing elements of the national life ; and that when once formed it is to be henceforth modified only according to its own internal law , through the most urgent necessity , with the greatest delicacy , and the most consummate wisdom and prudence . Hence they cease to regard the Constitution as sacred , and look upon it as a thing that may be changed with as much facility , and almost for as slight reasons , as a gentleman changes the fashion of his coat , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not only the easiest but the safest thing in the world . Consequently , the idea of submitting to a present inconvenience , of suffering a constitutional provision which restrains their will or thwarts their present wishes , rarely occurs to them ; and whenever things do not go to their mind they clamor for a change in the Constitution . The danger of this state of the public mind needs not to be pointed out to the statesman . It is incompatible with everything like established order , with everything permanent or stable in government , and keeps everything unsettled and fluctuating . From the fact that , under our political order , the greater number of questions are determined by the will of the majority , a large class of our politicians , , seldom accustomed to look beneath the surface , or to trace facts to their principles , conclude that the majority have a natural right to govern , and that whatever tends to hinder the free and full expression of their will is contrary to natural law , and smells of usurpation . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the will of the majority , and call out with all their force , from the very top of their lungs , for its amendment . Is it not the essential principle of all republicanism , say they , that the majority must govern ? What then can be more anti-republican , more really undemocratic , than to uphold a constitution that hinders the majority from doing whatever they please ? But these sage politicians would do well to remember , that the right of the majority to rule is a civil , not a natural right , and exists only by virtue of positive law . Anterior to civil s*ociety , or under the law of nature , all men are equal , respectively independent , and no one has any authority over another . Each is independent of all , and all of each ; and both majorities and minorities are inconceivable . Civil society must be constituted before you can even conceive the existence of a political majority or minority , and when it is constituted , neither has any rights but those the law confers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is absurd to pretend that the majority are , or can be , deprived of any of their natural rights by any constitutional provision . If then a given constitutional provision should restrain the majority , prevent them from making their will prevail , that is no just cause of complaint , for no law is broken , no right is violated ; and when no law is broken and no right violated , no injustice is done . It is necessary to set aside these false notions , or pretensions , of modern Radicals and Socialists , which are revolutionary in // principle , and incompatible not only with all stable government , but with the very existence of the State status , of legal order itself . We must approach every established constitutioa with the presumption , as the lawyers say , in its favor , and as bound to accept and sustain it as it is , unless good and sufficient reasons are forthcoming for alteration or amendment . On no other condition can we be distinguished , in principle , from Radicals and Destructives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , because friends of order . The presumption is universally in favor of authority-that the constitution , as it is , is right-that the law is just ; and before we can have the right even to entertain a proposition to alter it , we must be able to prove beyond a teasonable doubt that it is wrong , that it is unjust . The fact that the veto power exists in the Constitution is to us , therefore , a presumption , at least , that it ought to be there ; it is , indeed , a sufficient motive for retaining it , until a valid and sufficient reason is shown for abolishing it . We insist on this view of the case , because we are anxious that the principle we indicate should be well considered . The opposite principle is rapidly gaining ground amongst us , if indeed it has not already become predominant . The fashion is now to presume every man guilty till proved innocent  --  to hold every charge true till it is proved to be false-all government , all law , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pol5ular tendency is to arraign government before the bar of anarchy , and compel it to vindicate its own innocence , thus reversing all the maxims of law , of justice , and of logic , hitherto devised and held in respect by the common sense of mankind . It is well , therefore , to remind the public , occasionally , that the presumption is always on the side of the Constitution and of the authorities holding under it . The value of the veto power is not , however , left to be merely presumed . It is a vital element in our general system of government , which is not so much an original system , as an original and peculiar modification of the English system , well known to be a government of estates , as distinguished from what has received the name of centralism . The characteristic features of the English constitution are the separation , on the one hand , of the bodies represented in the government ; and on the other , of the powers of government itself , each with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of the constituent bodies , and of the several departments of government , each with its veto , that consists the beauty and excellence of the English system ; and it is this alone that constitutes the safeguard of English liberty . These divisions , and the veto power attaching to each , are not in themselves , it is true , favorable to the efficiency of administration , nor are they intended to be so ; they are intended to serve as checks or restraints on power , to prevent it from becoming despotic , or hostile to the liberty of the subject ; and the peculiar merit of this constitutional system is , that they serve this purpose without impairing , in too great a degree , the unity and force of authority . This system we inherited with the common law from our English ancestors , and have retained it with simply such modifications as the circumstances of our country and the elements of our society rendered necessary or expedient . In interpreting our institutions , we are always to seek ou , r principle of interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the ancient republican or to any of the modern democratic theories . Our government is republican , in the sense that it is not monarchical ; it is democratic in the sense that it recognizes no political aristocracy , and treats all men as equal before the law ; but in no other sense is it , or was it ever intended to be , either republican or democratic ; save as all governments that are instituted for the public weal , instead of the private benefit of the governors , are republican , whatever their form . The people with us are the motive power , but not the directive or governing power ; the government vests in the Constitution rather than in them ; for outside of it they have no political existence , and no political authority , except from it , and in and throuo'h it The oove rament , in principle , is the government of law , not the government of mere will , whether of the one , the few , or the many . The Constitution governs the State , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aug. // the ordinary laws govern the people as individuals . It is well to bear this fact in mind , especially in these times , when the rage is to abolish law , and introduce , everywhere , governments of mere will . Law is the will of the sovereign regulated by reason , the expression of power united with justice ; will without reason is power disjoined from justice , and therefore the essential or the distinctive principle of despotism . Every government which is n government of mere will is despotic , and incompatible with freedom , whether the will be that of the king , of the nobility , or of the democracy ; of the minority , or of the majority . Strange as it may seem , there is not the least conceivable difference in principle between Russian autocracy , or oriental despotism , and the pure absolute democracy which is just now the fashion in Italy , in France , in parts of Germany , and , we are sorry to add , in our own country . In each the sovereign authority is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what is to be regarded as law , is the expression of mere arbitrary will . Practically , we should prefer the Russian or oriental despotism to that which our fashionable democrats are laboring to establish here , both in the several States and in the nation , and which the National Assembly have done their best , in the ridiculous constitution they have first promulgated , to fasten upon France ; for we would much rather be subject to a single despot , than to a mob of despots . In consequence of mistaking the real character of our government , of overlooking the fact that what its framers most sedulously guarded against was that of making it , or having it to become , a government of mere will , and of seeking to naturalize amongst us a wild and destructive democracy imported from abroad , from the Radicals of Europe , most of whom are born despots , and have not the least imaginable conception either of the nation , or of the constitution of true liberty , our democratic politicians have created , or suffered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already hinders the regular working of our political system , and threatens , at no distant day , if not soon corrected , its very existence . The separation of the constituent bod ies into Kings , Lords and Commons , adopted in England , we have not adopted , and could not have adopted , if we had wished , because there was nothing in our society which rendered it either necessary or practicable . We had no King and no Lords ; for , as Mr. Bancroft has well remarked , royalty and nobility did not emigrate . Only the third estate emigrated . Of the three estates represented in the English government , we had only one , the Commons , and , of course , could not represent what we had not . Having but one estate , we necessarily approached nearer to centralism in representation than the English , and their Constitution has an advantage over ours . Nevertheless , in consequence of the division of the country into separate States , we have in some degree been able to escape centralism in the Constitntion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some extent , though not as far as we mio'ht and ought to have done , in the several States , by dividing the representatives into two chambers , each with a different electoral basis . But in regard to the separation of the powers of government into legislative , executive , and judiciary departments , we have in the general government , and in most of the State governments , conformed to the English model . This separation of the powers of government into distinct and mutually independent departments , by which we escape the worst form of centralism , is fundamental in our political system , and to change it would destroy the essential character of the system itself , and , by centralizing all the powers of government in one and the same department , would render freedom wholly impracticable . To the maintenance of this separation , and of each department in its independence , the executive veto is indispensable , as every statesman-we say not every politicianmust readily perceive and admit . It was given by the Constitution mainly , though not exclusively , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative encroachments . Without it , there would be no independent , no efficient , and no responsible Executive . All the powers of government would be absorbed by Congress , and the President would cease 1849. // to be the President of the United States , responsible to the public for his acts , and become merely an officer of Congress , with no functions but to execute blindly its mandates . The balance intended between the several powers could not be preserved , and the government would , in principle , and very soon in practice , degenerate into a parliamentary despotism , like that of the Long Parliament in England , that of the Convention in France , and that which the latest French Constitution contemplates , and will secure , if it lasts , without essential alterations . We are as strongly opposed to the " one-man power as any of our contemporaries , and as anxious to guard against every tendency towards monarchy as any body can be ; but there is no less to be apprehended from legislative than executive encroachment . Perhaps under our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent than any other , and executive usurpations themselves are chiefly stimulated by them . Against legislative usurpations the people are seldom on their guard ; they are always usurpations which receive the support of the majority , and opposition to them is never raised , except from the minority . Experience proves that legislative bodies always seek to absorb in themselves all the powers of government . The failure of the French , during sixty years of experimenting , to establish a free and stable government has been due to their mad attempts to concentrate all the powers of government in the legislature ; to their blind confidence in the wisdom and integrity of legislators , and their insane distrust of an efficient executive . In all their efforts we see them aiming to make the legislature omnipotent , and the executive a nullity . Aside from his patronage and means , through that of exerting an indirect and corrupting influence , the present executive of France has as little power as a Virginia governor . No government can be stable or efficient without a strong and independent executive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great curse , alike impotent to do good or to prevent evil . An administration that wants power to protect itself , that trembles every moment for its own existence , that has no discretion , no responsibility , is as mischiev ous as it is contemptible ; for its resort is always to low cunning , to corruption . The history of the English Parliament proves to a moral demonstration the tendency of all legislative bodies , and the most serious danger to which the English constitution is now exposed is from the omnipotence of the legislature . The executive lies even now at the mercy of Parliament , and were it not for its patronage and means of influence , by appeals to interest , cupidity , the love of place and emolument , it would have scarcely the shadow of power . Of all despotisms , the legislative is the most intolerable , when the legislature is the tool of an odious oligarchy . So deeply impressed were the Convention of 1 *7 87 with the tendency of legislative bodies to absorb all the powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive even an absolute regulation over all the acts of Congress ; and some , fearing lest the Executive might want the firmness to interpose its negative as often as might be necessary , were for strengthening and encouraging it , by joining with it in a council of revision the Supreme Judges themselves . Though it be well they did not , their proposition to do so is *t least instructive , by showing how much the Convention distrusted legislative bodies , and how much importance they attached to the veto power , as enabling the President to maintain his independence and respectability , and save himself from becoming the mere tool of Congress , no subsequent experience proves them to have judged hastily or unwisely . We need no argument to prove the importance of maintaining the independence and respectability of the Executive . If he should cease to be independent , if his functions should be reduced from those of President of the United States to those of a mere executive officer of Congress , he would feel himself relieved of all responsibility of government ; he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain a xvise and efficient administration ; but would throw all icsponsibility upon Congress , and either enjoy his ease as a rol faineant , or exert all his craft , cunning , and opportuniti6s to abuse power to his own purposes . And how without the veto power he is to mainAug. // tam his independence , and Congress to be prevented from assuming to itself both the legislative and the executive or administrative powers of government , is more than we are able to comprehend . But the executive veto is necessary , not only to prevent the centralization of the powers of government , and to preserve the independence and respectability of the executive department , but also as a check on hasty and unjust legislation . There is , perhaps , far more need of such a check than the mass of our people now-a-days suspect ; at least , the framers of the Constitution believed it to be highly necessary . rfhey were , in the modern sense , no democrats , and had not the slightest tendency to radicalism . They were practical statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to establish a wise , strong , and durable government , which in its practical operations should secure the blessings of union , liberty , and internal peace-maintain justice , and promote the common weal . They held in horror all absolute governments , whether royal , noble , or popular ; and , aware that power , in whatever hands it is lodged , may be abused , if there is an opportunity to abuse it , they sought to guard against the tyranny of the sovereign , at the same time that they secured the obedience of the subject . They had not learned to reject all the lessons of experience , and were far from accepting the doctrine of the impeccability of man , or of the divinity of the people . They believed that the people could err and do wrong , as well as kings and nobles , in their collective as well as in their individual capacity , and that tyranny and oppression are tyranny and oppression when proceeding from a popular , no less than when proceeding from a royal or noble source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfledged politicians of the day , that majorities can err and oppress , as well as minorities , and that although the rule that the majority must govern is adopted , it is necessary to subject the majority to such restraints , that to be able to govern at all , it must govern justly . Here we may see their practical wisdom . They did not seek merely to enable the majority to govern , or to organize the government so that no will but the will of the majority should ever prevail , but they went further , and sought to establish limits to that will itself . A government in which the will of the majority is unlimited , in which it can always prevail , is just as much an absolute government , and just as despotic in principle , as the most absolute monarchy that ever existed . There is under it no guaranty of the liberty of the subject in the face of power  --  the essential element in all free governments . Modern democrats are aware of this , and seek to blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the majority is the will of the people , and that the people are always just , and never will abuse their power . But we might as well say that the absolute monarch is always just , and will never abuse his power . If it comes to deifying , we may as well deify the king as the people . Experience no more proves that the people can do no wrong , than it does that the king can do no wrong . There is never any guaranty for liberty , where there is nothing that limits or restrains the exercise of arbitrary will , or sets bounds to the sovereign power ; and even if the people were not themselves capable of abusing their power , we know perfectly well that demagogues can usurp and abuse it for them . 1'he Convention properly understood this , and throughout , they were as anxious to provide for a limitation of authority as they were to provide for the supremacy of the law itself ; for governing , ( if we may so speak , ) the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must govern , directly or indirectly ; but it must govern only under certain conditions , according to certain rules , and within certain bounds . But the convention did not consider it enough to mark these bounds , and to prescribe those rules and conditions on paper . " Experience , " said Mr. Madison , " has taught us a distrust of that security , and that it is necessary to introduce such a balance of powers and interests as will guarantee the provisions on paper . " * Paper constitutions are mere cobwebs , unless the organization of powers under them is such as to render it impossible for any power to violate them . Power will be sure to violate them , if able , whenever it * MaiLon Parers , p 1107 . A*49. // has a sufficient motive to do so . If power is lodged in the majority , impose on it what paper restraints you please , you are no better off than if you had no constitution at all , unless you have somewhere in the state a force that guaranties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Convention , therefore , which drafted the Constitution on parchment , took care to establish it in the effectual organization of the several powers of government . The separation of the powers of government into distinct departments , each provided with means of self-defense , the separation of the legislature into two houses , the peculiar constitution of the Senate , the senatorial term for the long period of six years , and the necessity of the concurrent vote of both houses to an act of Congress , were all designed to operate as so many checks on the will of the majority , and to prevent , by restraining its action , hasty and unjust legislation . It was not enough to write on paper that Congress shall pass no laws hastily , or without a due ryard to justice ; it was necessary to go farther , and to subject the enacting of laws to such conditions , to so many forms and processes , that it would be difficult , if not impossible , to get a law hastily enacted , or enacted at all , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system of checks on the will of the majority , of restraints imposed on the exercise of sovereign power , which the Convention saw proper to establish . The Convention installed the majority as sovereign , but as a limited , not as an absolute sovereign ; and the exec*ative veto is an integral part of the limitation which they imposed . They wished to make legislation not easy , but difficult ; and were far more anxious that the laws should be wise and just , than that they should be numerous . Their study was to subject every measure to the most rigid scrutiny , and to render it impossible for any measure to become a law till after it had been thoroughly sifted , and had received the approbation of the best minds and the highest wisdom of the country . To this end they required for the enactment of a law the concurrence of all the branches of the government . They gave to each house a negative on the other , and to the executive and judiciary departments each a negative-at least a qualified or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its purpose as far as it goes ; but it is insufficient , because the judiciary can not take cognizance of the policy of a measure , and can interpose its negative only on the ground that the measure is unconstitutional . The system of checks would , therefore , have been incomplete , without the executive veto , which can negative an act not only for its unconstitutionality , but also for its impolicy . That the system of checks established is too effectual , that it has rendered legislation too difficult , no statesman can pretend . Our danger lies , as experience amply proves , in too much legislation - not in too little . The tendency to over-legislate is quite too strong , and We make quite too little of wise and efficient administration . Nothing more distinguishes modern times from antiquity , than our excessive legislation , and our tendency to make legislating , instead of administrating , the chief business of government . The facility with which old laws are repealed or modified , and new statutes are enacted , and not in our country only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , men of stronger nerves than we may well tremble to think . The utmost contempt for law , and the wildest disorder would prevail even now , if it did not happen that our courts preserve the common law , the lex non scripla , which , happily for us , serves as a public conscience , and regulates the greater part of the relations between man and man . If the party among us opposed to the common law should succeed in abolishing it , and in reducing the entire law of the land to the icr scripla , or statute law , we should find ourselves as ill off as if we had no law at all . No man could tell for six months what the law would be . We scarcely , in the State or the nation , enact a law before we modify or repeal it , especially if it is a law likely to prove of some utility in its practical operation . We have no settled policy ; we are disputing about the simplest elements of both civil and criminal law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would throw everything into confasion , if the courts did not now and then go the full length of their prerogative in inter-118 Aug. // preting them , so as to get an innocent meaning when the legislature had either no meaning , or a meaning subversive of all the legitimate ends of legislation . Surely , no statesman , especially no lawyer worthy of the name , can wish for greater facility of legislation than we now have , or regard the actual Constitutioa as rendering it too difficult . It is strange , we remark by the way , that at this late period of the world 's history , this rage for legislating should so prevail , and entire communities should act as if law had now for the first time to be created . Has nothing been settled , and have we existed as a civilized people for these two hundied years without law , or without law adequate to the wants of a free and thriviag people ? Do we need to be told that law , as a science , was projected even centuries before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt it to what there may be novel or peculiar in our condition and circumstances are very few ? Can we answer how many of the evils we are compelled to suffer , spring from the rejection of old law science , and from experimenting in legislation as if we had the whole science to build up anew ? Do we need to be told that our foolish legislative experiments are the principal cause of the constant convulsions of our business world , and that had it not bQen for the youth and vigor of our community , our experimental legislation would long ere this , by the in security to property it causes , and the frequency with which it makes it pass from its owners to others , have proved our total ruin ? Surely , if we trace the history of our legislation for the last twenty years , we shall not doubt that checks on sovereign power are needed , and all the checks , and more than all the checks which the Constitution provides . The Convention felt that there would be a tendency to hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has proved to be stronger even than they apprehended . They had no great confidence in majorities , but they did not foresee how majorities would be manufactured , nor anticipate the introduction of that perfect party discipline and party machinery which have since been introduced , and which render the people either a nullity , or the blind tools of irresponsible party managers . This discipline and machinery , when adopted by one party , has to be adopted by the other in self-defense , and . we have now arrived at the point when all the affairs of government are managed by party ; and a power , through party , unknown to the Constitution , is installed as sovereign . This power is vested nobody can say where or precisely in whom ; it is wielded by no public law , by no responsible chiefs , and though all-controlling , you can nowhere lay your finger on it . It is at once the slave and the master of everybody . rihis power , acting without public recognition , with out public responsibility , dictates the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The officers when chosen find themselves subject to it , hemmed in by it ; obliged , they can hardly tell why or wherefore , to obey it ; and having no employment for their own judgments , they give themselves up to it , and merge their own responsibility in its irresponsibleness , and never trouble themsives to ascertain whether what they do is for the good of the country or not ; it is enough for them that it receives the sanction of their party . The consequence is , that in our acts of government we do not get an expression of the popular reason , nor of the personal convictions or conscientious judgments of even the men who are nominally clothed with authority ; we get only the wishes or interests of party , or rather of the unnamable and irresponsible managers of party one-sided and selfish , and rarely compatible with the interests of the country at large . Nothing is or can be more important , then , than an organization of restraints which render legislation difficult , and prevent the posses*.ors of power from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruinous to the country . You have some moral value of a man as long as there is nothing between , him and the public , as long as he feels .. that he must answer directly to the public for his acts ; but when a party stands between him and the public , and his reliance is on his party and not on his country , you have none at all . If he does the will of his party , that will uphold him , and vindicate his acts ; and that is all that his interests or his reputa * . S4*9. * 119 // tion require ; consequently , the more predominant the partyism , the more necessary are the constitutional checks on power . It is true that the very reasons which render the Executive veto the more necessary , tend also to render it less adequate because the same doctrine of party operates on the executive with hardly less force than on the members of Congress themselves , and tends to withhold the President from employing it against a favorite measure of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not an objection to the veto power in itself considered . It is an objection only to its sufficiency , and proves , not that is injurious , hut that it does not do all the good or prevent all the mischief it should . The Executive that refuses to employ it when he constitutionally ought , is as an Executive that has it not ; and his refusing to employ it when its employment is demanded , is , as far as it goes , an argument for it , not against it . This evil which we admit , will , no doubt , subsist , as lone as parties continue their present policy of selecting as candidates for chief magistracy of the Republic , not their greatest and best menmen well known to be fully qualified for the office , and able to stand of themselves without being held up by party discipline ond machinery  --  but their most available men-men who will run the best , because they carry the least weight . This is a bad policy , even for the party itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , necessary to avoid the greater evil . When one party adopts it , such is the fickleness , short-sightedness , and silliness of the mass of every party , that the other is often obliged to do the same . But the consequence is always bad . The Executive wants self-reliance ; conscious of his own inexpefonce , perhaps of his own inability to discharge properly the duties of his high office , he is afraid to act independently , from his own convictions , on his own responsibility , and therefore throws himself back on his party , merges i*is individuality in it , yields bbndly to its dictation , and throws upon it the entire responsibility of his acts , which it must assume , or else go out of power , an.d let the opposition come in . The*consequonce is that he surrenders his independence to his party . in Qongress , and , if that party is in the majority in both houses , brings about that amalgamation of the executive and legislative functions of government , which the Convention hoped by means of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedied only when we have an executive who adopts and acts on the sound principles proclaimed by our present worthy chief magistrate in his letters before his election , and in his noble inaugural address . But it is not easy in the present state of public opinion to act on those high and independent principles , and will not be , till the public mind , by means of the press , sIx 11 be brought more into harmony with those great conservative principles of government , which have been so generally neglected for the last twenty years , but without which our liberties exist only in name , and wise and just government is but a dream . It may be objected to the veto power , that it is seldom likely to be employed , except against such measures as secure a majority in Congress only by a union of some members of the party to which the Executive belongs with the opposition , and which , since they combine , in some degree , the support of both parties , are the least likely to be hasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be employed when it should be , and will be when it should not . Experience does not fully bear out this objection , but we grant that it has some force . In several instances the veto has been applied in the manner here supposed , and it is this fact that has led some of our Whig friends , contrary , as we must believe , to their general principles , to propose its abolition or modification . But we are Conservatives , and we are loath to lay a rude he nd on the Constitution . Experiments in amending constitutions , St e or national , have not thus far proved very successful , and , in general , we find the amended constitution more in need of amendment than the original constitution itself . In almost every instance that has come under our knowledge , the so-called amendments adopted have proved a serious injury to the Constitution-have impaired its symmetry , rendered it less efficient , and made new alterations necessary ; besides wakening in the public conscience that sacredness which should always attach to the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design or intent of the Constitution , or clauses originally good , but rendered injurious by social changes or revolutions which have subsequently occurred , we would , of course , have removed ; but beyond that , we believe it never prudent to venture . Nothing is more unwise or unstatesmanlike than to alter a constitution , for the sake of harmonizing it with changes which may have taken place in mere public opinion , or of conforming it to the demands of some newly invented or newly revived political theory . No constitution , constructed in accordance with a political theory , ever worked or ever did work well , for the simple reason that every theory is despotic , and no man , much less the mass of men , ever did or ever will act throughout life in accordance with a theory . Every man 's life is full of anomalies ; and it is far more with the anomalies in life and society , than with the normal , or what comes within the rule , that government must deal . A constitution that preserves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Governments are founded in practical reason , not in speculative reason ; and good sense , aided by large experience , must determine their constitution , not speculation . The English , who have much good sense , but very little speculative genius , and who care little for systematic consistency , maintain a comparatively free government . The French and Germans , who are far their superiors in speculative science , and who draw out constitutions perfectly satisfactory to speculative reason , forever alternate in practice between anarchy and despotism . No constitution will avert all evil , and wisdom requires us to submit to many evils ; for what works evil to-day may work good to-morrow . By attempting to remove the evils which we occasionally suffer , we not seldom lose the good we are in possession of , and open the door to greater evils from which we are as yet free . The exercise of his negative is , on the part of the Executive , an act of great personal responsibility . The easiest way for him is to throw the responsibility on Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do otherwise . If he does otherwise , it must be either from a sense of duty , or for the hope of gaining public applause or support . It should be borne in mind that the veto power is purely negative ; that when constitutionally employed , it gives to the Executive no positive power of legislation , enables him to fasten no objectionable policy on the country , but merely arms him with a conservative power to preserve to some extent laws already in force , and to prevent or delay the adoption of new measures and of a new line of policy . It is a power perfectly in accordance with the principles of our government , and is repugnant to radical but not to Whig doctrines . Opposition to it could come consistently enough from the democratic party ; but from the Whig party , it strikes us , not without some inconsistency . True , it has been used to defeat favorite measures of the Whig party , but it is no Whig doctrine to seek to carry measures in spite of the Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are sworn to the Constitution for " better or for worse , and we *trust we are prepared to forego every public good not to be attained under it , and in accordance with its provisions . It is said by some that the executive veto can not be legitimately employed except on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the measure negatived . This we apprehend is a mistake , no restriction of this sort , or of any sort , is to be found in the Constitution itself. * * " Every hill which shall have passed the House of Representatives*and the Senate , shall , before it becomes a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approves , he shall sign it , but if not , he shall return it , with his objections , to that house in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such consideration two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill , it shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other house , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by- two thirds of that house , it shall become a law . ' - " If any bill shall not he returned by the President within ten days , ( Sundays excepted , ) after it shall have been presented to him , the // acts of Congress , and nothing is said as to the grounds on which it is to be applied . The Executive is left sole arbiter of his reasons for applying his negative , only he is to communicate them to Congress . Congress may judge of their sufficiency , and if by a majority of two-thirds they judge them insufficient , they count for nothing , and the measure becomes a law in spite of them . It is clear from the debates of the Convention , that the Convention did not intend to restrict the power to the simple constitutionality of the acts of Congress ; that power is in the judiciary , and the executive veto , if so restricted , would be superfluous . The Convention believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless would tend to impair the independence of the Executive , or would be impolitic or unjust , and it was to provide a negative on such acts which the judiciary could not reach , that they gave the Executive same shall be a law , in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . " - C'onst. of tile U S. , Art . I* Sec. 7 . " All legislative powers hereingranted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . " - Gomst. of U. S. , Art . 1 See . 1 . The object of this provision of the Constitution appears clearly in the form of the executive oath , " I do solemnly swear , " &amp;c. " that I will , " &amp;c. " preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . " In the above essay the careless or prejudiced reader may perhaps seem , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend the employment of the veto power , as it has been freely employed during the last twenty years , for private or party purposes . Nothing , however , could be farther from the design of the author , than to admit so loose a construction of the Constitution . *tX*e conceive the veto power , like the separate powers of the two houses of Congress , to be conferred upon the Executive as a means of selfpreservation and defense , as a means of preventing direct violations of the Constitution , and as a check upon the violence and impetuosity , the socalled " hasty legislation " of an excited legislature . Under circumstances of peculiar excitement , when parties are equally divided , a most iniquitons measure might become a law , were it not for the conservative barrier erected against it in the presidential veto . We therefore regard the veto as our defender against the great mischiefs that may happen from the hasty and illconsidered action of a small and virulent majority . - Ed. his qualified negative . Other objections than the mere unconstitutionality of acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects for the Executive to consider ; and , since to confine him to the simple question of constitutionality would deprive him of the power to maintain the independence of the executive department of government , we must hold that he not only is not , but ought not , to be so confined in the employment of his negative . Our readers will perceive that we have given ourselves a considerable latitude of discussion . Our object has , indeed , been to defend the veto power , but at the same time to draw attention to those general principles of our Constituion and government which in the democratic excitement of the times , and the bustle and confusion created by party struggles , we are in danger of forgetting . We have wished to point out the place of the executive veto in our plan of government , and incidentally to lay open and defend that plan itself . The writer of this is no political theorist , he is an American , and an American conservative both from principle and from inclination , and is opposed alike to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experimental legislation which has become so much the rage . He believes that the Constitution is too little studied , and that the real character of our institutions is too little understood and appreciated . If what he has said shall excite any of our gifted and learned young men to a more diligent study of the American constitution , his purpose will have been answered , and he will not have written in vain . NOTE BY THE EnITou. - The doctrine in regard to the veto poweP* hitherto maintained by the Review , has been , that that power should never be employed excepting in cases of extreme emcr5 , ency , when the action of Congress has been either clearly unconstitutional , the executive oath in such cases demandino an employment of the veto power , or when the President may be compelled to employ it for the defense of his own prerogative , or the prerogative of other branches of the government . The Whig opposition to the too frequent employment of the veto power , is founded , not so much upon a general apprehension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pledge to use it without scruple for the ends of his own party , would effectually check all legislation during the term of his continuance in office , and so defeat the most salutary measures , passed by large and constant majorities , and evidently necessary for the defense and welfare of the country , but odious to the minority merely because they emanated from the opposition . If the Constitution intended to concentrate in the President the three functions of judicial , legislative , and executive authority , then it also intended that the veto power should be employed by the President as a means of controlling the entire legislation of the country . By simply announcing that he will veto every public measure originating with the majority , the President is able to throw the entire legislative power of the nation into the hands of his friends in the minority  --  a condition of things which , in this country , would end in a civil war . An unscrupulous President is able , by the use of his patronage , by threats , and by personal influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the height of his unpopularity . The means of doing this are almost always at his disposal . Our author has shown that this government is constitutionally so adjusted as to favor the majority , and to throw the weight of power into the hands of the greater number . It will not be denied by either party that in general it is right for a well-ascertained and constant majority to have the greatest weight in leuislation ; but to admit at the same time that the President may constitutionally exercise his veto power as a steady and constant stumbling-block to a fair majority in both houses of Congress , is to admit a power totally subversive of the ends of government , and hostile to the spirit of a republican constitution . The Whigs , there fore , have elected a President pledged , not to carry their measures against a natural majority , but pledged only not to interpose his negative against a clear and constant majority in Congress . It is the doc trine of the Whigs , that the President is not invested with a judicial or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less he meddles in legislation the better . If we look merely at the letter , there is , indeed , nothing written in the Constitution which directly forbids the constant partisan employment of the executive veto ; but in this , as in other instances , we are obliged to study , not merely the letter , but the spirit of that document . It would have been impossible to trace the exact limits within which the veto should be employed . In all governments the employment of such a power must be left in great part to discretion , and its use be regulated by the custom of ages . Custom and usage have limited the employment of the negative of the crown in England upon acts of Parliament . The election of Whig Presidents will in the same manner fix and limit the veto power , with the sanction of public opinion in America . The entire argument is but one of many which go together to convince us that the safety and dignity of the nation depends in great measure upon the election to the executive office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington , the executive branch of the federal government , great as was its influence , never overstepped its lawful limits . So far was Washington from improperly interfering with the action of the co-ordinate branches of government , that , for example , while Congress was engaged in discussing the measures of the proposed system of finance , he strictly abstained from any expression of opinion respecting them . Wherever precedents may be found for buying congressional votes with executive promises , or making ' the support of executive measures by legislators the ground for rewarding them with lucrative and honorable offices , or for bringing any sort of illegitimate influence into the halls of legislation , the first President , no less pure in mind than firm in authority , set none of them.
