txt WE take pleasure in resuming , in a second article , the review of the interesting subject referred to in the above title , which in a former Number* was interrupted by the exhaustion of the limits of space then at our command for the purpose . The chief merit of this , as it must be of every code , is that it rejects altogether a reference to what is known as the Common Law . We can not conceive a system , making pretensions to rational principles , having anything to do with that absurd jumble of arbitrary rules - as much at war with the common sense of men , as it is with the common dictates of justice - which is recognised as authoritative by the courts of the United States . It has been extolled , by its admirers , as the perfection of human reason ; but to us it seems more like a negation of reason . How it has so long retained its ascendency in the jurisprudence of civilized nations is , we confess , an occasion of wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its teachers , and the grossest inertness on the part of the people , could have enabled it to endure to so venerable an old age . Present it to an enlightened inhabitant of the Sandwich Islands , could he be made to comprehend its scope and meaning , and could he be instructed as to the social condition of the nations where it is recognised , he would be struck with astonishment , either at our stupidity or our slavishness . He would point to its uncertainty , to its abstruseness , to its // inconsistencies , its fictions , its paltry details , and its general want of justice , as things which barbarians would hesitate to submit to , much less adopt , and of which a civilized people should be ashamed . This , we are aware , is strong language ; but not too strong for truth , nor incapable , as we may sometime show , of the clearest demonstration . It is to be regretted that the wise men who engaged in the glorious task of severing the political ties that subsisted between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried their notions of emancipation to a bolder height . In stopping where they did , though they accomplished a great work , it was not all the work that was to be done . They should have declared their independence , not only of the government , but of the laws of the mother.country . In consenting to adopt the Common Law as the rule of their civil existence , they brought upon themselves a vast and complicated system , which every year would render more cumbersome and intricate , and demonstrate its utter want of congeniality with the institutions they were about to establish , and the popular spirit and manners destined to grow up under their influence . Had they framed a simpler system , - had they selected from the laws to which they had been accustomed such as were most reasonable in themselves , and best adapted to their wants , - and had these been arranged in proper order and form , the nation they redeemed would have become as conspicuous for the beauty and justice of its legal code as it now is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was not too much to expect from the time , and we must lament that so just a reform should have been neglected . It is still a neglect for which many reasons may be assigned . The most important of these is to be found in the fact , that legal abuses , though vastly oppres4ve in the aggregate , yet , falling upon a few only , and in circumstances not commonly spread before the public mind , fail to fasten that deep interest which is requisite to the overthrow of an ancient error . Legal reforms , as other reforms , must spring from the bosom of the people ; and as , at the time when the English jurisprudence was engrafted upon the institutions of the new world , many of its maxims and principles had wound themselves around the hearts of a large portion of the American people , partly from education and partly from habit , while there was no other source to which they could look for a legal system more enlightened and just , it was by means of the combined operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not then framed and promulgated . Weightier evils hung upon their free action and absorbed their thoughts . Delibe // rate and violent invasions of the plainest rights of mind and conscience left them little time for the calm consideration of a remedy for the occult and mysterious despotism of antiquated laws . And thus the oppressions of its requirements have been left to accumulate to the present day . It is true , great reforms have been introduced in many of its parts ; but , great as they are , they are only partial and incomplete . Branches have here and there been lopped off , but the trunk still stands . The fountain has not been stayed , in the midst of all the changes that have been made , in closing the channels of the smaller streams , and directing the course of the tributaries . The primal , vital , radical error , - the source of all its other errors , - the resort to an unwritten law , and the recognition of the force of constructions and decisions by judiciary bodies , still exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy , that so long as this defect does exist , we hope in vain for a collection of wise , harmonious , and just rules . In other words , while the Common Law is acknowledged as an authority in our courts , law must fail of attaining the rank and consistency of a science . " Science , " says Sir John Herschel , " is the knowledge of a few , methodically adjusted and arranged so as to become attainable by all . " Law is the knowledge of a few - of a very few - so irreconcilable in its principles and so immethodically dispersed , that it can never come into the possession of onethousandth part of those for whose civil conduct it is intended to be the guide . A brief glance at its character will furnish evidence enough of this assertion . What is the Common Law l Its most distinguished and eloquent expounder , Sir William Blackstone , says it is the " unwritten law of England ; " consisting of " general customs , " " particular customs , " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed only in certain courts and jurisdictions . " Custom , it will be seen , is the single and entire foundation of the whole structure . For we are told by the same writer , that its authority rests solely " upon general reception and usage , " and that the only method of proving whether this or that rule or maxim is a part of the Common Law , is " by showing that it hath been always the custom to observe it . " If it be asked , how the validity of these customs is to be determined , the same teacher answers , " by the judges in the several courts of justice . " " They , " he continues , " are the depositories of the laws , the living oracles who must decide in all cases of doubt , and who are bound by an oath to decide according to the law of the land . " But that law of the land , requires , says one of the best authorities , Fortescue , // viginti annorum lucubrationes , even on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , adds Mr. Livingston , " no man ever did or ever can understand , for the plain reason , that in many instances , it does not exist until the case arises that calls for its application , when it is pronounced , not by the legislative authorities , but by one of these living oracles . " A doetrine involving the solecism that that which is this moment created , has had an immemorial existence . But supposing these unwritten customs to include every variety of case that is likely to arise or that can be conceived , how are the judges to proceed in ascertaining what those customs are ' ! Blackstone tells us , by the study of " those judicial decisions which are the principal and authoritative evidence . " These are to be found , scattered over the pages of an immense number of reports , often , as it is admitted , hastily and inaccurately prepared , crude and imperfect in their execution , and sometimes , through the mistakes or want of skill of the reporter , inconsistent with themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring suspicion over the whole science ; but the difficulties do not stop with this . Is it possible for a single man , within the compass of time ordinarily allotted to an individual , to make a careful comparison of the innumerable and heterogeneous doctrines dispersed in these " deserts of print 1 " If we might be permitted to frame an answer from the cost , the extent , and the repulsive style of the volumes , we should say , no ! It is certain , at least , that a large portion of the legal profession , and all of those among the people who can not give their whole time to the pursuit , must satisfy themselves with the incomplete and scanty knowledge furnished by digests and abridgments . A note in Kent 's Commentaries , computes the reports which are necessary to a well-furnished legal library , at 364* volumes , exclusive of Admiralty , Irish reports , &amp;c. , to which are to be added , 33 volumes of digested indices , 184* volumes of text-books and treatises , 67 volumes of abridgments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . This vast accumulation of learning , then , is what Blackstone regards as the " principal evidences " of the law . Nay , he calls them " authoritative ; " but in what sense are they authoritative ' ! Are they obligatory on future judges ' ! Blackstone answers , it is the " established rule to abide by former precedents , " yet he himself enumerates several exceptions . When a decision is contrary to reason , if it be clearly contrary to divine law , even if it be flatly absurd and unjust , it is not law . But accomplished commentators object to his exceptions , and it is still a mooted question in // the courts , how far the doctrine of stare decisis is legitimate . It has been argued , time and again , but never with any satisfactory result . No matter how clearly the one side or the other may have been illustrated and enforced by one judge , another is soon found to review his reasonings and disturb his decisions . Even those who have been most strict in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most ready to disobey its injunctions . Lord Mansfield , who stated the certainty of a rule to be more important than the reason of it , is yet said to have made " more innovations and improvements of law , and felt himself less embarrassed with the disposition of the elder cases , when they came in his way , to impede the operation of his enlightened and cultivated judgment , than any other English judge . " His successor , Lord Kenyon , acted like a Roman Dictator , appointed to recall and reinvigorate the ancient discipline . He controlled or overruled several important decisions of Lord Mansfield , as danger . ous innovations , and on the ground that they had departed from the precedent of former times. * One thousand or more cases are to be found in the books which have been overruled or doubted , and , as society advances , this number must be incessantly increased . Yet , this indigestible and heterogeneous heap of legal authorities is held up to us , as containing " the most certain evidence , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common Law . " Is it to be wondered at , that the Common Law should have been made a by-word among men who have boldness enough to emancipate their minds from the despotism it exerts over popular opinion * Need we marvel at the complaints so frequently urged of its prolixity , incertitude , and expense * And how could it be otherwise than inefficient in its influences , so long as it remains so questionable in its principles , and so awkward and cumbersome in its machinery * Its inconvenience to every class of citizens is indescribably provoking . The legislator and the judge , as well as the great body of people upon whom it is intended to operate , are alike subjected by it to incessant vexation and trouble . Expressed in language carelessly defined , or equivocally arranged , abounding in obsolete and technical terms , difficult to be understood , referring to usages that have long since expired , or dependent upon fictions which are absurd , imperfect in designating what acts are offences , contradictory or negligent in assigning their penalties , often unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and disgusts a liberal or refined habit of sentiment . Kent 's Corn. , 477. // If we consider the nature of penal law , the absurdity of much of the existing arrangement becomes more striking . It is a rule , prescribed by the supreme power of a state , to guide men in the performance of their civil duties , to prescribe their rights , and pronounce the penalties of civil offences . The single principle upon which it is founded is the prevention of crime . In proportion as this object is the most immediately , simply , and efficiently attained is the degree of its perfection . It is obviously of the first importance that all offences should be clearly and accurately stated , that punishment should be nicely adjusted to the greater or less turpitude of the offence , that the mode of procedure in detecting guilt , in assigning to each party in a common infringement the exact proportion of his criminality , and in fixing the functions of executive officers , should be pointed out in plain , simple , and uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigidly worded , and universally promulgated . Or , as it has been well expressed in a resolution of the Assembly of Louisiana , the design of a body of criminal law , is to collect , in a written form , " all the rules which it may be necessary to establish , for the protection of the government of the country , and the persons , prop . erty , condition , and reputations of individuals ; the penalties attached to a breach of those rules ; the legal means of preventing offences and the legal means of prosecuting them when committed ; the rules of evidence by which the truth of accusations are to be tested ; and the duties of executive and judicial officers , jurors , and individuals ; to the end that no one need be ignorant of any branch of criminal jurisprudence which it concerns all to know . " No method is more admirably adapted to bring about these objects , than that of collecting the laws into a written and well-digested code . If it is intended that they should exert the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known and administered . rf o be known they must be written in a compendious form , and to be administered they must be comprehended . A code proposes to enumerate , in a brief yet comprehensive form , the most important general principles upon which its provisions are founded ; it determines with the completest accuracy every act of men which is to be either specially allowed or prohibited ; it aniiexes to every act that is prohibited its appropriate and condign punishment ; it prescribes a method for ascertaining when and by whom its requirements have been violated ; all its rules are arranged under independent heads ; all irrelevant matter is rigidly excluded ; all pertinent matter is methodically classified and connected ; the parts complete in themselves , mutually explain each other : // while the most ample provisions are made for discovering and remedying defects , and for the modification and improvement of those points which are imperfect , through ignorance or neglect , or which experience and progress demonstrate as wanting emendation or reform . If , in the first draught of it , anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily supplied ; if there be anything superfluous , it can be lopped off ; and if there be anything partly good and partly bad , the one may be retained while the other is rescinded . Does a new case arise , requiring the application of a new principle , let it be , through the designated agency , subjoined . But does a case arise , in which the application of an old principle is unjust , there are means instituted for escaping from its arbitrary and despotic operation . Mr. Livingston perceived the benefits and freely illustrated the working of this principle . He has incorporated into the Code of Evidence provisions for what may be called perpetual revision . They are found in two articles , the objects of which are to secure the advantages to be derived from the experience and wisdom of the judges in the suggestion of defects , while the remedy is reserved to the legislature . The first relates to any positive provision of the code which is found to operate improperly , either to the prejudice of the accused or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all omissions of rules that might be found of salutary operation in the discovery of truth or the establishment of justice . In this way , the flagrant evils of judicial construction are obviated . When the court , in the long course of it experience , discovers anything that is to be remedied , it must invite the concurrence of the legislature , who , after a full and impartial scrutiny , devise such remedies as the circumstances suggest . The legislative and judkial departments of government will then each be confined to its appropriate sphere , leaving to the one nothing to neglect , and to the other nothing to usurp . Provisions of this sort , says Livingston , " offer a complete answer to the objection that has been raised to a written code from its rigidity , or what has been called , by a celebrated jurisconsult , its want of malleability . " It can not , indeed , be worked into any shape , that the discretion of a judge , well or ill directed , may deem necessary ; but it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adapted to its wants as they arise , and this more effectually , more constitutionally , and equitably , than by the legislation of decrees ; more effectually because the sanction of positive law will not only give it a legitimate , instead of doubtful authority , but because , being promulgated as a law , it will be universally known ; being concise , it will be easily understood , and a knowledge of its provisions 02 // may be acquired without expense ; more constitutionally because it will emanate from the proper department of government ; and its superior equity must be apparent , when we consider that in one instance , the rule is made for and applied to an existing case , in the other it has no force until after its enactment and promulgation . In the pregnant language of Bentham , judge-made law , always and of necessity uncertain and variable , would be exchanged for legislature-made law which is precise and permanent . We are aware that many competent people object to the principle of codification , but we do not estimate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the subject or a needless and silly fear . All new things are received with caution and prejudice , and often the only objection to that which is new , is the simple fact that it is new , independently of its merit , and without regard to the necessity that may exist for its adoption . But such as these objections are , we propose briefly to answer them . We only ask a fair consideration of *vhatever may be advanced . 1 . First , then , of the objection , if objection it may be called , that a code of laws is new . If it be meant by this , that everything which is new is mischievous , it applies equally to every change in the existing order of things that can be conceived . It takes for granted that the human intellect has exhausted every topic of thought , and that nothing that may hereafter be struck out is worthy of a moment 's consideration by any wise man . It presupposes that society has already reached the state of ultimate perfection , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed . It proceeds upon the ground , that the human race came into the world in the maturity of its vigor and beauty , and that nothing in its condition is susceptible of improvement . For , if we admit the imperfect progress that has been made by the human mind , if we admit the existence of social evils , if we do not arrogate to our forerunners the possession of the highest wisdom , and the most consummate power , we admit that there are many things capable of being reformed , which reform , at the time it is started , is new , and therefore to be deprecated . Can anything be more absurd , or less worthy of a serious reply l The truth is , in regard to all new measures , the real question should be , not how long they may have been known , but what they promise to accomplish , and the means they possess of effecting the end . Should they be found reasonable in themselves , let them be adopted without delay ; but should they be pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , which may be clearly pointed out , and not because they are innovations . The fact that // an untried plan is an innovation is often the best reason why it should be regarded favorably . Christianity was once an innovation , and because the moral state of mankind was such as to entitle it to that name , the more imperative the necessity for its advent . The history of democracy is the history of a series of perpetual innovations , and until society shall have attained its completest development , the succession of changes by which democracy marks its progress , will be esteemed by the timid and time-serving every where as so many innovations . The loftiest hopes and aspirations of man are inseparably connected with the success of these much scouted but little understood innovations . ' They are the pioneers to all that is great and grand in human action , and the pledges of a glorious advancement for the future . 2 . But written codes , say some , may be very well in theory , but very bad in practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cowardly are accustomed to meet what they do not understand , or do not wish to realize ! It rests upon a confusion of terms , as well as a confusion of ideas . What is meant by saying that a thing may be very good in theory 1 If it means anything , it is that the measure is both rational in its objects , and in the means by which it proposes to accomplish them ; otherwise it is not good in theory , and the question of practicability may be left out of the discussion . Now , in this matter of a law reform , it is evident , that if it is good in theory it must be good in practice . If it is adapted to the end proposed - that is , if the principles it asserts are wise , just , and pertinent , suited to the people and the times for which they are intended , then it can not fail to be good in practice . But if it does not possess these characteristics , then it is bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . The fact of being bad in practice , is sufficient of itself to prove it bad in theory , - is indeed the very quality which makes it bad in theory . The objectors , therefore , must take another position , they must show it to be bad in theory , before they acquire the right of recording their condemnation . If , however , they mean , that written codes are found to work badly , the question becomes one of fact . Viewing it as such , then , we assert , that whenever written codes have been used , and to the extent they have been used , their practical working has shown their immeasurable superiority to every other form of law . It is true , our instances are few , bat yet sufficiently numerous to furnish the basis of a sound inference . The Louisiana Code of Procedure were alone adequate to establish the point . " An experiment in the occult sciences , " says Livingston , " is said to be most successfully made , when the desired effects have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same in legislation , and we may consider the favorable result as completely ascertained ; for an experiment has been thus made . It has succeeded in the most difficult branch ; succeeded under every disadvantage of imperfect execution , and in opposition to professional and national prejudices ; succeeded , too , so completely as to silence every objection to the measure itself , and leaving none but to some of the details which more mature revision may remove . " Or will any one be hardy enough to allege , that the Code of Napoleon , the code to which more than thirty millions of people have not looked for justice altogether in vain , for nearly half a century , is impracticable or inefficient l That code , as we may afterward show , is badly constructed in a material respect ; yet in spite of its defects , fulfils the functions of a supreme law much more simply , and quite as effectually , as the vaunted Common Law of England . Suitors acquire and maintain their rights , and the demands of public justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under it , are to be ascribed to those features in which it has departed from the strict idea of a code , and introduced the practices of the more ancient law . But not to multiply citations , there is one fact we hold as a complete answer to the charge we are combating . It is this , that all the modern attempts to improve the existing laws are only so many approaches to the formation of a code . The revised statutes , the abridgmeats , the digests , and the indices , that constitute so respectable a part of a legal library , are endeavors to give scattered and conflicting statutes , rules , and decisions , the precision , the conciseness , and the method of a written code . They are efforts to appropriate its form , if not its spirit , and need merely to be carried a little further to realize all that is contained in the great idea of codification . Thus , those who are loudest in their objection to written and organized bodies of law , are among the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of their advantages . In practice , they measurably confess a principle , which , in argument , they entirely oppose . 3 . If it be rejoined , that these are attempts to methodize laws that are already known and interwoven with the habits of society , while the introduction of a new system would be attended by great inconvenience and expense , we are ready to meet the argument on that issue . The inconvenience alluded to , we suppose , means the inconvenience of learning what the new laws are , and the expense of reducing them to practice . We acknowledge both the trouble and the cost ; but we reply , that the trouble and cost will be much less than what is involved in the labor , time , and money , // expended under the present system . We ask , in the first place , are the present laws known - known to the people , known even to the judges ' ! In the multiplicity of recorded decisions , can the most skilful jurisconsult always extract the truth ' ! Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , the means of ascertaining them , or the modes of prosecuting their violation ' ! Are the millions who are perpetually rising up to assume the responsibility of social relations , informed as to their duties , and can they be informed without mature study , or without feeing counsel I " It may safely be asserted , " says an eminent authority , " that less time will be required to obtain a perfect knowledge of any law that is reduced to writing , and framed with a tolerable attention to clearness and method , than would be necessary to learn that part of those which now govern us , which is unknown even to its professors . But should it be conceded that this supposition is unfounded , and that greater trouble would be required than is supposed to master the differences between an old and new system , for those who have studied the former , yet this can apply only to ourselves , to those who are now on the stage of public life . But those who are just about to take their places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates , magistrates , and officers , who are to replace them ! - the multitude even in the present day , who have not yet studied the present laws , but who are bound to obey them ! - the millions who are to follow them in the lapse of those ages which every good citizen must wish his country and its institutions to endure ! - is the curse of bad laws , and the odious and painful task of learning them , to be entailed on these for ever , to save ourselves the task of a few days or weeks mental application ' ! " Besides , it is not to be imagined that , in preparing a new system , no reference will be made to such laws as are already in existence . Whatever is good , to be found among them , whatever just and equitable principles , or whatever efficient and benign institutions they may have embraced , will be retained , only divested of the elements which have perverted their operation and diminished the amount of their beneficial effects . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rendered accessible . Its terms made intelligible and its parts methodized , the law would become a rule and guide adapted to the capacities of all . 4 . A more considerable objection , however , is urged by those *ho represent , that if a new system were established , judicial decisions would still be required to settle the meaning of terms , and to declare the application of principles , which in a few years would accumulate a vast mass of legal learning . Reference is made in proof of the assertion , to the codes of Justinian and Napoleon , // under each of which the commentaries , glosses , and decrees , have grown to an immeasurable magnitude . The treatises , it is said , relating to the application of the French codes to difficult and doubtful questions , amounted , as early as 1818 , to more than fifty volumes , while there were over a hundred volumes of statutory law ; and , as it respects the Justinian , although an imperial edict , published in confirmation of the authority of the Pandects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet , as Montesquieu tells us , greater changes took place in a few years in the jurisprudence of Justinian , than in any three centuries of the French monarchy . These are unquestionable facts ; but so far from warring with our view of the argument , they serve to show its pertinency and force . It is to be obseryed , that the various bodies of law prepared by Justinian were the merest approximation to what is now comprehended in the idea of a code . His Code was only a collection of the imperial statutes from Hadrian to his own time , thought worth preserving ; the Institutes were compends - admirable , it is true , but still compends , of the more ancient laws ; the Pandects were voluminous abridgments of the decisions of pr*tors and the opinions of legal sages , without precision and logical arrangement , abounding in contradictory doctrines , and full of the very uncertainty which it was their object to avoid ; while all were vitiated by the fatal defect of admitting a recourse to an authority out of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be remarked in the Code of Napoleon . Explicit as it is in many of its definitions , and felicitous as it is in arrangement , it recognises the doctrine of usage , and thus opens an avenue for the advent of the whole jurisprudence of precedent and decrees . Now a true code would altogether avoid sources of error like these . The great evil we have found in the English law is that it tolerates this reference to the decrees of judges . Nearly all the uncertainty with which it is chargeable , has its origin in this single defect . It is in the fact that it admits of judicial legislation , that it recognises in the determination of its ministers an authority quite equal to itself , that its most grievous departures originate . Law thus loses the character given it by the definition of Blackstone , as " a rule of action prescribed by the supreme power of the state , " and becomes an unknown and variable jumble of dicta . It is no longer " a rule of action , " since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , un1*i1 some case shall arise to call it into existence ; it is not " prescribed , " inasmuch as it is not known before it is applied ; thus , in many instances assuming an ex post facto operation ; and " the supreme power of the state " has nothing to do with this jurispru // dence of construction and decrees , confined exclusively to the courts , instituted as , and in theory supposed to be , the mere interpreter of the law . Now a code finds a remedy for this , in that it is a something entire in itself ; in its parts , and as a whole , it is complete ; or should the experience of its practical working discover points in which it could be improved , either by simplifying or enlarging its clauses , it provides regularly for its own systematic amendment till it shall reach the highest possible approximation toward perfection . Not the wanton caprice or prejudices of the judge - not his sinister motives or base subjection to prevailing influences - no prevaricating and self-constituted tribunal - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper law-devising and law-establishing power , are made the arbiters of rules in which the properties , happiness , and lives of the people are involved . It would be made the duty of judges to report to the representative all cases of doubt or difficulty , and so combine the advantages of the wisdom and personal acquaintance of the judiciary with the deliberative sagacity , popular spirit and lawful sanction of the legislature . There could be , therefore , no accumulation of decisions , no heaping up of commentaries , no diffusing the law through a thousand volumes , and no bringing it into the position of a rule liable to perpetual fluctuation . Thus we find the objections of those who oppose codification are easily disposed of , and that the practicability of it no longer admits of doubt . Shall we much longer continue to neglect its incalculable practical benefits@@184090657.txt THE attention and the sympathy of American democracy have been often of late years attracted to Italy , by the several attempts at insurrection that have from time agitated that beautiful but unhappy country . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sincere sorrow for its failure , the disproportionate struggle in which the Liberals of Italy have engaged with their tyrants . And when the daring outbreaks of those gallant but hapless patriots have been overwhelmed beneath their usual fate , our indignation has often risen to the highest pitch , at the narratives which have reached us of the cruel modes of vengeance inflicted by the petty and blood-thirsty despots of Italy on their prostrated , powerless , and often innocent victims . A few of them , after surviving , through long years of incarcerated torture , the * U.

But this painful sympathy which has been generally felt among us in behalf of the persecuted Liberals of Italy , has been but the instinctive impulse of indignant humanity that shuddered at the sufferings of fellow-men . We have felt for them what as Americans we could not but feel , at any spectacle of foreign force and brute tyranny cruelly triumphant over a cause of native patriotism and republican aspirations , so closely in harmony , in its general aim and tendency , with that to which our own unforgottert fathers pledged " their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor . " This we have felt , but nothing more . Whether from the difficulty of procuring information in reference to these interesting events , or from neglect of investigation on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of the analysis of facts not immediately connected with our own interests , - it is certain that but few of us have hitherto possessed any positive knowledge on the subject . Few of us have as yet fairly understood how far our general sympathy was just . Few of us have taken the pains to ascertain whether the convulsive efforts of the Italian patriots have been the result of a well conceived plan , a well organized system , or the mere effervescent explosion of a few nobler spirits among a mass of uneducated slaves , who , exasperated by an intolerable pressure of suffering and evil , have become reckless of consequences , and have burst out into wild and brute violence , to seek in the general confusion at least the chance of a brief relief .

Among the several secret societies which have succeeded each other during th' last ten years , the Giovine Italia , or " Young Italy " stands the most prominent . Strong in its convictions , fearless of consequences , and unheeding the rage of a tyranny it despised while it abhorred , this Society alone has made a public declaration of faith , and proclaimed in open and unequivocal language the principles on which it has taken its stand , and on which and by which it has determined to begin and carry out its mission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may call kindred to that of the apostles of old , this Society , inspired with a faith , neither to be shaken by sophism , nor deterred by persecution , has been laboring with unremitting exertion and industry , ever since its establishment , to propagate its creed among its Italian brethren , and still to increase the growing numbers of its proselytes . A society of distinguished men , devoted to the dissemination of liberal principles , of pure morals , which inscribes on its banner the holy watchwords of human freedom and equalityand which , destitute as it may be of efficient means , yet dares openly to raise that banner high aloft , and to proclaim an uncompromising war against tyranny , can not be un*vorthy of our attention and sympathy . The first numbers of a newspaper recently issued by the Society of La Giovine Italia , under the title of " s*postolato Popolare , " have fallen into our hands . This publication is printed in London , but is designed chiefly for dissemination among the laboring classes of Italy , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering in exile in foreign countries . We have found this paper so replete with a true political wisdom , with sound and healthy views , pervaded with a high tone of pure Christian morals , that while we have been forcibly struck , both with the ability with which it is written , and with the value of the principles asserted by it , it could not but suggest the desire , as closely as in our power , to examine and study the Society from which it emanates , and of which it is the solemn public voice and utterance . Before , however , proceeding to this inquiry , a few words are due to the events which have preceded and led the way to its formation . After the popular triumph of the Trois Jours of 1830 , in France , the Italians , relying on the presumption that the agreement which had been entered into by the five great powers of Europe , of nonintervention , would be adhered to , even by Austria , in relation to the Italian States , rose in insurrection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution spread with such rapidity // that the duke of the last named city had barely time to escape with his family , and seek a shelter in the Austrian dominions . He escaped ; but he carried with him a bitter resolution of vengeance against all Liberals and Liberalism . Before quitting his city , while he neglected every object of value , he took care to drag with him in his flight the unhappy Menotti , a distinguished citizen of Modena , and at the time a prisoner of state to the duke . He was the chief of the conspiracy which made the revolution in Modena , but having had the misfortune to be detected before the explosion of the insurrection , he was arrested , and the occurrence of that event found him in a dungeon awaiting his trial . The insurrection of these two cities was accomplished solely by the young Italians , - namely , of that class who , born in these times of revolution and progress , and nourished in the glorious recollections of the past , blushed deeply for the present abasement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and could no longer brook the shame of being governed by an ignorant and brutal foreign tyranny , - that noble youth with whom the love of that country is the most fond and fervent religion of their heart . They were perhaps too hasty , but the gallant impulses that animated them were not to be resisted . They believed that the favorable hour had arrived to fulfil the great duty they o*ved to Italy and to their own natural rights ; and regardless of the personal dangers they braved , and as fearless of the worst consequences to themselves as they were free from any motives of individual ambition or interest , they devoted themselves to the cause of liberty and independence . Their enemies fled , -  --  the satellites of despotism were laid low in the dust , - and the insurrection was accomplished . But the direction and management of the revolution fell into the hands of men altogether different from those who had achieved the insurrection , men wholly inadequate to the task to which they were called . Though not destitute of patriotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold and vigorous energy necessary for the success of such an enterprise . While central Italy was shaken to its foundations by the revolutionary movements , and while the young Italians , in the enthusiasm of their liberal patriotism , were determined by every means now to accomplish the long cherished object of the common regeneration of the whole of their loved and lovely land , and were eagerly asking for arms to be ready for every emergency , these men that had unfortunately been appointed to the provisory government of Bologna , strove with all their power to paralyze and arrest the general excitement , - to disarm those that were already equipped , // and to prevent the arming of others , under the ridiculous pretext that it was more prudent for an unsettled and feeble nation to respect the neighboring governments , to avoid alarming them by hostile demonstrations , and to keep inviolate the treacherous principle on which they rested their reliance , of non-intervention . In the meantime , the Austrians having ascertained that the promised assistance of the Roi-Citoyen of France would not be gjven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , as was that of Poland , was to be sacrificed to the cold and deceptive policy of a faithless cabinet , boldly crossed the confines ; and availing themselves of the fatal inactivity and want of preparation of the Bolognese government , attacked and scattered with no difficulty the few troops which , in that hour of confusion and disorder , dared to attempt a momentary resistance . A handful of ill-equipped volunteers , commanded by Ollini and Sarcognani , two distinguished officers of the time of Napoleon , manfully indeed and heroically resisted for a moment the overwhelming forces of the enemy ; but they were soon swept away and dispersed . General Zucchi also , a brave soldier of the same epoch and school , seeing that there was no possibility of contending with so powerful an army , withdrew in good order toward Ancona the few soldiers that were under his command ; and when all was lost , effected a capitulation with Cardinal Benvenuti , in which it was stipulated that all his soldiers , himself , and in general all persons who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign countries . The Punic faith of Austria did not long , however , respect this capitulation ; and a man-of-war brought into Venice the vessel which had on board the most distinguished of the refugee liberals ; who were unscrupulously brought to trial on the charge of high-treason , for a crime that was neither committed in the Austrian States , nor intended against Austria . Zucchi was among the prisoners ; and even without any trial at all , or form of judgment , was sent to a German fortress , where for years it was unknown to the world whether he was living , or indeed where he was entombed . The duchies of Modena and Parma , and the whole Romagna , being thus invaded by a powerful Austrian army , the people of central Italy , after having enjoyed for a brief period an unsettled and tumultuous liberty , were again bowed and crushed beneath the iron yoke of their despotic masters . The insolent Austrian , elated by the inglorious triumph of an easy conquest , breathing hatred and vengeance against all who were even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and poor Italy , already overwhelmed with the evils and sufferings of // 265 domestic tyranny , had to endure the aggravation of all the rude atrocities of foreign barbarian mercenaries . During the period of general discouragement and depression that followed the Austrian invasion , and the unlooked-for return of the domestic despots , most of those who had taken an active part in the insurrection fled , and sought refuge either in France or Switzerland . Others who had played a less conspicuous part , withdrew into the country , concealing themselves in the remotest and obscurest nooks of the provinces , to wait an opportunity to escape unnoticed ; or in the hope that their innocence might be acknowledged , or the first fury of revengeful tyranny should subside and abate a little . But vain , and fatal to many who entertained them , were any calculations of this nature . Tyranny never forgives , never forgets . How many , thus allured by mendacious promises and assurances , have been sacrificed ! How many , discovered by the untiring activity of the keen police of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were torn from the bosoms of their families - carried before a mock tribunal , always composed of men selected as the fit instruments of the predetermined will of their employers and masters - and thence , after *immary judgment and short shrift , hurried remorselessly to the place of execution ! Thus did Menotti , thus Borelli and Ricci , fall beneath the impious axe of the Duke of Modena ; who , with a hellish barbarity , ordered the body of the former to be cut into four parts , and suspended in four quarters of the city , as a warning spectacle to all who should again dare to conspire against a tyranny capable of such an act . Thus did Tonelli , Brunetti , and their companions , expiate by the hands of Pontifical executioners the crime of having loved their native Italy , and of having wished her a better government than that of ignorant corruption and priestly incompetence . They fell without uttering a murmur , or any other regret than that they could not have done more for the country they loved so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that presented a fair chance of success , if we consider the time at which it exploded , the enthusiasm and commotion prevailing throughout all Europe , and the want of preparation of the enemies of Italy to stifle at its birth the huge monster that thus so unexpectedly sprang up out of the earth to threaten their existence . It is evident that the revolution of 1831 failed simply for want of the requisite energy and courage on the part of those into whose hands fell the management of affairs . If those men , penetrated with an understanding of the nature and importance of their mission , instead of trying to soothe and flatter the cabinets and the diplomacy of R2 // foreign courts - instead of proclaiming the delusive principle of non-intervention , and reposing their own entire trust in it - had boldly declared war against all despotism in Italy , and proclaimed her unity , liberty , and independence , waiting for a more propitious moment to wage that war against those who were as yet too powerful to be attacked , - if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Italians , and sitting down quietly in their legislative seats , as if the great work were already consummated and safe , they had stirred up all the ready energies of their countrymen , had availed themselves of the immense resources offered them by the generous enthusiasm of the momenthad they armed all men capable of bearing arms , and put all the country beyond the Po in a state of insurrection - all Italy would have echoed to such a call . Naturally intolerant of foreign bondage , the whole Italian people would gladly have embraced the favorable opportunity of breaking and spurning its fetters . If such an imposing attitude had been assumed by the provisory government , Austria could have been held in check for a sufficient period to give the Italians time to breathe , and to organize and concentrate ample preparations for war . The opportunity was , however , lost ; and the incapacity of a few men , who were not up to the level of the enterprise , drew in its train long consequences of new and severer evils for Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undetermined . But it was in vain that the tyrants of Italy thus persecuted her patriots , - in vain that they thought to extirpate from her soil the seeds of liberalism with the bayonet , the axe , and the fetter . The convictions of those against whom this system was directed were too strong to be thus shaken ; their hatred of despotism and oppression too deeply rooted to be thus overthrown . The blood of martyred patriotism , which tyranny thus poured forth like water on the altars of its vengeance , but served , as it always does , the more to enrich the soil in which those roots had struck and spread . With that very blood the oaths of new proselytes , and a deadlier sentence of extermination against the despotism that shed it , were but written and recorded in the heart of Italy in more indelible letters . The Giovine Italia , composed of the several scattered elements of the *previous revolution , was soon constituted - with a clear understanding of the errors of its predecessors , and determination to guard against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin in 1832 . The place of its birth was Marseilles . A considerable number of the persecuted patriots , who had saved their lives by escape , assembled in this city , so near to the country from which they had been driven . The sons // of the several secret societies , which had till then worked separately , here met , and with unanimous consent merged them all into one , to which they gave the name of La Giovine Italia . Giuseppe Mazzini , of Genoa , distinguished for his talents , rare attainments , and stern and devoted patriotism , and who had just succeeded in effecting his escape from the political prisons of Piedmont , was and is still the most active in bringing and keeping together the dispersed materials of organization and action . The sacred work has met with a proportionate success ; and in spite of the many difficulties which have impeded their progress , the future now smiles auspiciously on their noble labors . This Society is completely organized as a provisory Italian government . The principle on which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management is democratic . Its device is , Liberty - Equality - Humanity - Independence - and Unity . Every Italian who wishes it , and who bears a respectable character for an upright and moral course of life , is admitted into the Society . They first established a Committee , or , as it was termed by themselves , Congrega Centrale ; whose duty was to proclaim and disseminate their creed , and increase the number of their brethren . This soon grew with a happy and unexpected rapidity , not only in foreign countries , where the task was safe and easy , but even in Italy itself , where every such movement is attended with formidable danger , and fatal consequences in the event of detection . Congreghe were successfully established in Piedmont , Lombardy , Romagna , Naples , and Sicily . Every Congrega has a president , who alone is acquainted with all the proceedings of the Society within his province ; but as his authority does not extend beyond those limits , he has no knowledge of what may be done by other Congreghe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole machinery of the Society , is able to know all the movements of all the provincial Congreghe . Every one who is admitted into the Society gives a solemn promise to keep inviolate the secrets he may discover , and to exert himself , so far as in his power , to propagate and to preserve the purity of the principles of the Giovine Italia . They call themselves brethren . Every brother is requested to pay a monthly contribution , the amount of which is left entirely to his own patriotism and his own judgment of his ability . " Ora e Sem .. pre , " " Now and Always , " is their motto , - and certainly no form of speech could convey a stronger conviction , and a deeper meaning , than these two words . All the other secret societies that have preceded the Giovine Italia have acted on the presumption , either that the mass of the // people , from their deficiency of education , could not understand the liberal doctrines ; or , in their dread of the argus-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the more easily liable to detection , if the number of the conspirators should be too widely extended . They have therefore kept at a distance from the People . Was it contempt for the Mass , from which alone emanate and spring all true political greatness , and the real strength and support of all great enterprises in the hour of trial * Or was it the simple prudential consideration we have alluded to 1 Whatever might have been the reason of a mistake so signal and so fatal , its effect has been that the people , when appealed to by them , when the necessity arose for their physical aid , have stood aloof , as mere spectators of that which they had never been taught to be their own most vital concern ; and no eloquence has succeeded in persuading them to mingle and coöperate with the mysterious and excommunicated Carbonari . But the Giovine Italia has founded its system of action on a higher faith in the morale of the People , on their native capabilities , and on the patriotism which is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more cultivated classes of their countrymen . It has therefore addressed its appeals first and most particularly to them , and pointing out to all the true way to a common salvation , has invited all and each to join the Society which is laboring to open that way to the whole nation . And the People , on their part , grateful for the long unwonted consideration manifested toward them and for them , are found to welcome , with a corresponding delight and pride , that voice which thus makes its way , in the same stirring accents , to cottage and hut as to palace and academy . The Giovine Italia preaches moral and religious , civil and political Reform . Convinced that a nation will never succeed to be politically regenerated , except it be first morally cleansed and purified , it strives to direct the hearts of its brethren toward the worship of truth and religion , such as they have originally emanated from God . Hostile with the hostility of death to tyranny and every form of civil and social oppression , it attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abuses rife in both the political and religious institutions of its country and time . It preaches more than any mere partial and palliative reforms , and shows the absolute necessity of erecting the new social edifice on the universal and inalienable rights of man , - an edifice of which the democratic principle is to be the corner-stone . Positive and determined in everything relating to its own constitution , the Giovine Italia is yet unassuming and guarded in the recommendations it addresses to others . It insists that Italy // must be united and republican , and so far as its influence shall avail will exert itself to effect that result . But it is only recommendation . It labors only to persuade ; - it pretends not to force ; - Italy alone must determine . It will not be out of place briefly to exhibit some of the grounds on which it defends the united and republican form of government for Italy . Italy must be republican , says the Giovine Jtalia ,  --  because all men are called alike by the laws of God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a mutual respect and love , and the republican institution is the only one that ensures to mankind the realization of this his natural destiny on the earth . Republican , because the sovereignty of the state resides essentially in the nation , sole interpreter of the supreme moral laws ,  --  because whenever privilege is constituted in the social edifice , it corrupts the equality of citizenship , tends naturally to extend wider and wider its vicious influence , and threatens the liberty of the whole . Republican , because whenever the sovereignty is acknowledged to reside in several distinct powers , a way is opened to usurpation , a struggle is inevitable between the existing powers , and thus the harmony which is the supreme law of a rightly constituted society is destroyed , distrust and organized hostility being substituted in its stead . Republican , because it is proved as well by history as from the nature of things , that monarchy tends to generate anarchy , and hereditary authority despotism . Republican , because the progressive series of modern European events leads society inevitably to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monarchical principle in Italy would necessarily contain in the very act the elements of another revolution in that country within a few years . Republican , because practically Italy has none of the elements of monarchy-. no aristocracy endowed with power , wealth and respect , to stand between the throne and the people-no dynasty of Italian royalty that could concentrate all the votes of the many and various portions of the country . Republican , because its tradition is republican , republican its history . Republican , because the Italians of the several states that would not submit to the regal government of one man selected from the bosom of any one of them , would all unite in offering a willing loyalty to a principle . And republican , because , to stir and arouse a whole nation , it is necessary to place before it an aim in which it should directly and intelligibly perceive its own highest natural rights , and greatest social interests . The Giovine Italia is also , to use its own phrase , Unitarian ( unitaria , ) - because for Italy without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity there is no force ; while , // surrounded as Italy is by nations united , powerful and hostile , she needs above all things to be . strong . Because , as they reason , federalism would doom her to the impotency of Switzerland , and she would soon fall again piece-meal beneath the influence of some of the great neighboring powers . Because federalism , reviving the old rivalries now almost extinguished , with perhaps the old animosities now almost forgotten , the march of the modern civilization of Italy would tend to retrograde toward the middle ages . And because federalism , by splitting Italy into several small parts , would encourage the rising of petty ambitions , and local and partial patriotisms , and would become a source of aristocracy , ever hostile to liberty , and fatal to the progress of a true civilization . These are a few of the arguments on which the Giovine Italia rests its doctrine of a republican form of government for regenerated Italy , together with the fusion of the whole into one noble and beautiful national unity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in that country , its history , wants and natural tendencies , we can not withhold our earnest approbation from the doctrines which are so strongly and so eloquently put forth by the Society , - though we would suggest to their most careful consideration the practical study of the federative principle , in its working in our great republican union of republics . We will not here criticise the arguments which they derive from the past history and present peculiar condition of the country for which they are so much better competent to judge than we can pretend to be . But , in passing , we may be allowed to express to them our own profound confidence , that the federative principle , wisely applied to the organization of a union of independent republics , with distinct collective and national sovereignties , and a proper and well defined distribution of their respective subjects of national and municipal powers and duties , accompanied with a strong sentiment of national patriotism and love of the Union , is the most wise , firm and energetic form of government ever yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would seem to us peculiarly adapted to the historical , geographical and political circumstances of Italy . On this point , however , we repeat that we do not feel entitled to sit in judgment upon the counsels of such a body as the Society of which we speak . We content ourselves , as free Americans , and brethren to the friends of freedom every where-still more , to its martyrs ! - with the expression of a most earnest hope that the Giovine Italia may , before no very distant day , triumph over its enemies , and witness arid perform the realization of all its high patriotic and philanthropic aspira // tions ;  --  and that Italy , so fair and so lovely in hs very chains , so great still even in its most abject abasement , may yet assume , within the epoch of our own day , its just and elevated place among the nations of the earth . In 1832 , the Society established a monthly journal at Marseilles , of its own name , " La Giovine Italia , " as its organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsleeping vigilance of the several police systems it has had to contend with , thousands of copies have been scattered throughout the interior of every province of Italy . Pamphlets and other occasional publications have also been distributed gratuitously among the people . All these writings have been clothed in a familiar and easy style ; and have treated the questions they have discussed in a manner calculated to convey useful and stimulating instruction to the most ordinary intelligences amidst the masses to which they have been addressed . The expenses of such publications have been defrayed by the voluntary contributions of the members of the Society , and of other individuals of a liberal philanthropy in Italy and elsewhere . The Tribuno , a periodical edited and secretly printed in Milan itself , was also written in the same spirit , and emanated directly from the Giovine Italia . This liberal press , although supported with very scanty pecuniary means , and forced to struggle at every step against fearful obstacles and dangers , yet succeeded , in 1833 , in becoming a formidable power in Italy . The governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were terrified by it ,  --  nor without good reason ; for while , on the one hand , its republican ideas were spreading with an alarming rapidity among the people , and the revolutionary party was daily assuming a bolder character , on the other , they were unable to detect the persons and the quarters from which the incendiary brand of rebellion proceeded . Surrounded as they were by so many hidden foes , and convinced that it was beyond the power even of their despotisms , entirely to arrest the progress of those opinions , they had determined , however , to discover some clue which might lead them to the apprehension of the chief of the culprits . The usual expedients of spies and corruption were strained to the utmost . The poisonous contagion in this instance reached quarters till then pure and virtuous . Nor was it unattended by a partial success ; and some of the threads of the organization were indeed discovered in Piedmont , Genoa , Lombardy and Naples . A great many officers and subalterns of the Piedmontese army , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milan , were arrested and thrown into irons . Others , more fortunate , fled to foreign countriesincreasing // thus the ' number already great of the fugitive exiles . Persons of high social position and respectability were sacrificed at the same time . The prisons of Turin and Alexandria were crowded with unhappy victims , who were daily transferred to a military commission presided over by a cannibal whose abhorred memory will never be forgotten in Piedmont . We refer to General Gallateri , the governor of Alexax*dria , who , with the smile of a fiend , used to say that the softest music at his breakfast was the report of the musketry which every morning hurled into eternity some of the victims of his and his masters ' vindictiveness . Upward of fifty gentlemen , distinguished for their birth , talents , and respectability of character , were sentenced by court-martial to be shot ; and in order to add contumely to the cruelty of their death , it was ordered that they should be shot in the back , and by the hands of prisoners in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was in vain that the Piedmontese public manifested with strong demonstrations their indignation at these judicial assassinations , - in vain that the Senate of Turin protested against the illegality of such judgments , and claimed the rights belonging to the proper civil and criminal tribunals of the country . Carlo Alberto , who in 1820 , as Prince of Carignano , had been a member of the society of the Carbonari , and who , before the explosion of the insurrection in Piedmont , had betrayed everything he knew , and had even given a list of the names of all the conspirators both of Piedmont and Lombardy - this Carlo Alberto was on the Sardinian throne ; and the informer of 1821 could not but be the tyrant of 1833 ; and fitly sought to drown , in the blood of new victims , the torment and shame of his unforgotten treachery to those of a former day . The Austrian government , although from natural disposition as well as habit averse to the judicial shedding of blood , was not less cruel than the rest , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its policy is , in the punishment of state offenders , together with a show of clemency , to protract as long as possible the pleasure of vengeance . Hence the assumed humanity of sending its victims to the distant dungeons of Spielberg , from which such mournful revelations have reached us , from the sad experience of a few of the noblest occupants who have ever sighed within their dreary walls . Hence the scanty and rotten food doled to its political prisoners ; and hence the frequent visits made to their cells by high personages of the court , to witness with their own eyes the progressive success of their system of killing by slow degrees of torture , by thus undermining the constitution , and poisoning the very // springs of existence . In making arrests , they were neither inactive nor scrupulous . The lightest suspicion , the denunciation of a vile spy , rewarded in proportiou to the number and importance of his disclosures , real or pretended , a thoughtless word or allusion in private conversation , were sufficient proofs of guilt . Hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison , consisting chiefly of lawyers , physicians , men of letters , young priests - for democracy , we rejoice to say , has seriously penetrated this important order of society in Italy , and the altar , we trust , will no longer be the chief support of the throne of despotism . Giordani , one of the most eminent literary men of Italy , was arrested because , in a letter intercepted by the Austrian police , there was an expression which they could not readily understand . He had to languish for four months in a prison , before the interpretation of the suspected phrase could be intelligible to the Bo*otian capacity of the Austrian magistrate . But we have neither space nor time at command to relate all the arbitrary arrests made by the police , or to detail the barbarous treatment in countless cases inflicted on the suspected members of the Giovine Italia . Those only , who have some knowledge of the mode in which political trials are conducted in those countries , can form a conception of the outrages which , in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Bono , a very young man , and the highly respectable clergyman Bianchi , died in prison , destroyed by the poisonous effects of the bebbadera , that was given to the prisoners to drink , in order to wrest from them some unguarded revelations while in the state of intoxication produced by it . Others lost their reason . Among these was a former soldier , of the name of Bressanini , who , a short time after his imprisonment , became a raving lunatic . His depositions were on their very face those of a man in a state of madness . The proceedings against him nevertheless went on ; the revelations of insanity were used against other prisoners , and many arrests were made on the strength of them ; and finally he was himself condemned ,  --  though the more scrupulous conscience of the sovereign himself could not be prevailed upon to permit the execution of the sentence of three tribunals , which , without verifying the truth of his statements , or paying any regard to his manifest insanity , had doomed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoners of state of the Giovine Italia , was wholly composed of Austrians , or renegade Tyrolese - Italians being carefully excluded from it . The presiding judge was a man whose name , Zajotti , will long live in the execrations of all Lombardy . His appearance and aspect were as VOL . IX . No . XXXIX. -S // hideous as his soul was cruel and dark . Like the tiger , he indulged in the pleasure of tormenting his victims by slow process ; and the peculiar grin which rested upon his revolting countenance when any prisoner of the Giovine Italia was brought before him , and when he saw that some secret was to be sucked out of the inexperience of some or the fears of others , is described as strikingly suggestive of the idea of the ferocious beast of prey to which it has been usual to compare him . Twenty-four civilians and ten military men were condemned on this occasion , at Milan , for high treason ; and though several of them were found guilty simply on the strength of the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revisory tribunals , nor the Emperor , paid any regard to that circumstance , and the sentence of death was unscrupulously passed upon them . The public policy of Austria is , however , wisely hostile to the practice of capital punishment . It knows , indeed , that the prospect of long and severe incarceration operates with a much more effectual deterring influence upon the minds of men than the chance of a speedy and easy death ; at the same time that the spectacle of the example of punishment is thus indefinitely protracted for the benefit of others . The sentences of death were therefore commuted to imprisonment at Spielberg for various periods from ten to twenty years ; and after a partial infliction of them , a long perspective of hard labor and solitary confinement stretched in the dreary future before the eyes of the prisoners , when the death of the old Emperor , Francis II. , in 1835 , caused a more favorable turn in their behalf ; and his successor , feeling himself bound , according to the ancient custom of the empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political offences , though he did not pardon them , yet so far mith gated their sentences as to send them into exile in this country for life . In the mean time , while these misfortunes befell the conspirators of the Giovine Italia in Italy , those who were established in France and Switzerland made an attempt , in 183* , at a revolutionary movement from without , which met with no better success . After having organized a numerous corps of exiles , they set out by different routes toward Savoy , with the intention of beginning an insurrection in that country , and thence of proceeding through Piedmont into central Italy , where all the conspirators were to rise , and fight in detached bands , in the manner in which the Spanish patriots sustained so well their sanguinary guerilla struggle with the French . The topography of Italy is in general well adapted for this mode of warfare , which indeed is the only one that promises a fair chance of success to an enterprise of this nature . But the French cabi // net , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation by the exiles , with a vigilance and zeal better worthy of a better cause , arrested the progress of every one who was moving toward the threatened province , and easily dispersed those who had already reached the neighborhood , and who were awaiting the moment of action . The king of Sardinia also , who knew the storm which was gathering on his frontiers , concentrated a powerful force to oppose it ; and thus failed the second attempt at insurrection made by the Giovine Italia . Italy again relapsed into a state of torpor , and apparent resignation and thoughtlessness . The vexations of the police have gone on increasing ; and the weight of despotism , already so odious and intolerable , has become , since these events , more grievous , more oppressive than ever . But the Giovine Italia perseveres still in its holy mission . After some interval of silence , it is again raising its voice , which sounds like the notes of a silver clarion ,  --  - again sending forth its apostles to proclaim and propagate the same principles . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Italians of all classes , inviting and invoking them to join the sacred cause of liberty and humanity . It is no longer , as before , a mere secret political society , but the founder of a creed , of a political religion . Harmonious with its principles , it directs its chief attention to the masses , heretofore neglected in the movements of this general character which have preceded this . For this object it has commenced a periodical publication , especially addressed to the people-the " Apostolato Popolare " which has been already named in the former part of this article . It breathes in every line a pure and lofty patriotism , sound religious morals , and truly liberal principles . The plan they propose to follow is clear , and calculated to produce great and extensive good . We do not find in it the violent diatribes and imprecations of an excited and revengeful jacobinism , but the moderation and gravity of true patriots and philanthropists , deeply convinced of the justice of their cause , and resolved to undermine and overthrow , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of despotism , and to rear upon their ruins a glorious structure of republican freedom and happiness . We would gladly translate , for the benefit of our own readers , the noble address with which it opens , to the Laborers of Italy , were we permitted by our present limits of space . With a cordial expression of the sympathy of American democracy , we can only wish to its worthy conductors that reward which is their own highest aim - the rapid extension of the number of their converts and brethren , and the speedy advent of the day which we are well assured is destined to witness the triumph of their // high and holy cause , the emancipation of their beautiful country , its restoration to its natural position in the great family of nations , and its enjoyment of the blessings-inestimable amidst all their worst drawbacks-of freedom and democracy . May the mass of the Italians become but well imbued with the truth of the doctrines to which the love of their patriotic brethren is thus striving to direct them , and assuredly the consummation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , the wheels of whose car they are thus laboring to expedite , can not be far.
