THE SLAVE KING ; OR THE Triumph of LIBERTY . C.N.CORWAY BY J. H. INGRAHAM , ESQ . Entered according to act of Congress , in the year 1846 , by H. L. Williams , in the Clerk 's Office , in the District Court of the District of Massachusetts . Preliminaries Main text CHAPTER I. THE GAZELLE KEEPER . So shone the sun upon the arrowy Guadalquivir , when Spain was ruled by a Christian , and the Cross of God rose where now the Moslem Crescent gleams ! ' These words were slowly and sadly spoken by a venerable , apostolic-looking man with a lofty and towering form , a pale , thoughtful brow , and features of the most noble outline . He wore a garment of close cloth , girded by a thong of untanned leather about his waist , and descending to his feet , which were sandalled with untanned hide , strapped with cords across his naked feet . To his brown-hued coarse robe was attached a hood , which hung down his shoulders , leaving exposed his fine silvery head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow , descended into his bosom and was lost there . His eye was as clear as light and as gentle as that of a maiden 's , white his pure complexion was as soft as an infant 's , the effect of rigid abstinence from animal aliment , and of many a long fast and wasting vigil . There was a lustre and transparency to his countenance that seemed to belong more to heaven than to earth  --  an ethereal , saint-like expression that gave it an aspect almost divine . The words he had uttered fell unexpectedly and startlingly upon the car of a young man seated at his feet upon a rock , which , being near the Sierra Morena , commanded a wide and magnificent prospect of the green vale of the Guadalquivir , and the silver white towers and dark walls of Cordova upon its banks . He was a young shepherd of tha Sierras by his garb , which was a baregan of dark cloth fastened at his neck by a loop of leather , bound with a girdle of goat 's hide , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg , were encased in coarse mountain boots of dried skin . By his side was a rudely-made hat of palm leaves , with the brim thriee the breadth of the crown , and also a strong oak pike , seven feet long , terminating in a hook , not unlike a shepherd 's crook . His age was not more than three or four and twenty at the most ; yet the mountain life he had led matured a nobly developed form , which was moulded as if it had been the original for the Greek Apollo . Though his cheek was as brown as the chesnut of his native Sierras , his face was remarkably handsome and lighted by an eye at once soft as the gazelles and piercing as that of the mountain eagle . He was reclining at his ease upon a rock , which stood upon the very pinnacle and outer verge of a cliff that towered a thousand feet from the valley in a sheer precipice . He had been collecting his goats and gazelles , of which he had a flock numbering more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shelves and peaks of the mountain , whither they had dispersed themselves seeking the scanty herbage of the heights , be gaided them into the rocky pathway which led down the mountain side home ward , and here turned aside , as he was wont to linger and gaze upon the fair valley , lighted up with the splendor of the setting sun . And a fair and glorious sun it was that made the goat-herd loiter on his homeward path till often the shadows of night would hasten upon him and render his passage down the steep footway perilous even to his practised tread . Beauteous as the Vale of Paradise itself , the verdant plain of the golden Guadalquivir lay before his admiring and wistful eyes . Terminating on the south at the majestic wall of the dazzling Sierra Nevada , whose purple sides were finely blended with their snowy crests , and embraced in the north by the encircling arms of the Morena Mountains , with the beautiful river meandering through its green bosom , its banks studded with cities and towers , and lovely with groves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was termed by the Moors , the guarded emerald of the earth . ' In the midst of the charming valley sat Cordova , upon a throne of towers , the Queen of all the fair scene . Upon her hundred minarets sparkled the crescent of Islam , and from the bosom of her groves rose side by side with the cathedral of the Nazarene , the Mosque of Omar . A league from the base of the mountain , along a winding road , a party of travelling merchants , with their long train of laden mules and horses was visible , making its way from a pass in the hills towards the city , ere the gates should be closed for the night ; and off the road , beneath a grove of stately palms , that flung their delicate shadows far across the green plain , were assembled a caravan of Moorish travellers , with one or two camels and many horses and mules , some laden , others garnished with gay trappings , while here and there moving about the picturesque encampment , were seen cavaliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the Sierras , were frowning with castle and tower , many of them in ruins , yet all adding to the effect of the picture spread before the eyes of the young mountaineer . He had reclined at first upon the rock , and gazed with a subdued look of enjoyment ; but gradually his eyes lighted up , and an expression of decision , not untinged with melancholy , passed across his handsome face . It was at this moment , that the words spoken by the hermit fell upon his ear . Upon hearing his voice he started quickly to his feet , and turned towards the speaker and knelt with an air of reverence upon his knee , while he said earnestly , Thy blessing , father . ' Thou hast it , son ! ' responded the hermit , laying his hand upon his head . The young man kissed the hand with affectionate veneration , and then standing up said  --  You are far from your cell , father , for this hour . It will be night ere you reach it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me guide thee , father . ' Stay , not yet , son . I will sit here and rest with thee . This stone is a sacred seat . ' T is said the Holy Paul when he first preached in Spain the cross of the Crucified , was five days wandering among these mountains , to which he had been driven by those in Cordova , who would not hear his doctrine . He was secreted here by a converted Israelite , and from this rock gazed upon Cordova as we do now . ' How knowest thou this , father ? ' asked the young mountaineer , reverently , stepping aside from the spot , and gazing with holy awe upon the little recess in which he had been reclining . Tradition , son , which never suffers ought to perish touching the followers of the Messiah . ' And tradition , father , says that Paul from this rock shook off from his feet the dust of the city , and said , prophetically , Thou hast rejected the Cross ; therefore thou shalt wear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the crescent  --  and a grievous yoke has it been this twenty years to Cordova . The rule of the Moslem is a punishment of Heaven upon the land that proved itself unworthy to bear the foot of an apostle . Yes , my son , in the rule of the Moor we behold the retribution which was denounced upon yonder city . As now it shines in the setting sun , fair and glorious to the eye it shone twenty years ago the pride of a Christian King , and Christian people . But then the sun lighted up no infidel crescent . A thousand crosses flung back his beams . Look ! can thy young glance espy even one lowly symbol of Christ in all this vale of beauty ? The crescent is everywhere , father . I see no cross . ' No . Not one is left standing . The sign of the False Prophet usurps even upon the Temples of God , the place of the Son of Man . The church is desecrated into a mosque ; and the muezzin calls the prayer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a sad sight , my son , for the eyes of a Christian man to gaze upon . But prayer and faith will yet avail to turn aside the judgment that is upon us . Penitence and deep humiliation among the great and the rich , aye among the priests of the altar , are needful . This has come upon us for the worldliness of the church , the licentiousness of the priesthood . God has bridged the sea to the infidel , and given the fair lands into his hand to waste and to pollute . Let me lean on thy shoulder , my son , I will accept thy guidance . Willingly , holy hermit , ' answered the young man as he placed the hand of the venerable recluse upon his shoulder and turned to support him up the mountain to his cell , which was situated at least four hundred feet higher than the lofty projection on which they were standing . Not this way , my son . I go down into the valley , ' he said , pointing down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand feet below in a ravine , in the shadows of which lay half-buried a shepherd 's hamlet . Then you have just come down from the summit , father ? ' Yes ; I have an errand of mercy below to-night . ' It is not often you are found out of your cell , father , when the evening star rises over the peak ; ' said the young man , as he directed his steps away from the cliff-verge and began to descend a precipitous goat-track , that wound down the western side of the Sierra . Slowly they descended together , that youth and aged man , the younger supporting the elder with tenderness , mingled with reverence . The sun sank into a bed of purple clouds , and the soft shadows of advancing twilight began to fall over the beautiful scenes of the valley . The city with its towers and walls , and arching domes , melted into a golden haze , that each instant grew browner and more obscure , till the minarets of the mosque could no longer be distinguished from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The river soon caught the light of the first star , and shortly after the moon , like the half of a large pearl , rose over the Sierra and flung its chaste radiance over grove and river , and softly beaming upon the crescents which the sun had so lately left . Steadily , and firmly , and with the affection of a son , the young mountaincer guided the steps of the noble hermit amid the gathering darkness and gloom of the way ; and ceming at length to a small ledge , which projected about a hundred feet above the hamlet , in the ravine beneath , they paused there to rest . Thanks , my son . Thy arm is as strong as it is willing . It is not often that I need other aid , even in this mountain path , than my own strength . But I have not been well of late ! Thou dost fast too often , I fear father ! ' Nay , it is grief rather than abstinenee that hath weakened me . ' And how much farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for I will accompany thee ? ' Not far ; but I need no aid when I reach the plain . But who comes this way down the glen ? A hunter , and by his garb a Moor . ' The place where they stood was a shelf in a winding path , that led from a mountain pass to the summit of one of the boldest of the Sierras . In the defile itself at the foot of the path was nestled a hamlet of a dozen humble herdsmen 's huts , perched here and there upon the rocky banks of a wild torrent .  --  About one hundred feet above the torrent , and level with the spot on which they were resting , ran a path through the defile , and so to the summit of the mountain to the rear . Both of these paths that led through the defile , and that descending from the cliff by which they had terminated on this natural platform , and joining , formed a single path down to the hamlet . Along this defile way a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and a rich , scarlet Moorish shawl bound round his waist by a morocco belt , to which hung his curved scymeter . His figure was strikingly elegant and commanding . His costume sparkled with silver and jewels . He was slenderly built , had a fine expressive black eye , and handsome features . But his face was now flushed , and his bearing highly excited . He wore a dark mustache . On seeing the two strangers he assumed a hostile and haughty air , and with the fragment of a short hunting spear which he carried , and upon which he slightly leaned as he walked , he menaced them . Stand back , dogs of Christians ! ' he cried haughtily . Hear that my son ! ' said the old hermit , with a flashing eye . I hear it father , ' answered the mountaineer , clenching his hand impulsively ; but we must submit ! I would gladly lay down my poor life that such words might no more be heard on the air of Spain . The time may come father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called my master Beelzebub.  --  His followers must not be startled to be called dogs ! ' Pass , Moor ! ' said the young man in a tone of stern defiance . CHAPTER II . THE YOUTHFUL MOOR . The youthful Infidel , for he had not seen more than twenty summers , strode on with his broken spear advanced , as if he anticipated an attack from the mountaineer ; for in those hostile times every man was likely to meet a foe in every stranger whose path he crossed . He came along the path until he stood before them . The platform of rock was so narrow , that the hermit and the gazelle-tender fully occupied it ; yet the descent of the path lay over it , to which it formed a sort of step . The hermit stood firm ; but the mountaineer by his side gave way as far as he might with safety , to let the young Moorish huntsman pass between them . He hesitated , nevertheless , to go by . The stern glance of the hermit rested upon him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me pass , Christian dog ? ' repeated the Moor with flashing eyes , as he pressed his spear point towards the silvery beard of the venerable apostle of the Cross . The Christian hath turned aside full often for the Infidel , young man . ' I can not pass unless thou move also , ' answered the Moor . I am wounded by the tusk of a boar which I slew but a few paces up the defile , and I hasten to my friends . Let me pass . ' There is fresh blood discoloring his kaftan , father , ' said the mountaineer.  --  He speaks the truth . ' I am deeply hurt in the side . Give way and let me hasten , or thou shalt rue it . My life or thine . ' Nay , if thou art in suffering I will not stay thee , but rather aid thee , Infidel , ' answered the hermit , his brow relaxing its sternness of aspect , and his countenance beaming with benevolence and sympathy . Sit here and let me see thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The young man gazed keenly upon his features with looks of mingled doubt and confidence . The latter feeling prevailed , perhaps aided by his consciousness of his inability to advance forward without some aid ; for he was growing fainter each moment from the loss of blood which was now seen trickling upon his sandalled feet . I will trust thee , Christian , ' he answered faintly , as he sat , or rather sank down upon the rock at their feet ; his spear fell from his relaxed grasp ; a deadly paleness took the place of the flushed brow ; and , inclining his head upon his shoulder , he became insensible in the arms of the young gazelle-keeper . He has now beceme a subject for Christian love and pity , rather than Christian anger , ' said the recluse . Poor youth , though an Infidel , he is a child of Adam , even as we are , and we can not refuse him our aid in extremity . Loosen the shawl , Alfonzo . Carefully , for the wound may be deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The young mountaineer had stood aside , as we have seen , at the imperious and insulting demand of the Moor , to give him room to pass ; for , though he loved not the Infidel , he regarded him as it were a guest upon his mountains , and he did not care to be so uncharitable as to deny him the pathway , open to all . He had stood aside , too , at imminent peril , for the rock below him fell sheer a hundred feet , and he had only his firmness of foot and steadiness of nerve to sustain him while the Moor should pass him . In stepping aside , therefore , he trusted to the Moor 's honor not to jostle him ; for the slightest touch would have sent him headlong . In a word , he had jeopardised his own life out of a spirit of mountain courtesy to the Infidel . It was not a feeling of fear that caused him to obey . The heart of the young gazelle-tender knew nothing of the sensation before man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would not suffer him to yield to a demand made so haughtily and with such epithets . He stood his ground , and would have grappled with the Moor ere he would have recognized the degrading appellation applied to him by obeying . But when he saw the young Moslem bleeding before him , and beheld him sink insensible at his feet , all his humanity dissolved into gentle charity for the sufferer ; and , forgetting the Mahommedan in the man , he extended to him prompt assistance . From his girdle he untied a thick leather pouch , which he hastily opened , and out of it took two little crystal vials and a box of some fragrant unction , which he proceeded to mingle together and pour upon linen torn from the bosom of the Moor . By the time he had prepared this , Alfonzo had removed the shawl and firmly woven garments and laid bare the wound , which was an unsightly rent in the side between the ribs . In a few moments , by the application of the linen saturated with the medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound was then carefully dressed and bound up by the hermit with a degree of skill found at this time only in the art of the surgoon . Now , my son , canst thou bear him on thy shoulders to thy hut in the hamlet ! ' asked the hermit as he completed his Samaritan-like task . We have done our duty to this Infidel , as unto God , and we must not let him lie here and die .  --  We must watch over him till he can take his feet again ! ' I can carry him , father ! ' answered Alfonzo as he raised the lifeless form of the stranger upon his shoulder and proceeded carefully to descend the steep way , the hermit following supporting his steps by the aid of the boar-spear which he had brought from the shelf of rock to return to the Moor when he should recover . In a few minutes , this latter portion of the mountain path being easier of descent than the former , they reached the foot of the mountain and entered all at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , along the rocky borders of the brook and lined on one side with the rude huts of the mountains . Although this hamlet seemed to be , when viewed from Paul 's Rock , in the level of the valley , it was at least seventy feet above it , and the brook of the defile along which it was built , gained the vale only by a succession of wild cataracts , whose roar echoing from the cliff and mountain sides , was heard unceasingly . It was a rude , romantic spot where the hamlet stood , and being so high on the road of the valley and so profoundly concealed by trees that it was visible only to those who from the cliff above could look directly down on its thatched roofs and hugely constructed chimneys . Alfonzo bore the burden on his shoulder along the street of the hamlet , until he came to a hut constructed of stone a little apart from the rest of the habitations . It was sheltered by half a dozen date and banana trees , and a majestic cork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man about forty years of age making a frugal meal of coarse barley bread and dried fish . He wore the dark brown shepherd 's rernagan and broad palm hat , and at his feet crouched a shaggy wolf dog , who upon seeing the approach of Alfonzo and the recluse , glared his white teeth and emitted a savage growl . Who is it , Lopo ? ' questioned the man as he looked through the dim twilight in the direction of the approaching party .  --  Ah , it is the good father , Godefred , and Por Dios ! here comes Alfonzo with a dead man on his shoulder ! ' With these words the goatherd laid his bread and fish down on the root of the tree upon which he had been seated , and hastened to meet them . What is this ? Who have you here ? An Infidel ? We have one less enemy in the land . ' He is not dead father Gaspar , ' answered Alfonzo , as he laid his burden at the foot of the tree . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere he get to his feet again ! '  --  cried the goat herd drawing from his girdle the broad sharp knife that he had used in many a combat with the wolves of the Sierras in defence of his goats . Nay , Gaspar , ' cried father Godfrey , arresting his hand as he aimed a blow at the breast of the lifeless Moor with as little compunction as if the infidel had been a wild beast . The Moslem is thy guest ? You must not harm him . God hath given him to our charity , and we must not show ourselves worse than barbarians by slaying a helpless foe . We found him on the hill at the cross path , he was grievously wounded in combat with a boar and sank at our feet lifeless ; albeit if he had had strength he would not have hesitated to have made his way over our bodies . But when he could no longer do us harm and lay at our feet dying , christian feeling commanded us to bind up his wounds and restore him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark-faced goatherd slowly and reluctantly returning his knife to its sheath of untanned leather . Nay , he will never injure a benefactor , Infidel though he be . The sons of Islam regard hospitality as a sacred duty . So must we Christians . How know you but that we may convert him to the faith of the cross when he shall recover ? Hast thou a spare couch ? He shall have mine , father ! ' answered Alfonzo . That is noble in thee , son . I am glad to see that thy soul is so superior as to not only disdain taking advantage of a fallen foe , but to put thyseif to iuconvenience to entertain him . Gaspar , I see discontent on thy brow still . Thou may'st go into the valley and slay as many Moors as thou wilt , but thou canst not lay thy hand upon the man whom God hath smitten , without sin . Alfonzo bear him into the hut and let him sleep . As he awakes give him this potion dissolved in a glass of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the end of three days he will be able to rejoin his friends in Cordova for by his white hands and his rich costume he is of high lineage among the Moslems . ' And whither go you , father ? ' asked Gaspar . By the mass , I shall not sleep a wink to night with a Mahmoud under my roof . Make the sign of the cross on my door-stone ere thou depart . ' I am glad to see thy faith in the cross my son . It will protect thee and all who believe in it , both in this world and the next , and against infidel and Satan . I will do as thou sayest . ' With these words the venerable apostle knelt upon the threshold after Alfonzo had again lifted the body and bore in into the hut , and reverently made the sign of the cross not only upon the door-stone , but also upon the lintel and sides of the door . The mind of Gaspar seemed from his countenance to be greatly relieved by this strong defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the supernatural evil power attributed to the Saracen . Father Godfrey now approached the rude couch of dried mountain grass , upon which Alfonzo had gently laid the Moor , and by the pleasing light of a torch of resin-wood gazed for a moment upon his pale and strikingly beautiful features . Poor youth ; with so fair a body , and so dark a soul : alas , that it should be lost forever , when Christ hath died for him as well as for thee and me , Gaspar . When I return to the hamlet , which I shall do to-morrow morning early , I will call and see how he fares . If he wake up before dawn , Alfonzo , speak to him kindly ; and let him not rise till I come . Now good night , and God 's benison be on thee and thy house . Father , I will go with thee , ' said Alfonzo , following him out of the hut , and laying his grasp upon his robe . No , son ; I need no aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my staff , by night as well as by day . Watch you by the side of the infidel . Thy conduct this night has made me love thee , Alfonzo . I have often looked upon thee with interest as I have seen thee watching thy gazelles upon the cliffs , and thanked the blessed Virgin that thou wert a son of the church . Thou hast shown true Christian charity to-night . I know thy hatred of the Moslem power , my son , and thy scorn of the infidel name ; and , know therefore , that to extend this kindness to one of the foes of thy church and land , was a great sacrifice of thy fiery spirit . Good night , son . I go on a mission that requires secrecy and needs no companionship , else I would take thee with me . Watch well over thy guest . ' With these words the hermit walked forward , and soon Alfonzo saw his white locks disappear over the verge of the path that led down into the valley . Slowly he returned to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to sleep heavily , and seating himself by his couch , began to examine with a curious eye the jewels with which he was adorned . CHAPTER III . THE SPANISH TOWER . While Alfonzo was admiring the richness of the apparel , and the wondrous beauty of the jewels which adorned the wounded Infidel , Gaspar , his father , sat on the opposite couch gazing moodily and silently upon the pale face of their unconscious guest . At length he spoke , as he saw Alfonzo examine with attention a jeweled bracelet that clasped the left wrist of the Infidel : This tinsel we have to pay for , boy . That red ruby is made of the best blood of Spain . That diamond is made of the congealed tears of the daughters of the land who fill the Infidel 's bosom . These silken vestments are woven from the heart 's fibres of the best men in Spain . What the man has on is not his , but thine and mine . This was said sternly , and with a countenance darkly foreboding the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed upon him a keen glance . He read his father 's thoughts and feelings , for his own bosom sympathized in them . He felt that his words were true words ; that the glory of the Moslem was the degradation of Spain . But he could not enter into his father 's stern resolve to desecrate the hospitality of the roof beneath which , in his arms , he had brought the youthful Saracen , at the command of the holy hermit . Father , you say what no man in Spain can gainsay . But this is no time to talk of such things . This Infidel and all he possesses is sacred . Alfonzo , I am a poor goatherd . I live on coarse fare , I wear coarse garments ; and this poor cabin is my only home . But before the Moor came my father was a noble , of proud Gothic and Roman lineage . He fared sumptuously , he wore purple and dwelt in a palace . All this before the Moor came . I am made poor through the Infidel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a turbaned Emir . My father 's head fell beneath the scymetar of the conqueror Taric . I alone live an exile in the Sierras , remembering the past greatness and present ignominy of my house and name . And this man who lies here , and his , did it . ' He is not twenty yet , father , and it is twenty years since Taric at the battle of Xeres overthrew the Christian power and made Cordova the Saracen capital . At least this young man is innocent . ' Art thou a Moor , that thou should'st speak one word in behalf of one of them ? ' cried Gaspar , with angry vehemence . If he was not one of the conquerors of the land he is one of its dwellers and one of our masters . At this moment thou seest that he has upon his person wealth for a noble . It is not his . The Moors brought nothing into Spain but their scymetars . Yet they have cities and morgues , and slaves , and gold and silver , and wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outvies in regal splendour the court of the Gaul or the Roman Emperor ! All this magnificence hath been coined out of Spanish hearts . I say this Moor 's jewels are mine . I will tear them from him , boy , and send him forth to get more as he got these , by robbing and rapine . I will be a goat-herd no longer and crouch here in fear to show my head in the valley for fear of a Saracen scymetar . I will go to Vence or Rome and live their like a noble as my fathers were . ' The good father Godfrey hath given him to me and thee in sacred charge . I would not touch a hair of his head . Nor , father , shall you so wrong yourself as to harm him ! ' Dost thou menace me ? ' cried Gaspar , laying his hand upon the haft of his knife . No , father . But I would not have it said in the hamlet by our neighbours that the hermit Godfrey brought a wounded Moor to thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got well , and that thou did'st basely rob him . The honest goatherds would cry shame ! ' With this Moor 's gold and jewels I should ere many days be beyond the voices of my neighbours and indifferent to their scorn . Say no more , boy ; I will take his jewels from him ere he wakes to defend them . ' Yes , father , that is right . Go to it like a coward , as becomes the deed you would do . Be careful that he wakes not to scare thee away . I did not believe the best of gold would have made thee forget thy honesty as a man , and thy honour as a Spaniard , to say nothing of thy duty as a host . ' Do you mock me ? I swear to thee , boy , that I will not let this Moor go forth as rich as he came . It is a merit to rob an infidel . It is not robbery , but taking back that which is our own . ' Hear me , father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand rudely to unclasp the dazzling bracelet from his arm . You are a brave man . You have slain in deadliest struggle three score and ten wolves , as the notches on thy boar-spear show to all who will count them . Now wouldst thou by one act of robbery , the robbery of a wounded and sleeping foe , undo all thou hast done , and proclaim thyself a coward . ' I am no coward , boy . ' Then show it by waiting till the Infidel is restored by father Godfrey 's potions to strength and health . Then , ere he departs , tell him what thou wert tempted to do while he lay asleep in thy power , and say that you will now give him a chance to defend his property , for you mean to try and win it of him in fair battle as becomes a brave man . ' I will do it ; by the mass . I will wait , boy , ' responded the stout goatherd , drawing back his hand from the tempting bracelet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rob him . Thank thee , boy , for this hint . His jewels are mine as certainly as if I took them now ; for he must needs he a strong man who can defeat Gaspar , the wolf-killer . ' And as he thus spoke he elevated his broad , herculean chest and gazed with complacency upon his sinewy bare arms as he moved them up and down with athletic pride in their muscular power . Alfonzo looked gratified that he had succeeded by his knowledge of his father 's character , in saving the sleeping Moor from being plundered in their hut . There was in the spirit of Alfonzo a vein of chivalric feeling that elevated him far above his condition ; and though he loved not the tyrant and oppressor of the land , he could be generous and superior to hostility or revenge in circumstances which appealed like the present , to the loftier sentiments of his breast . It was with pleasure he saw the change in the manner of Gaspar , who putting up his formidable knife , looked once more upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient wishes for his speedy recovery . Alfonzo saw that the Moor had nothing more to fear at present from his father , and rising , he said , I will be in by and by and watch with him , till dawn . I leave you , father , to sit up with him till I come back . ' I will do it . You need not fear me , Alfonzo . I am as sure of him when he gets well , as I should be now . Where do you go ? ' Not far . I will be back in two hours . If he wakes , administer what I have mixed in the cup ! ' I will do just as you say . I hope it is a magic drink that will put him on his feet in five minutes after as well as ever . By the mass it would not be many seconds before we should be at it , Christian to Moor . ' Alfonzo threw on his bernish , a coarse brown mantle , like a blanket , about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide belt , to which hung a wolf 's sheathe knife , took his mountain staff and went out . The night was gloriously bright , with burning stars in the deep azure of heaven , rivaling the lustre of the pure moon , which floated like a transparent shell upon a blue sea . The low winds breathed gently among the lime and the date trees , and rustled pleasantly in the pendant foliage of the banana . The mountain crests rose skyward on either hand , as if supporting a group of the fleecelike clouds that hung above them and almost seemed reposing upon them .  --  The roar of the sparkling brook at his feet filled the defile with a constant song that the mountains loved always to hear . The young gazelle-tender walked along the narrow road that led past the few huts that composed the secluded hamlet , and coming to the descent along the side of the water-falls , bounded down the declivity almost with the speed of the leaping cataracts that shone in the moonbeams like ribbons of silver unrolled down the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain in a grove of cork-trees whose heavy shadows left the path-way which wound beneath their huge trunks , in impenetrable darkness . But , at intervals , glimpses of moonlight falling upon the sward through an open space between the branches , lighted him along like beacons gleaming in the deep forest gloom . He pursued his way , not in the direction of the city of Cordova , but following the base of the Sierra , which constantly frowned above his path . At length , after going about a mile , he came suddenly upon a spur of the mountain , and passing round it , he entered a gorge similar to that in which the hamlet stood . He ascended a few rods a grassy but steep path , when getting above the top of the forest trees which he had hitherto been traversing , and which spread before him like a dark green lake slightly agitated by the breeze , he looked up and rested his eyes for an instant upon a tower a few feet above him and overhanging the path . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer angle , and standing on the very verge of the mountain , and at the edge of the defile , like a sentry to protect its passes . It was , however , in ruins , like nearly every strong hold which had once belonged to the Christian inhabitants of the fair valley of Andalusia ; for that it was a Spanish , and not a Moorish fortress , was plain from its age and peculiar construction . The tower had lost a portion of its battlement , and the bastion had been deprived of several feet of its wall at the southern angle . Over it towered two lofty sycamores , like protecting genii . The moonlight fell upon it and exposed both its strength and state of ruin . So has the curse of the infidel blighted all that is fair in Spain , ' said Alfonzo , as he let his eyes linger upon it as it towered over the forest , and looked yet like a strong hold of power even in its impotency . All about the tower was silent and peaceful . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hushed ! The cry of the warrior , the shriek of the fallen , the clangour of steel meeting steel , the roar of warlike engines were silenced . Repose and loneliness and peace seemed to have made it their home . Alfozo , reflecting in this strain , began to ascend a flight of hewn steps that led to the portal of the tower . He passed around the angle of the ruined bastion , and came all at once upon a neat whitewashed kasah , or vine-dresser 's cottage , sheltered by the wall of the tower on one side , and by the face of the cliff on the other . It was before its door that the two sycamores grew . The moonlight fell full and pleasantly upon the small green plat adorned with roses and blossoming flowers , before the door , and revealed a spot of loveliness rarely found in such a remote and secluded region . The cottage or casah was built of stone from the bastion , in a neat manner , was flat-roofed , and its spotless white walls were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , so profusely that it resembled a bower . Before the door was a bench , and under each of the two windows was a bench , on which humble vases of flowers were placed , half veiling the casement . The little space between the door and the wall was about forty feet wide , green as soft verdure could make it , and containing little plots of mountain plants and the two gigantic sycamores . Back of the cottage rose sublimely into the starry heavens the wooded face of the Sierra . To the south , through an opening between the mountain and the bastion , was a glimpse over forest , garden , plain , and fertile meadow , of the white minarets of Cordova , beyond which remoter far , against the margin , like blue-tinted shadows , the faintly-seen masses of the Sierra Nevada . Alfonzo lingered an instant as he came upon this little paradise , as if fearing to disturb its peaceful beauty by his presence . He then , with his finger on his lip , walked softly forward , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge dog bounded from the shadow of the building , and without a voice , other than a low , fierce growl , leaped towards him , as if he would rend him . But , ere he made the second bound , he crouched at his feet and whined recognition . Alfonzo patted the shaggy beast upon his head and then tap ped at the window , by the side of which hung , like trophies , rather than for present use , an old shield and two or three sheathed yatagans , belonging to the owner of the cottage . He tapped a second time , and then , putting aside the trellis , looked in . The moon-beams that he admitted showed a small neat chamber , with a spotless couch , but no occupant . Voices fell upon his ear from an inner room . He was about to leave the window to enter by the door , when a hand was lightly laid upon his shoulder , and a musical voice pronounced gladly , but in a low tone , his name . CHAPTER IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , and , with an exclamation of delight , clasped to his heart a lovely maiden of a beautiful form and an air of wild mountain grace , mingled with a modesty so captivating , a bearing so proud and free , that she seemed a fit mate for the noble , manly gazelle-keeper , who was gazing so affectionately into her dark moon-lit eyes . Such eyes ne'er had gazelle as hers . So large , and bright , and starry , and so beaming with love and the tenderness of passion . Genilla , ' he said , I feared you were away again . I was just about entering the door to seek you . ' Allah be praised that you did not ! ' she answered fervently . I am so glad you are come . It is three days  --  three long days , Alfonzo since I have seen you . ' I have seen you every moment , dearest Genilla . I have to look into my heart to find your image there always . ' And do you think I forget you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have had much trouble with my gazelles of late . They have four times , in the last three days , wandered far out of their usual track upon the mountains , and I have spent many hours in search of them . The night before last I was upon the mountain till dawn . ' How I tremble when I reflect upon your dangers at such times , dear Alfonzo , ' said the dark-eyed girl , looking up into the face of her lover with beaming eyes that seemed moistened with tears of affectionate solicitude . One false step in those hours of darkness , and you would perish ! Would that you could turn to some other pursuit , my noble Alfonzo . Oh , that you would listen and be persuaded to  --  ' Not a word more , Genilla , ' he said playfully , yet firmly ; I know what you would say . I am a Christian and not a Moor ! ' You should , for my sake , seek the service of the Emir , ' she continued warmly . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my people ! ' For thy sake , I would do them good and not evil . For thy sake I have done them kindness , when it was in my power to injure them . But more than this , I can not . I would rather be the free gazelle-keeper upon the mountains , exposed to death by the precipices and the wolves , rather than take service with the chiefs of thy race . Speak no more to me upon this subject , Genilla ! ' The maiden folded her fair hands upon her bosom , and sighed and remained silent . Alfonzo led her gently along a narrow walk , bordered with wild flowers , which wound round the cottage , and thence held its serpentine way up the mountain . They walked on a little way together , until they came to a smooth rock , hollowed out beneath a trickling mountain stream , that had filled the cavity . A few gold and silver fishes glanced about in the pool , their glittering scales reflecting the moonlight , as it found its way to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crevice in the rock , and bent gracefully over it . There was a stone bench against the natural wall by the fountain , and a bed of moss before it for the feet to rest upon . Let us sit here , Genilla , ' said Alfonso , as he drew her gently to the seat . How delicately the distant minarets sparkle in the beams of the young moon , which looks upon a hundred rivals in Cordova ! Would it were the cross the moon shone upon . Father Godfrey says that he remembers when a hundred golden crosses caught , and flung back the glory of the morning sun . Would those good days were come again , Genilla . But I see that you like not the subject . I know , if I love thee , I must love thee as thou art ; but would to God thou wert a Christian ! ' Would to Allah thou wert a true believer , Alfonzo ! ' said the maiden , earnestly , her dark eyes lighting up with beautiful enthusiasm . We will not talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tapped at thy window , and where were you , Genilla , when I came ? ' I was in the tower looking for thee , and listening for thy step . I expected thee to-night , for if thou hadst not come I should have been sad and filled with fears of thy safety . I saw thee come up the path and listen at the lattice . I came out of the tower and touched thee just in time to keep thee from entering rashly . ' Who is with thy father ? ' The Chistian hermit . ' Not father Godfrey ! ' exclaimed Alfonzo , with amazement . Yes . He came about a quarter of an hour ago . I was in my lattice singing to my littah when I beheld his tall , majestic figure crossing the green to the door . I trembled , I hardly knew why ; but since he used to come and talk to me of Christ , I have feared him . Yet I would have warned him , for thy sake , that my father , Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this purpose , supposing he had come as heretofore to persuade me to become a Christian , to tell him his danger , when seeing me he directly asked for Ben Osmin . ' Asked for the stern Moor ? ' Yes . He said to me , Daughter , I would see thy father . Lead me to him ! ' And you obeyed ? ' While he was speaking , Wolf , the dog , was making a deep growling noise which brought my father to the door . Upon seeing him I expected I knew not what scene of horror , for my father loves not a Christian . But upon seeing the hermit , for the moon showed him plainly to him , he advanced with courtesy and taking bis hand , said , Enter , Christian in the name of Allah . ' This is surprising . It was hither then that the father was coming . ' He seemed to be expected . My father led him into the house , and at the same time bade me walk awhile in the moon-light as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I wandered into the tower and stood in the window waiting for you and wondering at this strange visit of the hermit to my father . ' It is strange indeed . I know not what it can mean . He can not hope to convert Ben Osmin . Yet he and Ben Osmin can have no business together in common . It is very strange that the holy father should leave his mountain lodge at night to come hither . ' Perhaps they have business together . In Cordova Christian and Infidel traffic together , jostle each other in the Bazaars , and dwell at peace within the same walls . Why should not two meet here ? Are not you and I proof that they may , Alfonzo ? ' she asked , smilingly . But I have not inquired of thee how that fair mountain maid , thy sister , is ? ' Xariffa is well , and each day wishes thou wert a Christian . ' Then she knows her brother loves the daughter of the Moor ? ' I have told her . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Oh , no ; she said that she hoped I should be the instrument in leading you to the truth . Twice only have you met each other , but often enough , I know , to be mutually interested in one another . She is very beautiful ! I love her because she is so like you I saw in her eyes and in her smile the smile and eyes I love . ' The consciousness that I am beloved by you , Genilla , is bliss to me . I dwell upon your sweet image when I am alone upon the mountain , I dream of you in the night . The stars remind me of the light of your eyes , the singing of the birds of your voice . Were it not for you  --  for my love for you  --  ' Well , Alfonzo , why do you place your face between your hands and heave a sigh so sad ? ' I can not breathe the words that came to my lips . It may not be . Yet I do not fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfonzo ? ' she said with accents of touching reproach . Fear Genilla ! I thought our hearts , our hopes , our lives , were one . ' No , I do not fear to trust you , dearest girl , though our faiths differ , our hearts beat as one heart in one bosom . You shall hear all I would have said . But for my love for thee , instead of serving the Moor in the Emir 's guard as thou wouldst have me , I would take up arms against him were there a Chief to be found in Spain . These words from thee ! This spirit in the bosom that Genilla believed throbbed only for himself ! wouldst thou indeed arm this hand which now holds mine in its bound grasp with the steel of war to pierce the heart of my father , of my countryman ! ' Do not take my words with such spirit , Genilla ! There is no need ! God knows we have no leader in Spain . The land is sunk in bondage to the Moor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mosque has displaced the cathedral ! The Priests of God are flown into Italy or have perished by the sword , or live exiled in the mountains like the holy father Godfrey himself , once the Abbot of the richest monastery in Spain . Chiefs we have none . Our nobles are out-laws ; our Princes have perished . The Moor reigns in the palace of Amalarie and the Convent of the Blessed Virgins has become a harem for Algezir the Eimr . Thou mayest , therefore , laugh , but not be angry at my words ; for they are only words . They will never be more than words ! ' Alfonzo , I will neither laugh nor be angry . It is natural that you should feel as you do , being a Spaniard and a Christian . But look ! behold the cloud of glittering crescents that shines above the walls of Cordova ! These should show you that the power of the Prophet is established in the land and that the followers of the Nazarene have no more hope ! You should therefore cease to dwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules of my people . It can not be remedied .  --  The destiny of your race is sealed .  --  The Prophet is fated to hold empire here forever . Be wise , then , cling no longer to a crushed and fallen faith , and embrace that of the true Apostle of God ! ' I know there is no hope , at least I see none , Genilla ! But I can never rest quietly under the yoke of Islam . I can never become a follower of the False Prophet ! ' Be it so . So that we love let there be peace between us ! ' said the maiden laying her hand upon his shoulder and looking up affectionately into his serious face . This is heavy conversation for us , Alfonzo . Let me sing to thee ! You are gloomy and I will sing thee a lively ballad . It shall be of the fortunes of an Andalusian maiden who was taken captive by Taric the Conqueror ! ' No , I care not to listen now to songs of Moorish valor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the subject of the interview between the father Godfrey and Ben Osmin . ' When he has gone , my father , who keeps no secrets from me , will tell me , then shalt thou know ! Did you see ought of a hunting party from Cordova , on the mountains to-day ? ' Did one pass here ? ' asked Alfonso quickly . Through the defile below , within a quarter of a mile . But they were half concealed by the trees , yet I could see it was a brave show of arms and horses , banners and silks , with lively bugling . How large a party ? ' No less than three score . It was an Emir at the very least . No doubt they went into the mountain to hunt wolves . ' If they were keepers of goats on the Sicrras , they would see little pastime in hunting the wolf . When did you say they went by ? ' About an hour after the sun was up . ' Then none of them have come back that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yon defile and returned to the city . ' I heard hunters on the hills to the southward of me during the day , and about noon a wounded wolf dashed howling past me as I was dining from my wallet a thousand feet up the mountain . I have yet more to tell thee . As I was coming down the Sierra path with father Godfrey , a youthful Moor , richly attired and armed with a shattered boar-spear , came into the path ; and , the way being narrow , and we being in it resting , he sternly bade us stand aside , and suffer him to precede us down the mountain ! ' And what did you ? ' she asked earnestly . I thought of you and stood aside .  --  But the holy hermit remained firm . The Moor advanced upon him as if to run him through , and I had raised my hand to catch the spear when the young infidel sunk upon his knees and fell over lifeless and bleeding ! ' A miracle performed by the hermit ! ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a short time before wounded by a boar 's tusk , and was hastening from the mountains when he met us . But his strength failed him and he fell senseless at our feet . ' CHAPTER V. THE EMIRS . The young Moorish girl , upon hearing the account given thus by her lover , prepared her mind to hear of the death of the Saracen hunter by his hand . He saw by the expression of her countenance that she expected him to announce this to her . He quietly answered her suspicions by a smile ere he said : And doubtless you believe that I left him there to die , Genilla , or that I hastened his end with my steel 's point ? ' I know not what you did . I pray you let me know quickly . I would know whether I sit by the side of a murderer of one of my countrymen ! ' she said haughtily . I raised him upon my shoulders , after father Godfrey and I had dressed his wounds , and bearing him down the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut . I left him there an hour ago asleep , and under my father 's charge . Before I left the hermit took his departure , bidding me take good care of him , and when he awoke administer a cordial which he left . In this way did I avenge my countrymen 's wrongs upon thine , Genilla ! ' Forgive me , Alfonso . ' Thou hast not offended . It was natural that you should suppose I should hate the Moor ; but I thought of thee and treated him as if he had been my brother . Besides , he being wounded , I looked upon him as an object of benevolence rather than of enmity . Beneath my father 's roof sleeps in peace the Infidel , who tomorrow , if he were well and strong , would not hesitate to level it to the ground , and give our heads to the scymetar . ' Judge them not so harshly , Alfonso . Thou hast done a noble deed . This shall be remembered by me whenever I hear thee , in thy excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this Moor ? ' I know him not I have seldom seen , Saracen though he be , a nobler face . ' You said his costume was rich ! ' Very ; and he wore a prince 's ransom in jewels about his person . ' Wore he a green turban ? ' Yes . ' He is a descendant of the Prophet . He is one of the sons of the Emir , I doubt not . Did you see a ring on his finger with a green stone in it ? ' Yes , ' Did you examine the device ? ' A key . ' Then thy guest is a Prince , Alfonzo . ' Sayest thou so ! ' These are the insignia of an Emir . ' There are a score of Emirs in the realm of Cordova who since the assassination of Prince Ayub Musa have been aspiring to the Emir 's throne . Which can this be ? ' I know not . It should be one of the first rank . It was his train who passed this morning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the guest of the Christian herdsman Gasper . What can have become of his followers ? ' He must , in the ardor of pursuit , have wandered from them . No doubt they are seeking him still on the mountain . ' Yes . Hear that winding bugle . I have heard it twice before , but mistook it for the lowing of kine . They still seek him . ' Genilla , whether the wounded Moor be an Emir or not , I am ignorant . He is a Moor , which is the same to me.  --  Were he a water-carrier of Cordova , he should be as sacredly my guest . But I do not wish his followors to find him in my cabin . It is a quiet home into which the foot of the Saracen has never yet intruded . So , if to-night those who seek him should pass this way by the tower aud ask for him , let it not be known that you know where he is . ' What shall I answer them ? ' Say you have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince is safe , though wounded . ' Send them not to my quiet home to seek him . Father Godfrey says that in three days he will be restored to health . He shall then depart . I will guide him to Cordova in safety . For thy sake he shall go free , were he the Imperial Caliph of Damascus . ' I will obey you , Alfonso . ' Thanks . Thou knowest that I have a fair and dearly loved sister . Her beauty in these dangerous times is her greatest snare . Let the eyes of any of these Saracen knights light upon her modest beauty , and the sweet flower of my humble home would be plucked , though I should perish in her defence . Send them not thither , Genilla , if thou lovest me ! ' I will not , Alfonzo . ' Thanks . Three days away from Cordova will not be long . I would show him how a Christian peasant can show hospitality to a Moorish prince , if prince he be , as he may be , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the descendants of the prophet wear the green turban , and only a Prince of the line , the signet graven with a key , the insignia of the Morisco Empire . ' Be it so . There sounds afar off another bugle . Sound on Infidel ; thy leader sleeps soundly and hears thee not . ' Hist . There are footsteps . It is my father and the hermit . See , they walk forth together . They take leave of each other with ceremony , and he departs . ' How strange . May it not be that Ben Osmin is a Christian ? ' My father false to his faith , ' repeated the maiden , with a haughty air . Sooner , Alfonzo , wilt thou find Genilla false to thee . ' And yet thou art false to me , sweet Genilla , so long as thou refusest to become a Christian . But hither comes Ben Osmin . Shall I meet him boldly ? He knows I love thee . ' And he hath forbidden me on pain of death to hold interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Draw thy steel against my father ? Retire within the shadow of the rock . You can not pass him unseen . Wert thou only a Moslem , Alfonzo , ' she said , reproachfully , this secresy need not be . Hide quickly ? ' Alfonzo drew back half a dozen steps so that the acacia , aided by a projection in the rock , effectually concealed his per son to the eye of a casval observer . The beautiful Moorish girl then advanced to meet her father who was calling her by name . Ho , Genilla . Where art thou , child ? Here , father . ' Allah be praised , ' ejaculated the old man , as he came forward . He was a short fleshy man , in a huge white turban , a black kaftan , and red sash in which was stuck a yataghan . His trowsers were of white linen of the amplest volume about the red slippered feet . Ben Osmin was a Mooor by birth , and had been captain of a galley in the fleet which brought over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great fame and some wealth in the taking of Cordova , and settled down to enjoy himself after his wars on land and his perils by flood . He was a person of cheerful temper , and had a rare talent at making the most of the sources of happiness in his way . He was a bachelor , that is , he had no harem , for he had a great horror of a sex that had no souls , and to whom the Prophet denied even a corner in Paradise . But one day , as Ben Osmin sat upon his Divan , thinking of nothing in particular , as was his custom , ( for pipe smoking in that early age was unknown , ) and sipping sherbert through a silver tube , a slippered Moor in blue caftan and soiled turban came near and said , Salaam , Ben Osmin . Here is a bale of rich shawls the Mufti hath sent thee for thy valour in the wars in defence of the true faith . ' Allah be praised , and Paradise be to the Mufti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take this gold plece and say the words I have spoken to the Mufti . The slave departed hastily , thrusting the gold piece into his girdle as he went out . Ben Osmin now fixed his eyes upon the bale of shawls with glances of mingled admiration and delight . The size of the bale , the beauty of the covering , the courtesy of the Mufti , and the reflection that his bravery was remembered , made his eyes sparkle , and overflowed his heart with joy and universal benevolence . Allah be praised . ' God is God , ' he ejaculated more than seven times , with an interval of at least three minutes between each ejaculation . At length he laid aside his sherbet tube , and clapped his hands thrice . An African slave in white turban and white tunic entered , and bowed reverently before Ben Osmin his master . Hussan , thou seest that bale of rich shawls ! It is a present from the Mufti , the defender of the Faith , to me Ben Osmin in consideration of the skulls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unloose the cords . Let me feast my eyes on the gift of the Mufti Allah be praised forever . ' The African approached the bale of shawls , and undoing the cords by which it was bound cast them aside , and then unrolled the outer shawl . Beard of the Prophet ! what have we there ? ' cried the amazed Ben Osmin , as the removal of the shawl revealed a wicker basket open at the top , in which lay fast asleep a sweet little infant about a month old . The slave fell back in amazement , and showed his glittering teeth from ear to ear , while the warlike Moor stroked his beard several times with rapidity and ejaculated , Allah be praised ! Hussuf what seest thou ? ' An infant , Effendi ! ' By the harem of the Soldan  --  how is it that my bale of shawls hath turned into the child of a woman ! God is good !  --  What must be , is to be . Allah be praised ! ' With these exclamations of astonishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basket , that he might look at it the closer . Mishallah ! ' he cried , it is fair to look upon , though something small ; but please Allah it will grow . What is that in the bottom of the basket ? ' he cried , pointing to a piece of parchment , on which were traced certain characters in Arabic . Place it in my hands ! ' The slave obeyed , and Ben Osmin read as follows : To the discreet and brave Ben Osmin , health and peace , Greeting :  --  This gift is sent thee by one who honors thee . Shawls will decay , and time tarnishes their beauty ; but a soul is immortal . Let Ben Osmin see that the infant be cared for , for he himself is a child in the hand of Allah , and is daily fed from the stores of his bounty . God is good and Mahomet is his prophet ! ' Bismillah ! ' exclaimed Ben Osmin ; a child is better than a bale of shawls . Hussuf , seek out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have to answer for its life to Isfrael . ' The slave disappeared on his errand , and soon returned with the wife of Aben Hassen , the turban-maker in the next street , who pledged herself to take charge of the infant till it should walk for a gold betsch the month . Allah be praised ! ' said Ben Osmin , as the woman departed with the babe and he resumed the silver pipe of his sherbet cup . A child is better than a bale of shawls . I will call it Genilla , and it shall be a shawl of love to my heart when I get old . ' So Ben Osmin named the infant Genilla , which signified a shawl of silk , and every day he walked to Hassan 's shop to have a sight of his protege , in which he took increasing interest as it began to advance to take notice of him , and by and bye to amuse him with its smiles and prattle . Bismallah ! ' he said one day to Hassan , here am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter in all Andalusia . Allah be praised ! ' The infant Genilla grew apace to girlhood , and , when she had reached her twelfth year , gave promise of being the fairest maiden in Cordova . Old Ben Osmin worshipped her with pride and love . But at length the Emir or Imperial Caliph , who held the government under the sceptre of the Caliph of Damascus , the Emperor of all Islam , died . It was necessary to send to Damascus to learn who should be his successor . In the interval , two of the principal Emirs , who had been generals of Taric the Conqueror , aspired to the vice-royalty to govern till the return of the messenger . This aspiration created two parties in the city , and , in a severe battle that took place between them , both were slain .  --  But , hydra-like , no less than eleven Emirs now raised their standards and asserted their claims to the Caliphate . At this juncture , Suleyman , who reigned in Barbary , interposed and appointed Abury Musa , the nephew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . But in a few weeks Musa was assassinated by Algezir , a powerful Emir , and once more Cordova was the scene of civil war between the Moors . At length the new Emir arrived from Damascus , but only to find his throne in the hands of Algezir . He raised the standard of the Prophet against him , and calling on all good Moslems to rally around it , he advanced upon Cordova , and defeating the Emir 's forces , eompelled him to fly to the Sierras for safety .  --  He took refuge in the tower beneath which Ben Osmin now dwelt so peacefully , and , after enduring a long siege , was compelled to yield at discretion . As he was an Emir , and the blood of the Prophet flowed in his veins , his blood was not shed , but he was banished to Africa . The Caliph thus won his throne . Ben Osmin had joined the Caliph , and for his instrumentality in bringing about the capture of the Emir in his tower , he had been rewarded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hither , therefore , he came to dwell ; but , instead of inhabiting the tower , he constructed , with great taste , for the comfort of his foster daughter rather than his own , the cottage adjoining it : and here for four years he had been dwelling in peace , undisturbed by the commotions that from time to time rended the city . For the Caliph had not been two years on his throne , ere the Emir , Algezir , returned , raised a standard of rebellion , deposed him to be in his turn overthrown by a conspiracy of fourteen Emirs , who , too jealous to concede power to either singly , reigned conjointly , but each watching an opportunity to reign alone . CHAPTER VI . THE WOLF-SLAYER . The Moor , Ben Osmin , had remained in quiet at his cottage by the tower during all the warlike excitement in the city ; and so that he was undisturbed in the society of Genilla , and in the culture of his acre of vineyard , he was content , and it mattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reigns of government in Cordova . Allah be praised ! ' he repeated a second time on beholding his foster daughter approaching him from the fountain behind which Alfonzo had concealed himself . I was afraid thou hadst wandered away , and , by the beard of the Prophet , the neighborhood is none of the safest for a maiden to trust herself in.  --  Hearest thou the bugles of the hunters among the hills ! I would rather they that blow them would keep there than come nigher my dovecote . There are unruly gallants always to be found in an Emir 's hunting train ! Hast thou been lonely , child ? ' he asked , taking her hand and addressing her with great kindness , and a countenance sparkling with the deep affection of his heart . No , father , ' she answered , richly colouring and dropping with slight confusion the lids of her dark Arabian eyes . I am right glad of it , for I had business that kept me . ' Business , father ? What couldst thou have to say to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet , ' answered Ben Osmin , smlling . I ne'er heard of a woman that could keep a secret . But one day , perhaps , I may tell thee , but not now . ' I do not like secrets , father . ' Then , Mishillah ! thou shalt not be troubled with this . ' I mean I do not like them when I dont't know them . ' Oh , that is it . By the beard of the Prophet ! when thou knowest it , a secret it is no longer . ' I will find it out ere long , dear father ! ' Dost thou threaten me , pretty one ? ' I will ask the hermit Godfrey . ' Thou ? ' cried Ben Osmin with alarm . I will go up the mountain to his cave and he will not refuse to tell me , ' she said with playful firmness . Daughter , thou must not go near this Christian monk . Thy words have alarmed me . Go not nigh him . Pass no words with him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for me . ' Is it so serious , then ? ' It is . He might tell thee what I refuse to tell . It is not good for thee to know it . Besides , what he says may be false . I will yet talk further with him after I have been to Cordova , and then I may tell thee ! ' Art thou going to Cordova ? ' cried the maiden with delight beaming in her beautiful face . You will take me with you , good dear Ben Osmin ! ' and as she spoke she entwined her graceful arms about his bearded throat and kissed his smooth well-fed cheek with the most winning temptation . Do not say no ! ' By the turban of the Prophet , what can I say ? ' responded the Moor in perplexity . Thou must stay at home . I have business . ' It is so lonely here ! I have not seen the city since I was a child . ' You can not go , child . The city is in sight from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish to go there ! ' It is a dangerous time to take thee there . Any day a revolution may break out . The Emirs are as jealous of each other as so many wolves watching a goat-pen . I should not be surprised to hear that some one of them had raised the green standard and proclaimed himself Supreme Caliph . It would not be afe for thee there . Besides , I am afraid of the gay Saracen cavaliers and rampant Andalusian knights that might rob me of thee ! Praised be Allah ! thou art secure here , and no one of them knoweth what a treasure is hid here ! Do n't ask me , Genilla . ' I am not afraid of the knights and cavaliers , father ! ' Bismillah ! I would have thee afraid of them . Thou shalt stay here . ' If thou leavest me , father , I will go up the mountain while thou art gone , and see the Christian Monk . ' The Prophet knew what he was about when he shut Paradise against women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be praised that is settled ! ' I am so delighted ! I shall now see the beautiful city , the splendid mosques , the palaces , the knights and cavaliers , the princes ' and ladies . Oh , dear Ben Osmin , how very happy I shall be . You are so good . ' On my soul be it ! Three women like thee would keep a man from Paradise . ' When do you go , dear father ? ' asked the gazelle-eyed Genilla , as she hung fondly upon his shoulder . I must go early in the morning . I will ride on horseback , and thou shalt have the mule accoutred , and amble by my side . ' I shall dream only of Cordova all night , father ! ' We must to our beds , if we are to start so early . In the city there still lives old Aben Hassan , the turban-maker , and I will have thee at his house . It is retired and out o ' the way o ' the range o ' the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I will , father , in a moment , ' she answered , slipping back towards the fountain ; I have left my bracelet on the stone bench under the acacia . How could you drop your bracelet ? But get it and come in , for it is a heavy dew . ' Genilla did not tell him that her lover had accidentally unclasped it from her wrist , for it would have been to betray his presence which she wished to conceal from him . She saw her father go round the cottage to enter it , and then picking up her bracelet she approached Alfonzo , who came forth from his hiding place , and clasped her hand . Now you must go without delay , Alfonzo ! ' she said quickly . If I linger my father will return , and discover you ! To-morrow night I shall be back from the city . I shall then see you and have a great deal to tell you . ' I would rather you would not go to Cordova , dearest Genilla , ' said Alfonzo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Ben Osmin says , it is a dangerous place for a maiden , so fair as thou art ! ' Jealous already , dear Alfonzo , ' said the Moorish beauty , bearing upon him her splendid eyes , while her delicate fingers tapped playfully his cheek .  --  Fear me not ! I shall fall in love with none of the young Emirs at court . Besides , I am but a poor humble girl , the daughter of a vintner . I fear not that any admiring eye will be turned upon me . I shall be safe in my obscurity , and the humility of Aben Hassan 's house .  --  I only wish to gaze on the magnificence of which I have heard so much , and of which I retain a girlish memory . ' I will say no more lest thou shouldst suppose I fear any knight should look on thee . If I thought thou lovedst me because thou hast seen no other man , I should little prize thy love , Genilla , and might fear it could be turned from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend his gaze on the ! But I know thee better , and can trust thee even in the gay and free city of Cordova ! ' I shall return to value and love thee more . If thou only wert a follower of the true faith ,  --  but I see a frown gathering upon thy brow . We will let faiths alone . We will love for this world alone ; faiths belong to a hereafter . ' Not wholly , dear Genilla ! But we will not embitter this brief parting moment by a subject on which , I fear , we can never see alike . One day I trust to see thee turn from a religion which denies to woman immortality , and embrace that of the son of Mary , the beloved Virgin mother , through whom all women are blessed and honoured evermore . Good night , love ! I will be here again tomorrow night at this hour ! ' I will see thee at the fountain ! ' Has Ben Osmin spoken about me of late ? ' But once . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn to pieces by wolves , he said , He is a brave youth , and were he a good musselman , he would be glad to see thee at the tower . But since he found us conversing together in the path at the foot of the rock , and saw that we liked one another too well , he forbade me to see you , as he forbade you to think of me mere . He is grateful to you for the service you did me , very grateful , but he can never forgive you for being a Christian . ' The lovers now parted , and Genilla entered the cottage , casting many a lingering look behind , while Alfonzo , with a thoughtful brow , walked slowly down the tower hill and descended into the forest path , in the gloom of which he was soon threading his way back to the hamlet . We have alluded to a service done by Alfonzo to the Moorish maiden , and which was the foundation of their first acquaintance and of their love . Alfonzo had been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keeper of goats and gazelles ; such being the occupation of Gaspar , who having fled to the Sierras from the sword of the Moors , turned himself to this as a means of subsistence . Gaspar was a noble of Spain , a man of uncalculating mind , but of great courage and integrity . He had lost his possession with the rest of his caste , and houseless he fled to the hills with hundreds of his countrymen . Many perished from hunger , many secreted themselves in caves and lived by hunting , more banded themselves as robbers of their conquerors , and lived by rapine ; while others joined themselves with the dwellers of the mountains and became herdsmen . Among these was Gaspar , the rough hearted , strong handed noble . He soon became attached to his occupation , for there was a certain excitement in it . Wolves constantly prowled in packs to way-lay and destroy his charge , and the fiercer banded exiles of the hills sallied forth upon his flocks to plunder them for sustenance . In defending his herds against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prowess that made him respected and feared in all the Sierras.  --  The fame of Gaspar the Wolf-killer had reached even the streets and marketplaces of Cordova . Trained in such a school , Alfonzo grew up fearless and skilful , and became a conqueror in many a fierce contest upon the mountains with the beasts and robbers that infested it . Side by side with his father , and aided only by a huge wolfdog , he had put to flight and defeated a band of twelve famished robbers who had pounced upon his flock ; till at length his herds roamed and browsed with safety upon the loneliest places of the hills , while the flocks of others were daily diminished . At length the mountaineers , unable longer to endure the ravages upon their flocks resolved to band together , and hunt the bandits from their fastnesses in the Sierras . They assembled to the number of four score , each attended by his fierce wolf-dog , a formidable opponent to an armed man . Over this small but resolute force they appointed Gaspar as captain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months before the opening of our story . The expedition was assembled secretly and went forth secretly . It was successful . The robbers , taken by surprise , were defeated in every encounter . They were driven from their strong holds , and from the Sierras for several leagues space . Alfonzo covered himself with glory by his bravery as well as distinguished himself by his judgment and military skill . Gaspar openly confessed that the whole success of the expedition was owing to the resolution and courage of Alfonzo , an assertion to which all the mountaineers gave their loudest testimony . The young gazelle-keeper received their praises with that modesty which always accompanies true bravery , and from that hour he was the hero of the Sierras ; and the fame of Alfonzo the Destroyer , as his enemies , the dispersed bandits , universally denominated him , penetrated the palaces of the Emirs , and his deeds found commendation from the lips of the youthful Moorish cavaliers that hung about the court . Up to this hour Alfonzo had not seen the fair Moorish maiden who dwelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHAPTER VII . THE MOORISH SONGSTESS . The young mountaineer , a few weeks after his gallant conquest over the banditti of the hills , was seated upon an elevated peak , watching the browsing goats and bounding gazelles of his flock , dispersed around him and beneath his feet . From the position which he had chosen for the purpose of keeping his charge full in sight , there was a view of the tower and the roof of the cottage of Genilla at the foot of the mountain on the eastern side . He had often gazed down upon this secluded place from the height upon which he now reclined , his dog Ban by his side , his boar-spear lying across his knee , and his eyes sharply wandering over the erratic herd , which he had in keeping , ready to send his watchful dog to bring back any one of the flock that seemed disposed to stray . He had heard that a Moor dwelt in the white walled cot , and this knowledge was sufficient to keep him from ever approaching it , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mountain and draw his steps near the tower in his search after it . Still he never went nigher the dwelling of the Moor than was necessary . He had heard , too , that the Moor who dwelt there had a fair daughter . More than this , he knew not . He had not heard even her name . Perhaps those from whom he heard it , never known it ; as there was but little communication between the conquered Christian and the conquering Infidel . It was a sunny afternoon . The bright green undulations of the plain at his feet were relieved by dark lines of forest , or enlivened by the groves and gardens . The air was so transparent that Cordova , though two good leagues distant at the shortest , seeemed as if the hand could be laid upon it . Every object was singularly distinct and beautifully defined in every variation of its out-line . The Guadalquiver , above and below the city , beneath the walls of which it was lost for a while to the eye , shone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with flags shooting up and down the stream . The villas and terraces , groves and gardens , mosques and minarets , that stood upon its banks were reflected from it as from a mirror . The various winding roads that led across the plain from the mountains or the river gorges , towards the gates of the city , were here and there enlivened by groups of travellers , or now and then a single horseman coursing along like the wind , marking his passage by a long cloud of dust . Near the city glittered the tents of a caravan of merchants about to set out on their journey into Gaul , and winding through the defile came slowly in sight a weary company that had three weeks before crossed the Pyrennees to barter their goods for Moorish gold . A troop of Saracen cavalry were just entering a forest on the right , with sounding bugles and banners flaunting . The young mountaineer 's eye wandered listlessly over scenes long familiar to his eye and then let his gaze rest upon the little Morisco cottage a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of a female figure , which even at that distance , he could discern , was youthful and graceful . It at once occurred to him that it was the Moor 's fair daughter of whom he had heard . A little closer scrutiny assured him that she wore the turban and white flowing trousers of the Saracen maiden . He at once became interested in her motions . She was , it seemed to him , engaged in training plants in the little green court-yard . He could see every movement of her white arms , and he felt confident she was gathering flowers . Once or twice she paused and seemed to be looking upward to the mountain , as if she had discovered him perched upon the pinnacle against the blue sky . She then suddenly disappeared . In a few moments a Moor came out and she was by his side . They walked along the terrace and sat down by the fountain . He now knew that he saw the Moor and his daughter . Hark ! He bends his ear eagerly and listens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would float a thistle down . Suddenly the notes of music come up the sky , floating on the air like some celestial melody . Far distant and faint as it is , it is inconceivably sweet , and for its very remoteness seems to him to come from heaven . At intervals a richer , clearer , more thrilling note would reach his ear , when his cheek would tingle and his dark , handsome eyes beam and expand with a new delight . The song went on . He could not distinguish a word , for it was doubtless Arabic ; but had it been his native Andalusian tongue , the far depth would have rendered words undistinguishable . He could not , moreover , hear only now and then a wild , seraphine strain that made his very heart-strings vibrate with the sweetest sensations . He forgets his gazelles ! he forgets where he is ! He forgets that the songstress is the daughter of a Moor . He is enchanted , bewildered , and , for the moment , lost ! The music ceases . The singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the cliff , and he sees her appear no more , though he watched an hour , hoping to hear once more that voice of passion and melody . At length he rose to his feet , and his cheek burned with shame that he had suffered his heart to be stirred by the scarcely heard song of a Moorish maiden . He felt that he had done a great evil , and yielded to a temptation that his conscience would not acquit him of ; for it was no small portion of the Christian faith of that day and nation to hate the Infidel . Hatred of the other was usually a good test of the orthodoxy of either Mahommedan or Christian . Alfonzo felt , therefore , that in suffering his senses to be beguiled for a moment by the syren song of an Infidel maid he had grievously sinned ; for he had lively religious scruples , and as become the fashion of the time , so far as belief in the Romish miracles was concerned , was a faithful son of the Church . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hermit Godfrey , who often seeing him when a lad out upon the hills with his gazelles , had taken a deep interest in him , and taken much pains to teach him all that was needful to make a good Catholic of him . As to Gaspar the wolf-slayer , a man was Christian enough for him if he swore by the mass , instead of by the beard of Mahomet . He hardly knew the difference between the religions of True Prophet and the False . He was a Christian simply because he did not happen to be a Moor . He swore by the cross , and had a vague idea that there was some sort of virtue in the cross that would save his soul . But these nicer matters he left to the priests . But Alfonzo was taught by the hermit to understand better the great principles of the Christian faith , and to see clearly that Mahomet was a false teacher , and his followers deluded . He could give a reason , which it would have puzzled Gaspar to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not often that his occupation would suffer him to visit the holy hermit in his cell , and there listen to his instructions from the sacred scrolls , and hear the wisdom that flowed from his lips .  --  But he learned enough to make him an intelligent son of the Cross , to elevate his character and guide his judgment .  --  His faith became , as it ever does when received in honest trust , the conservator of his principles . A pleasing intercourse thus grew between the young gazelle-keeper and the exiled abbot , and on the side of the latter it manifested itself in parental tenderness , and on the part of the former in gratitude and filial reverence . Not a kid was killed at the hamlet that Alfonzo did not bear a portion of it to the cell of the hermit , and he never let escape an opportunity of returning , by attention to his few wants , his sense of the value of his instructions . When now , therefore , our youthful mountaineer began suddenly to feel a consciousness that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of the Infidel songstress , he thought of Father Godfrey , and how sternly he would reprove him therefor . It was this reflection that contributed quite as much as his active conscience to deepen the blush on his cheek as he rose to his feet . But , if it were possible to have heightened the glow , it would have been immeasurably increased when , upon looking round him , he saw that nearly every one of his flock had strayed out of sight , not more than three or four being visible , and these at a great distance off , on the side of the mountain above him . His dog , also , seemed to have been charmed with the music , for he lay in a deep slumber at his feet . How long can this charm have lasted ? ' he exclaimed , amazed . It seems but a few minutes , yet my gazelles have had time to stray far away unseen , and the sun is an hour lower in the west . I must do penance when I see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that voice so heavenly , if I can ! But first , I must hunt up my flock . Ho ! Ban ! sleepest thou also ! Up , and away !  --  Seek them and bring them back ! ' The dog sprung from his repose , shook his shaggy hide , and glancing first into his master 's face , and then sending his eye over the mountain side , he bounded away , emitting a low growl , as he leaped from crag to crag . The young mountaineer now eager to redeem the time , unslung from his belt a horn , tipped with an agate from the brook , and sounding loud and long for a minute , restored it to its place , and followed his dog with athletic bounds , not even turning his eyes again in the direction of the Moorish cot beneath the tower . It was already on the verge of evening when he found himself with all his flock but one , a favorite gazelle , collected around him at the head of the mountain path , and guarded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sister 's , a fair young girl , whose chief delight it was to contribute to her father and brother 's happiness and comfort . She prepared her brother 's morning meal at early dawn , of fresh goat 's milk , and brown barley bread , and , at evening when he returned , he always found a warm supper awaiting him , with her cheerful smile , and her voice of sisterly affection . The wandering kid was hers . It had , when very young , fallen from a precipice , and broken one of its legs . Alfonzo pitying its sufferings would have killed it ; but Xariffa , more merciful still , pleaded for its young life , for it was a very beautiful soft-eyed kind , and seemed to cast its gentle looks up to her as if seeking her protection , and he gave it into her hands . Tenderly and assiduously she nursed it , first skilfully setting the slender bones of its leg , and fostered by her care , it soon recovered health and soundness . From this moment a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazelle bounded to meet her , and licked her hand , and to receive with joyful beaming eyes her fond caresses .  --  Whensoever she let it accompany her brother to the mountain , for the herbage was sweetest there , she would carefully enjoin him to keep her favorite near him and never let it stray out of his sight . Sacredly had Alfonzo fulfilled the trust until this day . But in the hour he gave himself up to the song of the Moorish maiden , and in watching for her re-appearance , his precious charge strayed with the rest ; and when after three hours toilsome exertion and much anxiety he at length got them once more together , lo , the kid , which for his beloved sister 's sake , was of more value than all , was missing still ! His brow was sad . The solicitude of his bosom was expressed in the sorrow of his countenance . Poor little Zarif ! ' he said , looking once more all around , to see if he could not espy its soft bright eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thickening shades of the rocks . I fear that thou hast met the fate which thou didst escape in thy infancy ! I dare not behold the face of my sister without thee , her loved gazelle . Zarif ! Hillo ,  --  o  --  o , Zarif ! ' he shouted , till the echoes of the mountains echoed back again Zarif . ' Hast thou seen nothing of the pet kid , Ban ? Go , look for her . ' The dog understood his master , for the sagacious animal was well aware that one of the flock was missing . Tired as he was he galloped off , and soon disappeared . If he does not find her , I shall be wretched indeed . This is for listening to the song of a Saracen maid ! The holy father hath ever told me that there was necromancy and magic among the Moors , and this comes of it ! ' The thought of the holy father reminded him that he was near his cell , and , seeing his dog soon return unsuccessful , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that he had done , to the hermit . CHAPTER VIII . THE WOLF-CHASE . Leaving his faithful dog to guard his herd in the pass , the young mountaineer left the spot where they were collected together , and going a few steps along a ledge in the cliff-side , he came upon an open space , about which grew several clumps of wild olive trees . A group of these concealed the entrance to a cave , which he approached with the ready tread of one familiar with the place . The shadows were already heavy before the opening , and the cave was quite dark . Still he advanced a few steps into it , when he came to an elevated chamber , which received light from an iron lamp , which burned before a curiouslycarved altar of stone , supported by sculptured mermaids , upon which stood a crucifix and a cup . The cave was about twenty feet high , as many broad , and twice as many feet in length . It was dry and clean , and hung with two or three pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dim light , and it was a minute before the young man was convinced that the hermit was not in his cave . The pallet of dried wolf-skins , gifts of his own , was empty ; and the knee-worn stones before the crucifix were no longer occupied by the holy man of God . The lamp still burning showed that he had been there that day , and his rosary and a scroll , laid down as if hastily left , showed that he had not gone far , for these were articles he never left the mountain without . I can not wait for Father Godfrey , ' said the young penitent , as he gazed around the dark vault with feelings of religious awe , impressed by a silence that was seldom broken , save by the voice of prayer . It is near the close of day , and my flock will be belated on the mountain if I linger . But the father hath said prayer and confession ne'er bring evil to any man ; so I will fain kneel on this sacred spot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will confess it to Father Godfrey and get absolution . I wish I had ne'er listened to Saracen sorcery . ' With these words the young mountaineer reverently laid aside his palmleaf hat and boar-spear , and even unsheathed and placed beside them upon the ground his hunting-knife ; he then placed upon his brow a crown of thorns , the points inward , worn , when at prayer , by the hermit , bowed his head reverently before the little altar , and kissed the crucifix with a penitential air . Mary mother , Virgin most holy , intercede for an erring son . I have been tempted and have sinned in that I have delighted my ear in the song of the Saracen . It is my fault , my grievous infirmity , and I have seen my guilt in the just dispersion of my flock and the loss of my sister 's beloved gazelle . I will offend no more , sweet Mother most holy . ' The sincere and ingenuous young Catholic mountaineer then kissed the crucifix again , and then rising to his feet , started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he beheld standing behind him , in the shadows , the holy father , who carried in his bosom the lost gazelle . His impulse to spring forward and caress the recovered kid was checked by a quick sense of his unworthiness . He therefore fell upon one knee before the hermit , and knowing that he must have been overheard in his confession , he said , Father , forgive me . Thou hast heard me confess to Heaven . ' Thou hast absolution of thy fault , my son , whatever it may be , ' answered Father Godfrey , placing his open hand upon the top of his head . As I forgive thee on earth , may the Son of the Virgin forgive thee in Heaven . But rise and tell me what thou hast done . ' I have listened with a delight I can not express to the ravishing sounds of a Moorish maiden , which ascended to my ear from the house of the Infidel by the tower , as I was seated upon the cliff watching my flock . I suffered myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forgot I was a keeper of gazelles , nay , forgot I was a Christian , for an Infidel Moor could not have listened with more pleasure than I did . ' Thou hast been in great danger , my son . I trust thou hast not spoken with the Moorish maiden ? ' No ; I went not nigher than the top of Alfar 's cliff . ' Then thou art safe . ' Thou hast not heard all , holy father . I have said I forgot where I was . My herd wandered off and I saw them not . At length I recovered from , or rather broke from the charm , and found my gazelles had strayed I knew not whither . After three tedious hours of anxious search I gathered them again at the head of the path to go down the mountain  --  every one save Zarif , the favorite of my sister , and which to my great joy and relief I see nestled in the bosom of your robe . Penitent and sorrowing for what I had done , I sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kneeled to confess to the Blessed Virgin and her Babe , which I trust will be as effectual as if I had confessed to you , since you heard me . ' Yes , my son ! I am glad to see such ready contrition . That is truest repentance which soonest followest misdoing . I am sorry that thou shouldst have suffered the voice of a Saracen sorceress to have allured thine ear till sin entered thy heart . Thou hast been punished in the dispersion of thy flock , and in the loss of thy kid , and your anxiety for it . I will inflict on thee no other penance . The maiden whom thou listenedst to is the daughter of the Moor , Ben Osmin , a stern hater of the Christian . Here is thy gazelle , my son . ' Where didst thou find my little kid , holy father ? ' asked Alfonzo , as he received the beautiful animal from the arms of the hermit , and pressed it to his own bosom with grateful joy . I knew not that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have met my sister ? ' I heard the sound of thy horn calling together thy kids , and at the same time the bleating of two or three before the mouth of the cave . I rose and went forth , wondering much at seeing them there , when , from the direction in which I heard your horn , I knew you were half a mile from them to the Eastward . It surprised me , as you are always found within sight of your flock . Something , thought I , unusual has happened ; and I proceeded to drive your goats towards you . In a little while your noble dog passed me , guiding seven or eight more , and then I saw that all your flock had been dispersed over the hills . I was about to return towards the cave , seeking any others that might have got lost to turn them towards you , when I heard a faint cry . ' It was my poor gazelle ! ' It was . It was some time before I could ascertain whence it proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lying at the foot of a precipice down which it had fallen ! ' My unfortunate gazelle ! this was owing to my folly . ' I saw that it was in danger of being destroyed by a young eagle that was every few seconds wheeling around it and then swooping towards it with grasping talons , but scared away , yet each instant growing bolder by the loud outcries of the affrighted kid ! ' I shall never forgive myself , father . ' It was a long distance round the cliff , but I succeeded at length in descending safely to the spot where it lay ; and scaring away the fierce bird , I rescued it from its perilous situation . I found no limbs broken , but that it had been only bewildered by the fall . ' It looks likely again ;  --  my poor Zarif ! ' It is unharmed . ' Thanks to the Blessed Virgin ! ' No doubt that this happiness is vouchsafed to you in reward for your contrition . I trust you will never offend in this way again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the words she sang , father . It strangely affected me . It was a sensation wild and delightful ! a sort of sweet intoxication of the senses ! I have no doubt that it was magic . ' Do not doubt it . The Infidel has a league with Sathanas . The false prophet is the great deceiver , who was to deceive the nations . His followers have fellowship with Belzebub . Barbary , whence these Moors came , is a land of sorcery and their neighbor Egypt is the home of magicians . It was in Egypt Moses found sorcerers that could do even the miracles he did , save his serpent swallowed up their 's . These Moors deal in magic , and their very language is cabalistic . There may have been magic in the words she sang , for the Holy Church admits that certain words of Arabic are unlawful to be uttered , as they contain the alphabet of the language spoken by fallen angels . One can only be safe by not dealing with the Infidel . ' Some further advice mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountaineer , and then accompanying him to the door of his cave , he dismissed him with his blessing . For several days afterwards Alfonzo studuously and religiously avoided the cliff on which he had listened to the syren song of the Moorish maiden ; and once when a straying gazelle compelled him to go upon the cliff for it , he carefully abstained from looking down at the cottage or tower . He seemed to feel that his eyes might jeopardise his soul ; yet we can not deny that he caught himself listening unconsciously , as if he expected the sweet sounds would be repeated ; and as he left the rock without hearing them , it must not be concealed that a feeling of disappointment , or an emotion very like it , passed through his bosom . Yet when he had fairly left the rock behind , he felt relieved , and experienced a sensation of escape . But Moorish sorcery ' was destined to prevail over the resolutions of the young mountaineer , if not in one way , in another . About ten days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dispersion of his gazelles , he was standing by a stately ulmos tree watching his herd as they grazed about him , when he heard a loud cry of alarm , followed by fierce barking mingled with the terrific howling of a wolf . Quicker than lightning he grasped his boar-spear , and bounded in the direction of the sounds which led him into a glen of the mountain over which the rocks hung so closely as to exclude the sun at noon-tide . His gazelles in the meanwhile warned by a blast upon his horn , huddled together in a compact body under the tree , and there stood affrighted with wild looks and expanded eyes , trembling in every limb . Alfonzo bounded forward and soon came up with the combatants whom he found in the glen closely engaged in terrific contest . There were two enormous wolves battling with the dog . The pass was very narrow , and the dog , it seemed had been lying in it , so that when the wolves would have passed through on their prowling expedition to reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time giving the alarm . The young herdsman on seeing the unequal battle rushed forward shouting and launched his spear . It passed through the flesh of the dog 's shoulder but penetrated at the same time beyond it the heart of one of the wolves . The dog and wolf fell bound together by the spear , and Alfonzo leaped knife in hand upon the remaining brute ; but showing his teeth with a ferocious snarl of his turned back lips he fled . It was the work of an instant only for Alfonzo to draw the spear from the neck of the dog and the heart of the dead wolf , and thus armed to pursue the fugitive . The dog was not disabled by the wound , as the spear had only transpierced the skin , and was bounding away after him , when , at his masters 's command he returned to guard the gazelles . The glen which was an opening between two cliffs of the Sierra , descended obliquely down the mountain , till lost in a vast forest to the westward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it took seemed intended only for the convenience of wolves and robbers . The latter , Alfonzo well knew made frequent use of it ; and one of the strongest positions which he had been the means of destroying had commanded a portion of this defile . There was no excitement more congenial to the youthful gazelle-keeper than the wolf-chase . The animal led Alfonzo along tle gorge for about a mile at an unflinching pace , occasionally snarling at his pursuer over his back , but not slacking his rapid gallop . Though fleet of foot , Alfonzo found he could not overtake him , and he launched his spear after him , resolved to give up the chase and return to his flock , and also to look after the wound in his dog 's neck . Unexpectedly to himself the spear , well launched , glided along the ridge of the wolf 's back , and entered the back of his head , into which it deeply forced itself , and then fell out leaving its point broken off in the skull . With a shout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his throat as he dropped bleeding to the ground . CHAPTER IX . THE FORTRESS . The wolf thus slain by Alfonzo was one of the largest of his species and bore upon his wiry hide many a scar , inflicted by baffled hunters . My poor gazelles have one less enemy , monster ! ' said the young man as he drew his blood-wet knife from the wound and cleaned it in the soil at his feet . He now looked up and around him , and for the first time discovered that he was in the vicinity of a strong-hold once occupied by a party of bandits , which , under their formidable chief El Zegris , he had expelled with great loss to them , when commanding the expedition of Mountaineers already alluded to . The ruin was in sight and not a hundred yards distant , and it occurred to him that the wolves he had slain had made their den in its foundation , and that if he searched the place he might come upon their lair . The idea was no sooner conceived than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Alfozo the Destroyer or Gaspar the Wolf-slayer would have thought of going alone into a lonely ruin among the wild mountains when it was likely wolves made it their home . But danger was the element in which the young mountaineer breathed most freely . He delayed only long enough to take the skin of the wolf as a trophy of his success , and then marched forward to the ruin which he had not visited since he had driven El Zegris the bandit chief forth from it at the point of the spear , and came near taking him captive in his band . He found it , to his surprise , almost entirely repaired ; the walls , which had been partly thrown down , built up ; the gate replaced upon its massive hinges ; the portcullis lifted to its place , and the draw-bridge , which had been burned , rebuilt , though rudely , with logs . It bore indeed every trace of having been occupied since the robbers had been ejected . There was a path , too , well trodden , leading from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark forest that , like an ocean of black waters , spread many leagues in the rear of the mountain , northwardly , He remained standing and gazing upon these signs of its habitation with amazement . He saw at a glance that the bandits , taking advantage of the quiet which had followed the earnest war waged against them , had returned to their fortresses . His first impulse was to conceal his presence from any one within , and , returning to the hamlet , gather a party of his friends and fall upon the place by surprise the same night . But as he closely observed the exterior and seeing no one either upon the look-out above the gate or any where in the vicinity of the walls , curiosity impelled him to a closer scrutiny before giving any alarm , which in the end might have proved wholly unnecessary . He , therefore , cautiously advanced step by step until he found himself across the draw-bridge and standing before the gate which still bore marks of the heavy stone axes by which he , at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bettered it down and gained entrance into the strong hold . All about the place was as silent as the deep repose of noon could make it . There was not a sound , save the hum of the summer insect on wing and the chirping of a mountain sparrow on a branch that overtopped the wall . The appearance of the repairs was as if they had been but recently made ; but yet as if they were intended to resist outward force . This has been the work of not less than a score of men , ' said Alfonzo , as he looked about upon the restored ruin ; but where are the workmen ? I will e'en ascertain the meaning of this ere I go away from it . The place must come down again , and the next time level with the ground . This gate is secured only by bars which are put up on the outside . This shows that those who make it their home have gone forth barring it behind them . I will take the liberty of unbarring it and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mountain . He removed two heavy bars , or rather timbers that were placed in deep beds in the door-posts , and the gate swung open of itself . Grasping his wolf-spear , and walking guardedly , like a brave man who means not to be taken by surprise , he advanced into the court . This was a quadrangle sixty feet broad , with small rooms built into the walls on all sides like pigeon-holes , fit dens for robbers.  --  On each side of the gateway were two large rooms . The place was strewn with the remains of old Gothic altars and columns , it having once been a pagan temple , according to tradition . He entered one of the rooms , and to his great surprise , found that it contained the arms and costume of Moors , while a silver-gilt crescent fastened upon a mace stood up in one corner . It looked like a Saracen guard-house . Amazed and wondering what all this could mean , he opened the opposite room and started back on beholding a Moorish turban and kaftan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the turban peering a Moorish beard . He looked closer and saw that there was indeed sleeping at his feet a Saracen soldier or robber , which , he knew not ; but he had evidence enough that the place was occupied no longer by Christian free-booters , but that Infidels held it instead . But for what purpose ? This he determined to ascertain . On looking around the apartment he saw that it contained Moorish saddles , scymetars , and yatagans , besides , turbans of every color , kaftans , morocco slippers , green , blue , and yellow , and many rich dresses . Filled with surprise at this discovery , he was about to rouse the Moor , and know from his lips what it meant . But he first determined to inspect the whole interior . He walked round the court , looking into each of the recesses , or dens in the wall , and although he found the most of them vacant , he discovered evidence that the rest were occupied ; and one of them held two beautiful Arabian horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large wild eyes , and pricked their small pointed ears in affright , on beholding the stranger . Having satisfied himself that the place was occupied by a Moorish party , which were then absent , he returned to the room by the gate-way , where he had seen the Infidel sentinel asleep . The Moor was still motionless , and Alfonzo possessing himself of his scymetar cried aloud  --  Up , Infidel ! The Christians be upon thee ! ' The Saracen sprung to his feet , and instinctively searching for his sword hilt , found his weapon gone . Upon seeing before him the tall athletic form of the young mountaineer , and beholding his scymetar held at his breast , he fell upon his knees and cried for mercy , in broken Spanish . Mercy , good Christian , mercy in the name of Jesu ! ' Infidel dog , to dare to pronounce that name on your polluted lips , ' cried Alfonzo , striking him on the mouth with the palm of his hand . What do you here ? Who holds this place ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ! ' answered the Moor , who was a stout man of forty , with a grizly beard , and a swarthy visage , now pale with terror . Hast thou taken the fort . Allah guard my head then ! ' Who are you , and what do you here ? ' asked Alfonzo , impatiently . I am Habib Ben Habib , and I was left here to guard the fortress , but having drunk wine from the Captain 's stores , I fell asleep . ' A mussulman drink wine ! This is a change in the prophet 's faith . Who is thy Captain ? Answer me truly ! ' El Zegris ! ' El Zegris , again ! He is a Spaniard and thou a Moor . Besides , he has fled men say , to the Pyrenees ! ' My Captain is El Zegris Effendi , ' answered the Saracen . He is a Spaniard or a Moor as suits him . His father was a Saracen , his mother of Andalusia . Once he was chief of the Spanish bandits . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Saracen band .  --  Instead of flying to the Pyrenees when Alfonzo , the Destroyer , defeated him , he fled for refuge to Cordova . There he became a good Moslem ; took service with the Emir , Abdel Alba , and became his friend . But he gave offence to the Emir ere long , who sent to have his head , but El Zegris , with twenty horse , fled the city , and sought shelter here , repairing the place as you see , Effendi.  --  I am but his poor slave , who aspired to no higher dignity , than to make sherbet for my master , and fight for him when I cant run away ; but I assure your highness I am a great coward , an arrant and a most admirable coward , and would not hurt a ligardo . How many fierce Christian devils hast thou on the outside ? ' Enough , Moor ! So thou art only a slave of El Zegris ? ' said Alfonzo , looking upon the trembling Moor , whose beard and moustache , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that greatly belied his real character . No more , Effendi ! ' he answered with a low obeisance . How is it that thou art left alone ? ' El Zegris did not expect company . He left me because he has gone on busy work , and needed men who could handle steel better than I do ; so he shut me in to cook and look after the horses , and as I told your most garcious Christian highness , I was tempted and drank wine , and the Prophet punished me by making me drunk . ' When did the Zegris ride forth ? ' Abut sunrise , Effendi , ' answered the slave with a profound salaam at every word ; cowardice making the craven rogue most courteous to Alfonzo , whom , under opposite circumstances , he would not hesitated to have branded as a Christian dog ! ' When does he return ? ' He bade me have the noon-meal ready for him , as he should be back by the time the sun was overhead . ' Alfonzo glanced upward , and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brave , but not a bravo . His courage was tempered with prudence . He knew that it would be instant death to be caught by El Zegris and his score of followers in his stronghold . He therefore resolved to take his departure and compel the Moor to go with him , as to leave him behind would be to betray to the robber-chief that his re-occupation of the place was known ; while , if the slave was only missed , he might be supposed to have run away . He was , therefore , about to command him to go before him and leave the place , when his ear caught the sound of approaching horses . He sprung to a loop-hole which commanded the entrance , and to his confusion beheld the Moorish party , headed by El Zegris , winding up the gorge , and within thirty yards of the gateway . To escape by the gate would have been impossible . He saw the peril he was in , and all his self-possession was called into exercise to aid him in effecting his escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loose stones of the rugged path had been caught by the slave 's quickear , and the two Arabian horses neighing briskly in their stalls showed their consciousness of the approach of their companions . The slave , with the subtle quickness of the Moor , was making for the door to escape to his captain , when Alfonzo laid his grasp upon him and held him firmly . Stir not ! ' he cried , as he pressed the scymetar against his breast . Come with me , and if you utter a word or sound this steel shall silence your tongue forever ! ' He dragged the Moor hastily along by the collar of his kaftan , and succeeded in gaining one of the vacant rooms which he had before noticed had a large ruinous loop-hole on the forest side . Into this place he thrust the Moor headlong , and springing in after him he closed the door and placed against it a heavy stone which had fallen from the wall above the loop-hole . He then took the turban of the slave , and twisting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not , even from fear , give any alarm . He rolled him into the corner of the cell , and now climbed up to the loop-hole to see what chances it afforded him for escaping ; when , to his deep chagrin , he saw that it overlooked a sheer precipice of sixty feet , which prevented all chances of escape . Be it so ! ' said Alfonzo ; a brave man can die but once . I will be patient and hope , while I watch my enemy as he enters . ' There was an opening for air left above each door , about the size of a brick , and by standing upon the huge stone he had rolled there , he was enabled to command a view of the gate-way and of the whole of the interior . CHAPTER X. THE CAPTIVE MAIDEN . The young mountaineer had hardly taken his position upon the stone by the door when El Zegris came galloping into the court , looking round him with fierce surprise at having found the gate unbarred . Ho , Habib Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head for thy carelessness ! ' he cried . Come forth and answer , for by the beard of the Prophet I will make thee a head shorter . ' As he spoke he galloped rapidly round the court , looking in at the open doors of the apartments ; and as he passed by the door at which Alfonzo was posted , the corner of his vernish , or Moorish cloak , nearly flapped into his face by the wind of his motion . He was splendidly mounted upon a dun-colored Arabian mare , which had an eye almost as beautiful and intelligent as a woman 's , a glossy hide like silk velvet , and nostrils so transparent that the pink light shone through them . Her head was small and elegantly shaped , and her fetlocks as delicate as a deer 's . Her movements were all fire and wild grace . Her rider was a young man not above thirty , rather under-sized , but firmly made , with a finely set head , and a proud fierce bearing . He was dressed in a scarlet Moorish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feather of the Caliph 's guard , and loose flowing Arabian trousers of white muslin , over which was drawn a pair of long Tunisian green boots . About his waist was loosely knotted a purple sash , to which hung by a double gold chain a jewelled scymetar . The trappings of his horse were also exceedingly rich . His whole appearance was picturesque and striking . His air was that of a man accustomed to command , and wont also to give free rein to his temper . His features were more Spanish than Moorish , though his dark , handsome Arabian eye , betrayed his half Morisco blood . His face was very fine , full of expression , and stamped with great energy and fierce passions . The jet-black beard , flowing to his breast , his raven locks sweeping the wind , his flashing glance and martial bearing , his inimitable horsemanship as he sat in his Barbaric saddle , like a part of the beautiful animal he rode , gave him altogether an imposing appearance , and rivetted the admiration of the youthful gazelle-keeper ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , and well nigh had taken him prisoner . El Zegris lingered an instant at the door of the room in which the Moorish slave had been found by Alfonzo , bending forward from his saddle to peer in . The slave has fled ! By the cross of the Nazarene , if it prove so , he shall die if he be taken . ' The rest of his party now came galloping into the court after their chief , who had preceded them by spurring forward , and nineteen in number rode round the area and drew up facing the gate . They were all Moors , save one or two renegade Spanish bandits , whom Alfonzo recognised even under the turban and kaftan .  --  They were all habited in a fashion similar to that of their chief , though less rich ; the colors of their coarse kaftans being brown or blue . Their horses , however , were without exception beautiful animals . Every man was armed with a short spear , in addition to his scymetar at his girdle , and a large two-edged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were bearded like pards , ' and had the ferocious , reckless look of outlaws , of whatever land or language . There was one of the party , however , which entered the gate , and instead of riding round in column with the rest , turned aside at a gesture from El Zegris , and approached the place where he remained watching the entrance of his troop . This person was a large framed Ethiopian , whose jet-black visage presented a striking contrast with the white turban which overshadowed it . He was , moreover , dressed in white , save a dark colored sash , that held his knife and heavy scymetar . He was mounted upon a bay horse as gigantic as himself , and , what fixed Alfonzo 's eyes with surprise and curiosity , he carried in his arms a female figure , her face exposed , and reclining upon his grisly bearded breast . A second glance told Alfonzo that the maiden was insensible , and the torn veil and disarranged vesture , shewed him that she had been lawlessly torn away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the moment Alfonzo discovered her , he had no eye for the movements of the rest . The Ethiopian stopped his horse in such a position , that he could see her pale features distinctly , as she lay unconsciously upon the hideous breast of the Ethiop . He had never before beheld feminine beauty so perfect . If she were so lovely with her color gone , and her eyes closed , and that expression of sorrow upon her brow , thought Alfonzo , how beautiful must she appear when her face is lighted up by the dazzling splendor of her eyes , and the tint of the rose leaf plays with the smile of beauty upon her cheek and lip ! It was impossible for him to gaze upon a lovely girl , Moorish though he saw she was , placed thus in the power of lawless men , without feeling a deep interest awakened for her in his generous breast . He thought of his scarcely less beautiful sister Xariffa , and his cheek burned as he thought how it might have been her , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed . He could not remove his eyes from her . As the Ethiop lifted up a mass of her shining raven tresses , that had fallen upon the neck , and mingled with the mane of the horse , and threw them rudely across his arm , his spirit leaped to have the power to hurl him from the saddle and rescue her . She has not yet revived ! ' said El Zegris , as he laid his hand upon her forehead , gently rather than rudely . No , Captain Effendi , ' answered the Ethiop , in a hoarse grating voice . The mountain air will soon restore her ! Dismount and bear her into that room ! ' he added , pointing to an apartment , the door of which was closed . The Ethiop alighted with the graceful form of the beautiful Moor , hanging supine across his arm , as if the weight were nothing to him , and taking a key from his bosom , he opened the door and entered . The apartment was evidently that belonging to the chief himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowered mats , and silken divans ran round three sides of the walls , which were hung with Venetian tapestry . Of these particulars , Alfonzo was enabled to obtain a glimpse , from the position in which he was placed . The Ethiop laid his light burden upon one of the Divan 's while the eye of his chief followed him , and then came out and turned the key . Allah be praised ! ' said El Zegris ; she is now in safety , and the trouble well off my hands of bringing her hither ! ' He now turned to his men , and after glancing from one to the other with a rapid eye , as if numbering them , he waved his hand , and then dismounted himself . His followers did the same also , and each man led his horse towards the temporary stalls in the walls of the stronghold . While they were unsaddling them , El Zegris , who had haughtily cast the rein of his mare to the Ethiopian , was looking round sharply for the slave . He then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have removed the bars from the inner-side . The dog has let himself down by the walls . That he has escaped is clear , ' he said , addressing his speech to his lieutenant , a Spanish bandit , though in Moorish costume , who approached him after turning his horse over to one of the men . Alfonzo knew the bandit well , he having been once a mountaineer , and for a murder he had done , fled to the haunts of robbers for protection . The rogue fears your scymetar and his wind-pipe will some day become acquainted ; he knows that he well deserves that such an introduction should take place , ' was the reply of the lieutenant , with a coarse laugh . He has escaped without doubt . I am sorry , for we have no coffee ready , and we are pretty well tired with our foray down the mountain ! ' The maid seems to take her capture unkindly . ' Make the maiden no theme for thy speech , Diego ! ' said El Zegris , with a flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , where he had ordered the Ethiopian to place her . He turned the key and entered , leaving the door wide open . The maiden lay upon the divan , like a reclining statue of marble . Alfonzo , whose look out was not more than twelve feet from the apartment where she was , saw him place his hand upon her pulse , and shake his head . This sleep will end in death if I let it go on . I must bleed her ! ' he cried , and taking a lancet from his sash , which was contained in a morocco case that held a few other small surgical instruments and mendicaments , such as men accustomed to war always carried about with them in those days , he bared her moulded arm , and bandaging it with her torn veil , pierced the full vein . In a few moments , as the blood flowed into a silver basin , held by the huge Ethiopian on one knee at his feet , she opened her eyes , and a shudder passed over her frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepened the red upon her lips . She revives , ' cried El Zegris . His voice , and the sight of him bending over her , drew from her a cry of terror . She realized at once the circumstances of her situation , and bounding to her feet , she shrieked and would have fled . But her strength failed her ere she had made three steps , and she would have fallen heavily to the floor , but for the interposing arm of the robber-chief . Nay , be calm , child , ' said El Zegris , smiling with the consciousness of possession . Thy father insulted , me and so , by Allah , did the daughter . Thou shalt be the bride of El Zegris . Thou  --  ' Never  --  never ! ' she cried , putting her hands before her face , with the palms open towards him , and shuddering with horror . I will not listen to thee . Thou hast ruthlessly torn me from my home , as if I were a Christian slave , rathar than a free Moslem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said the chief , than all the maidens in Christendom else . Be gentle , and be the bride of El Zegris . ' Robber . ' I am now an outlaw ; but ere long I shall be an Emir . There is discord at work in Cordova , and El Zegris will be there when the nut is ripe to see what he can do with raising a standard . Andalusia is now the prize of the sharpest scymetar . Come , Genilla , say thou will be mine . ' My spirit shall take flight to Allah , ere it bow to thy will , ' answered the young girl with lofty resolution . I will tame thee . ' Do not drive me to death , chief , What is my dead body to thee ? Yet I swear to thee by the Holy pages of the Koran that I will not be thine , and live . ' Dost thou not know , sweet maid , that thou art in my power . I offer thee the honorable place of wife . Thou refusest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I do thee an honor . No , no ; I can not give thee up . It has cost me too much trouble to possess myself of thee . Thou mayest play at disdain , flash thine eye , and curl thy pretty lip , but it will avail thee nothing . I am no longer a wooer to sue for thy smile , but thy master to command . ' More and more , as thy speech unfolds thy nature , do I hate thee . Each word thou utterest but widens the space between us . ' Sayest thou so , ' answered the chief , turning pale with anger , and a bright angry light glowing in his eyes . I will find a way to tame thee . I will leave thee now a while ; but first I will take good care that you have no instrument of death ; for I do half believe you would try and cheat me out of yourself , if you believed there was no way of escape for you . But as to escape , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are a prisoner in a stronghold in the mountains , a full league and a half from your father 's cottage . I leave thee now to better reflections , and Allah be praised whether they favor me or no , thou art mine nevertheless . ' CHAPTER XI . EL ZEGRIS . It was with the most intense interest , and the deepest sympathy in the fate of the hapless maiden , Moorish though she were , that Alfonzo witnessed what we have related in the foregoing chapter . His heart swelled with indignant emotion , and his cheek burned at the contemplation of her unprotected state . His reverence and love for his sister had made all other maidens sacred in his sight . She was , too , about Xariffa 's age , and had the same dark beaming eyes , and flowing dark hair . He watched the robber chief as he left the apartment , locking behind him the door , and placing the key in his girdle . He resolved then that he would endeavor , in securing his own escape , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and hapless condition of the beautiful Moorish girl , had made their own impression upon his heart ; but certain tones of her voice , as she plead eloquently for liberty at the feet of El Zegris , made him believe that he saw captive before his eyes the maiden who had so captivated his senses with her song . The very idea should have made the youth tremble when he recollected the consequences which had followed his listening to her melody . But this was not the effect this assurance produced in his bosom ; but it rather increased and gave rest to his awakened interest in her . Like the moth , he would hover around the flame which had singed him . There was an infatuation in the feeling that possessed him . But it was easier to yield to the infatuation than to resist it . As a mere Moorish maiden taken captive it is a question whether Alfonzo , chivalrous as he was by nature , would have gone so far as he did towards effecting her release ; but when that maiden was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his heart , he was inspired by a romantic enthusiasm in her behalf the secret of which lay in a sentiment deep in his bosom which he had never yet analysed , but to which he yielded obedience . The very reason which father Godfrey would have urged to him why he should leave the fair captive to her fate , was the very reason which prompted him to resolve to accomplish her release . Conscience and his religion told him to banish her from his thoughts and think only of himself , whose peril was equal to her own ; while a tender interest that lay deeper than mere waywardness , urged him to desire to see her free from the power of El Zegris . I will escape only with that maiden by my side , ' he said , resolutely . It may be wrong to serve one whom conscience bids me fly , but I can not resist the impulse . It may be that a spell is upon me , and that this kindness towards her that warms my bosom is produced by Moorish enchantments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be I shall obey the feeling . I could not feel myself free to go forth and leave the poor beautiful tearful maiden behind me . If I escape she escapes also with me , if she will accept freedom at the hand of a Christian . This El Zegris shall be disappointed . He shall lose his bride and he shall know that Alfonzo the Destroyer has stolen her from his hand . ' He now watched the progress of things in the court . The Moorish horsemen , after having taken care of their steeds , gathered about a large fire which one of their number built in the midst of the court , and began each to cook for himself the dinner which the unlucky Habib Ben Habib should have had in readiness . A kid , stolen from some herd on the mountain , was roasted upon sticks , and with their knives they cut off pieces and devoured them with coarse barley bread , washing the whole down with sour wine , which was sipped in an old silver cup out of a copper vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart on a broad seat placed just within the door of the room which contained the arms of the party , the apartment which Alfonzo had first entered on coming into the fortress . All their proceedings were plainly visible to Alfonzo . He noted everything with the closest attention . In the meanwhile , Ben Habib , his prisoner , was becoming very restless , rolling about and blowing noisely for breath . He saw that it was necessary to silence him and getting down from the stone he placed his hands upon the now motionless slave as he lay against a broken pillar curiously carved with a capital of entwined asps and said sternly , If you are not still you shall die . You have heard what El Zegris has said . If he hears you and discovers you and me he will be sure to take your head off as well as mine . ' I know it , Effendi , ' gasped the Moor , succeeding in removing the turban from his mouth . Oh , do not let me die for want o ' breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I ca n't get wind enough in and out at them for my body ! If thou wilt let me breathe and trust to me , may the Prophet pull me out o ' Paradise by the hairs o ' my beard if I speak above my breath . I know well I am taller by the head while I am in here than I should be out there . ' Alfonzo reflected a moment . He was convinced that he could safely trust him , as he saw that he was fully convinced his safety depended on being undiscovered . I will trust you , Ben Habib . But I swear to you by your Prophet that if you lift your voice above a whisper , or speak when you are not spoken to , I will slay you on the spot . ' With these words Alfonzo unbound the turban from his mouth and returned it to him to fold again about his shining bald pate . Ben Habib was full of gratitude and kissing the hem of Alfonzo 's robe , said he would be his slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hands of the fierce El Zegris . The Moor seemed to think that the young mountaineer , alone and surrounded by foes as he was , would yet escape his enemies in safety ; and Alfonzo too possessed this very kind of confidence in himself . The idea of being taken prisoner or slain by El Zegris did not give him a moment 's uneasy thought . He felt strong in his own courage and energy . He now returned once more to his look-out , while Ben Habib climbed up to the loop-hole to survey the depth below . He measured it with his eye , and looked by no means satisfied at the result of the survey . He neverthless slid down again to the floor , and began to unwind his kaftan , and proceeded to tear it into pieces . At the noise , Alfonzo called to know what he was doing . I am making a rope to let myself down the wall , Effendi . My sash and turban , my kaftan and trousers , torn up with economy , will reach full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be saved if thou wilt lend thy bernash to me to tear up ! ' Hist ! Let this be the last way of escape when all others fail , ' said Alfonzo . I would try this first . El Zegris may take a notion to have all the empty rooms looked into after me ; and if he finds this door fast on the inside , it is all up with thee and me  --  whip would go off our heads in the stoning of a date . ' Make no more noise with that rending , and be silent . I will devise a way to get out of this . Worse come to the worst we can fight our way out . ' Allah forfend , good neighbor Effendi . I am no man at the sword  --  I am better at a spit . Let us have no fighting , I pray thee ! ' Silence , Moor ! ' cried Alfonzo sternly . He then directed his scrutiny into the court with the closest attention . The Moors , having dined , had thrown themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade , and repose after the fatigue of their morning 's expedition . In a little while all , except two , who were still drinking wine by the fire , were stretched at length in sleep . El Zegris and his lieutenant still remained eating dried dates , waited upon by the Ethiopian . At length El Zegris rose and walked slowly round the court-yard , gazed a moment on the sleepers , glanced into the stalls , examined the security of the gate , and then ordered the two men by the fire to take their scymetars and do guard duty . The men murmured at being compelled to leave their sour wine , but obeyed .  --  The lieutenant Diego , without more ado , threw himself at length on the divan upon which he had taken his dinner , and shading his face with his turban , was soon buried in deep rose . El Zegris alone , with the two sentinels , was awake and vigilant . For his men to sleep after dinner was as customary , in that climate , as to sleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by repose in the heat of noon for the midnight expeditions upon which El Zegris led them . At length , after walking round the court and observing every thing thoroughly , like a skilful chief , he stopped before the door of the apartment in which the maiden had been shut up . Alfonzo 's heart throbbed violently , and his grasp was firmer upon the hilt of Ben Habib 's scymetar , which he held in his hand . The Ethiopian came near him , and held up before his eyes the bloody wolf-spear which Alfonzo had dropped as he hurried from the guard-room with his hold upon the Moor 's collar . The Ethiopian had just found it in the corner whither it had rolled aside , unheeded by its owner , who did not miss it with the scymetar in his grasp . He now saw it again with surprise , aud closely observed the result of the discovery . What is it ? ' impatiently asked El Zegris , whose foot was already on the step of the door which led to the apartment of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood on it still moist . ' How came you by it ? ' asked El Zegris , taking it in his hand and looking at it closely . I found it just now in that room , upon the floor . No doubt it will help to account for Ben Habib 's absence , and the open gate . ' By the beard of Mahomet , you say well , Yussuf . This is strange ! Is it a man 's blood on it ? ' No , a wolf 's . ' How can you tell ? ' Man 's blood dries red : a brute 's darkens and becomes brown : this is brown . ' It is not the slave 's blood then ! But how came this spear here ? ' It must have been left here . ' But by whom ? If this place had been visited by a herdsman , as it is not likely , for they seldom venture this side o ' the Sierra , it would have been plundered .  --  Nothing seems gooe . Yet the gate was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no where to be found . I will examine this matter by and by . Guards , see that you keep vigilant watch , and on no account open the gate . We have enemies that have found us out . Yussuf , keep awake , and if anything occurs to cause alarm , sound the trumpet call . ' With these words El Zegris threw open the door of the apartment in which the maiden had been imprisoned , and as he entered , she darted past him with a bound and a cry of mingled defiance and terror . He caught her around the waist and detained her , with a laugh of victory . No , no , my pretty bird . You do not escape so easily . Do not be so cruel as to fly me thus . There is many a maiden that would gladly become the bride of El Zegris , yet I choose only thee . ' I would thank thee to put me to death , ' she cried imploringly . I hate thee , Julio . ' Not half so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow to decide , ' she cried in despair . I see the ruse . Thou wishest to gain time . But I will not be too hard with thee . I will give thee till the sun go down . Wilt thou decide by then ? ' I will , ' she answered , half suffocated with her emotions . Leave me now . I had hoped thou hadst relented . But leave me now . ' I had also hoped that thou hadst relented . Say that thou wilt be my bride , Genilla , star of my life , and I will ride with thee to-morrow , in open day , into Cordova , and at the Mosque there the Mufti shall wed thee to me . ' It is false what thou utterest . Thou darest not appear in Cordova for thy head , robber . But at sun-down thou shalt have my answer . Leave me . ' Cruel as beautiful , thou seest that I am thy slave and obey thee , ' he answered with an air of haughty superciliousness , while a scornful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned the key as before , saying significantly as he did so , At sunset . ' CHAPTER XII . THE ENTERPRIZE PLANNED . The youthful gazelle-keeper now in his heart resolved that he would free the maiden from the power of El Zegris , even at the sacrifice of his life . There were , perhaps , two motives operating to spur him on to this chivalrous enterprise ; one , and the most powerful , a deep interest in the sweet singer who had so enthralled his heart , and the other , a desire to disappoint the robber chief . Touehing his own escape , he saw that it could be effected by the mode which had been suggested by Ben Habib ; for he well knew that the robes of both , torn up into cords , would be of sufficient length and strength to let him and the Moor down the precipice , when their escape would be easy by the defile of the mountain . But Alfonzo was not one who could at any time think only of self-preservation , and more particularly now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of El Zegris , a lovely girl , who had not been out of his thoughts for a day in the past three weeks , and whose voice floated like strains of music from the walls of Paradise , through his dreams night after night . I will not seek my own safety and leave the maiden in the power of El Zegris , ' he said firmly , as Ben Habib once more ventured to propose to him to escape by the window . How can you do her any good , Effendi ? ' asked Ben Habib in astonishment . There is El Zegris my master and twenty men that fear neither man nor spirit of evil . They will cut thee in pieces and make kabobs of thee and me . Let me tear up my kaftan . We had best be diligent and get away while they sleep ! ' El Zegris is not asleep . He is standing by the door of the armoury . ' He will lay down by and bye . He always takes his sleep after noon . ' No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethiopian . The black leaves his side and crosses to the stalls He is saddling the chief 's horse . Now he puts the saddle on his own . ' El Zegris is going to ride out , I dare say , in search of me , Effendi ; ' answered Ben Habib , with tremor in every limb . Rather to ascertain if any enemy is lurking about ; for he is examining my wolf-spear with attention , and evidently is disturbed at its being found here . He goes out to see if there are any signs of his enemies abroad . ' That is it . He will examine the ground closely for footsteps of man or horse . I am grateful to Allah I am safe in here . ' The sentry is unfastening the gate , tho ' not before looking through a loop-hole over it to see that all is clear on the outside of the walls . The Ethiopian now leads the two horses across the court towards his master . El Zegris vaults into his saddle fully armed , and bears in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can find anybody , man or wolf ; in the neighborhood to account for the blood on the spear . It will be more of a puzzle for him to tell how the spear came here , Effendi , ' answered Ben Habib with a faint attempt at a smile . I hope he will get his neck broke before he comes back again . Now his going out will keep us in . If we get down the rock , and into the defile he will find me , and then , Mash-Allah , Ben Habib will have no more use for a turban . ' Hist ! he speaks with the Ethiopian , and points towards the door of the room where his prisoner is shut up , and then casts a glance of suspicion towards his lieutenant Diego . ' He is afraid to leave the fortress , and leave her to the power of the renegade . By the soul of the Prophet , he is right , ' said Ben Habib , who stood near Alfozo , and listened with great interest to his reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is plain that he fears him . The Ethiopian makes a salaam with his face to the ground , and goes towards the door where he sits leaning his head against the pillar , and with his naked scymetar grasped in his right hand . Te enter the place one would first have to encounter the gigantic barbarian . ' I have seen him , Effendi , ' said Ben Habib , I have seen him take up two stout Moors , one in each hand , and dash their heads together three feet from the ground , till they roared for mercy . ' El Zegris waves his hand to one of the sentries to mount the Ethiop 's horse . He obeys , and the chief rides forth , followed closely by him . The gate is shut , but not barred , for I heard El Zegris say that it must be left so as to admit him suddenly , in case he should be compelled to to return suddenly . ' I hear the clatter of the horses ' hoofs as they go over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again . Now , Effendi , what shall we do ? If we go out of the loop-hole , as I proposed , El Zegris , whose eye is like an eagle 's , will be sure to see us , and I should land upon his pike-head , spitted like a goose . Be patient , and I will devise a way of escape for us both and the lady also , ' answered Alfonzo . Do not think of the woman , Effendi . Women are made to do men mischief . Every evil in the world hath come o ' woman . If it had not been for a woman , El Zegris would not have left here after one , and I should not have been left alone , and captured by you and locked up here and in danger of my head . ' If it had not been for a woman you would never have been born , Ben Habib , so let the matter end there . ' Mash Allah ; that is but the beginning of it , ' answered the Moor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Effendi , if thou wilt tell me how I am to get out of this , I will pray Allah for thy soul 's safety when it crosses the bridge of a single hair that leads to Paradise . ' Silence , Ben Habib . They babble will awake these robbers , and they will have thee by thy beard ere thou knowest it . Bismillah ! I shall know it when they do ; the curse of the Prophet light upon them . ' Alfonzo having seen the chief and his single follower ride forth , and the gate closed , but not fastened , and having seen the Ethiopian seat himself by the door , as a guardian Cerebus of the impassioned maiden , began to conceive in his mind some way in which he could avail himself of the present condition of things , to effect not only his own escape , but the liberation of the maiden . The whole interior of the court-yard , with its numerous little rooms , or cells in the wall opening into it , with its groups of Moors reposing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western side , with the embers of the late fire in the centre , was open to his gaze . The Moorish sentry at the gate had seated himself upon a stone ; Diego , the lieutenant , was asleep on the divan under the eaves of the guard-room , and the Ethiop leaned upon his scymetar , looking dozingly over the sleeping men , and occasionally nodding his head over the hilt of his weapon . Alfonzo watched his motions until , at length , he had the satisfaction of seeing him droop his huge head upon his shoulder , and remain motionless in the profoundest repose . The only person that seemed to be awake under the drowsy influence of that warm sunny afternoon , was the sentry at the gate . The horses in their stalls , by their stamping , and occasionally neighing , alone broke the profound stillness , which , like the repose of midnight , reigned within the fortress . Alfonzo now saw that the time had come for him to effect his escape , if he ever intended to leave the den of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought of his poor , watchful dog , his defenceless flock , his anxious sister and father . Every moment was precious to him . El Zegris might not be out long , and the attempt , if made at all , must be made , he saw , at once . Ben Habib , ' he said , turning to the Moor , give me thy turban . Fold it on my head as thou wearest it , and thy people ! ' The Moor obeyed in silent admiration . Now thy kaftan . I want thy Moorish trowsers also ! Not a word . Invest me with all thy apparel ; for I am to play the Infidel for a little while . ' By the Prophet 's beard , wilt thou leave thy servant as naked as he was born , Effendi ? ' No , thon shalt have a fair exchange . Put on my clothes ! ' This will be turning a Moslem into a Christian , as well as a Christian into a Moselm . ' Not a word of objection . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I shall be taken and slain as a Christian dog . ' Thou hadst better be slain as a Christian than  --  as thou art sure to be if I leave the here  --  as a Moslem dog . ' Thou speakest wisdom ! Now thou art a Moslem to any man 's eye . By the beards of Islam , thou wouldst be taken by the Prophet himself for one of his own followers . ' I am willing to be for the present .  --  Now I wish to have thee second me , and obey me in every thing , if thou lovest thy life . ' I love it better than I do any thing else I know of in this miserable world , the curse of Allah be upon it , that ever I was born into it , to be now in danger of losing my head . Look at me ! Am I not a Christian without suspicion of ever having seen the inside of a Mosque .  --  Bismillah  --  it  --  Allah ! I am like to loose my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to thy skirts , Effendi . ' Thou must fight too , if need be .  --  Remember that thy life hangs upon thy valor , ' Then I fear me my neck will hang by a rope also . I am better at spitting fowl than men , Effendi . ' I am now about to open the door , and go boldly out . I shall , if noticed , by the sentinel or any who may awake , be taken for one of their number , as I shall keep my turban thus well over my brow .  --  My first step will be to go to the stalls , and saddle three of the best steeds . ' Then what wilt thou do ? ' I will make thee come out of this hiding-place , and hold them ready to mount ! ' Bismillah ! They will not take me for one of their followers . Canst thou not , while thou art about it , bring a turban and kaftan , and trowsers from the guard-room there . I will put them on in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can , without awakening Diego , who sleeps there . But if I can not you must obey me , nevertheless , and hold the horses . No one will observe , for the sentinel is yielding to the general influence , and is bobbing his head to and fro , as if it was balanced on wires . ' I must obey , Effendi . I will do my best , ' answer Ben Habib , in a desponding tone . Thou hast no alternative , but to remain here , then , and await thy fate from the scymetar of El Zegris when he returns ; for he will assuredly take off thy head for thy carelessness in letting me in . Now , watch my movements , and when thou seest me cross the court after saddling the horses , you sally forth noiselessly and take them , and lead them after me . It shall not be my fault if there are not three riders upon their saddles in a moment after scouring across the draw-bridge . ' Alfonzo now cast one more observing glance over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the door , and slowly opened it . He stepped forth , his scymetar in his hand , and habited from head to foot like a Moor . He closed the door behind him , leaving Ben Habib peering through a narrow crevice , his face pale with fear , and his large eyes expanded with expectation . His prayers to Allah went with him for his success , for upon it depended his own safety . It was , therefore , with the deepest interest , that he followed his movements . Alfonzo , after finding himself fairly in the open court-yard , proceeded towards the stalls . He found , to his great joy , two horses saddled , the same which had been found there by him , when he entered the fort . All he had to do , was to tighten their girths , and bit them . He threw a saddle upon a third horse , and then leading the three out , he beckoned to Ben Habib . But he had to make the signal thrice , before the Moor came forth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume . But Alfonzo saw that the risk would be too great for him to try to pass into the armoury , by the sleeping lieutenant . Now lead these horses , and hold them before you door for me , ' said Alfonzo , as he left him and walked round in the shadows of the court , towards the guarded door of the apartment which contained the beautiful Moor . CHAPTER XIII . THE RESCUE . The critical moment for action , upon which his own life as well as the happiness and safety of the Moorish maiden depended , had now arrived , and the young gazelle-keeper felt the need of all his coolness , as well as of his courage . Slowly he advanced towards the door , on the threshold of which the Ethiop reclined  --  a giant in stature and strength  --  his head bowed upon his breast , and buried in profound sleep . The Moorish sentinel at the gate raised his eyes as Alfonzo approached the Ethiopian , but merely towards him : he closed them again . Alfonzo saw in this act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentry had evidently taken him for one of the Moors walking about in preference to sleeping . Taking a firmer grasp upon the hilt of the scymetar , Alfonzo now strode rapidly forward , and , passing by the Ethiopian , came suddenly upon the sentinel , whom he caught by the beard and , at a single blow with his scymetar , sent the Moor to his Propnet . It was the act of an instant . The victim of necessity uttered no groan , but fell dead across the stone upon which he was seated . Alfonzo with a strong arm then swung back the heavy gates , and leaving them wide open , he bounded lightly towards the Ethiopian , and leaping upon the giant buried his steel deep into his breast . The African rose convulsively to his full height , tossed his arms wildly in the air above his head , and then pitched headlong forward , at the foot of one of the circular , serpent-entwined barbaric altars in the fortress , and struck upon the ground with a sound that made the court-yard ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfonzo springing upon him once more struck him to ensure his death . Instantly three or four Moors were awake and upon their feet . The horses , Ben Habib ! ' cried Alfonzo . This way quickly . Rescue , lady ! rescue ! ' he called to the maiden . I have slain your guard , and now will open the door for thy escape ! ' With this he took the massive scymetar of the Ethiopian , and wielding the ponderous weapon as he would have done a battle-axe , he broke the door down and sprung across it into the apartment . There stood the Moorish maiden with eager face , her hands clasped , and her head bent forward between fear and wonder and hope . Ask no questions , lady ! Know that I am the foe of El Zegris , and risk my life to save thee . Wilt thou commit thyself to my guidance ! Yes , oh yes ! ' she cried , yet shrinking instinctively from the presence of a stranger . But there was something in the tones of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her confidence , and assured her that she was not flying from one enemy into the power of another . I go with you  --  only save me from El Zegris ! ' she added , grasping his hand . Then mount with me upon one of these horses . The way is open before us . Delay not a moment , the Moors are arising . ' With these words he caught her up , and the next moment was seated in the saddle with her in his arms . There was no time to place her upon the other horse . Ben Habib no sooner beheld him mounted , than springing forward he dashed first out of the gate , and just in time cleared the portal to avoid a blow of a yataghan from one of the Moors , who had bounded forward to stop his progress . Alfonzo was met by three of them in his passage to the gate ; but with the heavy scymetar of the Ethiopian he cut two of them down and rode over the third . He turned his head for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Destroyer has taken his bride away . ' The next moment he was threading across the bridge , leaving confusion , alarm and amazement behind him in the fortress . The Moors were now all awake , and seizing their arms before he got across the moat , ran to the walls , and a score of spears and lances were sent after him , but fell harmlessly about his path , as he flew like the wind  --  but still outstripped by Ben Habib , who went down the rocky pass as if he had neither neck or head to break . The astonished Moors finding their sentinel dead , the Ethiopian slain , and seeing the surprising escape of what seemed to them a Christian and a Moslem mounted upon two of their best horses , the latter carrying on his saddle bow the Moorish captive , knew not what to say , or how to understand it all . But when they heard his defying cry which told who he was , fear seized them . They increased their confusion by asking a hundred questions of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were surrounded by mountaineers . Diego soon recovered his presence of mind , and seeing no other enemies , ordered the whole party into the saddle to pursue the fugitives , whoever they were . But they refused to stir to a man , without El Zegris . The daring act they had witnessed , with the dread name which had been shouted back to their ears , paralyzed them . The third horse still galloped by the side of Alfonzo , held fast by the rein , and when he got to the foot of the defile , he transferred the maiden to the saddle upon it , and thus side by side they flew down the mountain . Not a word was spoken by either . Flight  --  safety  --  were only in the minds of both . Ahead of them rode at an unflinching pace the affrighted Ben Habib , laying on with fist and heels , and glowing , as if pursued by wolves . From the heights above , the Moor sent cries of defiance , and lances that fell short ; but none came forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but believing that the mountaineers were in force near by , and that he would fall into an ambuscade , he ordered the gates to be closed , and the garrison to stand at arms ready to repel the expected assault ; for that the person who had entered the fort and carried off the maiden , slaying the sentry and the Ethiopian , must have been backed by a large force , he felt confident . He was anxious , too , for the safety of El Zegris , whom one of the Moors said he recollectas he was going to sleep , having seen ride forth accompanied by Ali Benish his trumpeter . This is all a strange work , ' ejaculated Diego , as he gazed upon the bodies of the two men . One cant well say what is done when one is asleep ; but things , look as if the devil had been paying us a visit . How that man who rode forth with the maiden on his saddle ever got inside I know not . Yet as he rode out he must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dun mare , that he keeps for holidays , ' said one of the Moors . So I thought I had seen the horse before ; but he rode on like the wind . And that was one of ours that he led too , I suppose . ' It belongs to Aben Hafel . ' Yet it was not Alfonzo the Destroyer who had the maiden . He , whoever he was , was a Moor . The person who rode ahead alone was the young mountaineer chief . ' If ever there were two heads made on the same block , ' said one of the Moorish robbers , the head on that man 's shoulders was as like that of Ben Osmin as two eyes under one brow . I made a stroke at him , believing him to be a Christian dog , as he rode out , and he drew up his eyes and uttered a yell that none but the gullet of Ben Osmin could have given voice to . Besides , I knew the board and the bottle-nose . ' Then who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow who rode so gallantly , and shouted back the name of Alfonzo ? ' asked Diego . It was the Christian himself , ' said another of the renegade Spanish robbers who stood by . I saw him when he defeated our captain , and heard his voice resounding above the fight . It was the same voice . He spoke for himself and not for the one in the Christian garb , who rode ahead . ' Then I have it , ' said Diego , as the riddle seemed to resolve itself slowly to his apprehension . This Alfonzo has met Ben Huzzar , who you know we found not when we returned , he has met him outside and , changing garbs with him , has , by his means , through his treachery or his fears , got entrance into the fort while we slept , slew the sentinel and the Ethiopian , and so carried off the maiden bodily . This is all the explanation I can give for it , especially as , El Melec here says that he heard El Zegris when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his return . This must be the truth . But more than this , Alfonzo would never have ventured inside a fortress in broad day . When El Zegris returns he will foam and chafe life a tiger to find his mistress stolen and we all asleep the while . But as we are all alike to blame , he will have to take all our heads if any ; so the very magnitude of the offence will be our safety . I care not for the loss of the maiden , nor for that matter will any of us weep for the death of this mass of Ethiopian bone and flesh . I will let them lay where they are till El Zegris returns , and in the meanwhile will keep our defences in case that this daring mountaineer should have a force at hand , as is likely . If El Zegris be not watchful , he will be in danger ! I wonder what sent him abroad . Hark ! there is a shout . There clangs steel against steel in the defile below ! To horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt in peril . Who will follow me ? ' Four of the Moors leaped into their saddles at the same instant that he did . The gates were thrown open , and like a whirlwind the party dashed across the moat and soon diappeared to the eyes of those who watched them from the walls . El Zegris had left the fortress for the purpose of satisfying himself touching the wolf-spear , which had been found in the interior of his stronghold . The blood upon it he believed to be either that of Ben Habib or of a wolf , slain near the fort ; but he suspected it to be the blood of the former , who had been slain by the owner of the spear , and his body cast over the cliff . He , therefore , after getting down the path to the foot of the rock on which the tower stood , rode round the base of it , looking for the body of his slave . But nothing appeared to confirm his suspicions . He carefully , also , watched the neighborhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest and barren pinnacles that towered like minerets , seeming to invite the crescent to crown their sharp points . He rode , scy mitar in hand , like a man who expects an enemy to start out from behind every covert . After riding quite around the elevated spur of the peak on which his stronghold was perched , without finding the body of his slave , he turned into the gorge which led over the shoulder of the mountain in the direction of the hamlet on the southern side . He dismounted in this path , and giving his reign to his follower , he carefully walked along , examining the ground and the stones , and even noticing the spears and grass to ascertain if a foot-step either of man or horse had recentiy disturbed it . He had not proceeded far before he saw a small pebble that had been brushed from its bed in the soil , its moist side being turned upward and the little clayey cavity in which it had been half imbedded , was still damp and smooth , not being even sun-dried. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in the path not long before . He continued his search and a little ways further came upon the print of a foot . He saw that it was not a Moorish sharppointed boot , but the broad sandal track of a mountaineer . I have now evidence enough that some Christian dog has found his way into the fort in my absence , and that the spear belongs to the owner of the foot that pressed its print into the soil here ! ' While he was examining the ground farther , his followers , who had gone forward a few paces , leading his horse , suddenly cried out that the horses would not move , and that they acted as if a wolf was near . Upon looking up , El Zegris saw the animals running backwards , moving their ears and snorting with alarm . He immediately sprung into his saddle , and levelling his spear , rode for ward , urging his reluctant steed with its sharp point . He had proceeded but a few steps when his horse reared and nearly threw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the path lay a dead wolf , and a vulture was balancing himself on his large dark wings above its head , fiercely picking out its eye . A shout from the chief sent him soaring away to settle slowly upon the top of a scathed oak . El Zegris , unable to get his horse nigher , leaped to the ground and approached the wolf , which he found had been recently slain by a spear thrust , from which the blood still oozed out upon the earth . CHAPTER XIV . THE PURSUIT . The sight of the dead wolf , with the spear-wound in his head , was hardly needed to confirm the suspicions of El Zegris that some mountaineer had been his visitor , and that the person who slew the wild animal and he who entered the fortress were the same he was convinced by finding the broken point of the spear he held in his hand sticking in the bone of the wolf 's skull . This proof was all he required . Some wolf-hunter has slain the beast here , and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he entered , or was admitted by the slave , who left with him or was slain in a quarrel . There are no other enemies about , ' continued El Zegris , as if satisfied with what he had discovered . Yet this person , whoever he was , will report that the fort is occupied again , That I should be found out here , ere long , I had no doubt ; but it will take more than a force of mountaineers to dislodge me again from this place , if I choose to hold it . But I shall hold it only till I see how events are going to turn in Cordova . The revolution may break out to-morrow . I shall then leave the fort as empty as I found it and try my fortunes with some one of the Emirs.  --  His standard who is likely to conquer I shall rally under . ' These words were addressed partly to his follower , but were more the self-uttered thoughts of his mind than intended for the car of the trumpeter . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he drew near and gazed on the dead animal in the path , which it quite blocked up . A monster of his speeies . It was a true eye and strong man that launched this spear . It was either Gaspar the Wolf-slayer or his son , whom Allah confound ! If I e'er meet with him again , we part not till I have avenged my last defeat . For a more youth  --  a gazelleherd-boy , without skill or experience , to conquer me and drive me and mine from the Sierras , is an ignominy I shall not bear unavenged . ' It would be easy in the night to sally upon the hamlet where they dwell and come upon them by suprise , ' said the Moor . Thou art giving words to my own thoughts , Melec . I shall not long delay my vengeance . ' Here are letters carved on the end of the spear . They are Christian characters , which I do not read . ' Let me see them . I have heard these mountaineers mark their spears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after it has pierced him , and the animal is found dead , it may be known to whom its hide belongs . Let me read . This is the name of my foe . ' Gaspar ! ' No . Alfonzo , whom my men call the Destroyer . This spear is his . The wolf 's hide is his ; and would to Allah he would come and take it while El Zegris has his foot upon it . ' If this be the wolf of that man , and it was he who went into the fort and left the spear , ' said the Moor with some alarm , I would rather he would keep away . ' I know he is brave , and so , too , is El Zegris . Whoever knew me to show fear ? I would forfeit a thousand years in Paradise to see this Alfonze here and avenge upon him my wrongs . ' There are few men that would care to meet him in this place , ' answered the Moor , looking round . I would recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what shouting is that from it ? ' he cried , looking up the mountain to the stronghold , an angle of which only was in sight , about three hundred yards distant , the rest of it being concealed by a projection of a cliff overhanging the deep gorge in which they were . There is confusion among them ! ' exclaimed El Zegris . Hark ! that was the clash of steel . Listen ! a galloping across the resounding bridge over the moat ! To horse and let us see what this means . ' He vaulted across the back of his horse , and giving him rein galloped back the way he had come . A turn in the defile brought him in full view of the draw-bridge and part of the tower , in the gate of which he saw his men brandishing their scymetars , and shouting and sending their lances after a person on horseback , who was thundering across the draw-bridge , as if in pursuit of another in the dark garb of a mountaineer . For an instant the two horses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next moment lost in the deep path down which they were careering . The Christian dog has been discovered in the fort and is pursued ! ' cried El Zegris . He who pursued him had a female , I am sure ; and the lances were sent after him more than after the head one , ' said Melec , who continued to ride on at speed after his chief . Then it was so ! I was not sure , but thought the hind one carried a female ! ' answered El Zegris . Of that I am sure , Captain . ' On then  --  onward without slacking rein . There is no woman in the fort to come out of it but Genilla , and he who bore her forth is Diego and none else . Allah il Allah to the rescue ! ' he shouted , brandishing his scymetar , and burying his spurs deep into the flanks of his horse . The path-way which led down the mountain 's side from the fort , ran at first at a sharp angle of descent northwardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a zig-zag line , thus making a succession of terraces . The wolf had been slain on the second terrace below , and from this , in looking up , persons descending the first or higher terrace were visible until they began to enter that deeper part of it where the angle was made . The two parties were now approaching each other , one ascending towards the deep gorge at the angle , and the other descending into it . There was also at this angle a defile , which opened westerdly and descended towards the forest , and so round by the east side of the mountain ; the same ravine by which El Zegris and his whole party had returned to the tower , bringing the Moorish maiden their captive . El Zegris would not have galloped forward at such speed up the steep path had he not feared that the fugitives would take the eastern gorge , and so escape . That the three persons were the Christian Alfonzo and Diego bearing off Genilla , he had no doubt . He had , therefore , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm to combat . The portion of road along which he was now galloping was concealed from the tower by a brow of beetling rocks . Alfonzo resolved to bear his fair charge to the hamlet , and thence conduct her under a strong escort , if necessary , to her home . But the Moor Ben Habib was ignorant of this determination , and upon coming to the opening at the angle which led eastward down the mountains , he took it without hesitation , and as Alfonzo passed it he could just see the top of his bald head disappearing in the depths of the gorge . He could not but smile , serious as his present situation was , at the headlong equestrianism of the terrified Moor , thus riding for his head . The slave flies with fear for wings , ' he said to the maiden ; I am glad to see thee so calm . Still retain thy courage and self-possession , and ere long thou wilt be in safety . ' Who are you that thou art risking life for me ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moor , but thy speech and face betray thee to be a Christian . ' Alfonzo did not reply ; he had turned the angle and his eye fell upon the figure of El Zegris coming up the gorge at full speed . The two horsemen discovered each other simultaneously . Alfonzo had loooked for a meeting with the chief somewhere in the gorge on his return to his tower . He now recognised him , and at the same moment the chief saw and recognised the maiden whom he had destined for his bride . He reined up and took a second glance at the turbaned horseman by her side , but was amazed instead of seeing the features of his lieutenant Diego to behold those of the youthful mountaineer-chief his direct foe . Even the turban could not disguise or hide his well-remembered face from El Zegris , who never forget the features of a foeman , especially of one by whom he had been humbled . Lady , rein up and remain here and I will free thee from thy tyrant and make thee a free passage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bit of her horse and reining him backward . He then grasped firmly the hilt of the scymetar which he had taken from the Ethiopian and charged upon the robber chief , who , taken by surprise at discovering so formidable an atagonist where he expected to cope only with Diego , seemed to hesitate whether to withstand the onset or retreat for better vantage ground , for he was lower in the gorge than his antagonist . But Alfonzo 's headlong charge upon him gave no time for reflection . He spurred aside as he came upon him and endeavoured to parry the thrust which was made at his side . But his scymetar shivered like glass at the touch of Alfonzo 's weapon , and the guard of the hilt striking him in the breast hurled him from his saddle to the earth . His follower without waiting to see the result had in the outset leaped from his horse and climbed a cliff with the agility of an ape , and was full fifty feet in the air when his chief rolled over upon the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest said , I do not wish to kill thee . Ask thy life and swear never to disturb the peace of this maiden whom I have rescued from thy power , and I will let thee go free ! ' I will not take my life at thy hand , slave ! ' growled the fallen chief in a tone and with a scrowl of defiance . Then I will give it thee . I would not shock this maiden 's eyes by slaying thee before them ; but I will mark thee and destroy thy power of doing mischief . ' With these words he raised his weighty scymetar and suddenly letting it fall upon the right arm of El Zegris as it lay stretched out upon the ground he severed the hand above the wrist at a blow . The robber howled with rage and pain , and an exclamation from the Moorish maiden caused him to turn his eyes in the direction in which her finger pointed his attention , when he beheld Diego and his four followers galloping across the moat . In an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the maiden by his side was urging the two horses at full flight along the defile . For a moment he thought he should not be able to make them pass the dead wolf , but by the aid of the point of his scymetar he sent them madly leaping over the obstacle . Behind him he could hear the clatter of the troops of Diego 's horses and the shouts of the Moors . Suddenly they ceased and he knew that they had come up with El Zegris . He was confirmed in this by a loud outcry from the spot following the clang of iron hoof supon the rocks . Allah , protect us ! ' cried the maiden . I fear that even your courage , noble Emir , may not save either thee or me ! ' Fear not , lady ! Were they twice their number I would not fear them in thy defence . But they will not follow far . In a few rods we shall come to a part of the gorge impracticable for horses . We will leave our horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by them that no horsemen can get by or beyond them . We will then make the rest of our way on foot by a path known only to the mountaineers ; and thus effectually elude pursuit . Where you can not walk for the roughness of the way I will carry you safely ! ' CHAPTER XV . THE EXPLANATION . The gorge along which they were rapidly pressing their way , narrowed every moment , until they could only go on one before the other , Alfonzo being last . At length they came to the steep face of a precipice , where the road was only a mere cleft in the rock not two feet wide . Here , by his directions , she alighted , and also dismounting , joined her . Just before them was a sort of natural path over the cliff , accessible only for persons on foot . We will here leave our horses to be taken by their owners , lady , ' said Alfonzo , and go the rest of the distance on foot . I hear our pursuers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to me . I am willing they should say Alfonzo flies the Moors ! ' so that thereby I secure your safety ! ' She pressed his hand in silence , but her eyes beaming with gratitude to her unknown deliverer were more eloquent than words . He aided her to climb the steep path , and in a few minutes they had left the gorge far below them and were crossing the open mountain-top in the vicinity of the cell of the hermit.  --  They heard no more of their pursuers , though they listened as they paused to rest for a moment . In a little while , Alfonzo came in sight of his herd and his noble wolf-dog walking round and round them , guarding them . Upon seeing his master , the intelligent animal came bounding towards him and leaped upon his shoulder as if he would embrace him , while his eyes beamed welcome and joy at seeing him . Alfonzo examined the wound in his neck made by his spear when he launched it at the wolf , and was gratified to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the situation , in which he found his flock all collected in a close crowd together , he knew that his trusty dog had compelled them to remain so , not permitting them either to feed or move from the spot till his master should return .  --  The poor gazelles seemed startled at the sight of the Moorish costume through which Ban had instantly recognised his master , and looked startled when he approached them . You see , lady , that my herd are afraid of me , though if I wore my own costume they would be trotting up to lick my hands with every sign of joy ! ' Your herd , Emir ? ' 1 Yes , lady , I am a gazelle herds-man ! ' he answered . Sit here upon this mosscovered stone over-shadowed by this olive tree , and where I often have st to watch my gazelles , and I will tell thee who I am and how I came to rescue thee , for we have had little time to speak with each other since we left the fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the umbrageous seat to which he conducted her , a pleasant and elevated yet secluded nook in the cliff commanding a wild mountain prospect ; and in the distance , between two peaks , was a glimpse of the golden Guadalquivir . She could not withhold her eyes from the noble and youthful countenance of the young man who had saved her so gallantly from the hand of the marauding El Zegris . Every time he turned towards her as he was discoursing , he saw her dark , rich eyes drop hurriedly beneath his glance , while the deep glow of the rose would heighten the charming tint of her cheek . I am , maiden , ' he said to her , but a poor gazelle-keeper . You see my flock which is all my worldly wealth , and its care my only ambition . ' How is it , then , noble Emir , that I see you in the dress of one of my countrymen ? ' she asked , with curiosity and surprise . I know , by thy speech , thou art a Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spain ; how is it that I see you wearing the turban of a Moslem ? ' I assumed this costume , lady , to save thee . No other motive would have induced me to adopt the garb of the Infidel . ' But I am an infidel as you term the children of Islam , ' answered the maiden , with something between reproach and regret . Did n't you know this at the first ? If so , what am I to thee that thou , a Christian , the enemy of my race and faith , shouldst save me as thou hast so nobly done ? ' Listen to me , lady , and all shall be made known to thee , for here you are safe . The Zegri dare not come on this side of the cliff without their leader , who will hardly ever lead them again . In my duty , as a herdsman , not many days ago , I was seated watching my herd upon yonder rocky summit , which overlooks the valley of the river and Cordova , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower . ' My father 's home and mine ! ' she ex claimed with delight , clapping her hands with joyful surprise , and gratitude sparkled in her glorious oriental eyes . Oh , am I so near ! I knew not where I was , but being with thee , though I know thee not , and know thou art a Christian , I felt secure . Wilt thou take me to my father , Ben Osmin ? ' As soon as thou art rested ! Thou shalt see him ere night ! ' Thanks , noble Christian . ' I am rewarded in having rescued thee . Do not thank me , nor look upon me with such grateful eyes , lady , or I shall forget that thou art a believer in Mahomet ; I in the cross . I know not if I ought to linger here a moment , or hold any discourse with thee . ' Nay , if I , a Moorish maid , fear thee not , noble Christian , THOU shouldst have little scruple ! ' she answered , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cupid 's faithful time-piece , go faster in his bosom , than he ever knew it to throb before . Her eyes seemed to dart arrows of fire into his soul . He dared not look up again to meet her gaze , but said with downcast eyes  --  I will hasten with what I have to say . While I was seated upon the rock , looking down upon the tower , I saw you appear in the court-yard , and proceed to water some flowers . ' Saw me , noble Christian . ' Thyself , ' he answered with a smile at her look of perplexed surprise . The cliff is at least a thousand feet above the tower . Thou couldst scarcely tell me from one of thy gazelles . ' If I had only seen thy eyes , maiden , I might not , ' he answered with ready gallantry , and at the speech she dropped her fringed lids to her small Morocco slippered feet , and blushed with evident pleasure at so delicate a compliment . But I saw thee and yet could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motion that since then , now thou hast been nigher to me is proved could only have been thine own . But not by motion , or form , or feature do I know that thou art the same . By thy voice I recognize thee , lady . I heard thee sing . Heaven only has such music as floated from that garden bower to my ravished ears . I listened entranced . It seemed to awaken or create a new and delightful sense in my soul . You sang I know not how long . It might have been a few minutes  --  it might have been hours for all that I gave count of the passing time . But I will not speak in such terms , for I see that it surprises thee to hear me , and I know that I do wrong in suffering the recollection to animate my words as they do ; but my heart will speak , lady . ' The maiden listened like a startled fawn at some unusual sound , to his impassioned words , for words of passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he have fled from her in fear , had he understood that it was love that was burning in his bosom for the Infidel maiden , and kindling his lips with such warm eloquence . I have offended you , maiden . ' he said , observing her look constantly down . No , ' she answered in a voice as musical as silver ; and raised her eyes to his face . It was only for an instant ; but the look thrilled to his very being . Lightning is not more vivid than was this brief glance , nor is the tremulous dew-drop softer in the moon-beam . The young mountaineer was not aware of his danger , or being aware yielded with delightful madness to the spell that he felt she had cast about his heart . Maiden , ' he continued , taking her passive hand , and how could the fair Moorish girl refuse to give her hand into his whose courage and love had saved her from a fate so dreaded as to be the bride of El Zegris ? Maiden , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which thy voice echoed in the deep of my soul , and the dreams at night in which I heard it mingling with every sound as the star beams are woven with the darkness . I knew thou wert of the Moorish race , and would have banished thee from my thoughts . But in vain . In vain I confessed my sin and did bitter penance for my crime . ' Alas ! is it so great a crime for a Christian to think of a Moorish maiden ? ' she said with a sigh of the profoundest sincerity ; for she felt that her heart already was her preserver 's . I fear it is , lady , ' he said sadly . And I resolved no more to think of thee ; for I said , if the notes of her voice have so moved me , how shall I withstand the glance of her eye , should we ever meet . ' Here the beautiful girl lifted suddenly her almond-shaped lids , fringed with midnight rays , and darted upon him a glance that would have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had he been exposed as was Alfonzo his protege , to their influence . I did not expect to meet you , lady , for we mountaineers have little fellowship with or love for the Moors that settle about us in the valley . But to-day , being in pursuit of a wolf , I came upon the stronghold into which you were brought by El Zegris , and entered it without being opposed . It contained but one Moor , whom I was compelled to drag with me into a room on suddenly hearing the returning footsteps of the Chief ; for it was too late to retreat by the gate . I saw you brought in and heard all that El Zegris said to you . When I heard your voice , I recognized it to be the same that I had heard floating up from the garden at the foot of the Emir 's tower . Instantly I resolved to rescue you , for I saw how you hated the proposed union . I could have escaped by a loop-hole in the wall , but I would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noble and brave Christian ! ' I waited until El Zegris rode forth and his followers , save one , slept . I then disguised myself in the habiliments of the Moor , whom I held prisoner in the apartment where I was , and sallied out boldly , saddled the horses , and then slew the sentry as he nodded on his post . My next act was to kill the Ethiopian who guarded your door  --  to burst it open and place you before me on the saddle , and fight my way out . The rest you know , lady . And now having explained to you all , we will once more resume our way ; for I doubt not you are desirous of seeing your father . ' How shall I thank you , my noble benefactor ! ' cried the Moorish maid , almost kneeling in her gratitude at his feet . I forget thou art an unbeliever in my remembrance of what thou hast done for me . My father will bless thee also ! ' I ask no return : I have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thou art made happy  --  this is enough for me . I heard him call thee Genilla . ' It is my name , noble youth . Now , wilt thou tell me thine ? ' she asked with sweet grace . Alfonzo . ' The Destroyer ! ' she cried , starting aside with amazement not unmixed with fear . I thought thou knewest me not , as I called my name aloud when I rode from the fortress . ' I was too much alarmed and confused to hear . The sounds of clashing steel , the whizzing of lances , and the shouts of the robbers , were all that I heard . Art thou then the brave and heroic mountaineer ? Yet why should I ask  --  I should have known thee by thy deeds ! ' Thou wilt hate me too ; for if thou hast heard of me , thou hast also heard I love not thy people  --  the oppressors of my native land . ' Yet from this time I will look upon thee , Alfonzo , and think of thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He who could risk his life to save a Moorish maiden , can not be the foe of her people . ' Alfonzo slowly shook his head , made no reply , and calling to his dog to guide the gazelles down the mountain , led the way with the maiden . A title ; and used also as a term of respect , like sir or senior . CHAPTER XVI . THE PARTING . We have now brought our story up to the time when Alfonzo had his first interview with the beautiful Genilla . We have seen how rapidly love intoxicated his heart as he discoursed with the beautiful Genilla . We have seen how rapidly love intoxicated his heart as he discoursed with her upon the moss-seat beneath the wild olive tree on the mountain . We shall now briefly allude to the events that followed , and then proceed with the regular narrative which we broke off after the parting of the lovers at the tower and as Alfonzo was returning to his home where he had left his father watching over the wounded young Emir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his homble abode , where he quickly exchanged his Moorish dress for one more suited to his faith and race , presented the lovely Moor to his sister , relating her history . The fair Xariffa , who had less strong prejudice than her brother , received the rescued maiden with sisterly affection ; and when , after an hour 's rest with her , she left under Alfonzo 's charge to return to her father 's house , she presented her with a little silver cross , and sweetly told her that when she was in sorrow or trouble if she would pray to him who died upon a cross , she would find protection and peace . Genilla accepted the cross rather as a token of affection than a badge of faith , and promised she would try its efficacy . Alfonzo then took her once more under his charge and safely conducted her to the tower , where she found that Ben Osmin had just returned from Cordova , whither he had been to get troops to pursue the robbers , who had carried off his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emirs fearing to let any of his own followers go , as a revolution was daily , if not hourly , expected to break out . He , therefore , returned in despair just before the arrival in safety of his lost daughter . He embraced her with tears , and was nearly beside himself with joy , crying and laughing by turns . Alfonzo had not delayed a moment after leaving her , as he was anxious to return and head an expedition against the tower , and besides he did not wish to hear the Moor 's thanks for the service done his daughter . From that time he became a frequent visitor at the cottage of the Moor , till old Ben Osmin thought it best to ask the young lover if he intended to become a Moslem ; if so , he might still visit Genilla ; but if not , he must cease coming to the Emir 's tower . I owe you my child 's happiness and safety , ' he said to him , but , by the beard of the Prophet ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost again to a Christian . The Zegris is at least half Moor , while thou hast not a drop of the true blood in thy veins . I thank thee , Christian , for the rescue of my child ; but I can not consent that you should have her as the price of it . So let there be peace between us and the shadow of thy body cast no more across my threshold ! ' Alfonzo bowed in quiet submission to the will of the Moor . He could not become a Moslem , even for Genilla 's love . All the while the maiden stood by in silence , her hands folded upon her breast , as if she perfectly submitted to her father 's decree . She well knew that the young mountaineer would not change his religion ; therefore she did not ask him . But she also knew that he would not cease to love her . Without a word he left the presence of the old Moor ; but he had caught the dark glance of the maiden as he passed out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak with thee , Alfonso . ' So he waited at the southern angle of the tower , and in three minutes Genilla was by his side . Her eyes were sparkling with moisture and her cheek was pale ; that emotion which she suppressed and concealed in the presence of her father now showed itself before the lover . Alfonzo , we can not part thus ! ' No , Genilla ! Yet I feel that your father has instructed me in my duty . I ought not to see you again . Day by day I have been self-condemned for loving thee ! But in vain have I tried to break the sweet spell with which thou hast bound my heart to thee ! I would say in the morning , I will see Genilla no more , and yet evening would find me by thy side ! I have felt miserable because I loved thee , and ye more wretched when I thought that I must one day give thee up , or perish ! ' It need not be , Alfonzo ! ' What wilt thou become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , I said not so . I can not become a Christian , but for me thou wilt become a follower of the Prophet of God ! ' I , a Mahommadoun ! ' he cried , shrinking from her in holy horror . I a Moslem believer ? Never , never , Genilla , ! I love thee with all my being , but I detest thy faith ! ' We will not darken this hour of parting by more words like these , Alfonzo . I love thee , because gratitude lies at the bottom of my love ; and I can not cease to love thee whatever thou art . We will speak of this subject no more . But we are not to part now forever ! ' I hope I shall see you again , yet I sin in saying so ! ' Sin ! Sin for thee to love me ! Oh , what a severe faith is thine , Alfonzo ! ' she said , softly and reproachfully . It is no sin for me to love thee as I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Infidel maiden , as I love thee Genilla , it would cast me forth from its bosom . ' Would to Allah it would ; then the fold of Islam would open its gate to receive thee ! ' I would rather perish with the curse of the Church upon my head than embrace thy false faith ! ' We were to speak no more on this theme , ' she said , smiling . I forgive thy words for thy sake . I have not come to meet thee , Alfonzo , to make thee a Mussleman , but to tell thee that I and my father are of two minds . He would have thee stay away , I would have thee come ! Wilt thou come secretly to see me ! For thou art the star of my life , now ! To love thee and to be conscious that I am beloved by thee is all of existence that I feel ! Thy love is the breath of my being . Wilt thou come ! ' Yes , Genilla ! I would refuse to see thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world than to lose my soul in the next ; but I can not say so . I must come . ' And he did come often and secretly , till their hearts grew together as one heart , and save in faith they were one . Yet Alfonzo loved with a heavy conscience . He kept the secret of his love from the hermit , and this made him unhappy ; for to an ingenuous mind concealment is hateful . He felt he was doing wrong in loving the Moorish maiden ; but he hoped to convert her to Christianity , and with this weak defence of his conduct he let the current of his peep passions drive him onward . On her part she felf none of those compunctious visitings of conscience for loving Alfonzo . He had won her heart by the service he had done her . Christian , or Moor , or Pagan , even , she could not cease to love him . And she too , it was the sweet hope of her young heart , she too hoped by the talisman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to her was the Faith of Faiths . So the current of their loves ran smoothly on , disturbed only by brief discussions upon their respective faiths . Their meetings were secret , and not less delightful that they were so . It rendered Genilla dearer to Alfonzo in that her sweet society was not to be purchased without danger . We have now got back to our lover as he is proceeding homeward from the Emir 's tower after his last visit , that visit in which he had found the hermit closeted with Ben Osmin , and on which he learned Genilla 's determination to accompany her father the next morning into Cordova . He walked slowly along through the dark cork-tree forest , his way at intervals being lighted up by a patch of moonlight laying like shining water-pools upon the green sward . He was busily occupied as he paced along , in thinking about his love for Genilla , and her contemplated visit to Cordova . He did not like to have her go , so beautiful and unskilful in the ways of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  in a word he began to feel jealous . He was very much afraid  --  if he had dared to confess his feelings to himself  --  that some one of the handsome and dashing Saracen cavaliers with whom Cordova swarmed , might see her and captivate her susceptible heart , and steal her affections away from himself . This idea , once fairly got into the head of the young mountain lover , troubled him vastly . Half a dozen times he was on the eve of turning back and insisting with all a lover 's eloquence that she should not go ; but he was every time deterred from this lest she should suspect his motives ; and to be thought to be jealous is exceedingly annoying to a lover when he is jealous . I will let her go , ' he at length said ; if some gay Saracen knight falls in love with her and she returns his passion , as she may  --  for I am but a poor mountaineer and a Christian  --  it will be best for me ! In loving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul 's salvation . But I should be miserable not to love her ! So beautiful , so gentle  --  she was made for me to love her ! Oh , Genilla ! if thou wert only a Christian ! ' He sighed and walked on rapidly , as if he would run from his thoughts . Suddenly he heard the tramp of horses , and voices ahead of him . He drew aside , and upon seeing the party come near , he knew that it was a Moorish cavalcade of hunters , for there were hounds in leach , and two falconers with birds riding in front . It will be a sad tale to bear back to Cordova , ' said one of the horsemen , a richly dressed Saracen , who seemed to be the chief of the party , addressing a young man in a green turban who rode by his side . It will indeed , ' answered the other ; but I trust that he has found his way down the mountain by some other path . It is more than likely we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allah grant it ! But on my soul be it ! I would rather it had been myself lost or perished than he ; and at this time , too , when our faction hoped so much from him . But I hope the best ! God is great  --  and what is to be will be ! ' It is barely possible he may have found shelter in the hut of some mountaineer , ' said another of those who rode slowly along in front . That would be as fatal to his life as if he had fallen from a precipice , ' responded the first speaker . It was folly in him going out to hunt on the Sierras , and being there , rash for him to separate himself from us . But I have done my best . We will return to Cordova , and if he be not there before us  --  which Allah bring to pass !  --  I will head a fresh party in the morning and scour the mountain . ' The horsemen by this time had passed some distance the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his recollection his wounded guest , whom he had left two hours before under the uncertain protection of his father , Gaspar , the Wolf-slayer ; and whom he had forgotten in his thoughts about Genilla . He now knew that his guest was the leader of the party which had passed , and that , having given up the search , they had been collected together by their lieutenant , and were returning to Cordova full of sorrow at their loss . His first impulse was to follow them , and relieve their anxiety by informing them where the young Emir  --  as he doubtless was  --  was lying . But the reflection how dangerous it might prove to introduce a lawless Moorish party into the quiet hamlet , checked this purpose in his mind as soon as it was formed . CHAPTER XVII . THE HERDSMAN 'S CABIN . Alfonzo did not , however , suffer his generous impulse to subside in his bosom without giving it at least some vent . He watched until the cavalcade had entirely past , save a single Moorish slave who rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent equipage . He came out from behind the tree where he had placed himself , and laying his hand upon the hempen bridle of the ass , he said to the surprised Moor , Ride forward and tell thy master that his chief is safe , and in three days will be in Cordova ! Say to him that he need not search for him , as he will not find him ; but in three days he will behold him in Cordova . ' Having thus spoken , he left the slave as suddenly as he had appeared before him . The Moor , as soon as he could recover from his surprise , galloped forward , and Alfonzo could hear him shouting , Yallah , yal-il-lah ! ' to the troop before him ; Yallah , the glorious Emir is found ! ' Alfonzo heard the commotion that followed this loud out-cry of the slave , and the trampling of the horses as their riders turned back to question the slave , reached his ears . He did not wait , however , for the Moor to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was soon out of danger of being overtaken by the pursuing hunters , who , upon hearing the intelligence , proceeded to search the forest for the informant . At length , Alfonzo could hear their chief wind a recall upon his bugle ; and , a little while afterwards , as he ascended the first steps of the mountain side towards the hamlet , could see a mile distant , in an opening of the forest , the steel arms of the party once more in column , galloping over the plain towards the city . They will now wait patiently for their chief , ' said Alfonzo , as he climbed the path by the side of the cataract ; and by the end of the three days , I trust he will be well , as father Godfrey has said . The hamlet is safe from their marauding visit ; and Xariffa from their free admiration . ' He soon reached the summit of the rocking table over which the cataract tumbled like wreathed clouds of silver in the bright moonlight , and in a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way through the forest , as he had come , he had been expecting to overtake the hermit ; and as the cavalcade of Moors had not fallen in with him , the result of which would have been to make him their prisoner , he began to suspect that he had not returned to the mountain ; but had , perhaps , gone on foot towards the city ; but wherefore , unless to meet the Infidel Ben Osmin there the next day , he could not divine . But that he would venture there , he could hardly believe ; for , much as the Saracen conquerors hated the Christians as a nation , they despised the priests , and never let slip an occasion of doing them a mischief . He now entered the hut softly , and not hearing any noise , he approached the couch where , three hours before , he had left the wounded Moor asleep under the influence of the soporific ointment which the hermit had rubbed into his wound . There , buried in deep sleep , the youthful Saracen lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less false than before , and his breathing was more natural . One jewelled hand lay beneath his cheek and partly concealed by his dark hair . His long eye-lashes lay in an arch of dark curving lines upon his cheek . Beautiful as he was , yet his features were manly and noble , and seemed to bear the impress of mingled courage and gentleness . As Alfonzo gazed upon him , he saw his nether lip move and twitch uneasily , and at times nervously curve itself into an expression of exceeding pride and ferocity . He recollected seeing the same expression upon his countenance when he first beheld him advancing towards him in the mountain path and haughtily commanding him and the hermit to stand aside for him . The soul may be brave and the spirit gentle ; but that look , which sleep has betrayed , shows that his heart is bad .  --  Noble and beautiful as he is , from this hour , I could rather fear than trust him . The sooner he recovers his strength , and is on his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy ! Hast thou come back ? What is the hour o ' the night ? ' This voice came from Gaspar , whom Alfonzo saw lying at full length upon a wolf 's hide , at the head of the couch .  --  He had fallen asleep with his forehead upon his boar-spear , and the voice of the young man raised him to a sense of his duty . It is near the mid hour of night , father . Has he waked yet ? ' Not while I have kept awake ; but , by the mass ! by the feeling about my eyes , I think I have been sleeping . He 's safe , though ! ' added the wolf-hunter.  --  We shall yet have our bout together for his jewels and gold  --  the Holy Virgin permitting it ! ' he added , crossing his bearded chest with the point of his spear . Hast thou seen the holy father ? ' asked Alfonzo , looking round the large , gloomy apartment of the cabin . No , not since he left here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt by this hour at his midnight vigils . What do you want with him , boy ? ' Nothing , father . Where is my sister ? Has she been in the room to-night ? ' I have not seen her . She sleeps in her room as a maiden ought at this hour . ' You can also go to your couch , father . I will watch by our guest . ' Can I trust thee , boy ? ' Dost thou think I covet the Moors gew-gaws ? No , no , father ; I am not yet a robber even of a Moor . ' Nor am I , by the mass ! Yet will I fight him fairly for these so soon as father Godfrey pronounces him a well man . Call me at the dawn . I have business on hand . I would first get the hide o ' the wolf he says he has wounded . He will ne'er ask for it , and if he should , he will not get it . At least the wolves of the mountains belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  our lands and rivers , our cities and churches , and even our maidens for his harem . By the red rood ! he shall leave us the wolves .  --  Wake me at dawn , boy . ' With these words , old Gaspar cast himself again upon the rude pallet from which Alfonzo 's entrance had aroused him , and in two minutes he was breathing heavily in deep sleep . Alfonzo gazed instantly from one to the other , and could not but remark the contrast between the physicel strength of muscle and sinew of one , and the graceful eloquence of form of the other . Both alike slept unconscious of each other , unconscious of the gazer . The cabin was silent , save the deep respirations of the wolf-slayer . An iron lamp , fed by rezin from the barlec tree of the mountains , stood upon a wooden shelf near the head of the bed . It cast its dusky light strongly upon the faces of the sleepers , and penetrated faintly to the extremities of the large apartment . There was little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two of oak placed on either side of a wide fire-place , a rude table , a dresser in one corner containing a few articles of pewter ware ; a picture of the Virgin by the side of one lattice , and a huge cross of cork-wood , smoked black over the chimney piece , completed the furnishing of the herdsman 's chief apartment . The floor was paved with flat pieces of stone taken from the brook close at hand , and the hearth was a fragrant as smooth as polished marble . The windows were low , and latticed strongly in diamondshaped panes , but without glass . There were but two doors in the room ; one that opened from without , and another of smaller size that led into an inner room of the cabin . The roof of the hut was open , with its rafters to the eye black and smoked , and garnished with cob-web festoons of a score of years . The cabin was surrounded in part by an enclosure of pickets , in which the goats and gazelles were folded at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bark , beneath which in cold stormy weather the herd might gather for shelter and mutual warmth . There were hanging about on the walls on the inside of the cabin , the coarse apparel of herdsmen  --  palm-hats with wide brims , and sandals of cork with white lacings . In one corner stood a bunch or faggot of oaken staves for boar-spears  --  for Gaspar 's hunting-spear had often to be replaced by a new one . There was also a crook and a Moorish lance and sword , and several pieces of Moorish armour  --  trophies taken by Gaspar in his first battles with the Infidels , a score of years before . There hung also above the mantle-piece the gigantic scymetar which Alfonzo had taken from the Ethiopian he had slain ; and dangling from a knob by it was suspended the hilt of the shivered yataghan which he had taken from the severed hand of El Zegris.  --  There also hung about the cabin many wolf-skins , trophies also of the young mountaineer 's courage , and proofs of his faithfulness in protecting his herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the face of the young Moorish prince , and then slowly walked away , and opening the door that led to the inner room , he passed through a little entry and then came to a second door . Here he tapped lightly with the tips of his fingers ;  --  he had to repeat the call , when a hand was heard moving the button within , and a voice , soft and womanly , said  --  Is it you , brother ? ' Yes , Xariffa ; can I come in ? ' The door opened , and he entered a small white-washed chamber , with a paved floor covered with rushes , little sacred pictures upon the spotless walls , a bed upon a wooden frame  --  a great luxury in a mountain cabin  --  upon which was a covering of the whitest linen  --  relics of Gaspar 's once noble style of house-keeping in the palmier days of Spain . There were several little luxuries in the room , all once his wife 's , and barely saved as mementoes to the daughter of her noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on which was a covering of silver embroidery , faded indeed , but exquisitely wrought . There was also a little oval silver-gilt mirror hanging above it , kept polished by a ball of doe-skin , that was suspended by its side from a silken thread . Upon the table also was a silver cruet for scented waters , curiously embossed , and two or three small rolls of parchment , tied with orange-colored ribbon . These rolls were , one of them a missal of her prayers , another a history of the Virgin , and a third a Book of the sayings of Christ , from his fourth to his twelfth year , compiled by a learned and devout monk . ' There was over the head of the bed a small shelf , on which stood a crucifix of black wood , and from a nail over that hung a small muslin bag containing relics : there was a hair from the eye-brow of the Virgin ; a piece of a chip that Jesus had chisselled off in his father 's carpenter 's shop , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cords , with which our Saviour drove the money changers from the temple ; a hair of the tail of the colt that he rode into Jerusulem on ; and a thorn of the crown that he wore when he was crucified ! ! ! These were but a portion of the treasures in this sacred bag . It had descended to Xariffa from her mother , and was devoutly reverenced by Gaspar  --  indeed it was the only thing he did reverence . But the mind of his daughter was too much enlightened to give value to such light things as these relics . She held them sacred , not that she believed them to be what they were represented to be ,  --  but they were sacred as a mother 's legacy . Father Godfrey had taught her too faithfully and well for her to mistake superstition for religion . The moon was lighted only by a broad beam of the moon-light that came in at one of the windows ; but reflected as it was from the snow-white walls on all sides , there was need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful Andalusian maiden could be seen to be beautiful , dark-eyed , and as graceful as a mountain-sylph . She was scarcely seventeen ; wore her rich brown tresses free upon her shapely shoulders  --  and being now robed in a loose night-dress that , as she let in her brother , she gathered about her form , one hand holding it to her bosom  --  she seemed to be some lovely statue just warmed into life . CHAPTER XVIII . THE INFIDEL GUEST . Thou wert awake , Xariffa , ' said the young gazelle-keeper , as he took a seat by the moon-lit window , which looked out upon the sparkling water-fall . Yes , brother ; I can not sleep when the moon shines so bright , ' she said in a sweet voice , that was only equalled by that of Genilla , the Moorish maiden .  --  Where have you been ? I went out for you a little while since . ' Did you ! ' he cried with surprise ; and whom saw you ? ' he asked , as he thought he discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father asleep by your couch , and upon it lay a stranger  --  a Moor ! ' And did you not before know he was here ? ' he asked , pointedly . Teresa , the herd 's wife , came in and said you had brought a stranger in , whom you had found on the mountain ; but when I would have entered the apartment , my father met me and bade me go to bed , saying I had no business there . ' And yet you went again afterwards , ' he said archly . Yes , brother . Not being able to sleep , I was seated by my window looking at the play of the light upon the cataract , when I heard a commotion in the gazellefold . Fearing that a wolf was prewling near , I went to call you ; the door was unfastened , and I entered ; my father was asleep , and , as I said , I saw the handsome stranger lying upon your bed . ' You saw , then , that he was handsome , Xariffa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if he had not been a Moor , my heart would have felt for him . Still I could not but pray that his soul might not be lost . ' I am glad he saw thee not . Go out no more while he is here  --  it were dangerous for him to see thee ! ' Upon hearing her brother say this , Xariffa refrained from saying further  --  that the young stranger did open his eyes while she was standing looking at him with sympathizing bosom , and that alarmed she had fled back to her own room , and filled with wonder and curiosity to know who he was and all about him . She did not tell her brother this , therefore , nor that it was thinking of the Moor as , much as the glare of the moonlight that made her wakeful . She was seated at her window recalling and dwelling upon his features , when the tap announcing Alfonzo recalled her to herself . I hope you did not stay long when you discovered him ? ' said Alfonzo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  When was this noise which you heard ? ' An hour ago . When I got back to my room all was still ; I have heard nothing since , or I should have waked my father . ' Why did you not wake him then ? ' For fear he would be displeased at seeing me there , and also for fear I might alarm the stranger . ' I am glad it is no worse . This stranger , Xariffa , is a Moor . I met him just at twilight on the mountain : it was at the meeting of the two paths by the old date tree  --  you know that there there is a narrow ledge ? ' I know it well ; it was there you saved me from the wolf , that would otherwise have rent me in pieces , dear brother ! ' she answered , laying her pretty brown hand in his , and fixing upon his face from her dark Andalusian eyes looks of grateful affection . The moon-beams fell like a veil of transparent silver upon her pure brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moonlight only can lend . He let his gaze rest upon her lovely face for a moment in tender admiration . He thought how like Genilla were the brow and deeply shaded eyes ; and the voice , how some of its tones resembled those of the Moorish maiden ;  --  and he loved Xariffa more for this resemblance to Genilla , and his love for Genilla received new impetus from her likeness to Xariffa . On that rock where father Godfrey and I were resting , with room but for us two , when this Moor appeared armed with a broken spear , and with a flushed cheek . Upon seeing us his bearing became haughty and he commanded us , calling us Christian dogs , to let him pass . ' Alas , he looks so gentle now as he sleeps ? ' For the sake of Genilla  --  ' For her sake ! Hast thou not cast the Moslem girl from thy heart , brother ? ' she cried , with surprise and an aspect of alarm . Can I not say for her sake , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love her , sister Xariffa ? Be assured I shall never hate Genilla , ' he said , firmly . For her sake , I said I resolved not to resist the Moor 's fierce demand . So I stood aside , almost hanging over the verge , balanced by a hold upon the trunk of the date tree . But the holy hermit , not recognising the appellation given us , refused to move , and the fiery Moor aimed a blow at his breast ; but before I could ward it off , the hand that held the broken spear dropped by his side powerless and he sunk at the feet of the good father insensible and bleeding from a wound which he before said he had got from an encounter with a wild boar or a wolf . ' Father Godfrey at once took pity on him , for his anger extends not to the unfortunate , and bade me raise him up and bear him to the hut . I obeyed . We dressed his wounds and in the molient which de poured upon them was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The holy father , who is a skilful leech , says that by the third day he will recover and be able to go to his people . ' Dost thou know who he is , brother ? ' Thou hast too much curiosity , I fear me , touching him . But thou art discreet , He is a dangerous person for thee to be seen by him . He is a Moor ! and that is enough for thee , Xariffa ! Thou art safe now in the ignorance of the lawless Saracen that so fair a flower as thou art blooms in the mountain glens ; but whether this man be Prince or peasant , he will , if he sees thee , bear the fame of thy beauty to Cordova . From that hour thou art no longer safe here . ' There is no danger to me , brother , from one so noble looking ! Prince or peasant ! He is not the latter ; and may be the former . ' Thou talkest as if thou didst wish it would prove so . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one or the other . Which wouldst thou most regard a Christian Peasant , or a Saracen Emir . ' The peasant , brother . Why shouldst thou ask me ? ' I thought thy words showed a regard for this Moor . ' The Virgin forbid ! I pitied but his misfortunes . ' Alfonzo said no more . He knew that he , a Christian , madly loved a Moorish maiden and he found that even Xariffa might love a handsome Moorish youth ! But then she had no tie of gratitude to bind her to the stranger . He had done her no service to awaken attachment for him in her young and guiIeless bosom . In a word , thought he within himself , she has no motive , ' as I had , for loving . My fears are groundless . She is too pure a pupil of the holy father Godfrey to fix her heart upon an unbeliever . I will see that he does not see her , and there will be no danger from what is past ! ' The hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I will go and look into the fold . It may be that a wolf has been abroad ! Did you hear Ban give the alarm ? ' Yes , he barked violently at the time . But , as I said , all was soon silent again ! ' It was perhaps only a false alarm . But I will go out and see . I shall then return to watch with this stranger , who I wish was safe in Cordova . But it is father Godfrey 's commands that I extend to him the usages of mountain hospitality until he is well . Ere many hours he will awake , and perhaps he will need a nurse 's care . ' I will give it , brother . ' No , no ! It would be setting the dove to watch the new-fledged hawk . I will see Teresa Pablo 's wife and entrust this duty to her . I shall be in the mountains all day . Wilt thou promise me one thing , Xariffa ? ' Whatever thou desirest brother . I can deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the morrow . Keep out of his sight with discreet care . I have good reasons for it . Would to the saints he had never been led this way , and thus cast upon me . But if we must harbour the lion , we must take heed that he does us no harm . ' I promise you , brother . The Moor is handsome , but do not fear for my heart , ' she said , laughing . I could never love a Moor , were he an angel . ' I question whether there are many Moors who are angels , or are like to be . ' What ; not Genilla ! But I ought not to speak to thee of her . Fear not for me . I care not for him , save that I shall pray for his soul . ' Thou hadst best not . It will make thee think of him in thy prayers , when thou shouldst be thinking of the Virgin , and her beloved son . It will do thee no good to pray for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise me he shall not see thee . ' This I have already done . ' Then good night . I now go to the fold , and if all is quiet I shall go back to the room where our guest lies , und there watch with him till he wakes . Good night sister . The saints keep thee in their safe keeping . ' And guard thee also , brother , ' she answered , as she withdrew her graceful form from the gentle embrace of his fraternal arm . Alfonzo went out to see if all were quiet in the fold . He passed first along a narrow walk by the side of the cabin , and came to a gate-way in a high picketed enclosure , over which a brow of the mountain hung like a roof . It was a close and sheltered covert , and inaccessible to wolves save only from the rock above ; from which more than once these fierce beasts had boldly leaped from a height of thirty feet into the midst of the herd . But it was a leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tbey always were slain after fiercely combatting with Gaspar or Alfonzo . The latter now walked around the fold and found all quiet . Ban the dog came near , and rubbed his head against his side , and seemed unusually alert ; but there were no signs of an enemy . The gazelles were all quietly nestled in one corner of the fold , and all wore an air of peace and security . He then left the spot , pausing an instant to gaze upon the dark mountains around him , and casting a glance at the skies in which the moon walked in her brightness , attended by the brightest stars of the night 's train . He now re-entered the cabin and approached the couch . The Moor awoke as he came near , or rather raised his eyes and closed them again , murmuring a few words . Alfonzo went near him , when he again raised his eye-lids , and gazed upon him . Allah , give me memory , ' he said , where am I ? Who art thou ? ' Thy host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left thee by a skilful leech . ' The young man took it with looks partly unconscious , and a bewildered air . Who art thou ? ' he asked again . Thy friend . Sleep and get strength , for thou hast need of it , ' said Alfonzo , who saw that he was yet but partially restored to consciousness . I have seen a vision . I thought I had been in Paradise . A houri came and bent over me , and told me that I was immortal . But who art thou ? What dreary place is this ? This is no paradise , for thou art a Christian dog . ' Moor , '  --  began Alfonzo ; but checked the indignant words that leaped to his lips . The next moment the Infidel was buried in profound sleep as before . He is asleep . How quickly . He was not fully awake . What meant he by that vision . Xariffa is as lovely as the houri of this Mahommedan 's paradise . Could he have seen her . The Virgin mother forbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope he will sleep well , and depart sound at early dawn . I will help him away . I know not why , but I feel a foreboding of evil weighing upon my heart through this man . He shall depart at dawn . if I have to take him again upon my shoulders and thus carry him within a stone 's throw of the gate of Cordova . ' CHAPTER XIX . THE EMIR AND HIS HOSTS . The morning broke upon the sleepers and the watcher . With the first grey light Gaspar shook sleep from him , as if it had been a mantle , and standing up said , as he set aright his gasban and bernash , adjusted his skin-cap upon his locks , sheathed his knife and grasped his wolf spear , The Moor is sound . Thy father 's potion is strong , boy . Didst thou give him the second ? ' Yes , ' father . He is under its influence . ' I would not value a pair of goats that he were now well again . My fingers itch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and look at the door ; yonder comes the hermit in his round cap , and haggard enough he looks . Good morning , holy man . Thy blessing for the day , ' and the stout wolf-killer dropped on his knees upon the stone floor of his cabin before the tall form of the hermit , who , at the moment , entered the hut . Thou hast it , son , ' answered the monk , touching him upon the uncovered crown of the head . Thou dost not ask the same , my son , ' said the hermit , fixing his eyes on Alfonzo , who stood aloof . No , father , ' answered the young man , who felt that he did not deserve to ask a blessing at his hand , so long as he loved Genilla so wilfully and madly as he did . Kneel ! ' Alfonzo obeyed , but with evident reluctance , conscious of his guilty secret . He received the blessing in silence , and with shame at heart . He rose suddenly , as if his generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had yielded , when he had felt , that if father Godfrey knew all , he would pronounce a curse instead of a blessing , upon his head . The young Moor now not only looked round upon them with an air of consciousness , but raising himself up on his elbow , he said in good Spanish : How is it that I am here ? You are a Christian , I see . Explain to me , for I can remember nothing , distinctly , ' and he fixed his eyes upon the hermit . Thou hast been wounded , Moor , as thou saidst , by a wolf , and I had thee brought hither under the roof of this honest goat-herd and his son . I dressed thy wounds , and have had as much care taken of thee as if thou wert not a scorner of the holy faith . ' Thanks , thanks ; I remember that I saw thee . Thou shalt be remembered . Gold I have , and it shall be given thee . When was this ? ' Yesterday . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am still weak , I find , ' he said , as he made an effort to sit up . You will be better to-morrow . Has he drank the potion , Alfonzo ? ' asked the hermit . I gave it to him about two hours after after midnight , father . ' Then he will mend rapidly . But it is needful that thou shouldst remain till thou has strength to walk away . ' I would rather then go now ; for I am unable to move far . Hast thou seen any of my people about ? ' I met last night , Moor , ' answered Alfonzo , a party of Moorish horse , evidently a hunting party . I heard their chiefs discoursing , and learned from their words that they had lost their leader in the mountains . I supposed that thou must be the person they were so concerned for , and I took occasion to speak to one of the party , and bid him tell their lieutenant that thou wert safe , and would be in Cordova in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no further search for thee . ' Ha ! and didst thou not tell them where I was , that they might come for me ? ' cried the Moor , with a flushed brow and angry eyes . I did not , ' calmly responded the young mountaineer , firmly meeting the Saracen 's fiery glance . I did not care to have a Moorish horde invade the retirement of my mountain home . I thought it better to conduct thee , when thou wert well enough , myself to the walls of Cordova . ' And did the chief let you pass unquestioned ? ' demanded the irritated young Emir . It was in the forest I discovered them . I was unseen by them , and so heard their discourse as they rode by ; and , after all had ridden on , save a Moorish slave mounted on a pack mule , I stepped out from my concealment and bade him tell his masters the words I have already repeated . He rode forward at once , and in a few moments afterwards the forest resounded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their search , and reached my hut here in safety about midnight . But I have reason to believe that thy followers , if thou art their chief , returned to Cordova . ' Thou deservest death , Christian , for thus withholding the knowledge of my being here ! ' cried the Saracen , angrily . Moor ! ' cried Gaspar , who had been standing by and frowning upon the Infidel in silence ; I would caution thee to be chary of thy speech here . Thou art not in Cordova among thy friends , but in the free mountains among thy enemies . Discreet speech becomes thee . ' Dost thou menace me ? ' cried the Moor , clenching his hand as if he would grasp a scymetar . Gaspar , ' said the hermit , worry him not . This treatment of an invalid becomes thee not , especially when he is thy guest . Infidel , thou art wholly in the power of the Christian . But thou shalt not he harmed . I will see that thou art attended to till thy strength is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But thou must be quiet , and also have full confidence in my skill . ' I can do no otherwise . I will trust thee , leech ! ' answered the Moor , faintly . Gaspar , go forth to thy day 's duties ; and , Alfonzo , remain thou here , ' said the monk . The wolf-slayer went out , darkly frowning upon the Saracen , who had fallen back exhausted upon his coarse pillow . Father Godfrey examined and dressed his wound , and gave him a drink of some healing mixture ; and , darkening the room , went forth with Alfonzo , leaving him to sleep . Father , ' said Alfonzo , as they stood without , I like not the longer presence of this wolf in my fold ! ' It will be but a day or two . I and four men will make him a litter and bear him away , and leave him at the first Moor 's dwelling on the plain . ' It might endanger his life . He wants quiet , my son . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will invigorate him rapidly . He must not be removed ; and , besides , it would endanger thee and thy men . The Moors thou wouldst go amongst might quarrel with thee and do thee a mischief . ' Not coming on such an errand ? ' Thou hadst best not trust to them .  --  Why can he not share the hospitality of thy roof ? He has gold , and will repay thee ? ' I would not touch the Infidel 's gold for such a thing , father . But  --  I will tell thee freely . Thou knowest my sister Xariffa is very fair . ' No Infidel maid can compare with her ; and she is as good as she is comely . ' I fear that if this firey young Saracen lays eyes upon her , he will covet her . The very thought kindles my cheek . ' The maiden would not look upon a Moor with favor , Alfonzo . ' But if the Moor looks upon her with favor , he will , perhaps , wish to possess her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl an inmate of the harems of the Moslem invader ? It will be no new thing . If this prince fancies her , he will strive to possess her ; got no Andalusian maid is safe in her father 's where himself , would teach me to forget he now that I have given myself to th overthrow of her people 's power and th upraising of the cross where the crescen now stands ! But my heart is more pow erful with its arguments than my head I must see ! I can not cease loving her I hope yet to make her a christian ! He was pacing up and down the pave court within the house of Signor Vele as thus mused . It was overhung wit trees on two sides that grew in a garden to which a gate in the wall led . Th moon was just rising and silvering th tops of the palms and shedding its lustr upon tire minarets . The dwee-loo or An dalusian nightingale was singing in th branches of an orange tree above hi head , and the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gat which was set in tire wall and found tha by drawing a bolt on the innerside i came open . He passed through it an found himself in a spacious garden o shady walks , fountains and terraces . I was a scene of wonderful beauty to b thus hidden in the heart of the city . I the centre of the garden , were two loft palms that waved their tall capitals in th soft winds and cast an ever moving shad upon the sward at his feet He was charmed with the lovelines and quiet of the place . He rambled on and passing a marble fountain , ascended flight of steps , which led him to a high er terrace of the garden . He saw in th distance the walls of a villa , on the re mote extremity of the garden overlook ing it . He moved slowly in the directio of it , and as he came in sight of a lattic he thought he heard voices . He dre his scymetar , and threw back the fold of his bernish , so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he cautiousl went forward . But instead of an enem or foes seeking to attack him , he saw as he passed round the trunk of a larg cypress , with his sword in his grasp ready to defend himself should he com suddenly upon foes ,  --  leaning in an eas attitude against a palm-tree , a man play ing upon a guitar , and singing as he play ed with a fine rich voice He could not be deceived !  --  the voic was that of Abdelasis ; and as the moon light fell full upon his figure , revealin his features , he clearly recognised the Caliph He stood transfixed at the discovery his first impulse was to rush forward an attack him upon the spot , and if possibl take him prisoner . But ho reflected tha aid might be nigh  --  that he knew no where he was , having wandered throug the gardens some distance from the mer chant 's house , and that his retreat migh be cut off . Besides , Abdelasis-thoug he deserved punishment for his treach ery to him-might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was not a little surprised to mee the Caliph in these gardens , and especial ly thus sentimentally playing the lover He bent his eyes keenly to see if h could discern any one at the lattice ; bu all was quiet there , and no sign even o a fair hand upon the casement He remained for a few moments , con ealed by the trunk of the cypress fro the view of Abdelasis , whose face wa upturned to the lattice . He could no catch but here and there a word of wha he sang , but it was enough to show hi that it was a song of love At length he ceased , and looked up t the lattice intently , and then waved hi guitar towards it , saying  --  ' Cruel fair one ! He who woos the might command three . It is I , not thou who am bound a prisoner ;  --  my heart i in chains , and I sigh in bondage ! Wil thou not appear , lady ? There was no reply ; the lattice be trayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being weak and his mind a little confused and irresoiute , he had drank it off in silence . Offered by the hand of Gaspar he would have rejected it ; but there was something in the venerable aspect of the hermit that led him to believe , or at least hope that he intended him good and not evil . After the departuae of the three men the door opened from the inner room and an old brown-visaged female stole softly in . It was Teresa the wife of Pablo the hireling . She was dressed in a dark blue gown of coarse material , looped up at the side to her girdle ; and upon her black locks , sprinkled with grey , she wore a red cotton cap with lappets over the cars , and tied beneath her skinny throat . She was full fifty , tawny as an Indian , and yet with an appearance of having once possessed youthful beauty ; for her figure was still symmetrical and her dark eyes were bright and in themselves handsome . She held in her hand her rosary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This woman had been commanded by Alfonzo to watch his guest , and also to keep silence , should he wake , touching the presence in the house of the fair Xariffa . All this the dame promised ; and after having passed a few minutes in the room with the maiden , to assist her in making her neat rustic toilet , she proceeded , armed with her rosary , to the post assigned her . The old nurse did not like to be left alone in a room with an Infidel , even though he were asleep . She had heard strange and marvellous tales of Moorish necromancy ; and it was her religious belief , that every Saracen was a son of Sathanas . She , therefore , left ajar the door , so that , in case she should see any evil spirits appear about the bed of the unbeliever , she could secure for herself a prompt escape from the scene of danger . She now counted her rosary , and muttering an ave at every bead , took courage and walked towards the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of heather for a pillow . The room had been darkened by the hermit , but light enough stole in through one of the windows to enable her to have a good view of the patient 's features . Teresa had seen many a Moor at a distance , and wide awake with scymetars in their hands ; but she was then too much frightened to look at them with attention ;  --  but a Moor asleep and unarmed , was comparatively harmless , and she resolved to have a good look at him . The gloom of the large room did not please her at all ; it looked too much as if the dark corners might hide scores or two of little imps of Eblis ; so she approached the lattice and put back the old baragan of Gaspar 's with which it was temporarily curtained , and so let the broad , cheerful sun-light into the apartment and across the person of the Moor . The sight of the sun-beams gave Teresa more confidence , for she knew that evil beings feared the light of day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gazed upon him with mingled curiosity and awe . Ave Maria ! but he is a proper youth . How handsome his nose is ; and then he has a mouth just like a baby 's , only it has a moustache on it , which only makes it the manlier ! The blessed Virgin keep my soul ! but he is for all the world like any Christian . See his dark curling hair and eye-brows , as even as the new moon . His hands !  --  Jesu Maria !  --  they are as delicate as Signora Xariffa 's ; and how they sparkle with rings ! That large stone must be a diamond at the least ; it is like white fire blazing . How much I wonder did it cost ? What a pity for a Moor to have such handsome jewels ; and such silks to dress in , and velvet bands on his wrists . I never in my born days saw a diamond shine afore ! I 've heard the folk say they give light in the dark : I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound  --  if I could just slip it off for a minute , I 'd take it into the closet and try it . I would like to see if the story they tell about it is true  --  it looks as if it would come off easy . ' Teresa , therefore , softly approximated her thumb and finger to the ring  --  a brilliant diamond that sparkled on his little finger . The finger was exposed to her touch , and the ring looked as if it bound it loosely , as though loss of blood had relaxed the muscles and contracted the size of the finger . She , who a few moments before had approached the couch only with her rosary in her hand , and with many fears , Saracen ; but noble looking as he is , there is something in his features that is unpleasant . But what is that thou hast there ? ' Do n't be angry , Signora , for he is only a son of Sathanas , and if I had robbed and murdered him outright , it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . Open thy hand . What ! a ring ? ' A diamond , nothing less ; and shines in the dark like a glow-worm . It would take a rosary of ' em to make a light as bright as a rezin taper ; but they are very pretty , and then do n't burn out , which is a great saving , if one only had one big enough . ' Where did you get this , woman ? ' asked Xariffa , with angry surprise . I just slipped it off the Hommadoun 's little finger . He was sound , and is never the wiser . ' Robbed him ? ' No , Xariffa . I heard diamonds shined in the dark ; so I took it off as I saw it was on loose , to carry it into the closet to see . ' And did it ? ' Yes , as I said , like a glow-worm . ' And why did you come to me with it ? Why did you take it off , or after having been guilty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! ' What good will it do to him ? He has more , and is rich . We are poor , and it is no sin to keep it . He is an Egyptian , and we are bound to spoil the Egyptians . ' Take it back at once . Wouldst thou rob a guest of my father 's house , woman , and he a wounded youth . If you despise him because he is a Moslem , you should do him good because thou art a Christian . Return quickly , and , without waking him , replace it upon his finger . The Virgin protect me ! The Moor ! ' she cried , rising and retreating with surprise and fear , as she beheld the tall , noble figure of the stranger in the door of her room . compliment to her beauty ; I thought you were sleeping  --  that is , too ill with your wound to walk . ' Xariffa said this with hesitation and great confusion , and alarm ; for his appearance had completely taken her by surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least so her heart whispered to her , as she gazed a second time upon him . His noble figure , elegantly attired , though his costume was somowhat disarranged , his handsome , pale features ; his large fine eyes , beaming upon her with mingled admiration and passion ; the calm repose of his whole attitude , as he leaned for support upon the hilt of the scymetar  --  all spoke in his favor . Teresa who had seen him at the same time that Xariffa discovered him , had instantly sunk upon her knees and began to tell her beads , and to cry for mercy in the name both of the Virgin and of the mother of Mahomet . The Moor took no further notice of her , more than to point with his hand to the door , and simply to say  --  Go ! ' She gladly sprung to her feet , and fled from his presence . Xariffa called to her to remain , trembling at the thought that she should he alone with the Moor , but Teresa was deaf . Fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as your guest I am here .  --  As I slept , the ring you hold in your hand , was taken from my finger . I awoke and saw the woman who has now fled in such terror , quit my room ; and I rose to follow her , as I suspected her .  --  She led me hither ! I heard your reproof and your command for her to return it ! For this accept my thanks ! ' I need them not , Signor Saracen ! ' answered Xariffa , embarrassed . Take the ring , sir ; I am sorry the nurse took it ; but I believe it was more from curiosity to test its quality of emitting light in darkness , than from a desire to rob you of it ; yet , upon getting possession of it , her eupidity got the better of her honesty . I pray you forgive her , and receive the diamond . ' No  --  it is yours , fair Christian maid , ' answered the young man , taking it from her to place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' she quickly said , removing it with a shudder . I can not take it . ' Thou art too cruel , maiden , to disdain my gift . I owe this courtesy , for I am thy guest . ' My father 's and brother 's . ' So ; these two men are father and brother to thee , ' repeated the Moor , as he seated himself upon a settle near the door . I am still weak and must rest while I talk with thee . ' Hadst thou better not return , Signor , to thy couch . Thy face is pale and  --  ' Nay , maiden , I shall be better here , ' he answered with a smile , bending at the same time his piercing black eyes upon her face . I shall do better with so fair a leech as thyself , than under the care of the old man who hath dragged me so heavily . I am still heavy with the sleepy power of his potions . What is thy name ? ' Xariffa , Signor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold , free inquiry . But I pray thee , Signor , stay not here . Thou art imprudent . ' To trust myself within the influence of eyes so burning as thine . I grant it . But do not fly me . I shall not let thee pass me to the door . See , my scymetar debars thy passage out . Thou art myprisoner , sweet bird of the mountain ; ' he said , as he snugly placed his sword across the open door , pressing the point deep into the wooden post . Sit down , I pray thee , and resume thy netting . I love to look at fair fingers nimbly plying the shuttle bow . Thou hast both skill and taste . maiden , ' he added , taking up a corner of The sun of thy eyes will warm my blood and  --  ' No more , Signor . Thou didst pledge thy word to keep silent , if I permitted thee to remain . ' Then thou dost permit it . Thanks ! ' he said , with looks of delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' she answered , with a smile playing about her beautiful mouth as she bit into the thread of her work and then proceeded to knot and weave it . She was not perfectly at her ease in so dangerous a presence ; yet she had far more confidence in him than at the outset . Still she felt like a lamb who finds itself unexpectedly the guest of a lion , and finds that it must make the best of his critical situation . There was something in the degagee air of the handsome young Saracen that amused her , and qualified greatly her fear of him . There was also something in his looks , his manner when he spoke to her , in the tones of his voice , that struck her as pleasing .  --  She knew that he was a very dangerous person , and her brother 's warning words came vividly to her mind . But still he did not look so very dangerous . And then he had apologised so handsomely ; and removed so pleasantly the scymetar from the door-way ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was resolved by docility to atone for his previous boldness . She , therefore , resumed , timidly indeed , her netting ; yet she trembled lest some accident should bring her brother back from the hills before noon ; or for fear her father should come suddenly in and find his guest in his lamb 's fold . These thoughts troubled her ; and what too with the dark eyes of the young Emir fixed upon her , and watching every movement of her trembling fingers , it is not surprising that she dropped almost every third stitch in her web , and made , altogether , in the five minutes space only that she tried to net upon it before him , a very bungling piece of work of it . the Emir Mahomad , who was slain last year , is the most powerful of these , though he rules not with the Council . ' Then thou hast heard of Abdelasis ? ' Only that he is rich and ambitious , and has many friends . My father said that the Council of Emirs feared him more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of our city matters penetrated even here , maiden ? ' said the Moor , with surprise on his countenance . The peasants know more than we ourselves . There has been , within a few days past , some talk of such matters as you speak of , and it may be that Abdelasis may succeed , but it remains to be tried . He is closely watched by the Emirs , since a rumor got out a few days back that he might aspire to the Caliphate ; for one resolute man , with a few fast friends , would do more than a score of jealous and quarrelling Emirs , each fearing the other , and , in their disunion , become powerless . I had not believed the movements in the town were so well reported here . ' We take a deep interest in all that passes among our conquerors , Signor . It may be that , by and by , taking advantage of your dissensions , we may regain our city and province ! ' By the sword of the Prophet ! thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Christian maids feel this interest in their country ? ' Else they were unworthy the love of Christian youths , Signor ! We all weep and pray daily for our beloved land . Spain has fallen ; but she will rise again . The holy hermit , who dressed thy wound , says that this calamity hath befallen the land for its sins . It may be so ! We are deeply penitent now , and I trust that Heaven will yet accept our penitence and once more raise up a prince and leader among us . ' By the soul of the Prophet ! I did not know such a spirit dwelt in the mountains ! ' cried the Saracen . If the sister speaks and feels thus how must the brother and father feel and speak ! If the maidens of the conquered land are moved to such eloquence and lofty spirit , how must the men of the country be effected . With such a feeling abroad in the land , Spain is not conquered ! ' Thou hast confessed it , Moor . Spain is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not over the soul of Andalusia . ' The more I listen to thee , the more thou pleasest me , for thy very spirit ! I have never before beheld a woman like thee . Thou canst think and speak for thyself . Beautiful and wise maiden , listen to me , Moor though I am . I love thee . My heart is taken by thy beauty , but less by thy beauty than thy spirit . For thy sake I would almost become a Christian ! ' Thou wouldst never be a Christian , if only for my sake . Christianity receives none but those who come for Christ 's sake , and that they may be saved . Thy words displease me , Signor . Yet I would that not only thou but all thy people were true believers and heirs of promises given to thy father Abraham ! ' Perhaps , if thou couldst favor my love , maiden , thou mightest teach mel the truth . I could sit at thy feet and listen to thy teachings forever , so that I could have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy dark eyes . ' Thy speech is blasphemy ; for it mingles earthly passion with heavenly love . I can not hear thee , Signor . In professiug to love me , thou art mocking me . Wilt thou depart , or let me ? ' Nay , I will not detain thee ! Never was wooer treated so coldly . I could envy the Christian goat-herd on whom thy smile would light ! If thou wilt return my love , I swear to thee , by Allah , I hear the Moor up , sir . ' Ah , then I am back in time ! The hermit 's potion was not so potent as he supposed . I found the wolf which he had wounded . It was laying in a crevice of the cliff with the broken spear sticking in his shoulder , and , as you see , had nearly gnawed it up in endeavoring to draw it from the wouud in his broken shoulder-blade . He resisted fiercely , but I slew him , and here is his skln . The other is the hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lair , and this morning attacked him in it ; and after some scratches , as you see , killed him and took his coat from him . They were both of the largest size , and one of them has five old wounds in his hide . The Moor will be glad to see the skin of his enemy . I will take it to him . I am glad he is up , for we will the sooner get rid of him ; I ike not these Infidels too well at a distance ; much less beneath my own roof . But the father would have it that a Christian ought to show hospitality to his foe , giving me Scripture for it . If the devil made a call upon the good father in his cell , I have no doubt he would treat him civilly with the best he had . But I must see the Moor . ' foe . I would give much to see this Alfonzo ;  --  where is he now ? ' Doubtless with his herd upon the hills . ' Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' exclaimed the Moor with surprise . He takes no merit for his deeds , Signor ; he is like all brave men , modest . Spain speaks of him as a hero , while he only regards himself as a humble gazelle-tender . ' He must be an extraordinary man . Whose other armor and arms are these ? They are Moorish ? Yes ; they were taken from their ownners in fair battle a score of years ago . Thou seest that narrow sword  --  it was Taric 's , the Moorish conqueror ! ' Tarics ! ' exclaimed the Saracen with surprise and admiration , taking it up .  --  How came it here ? ' I struck it from his hand , and he only was saved by his friends from being slain by me ; for I had this foot upon his breast ! ' Thou ? ' Yes , Moor . Herdsman as you see me now , I am of the best blood in Spain . When Taric invaded our land , I was a noble , at the head of a thousand retainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should be defeated . Since that disastrous day I have been a mountaineer ! Still I keep Taric 's sword as a trophy ! ' Thou shalt no longer have it to beast of , Christian ! ' answered the Moor . It is mine ! ' Thine , Moor ! Give it to me ! ' Thou shalt no longer retain the sword of the great Champion of Islam . It is a shame to the children of the Prophet that thou shouldst have it . Ask me no more for it ! ' No , I will not ask thee for it , Saracen ! ' cried Gaspar , throwing down the skins and catching a scymetar from the wall . I will take it from thee , and with it thy jewels ! I am poor and thou art rich , robber ! Come , defend thyself ? ' As Gaspar spoke these fierce words he sprung towards him , his long hair flowing behind , giving him a wild and extremely fierce aspect . The Saracen stepped back and prepared to defend with the scymetar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords would have been clashing in mortal combat , when Alfonzo suddenly stood between them and interposed his person to their hostile swords . The Saracen gazed with surprise upon the noble and commanding air with which the tall mountaineer put them asunder , his shepherd 's long bernish falling back from his shoulders like the drapery of a statue . Behind him stood , leaning upon his long staff and surveying the group , the majestic whitebearded figure of the hermit Godfrey . What means this , Saracen ? How is this , father ? ' demanded Alfonzo with difficulty keeping back the fierce wolf-slayer . Dost thou see that he has the scymetar of Taric in his grasp ? ' cried Gaspar . The holy father 's potion hath given him health , and , by the mass ! he gets out of his couch to rob me of my trophy . Stand back , Alfonzo ! I am to do battle with him for both Taric 's sword and his jewels ! ' Not so , father ! ' answered Alfonzo . The Moor is entitled to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seest thy life is in danger . ' The Moor , with a dark frown , slowly hung it upon the stag 's horn from which he had taken it , and then stood proudly gazing upon Alfonzo and the monk . How long hast thou been up , Infidel ? ' asked the hermit now coming forward as Gaspar drew sullenly back , muttering threats against the Moslem hound , as he termed him . became clearer , and his whole bearing like a man who has suddenly invested himself with strength as with a garment . He strode proudly towards the door , and said with haughty courtesy  --  Thanks , Christians , for the shelter of thy roof ! If thou wilt show me the path down into the valley , fair sir , I can then go forward alone ! ' This last sentence was addressed to Alfonso . Go with him my son ! ' said father Godfrey . He is too overbearing for me to like him well enough to be his companion , ' answered Alfonzo , But I heed him not . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , it would be to lighten him of his jewels , ' said Gaspar in an under tone , and perhaps he will find a guide far more of the way than he bargains for . I will follow on at a distance ; and when Alfonzo leaves him , I will join him again , and we will then finish our little affair just now interrupted ! ' The Moor , preceded by Alfonzo , armed with his wolf-spear , which he never went without , left the cabin and took his way down the cliff-side towards the valley . Ere they were fairly out of sight , Gaspar followed , leaving the hermit resting in the hut . Thou art not Caliph , and so we are free , proud Moor , ' answered Alfonzo , with a scornful curl of his lip . The mountaineer is not so easily enslaved . Dost thou recollect that fifteen years ago , when one of the Caliphs would have made us bondsmen , how many of his servants lost their lives in the defiles of the Sierras ! He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are born free , and to God only are we servants . Art thou an Emir , for I know thou art a Moor of rank ? ' I am a private citizen of Cordova , ' answered the Saracen , who did not care to make known his rank and name , when it might , as he feared , be fatal to him ; for it will be seen he was no friend to the Spaniard ; but rather , of all their foes , the bitterest , as well as the most rich and powerful . What is thy name ? ' I fear not to speak it , though thou fearest to give thine own  --  I am Alfonzo , the goat-herd . ' The Destroyer ? ' cried the Saracen , who now recalled to mind the Ethiop 's scymetar , which he had found in the hut . Art thou the Alfonzo who cut off the hand of the Zegris ? ' he added , stopping full in the path , and fixing his gaze upon him , as he waited his reply . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking on as before . Then I have my wish , for I this day told that fierce peasant who would have attacked me , that I would give much to behold thee . ' Thou seest but a freeman , Moor .  --  The sight , I know , is rare in Cordova to infidel eyes ; but thou wilt find many in the mountains . ' The Saracen remained standing still , and surveying the mountaineer wilh curiosity and admiration . So ! Thou art the brave man I have heard so much of ! ' he at length said . I am glad we have met , or rather that I knew who thou wert before we parted . I believe thou art no friend to the Saracen ! ' No . I look upon the Saracen as the enemy of God and of Christian nations . Thy people have now the power in the land , but it will not be forever . The crescent that now so proudly glitters above the cross must be thrown down .  --  Heaven may have punished Spain for her sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wicked children of the Prophet , whose iniquities cry aloud to it for its judgment . ' Thou art a bold speaker , peasant ! ' answered the Moor , reminded by his words of Xariffa 's ringing speech . It is such men as thyself that keep Spain in commotion . ' Would there were more of them , Saracen , ' answered Alfonzo . But this is no time for us to speak of Spain 's wrongs and thy oppression . I have conducted thee now as far as I intended . From this spot thou seest the palm-tree of Ali Hamet . It will be a guide from which thou canst not stray . ' If thou wilt go on with me farther , I will give thee a purse of gold . ' No gold ! I will go on if thou art a coward . No herdsmen of the hills will find thee here , Sir Moor . The Saracen would have resented the imputation of cowardice ; but he had a motive stronger than pride actuating his purposes . He resolved , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . But he could not do it singly . Alfonzo the Destroyer was too formidable an opponent for one or two or many Moors to overcome , if aware of treachery . He therefore wished to beguile him onward to the house of Ali Hamet . He hoped there to be able to make him a captive ; and through him to bring the proud maiden , his sister , whom he had seen and talked with in the mountain cabin , till he became deeply impassioned with her beauty ,  --  to bring the beautiful Xariffa at his feet . He , moreover , felt desirous of having in his hands so powerful an enemy of the Moor , who might yet become as formidable to the Infidels as he had been te the robbers of the mountain-wilds . He therefore said , I am not a coward , brave Alfonzo , in my own city ; but , by the hand of the Prophet ! I like not much these gloomy woods . If some half score of Christian peasants should meet me alone , my courage would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thee ! for yonder comes galloping a party of Moorish horse ; doubtless some of thy own troop coming in search of thee ! ' The Moor looked up and beheld about half a mile off a party of horsemen whom by their turbans and white costume he knew to be Saracens . As they came rapidly nearer , he cried out with joy that he distinguished his own banner in advance . I congratulate you , Moor , ' said Alfonzo . I will now return , and hereafter when thou findest a sick or wounded Christian in need of hospitality , remember the kind treatment thou hast had at the hands of Alfonzo , the herdsman 's son . ' Stay . I wonld make thee a costly gift , ' said the Moor . No ; I do not care to trust myself with thy people . Fare thee well , Moor . ' With this parting salutation , Alfonzo turned to hasten into the narrow footpath to avoid the cavalcade , which consisted of at least eighteen horsemen , glittering in gold and silks and precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm thee . I will see that thou art rewarded by them rather than injured . They will hail thee as my deliverer when they are told what thou hast done for me . ' Alfonzo knew that it was dangerous for a Christian to trust a Moor ; yet he believed that his guest would prove faithful to his word . He , therefore , stood boldly ; for the horsemen came on so fast that , without fairly fleeing with speed of foot , he could not readily escape them should they pursue . So he remained , resolved to confide in the honor of the Moor . The next instant the gorgeously arrayed troop came close at hand , and the leader reining up on recognising his chief , leaped from his horse and , approaching him , shouted , Allah be praised ! my lord Abdelasis is safe ! ' Allah il Allah ! God is great ! ' shouted his troop , on beholding the young Emir . We rejoice to see you , my lord , ' said the lieutenant , embracing and kissing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain cabins , and I have come out on purpose to search for thee thoroughly . Thy absence so suddenly on the Sierras yesterday has filled us all with grief and alarm for your fate .  --  Every search was made for you . But you look pale ! ' I was drawn away from you in pursuit of a monstrous wolf ; I was not aware how far I pursued . I at length came up with him and wounded him in a fierce combat ; but he tore my side with his paw , and I found shelter in the cabin of a mountaineer . ' Who is this Christian ? ' Thy prisoner , Osmen . Seize and bind him ! ' cried the treacherous Saracen , as he saw four of the horsemen were within five feet of the young mountaineer . Scarcely had he spoken when Alfonzo , amazed , sprung backward , and presented his spear to defend himself ; Osmen , the lieutenant of the Moors , leaped towards him , and Alfonzo struck his scymetar to the ground with a single blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely . Let him not escape for your lives ! He is Alfonzo the Destroyer ! ' shouted the false Moor . Down with him  --  but slay him not . ' No sooner had the four Moors heard this well-known name , than , as if by one impulse , they drew back , as if a chasm had opened before them . The dreaded name , instead of inspiring them with valor , intimidated them . They were afraid to attempt , alone , to arrest so formidable an opponent : they waited for their companions to come to their aid , and then to overwhelm him by the power of numbers . In the mean while , Alfonzo steadily retreated towards the forest , facing his foes . Seeing this , the treacherous Abdelasis leaped into one of the saddles , and seizing a scymetar galloped towards him . Alfonzo received the horse upon the point of his spear , the weapon entering deep into his chest ; the animal reared and fell dead , and Abdelasis rolled over upon the ground . He was saved from instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the interposition of his followers ; who , seeing heir chief down , rode on with fierce cries to attack the formidable mountaineer . Alfonzo would have been surrounded and cut down , valiantly as he fought in defence of his life and liberty , when a loud cry from the forest close at hand startled the Moors . Down with the Saracen ! death to the Moor ! ho , to the rescue ! ' Alfonzo , to his great surprise , recognised the stern voice of Gaspar . The Moors , believing they were about to be assailed by a superior force , gave back , those on foot regaining their saddles in great haste ; and Alfonzo stood alone , as it were , in the midst of his enemies .  --  When he saw Gaspar approach , he rejoiced to have such good aid , but was surprised to see him coming towards him alone ; for he thought , as the Saracens had done , that he had men with him . I am alone , my boy , but I will defend or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large odds , but let us have stout hearts , and trust in the blessed Saints , and we will get clear of them . ' The Moors , who had quickly placed themselves in order of battle to receive the expected attack , on seeing but one person , now looked to Abdelasis for their orders . This prince had mounted Osmen 's horse , and taken a sword from one of his followers . He instantly recognised in the new comer his old foe  --  he burned to attack and punish him , and also to take captive the young mountaineer , who had thus far so successfully resisted the efforts made to take him prisoner . CHAPTER . XXV . THE REIGN OF THE EMIRS . Gaspar , upon coming up , ranged himself by the side of Alfonzo , and said , Now , let us walk backward slowly , and face them , my boy . We shall soon reach the covert of the wood , when they will have to dismount to attack us . To stand and fight with so many would be folly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend of the jewels at full charge . The Saracen leader spurred alone towards his foes , with his scymetar raised to cut dow the wolf-slayer , as he should ride over him . But Gaspar quicker , than thought , caught the scymetar on the staff of his wolf-spear , and turned it aside . The horse and rider dashed past him , and at the same moment came up Osmen at the head of the whole troop . The two brave mountaineers were forced back to the edge of the wood , Alfonzo keeping his assailants at bay with his spear , while Gaspar , wielding the heavy staff of his pike , like a club , swung it in a circle around him , keeping a clear space between him and the horses . The shouts and cries of the Moors filled the air , and the clangor of arms echoed and re-echoed through the forest . The two mountaineers fought in silence , and with the calm resolution of men who feel that their lives depend on their own courage , and strength . At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not follow them , and bounding away deep into the forest they left their pursuers far behind them . The Emir Abdelasis followed them on foot a short distance , when Alfonzo , seeing it , turned back , at which he retreated , though not without cursing him , at the same time loudly giving his people orders to surround the covert and endeavor to cut off their retreat to the mountain . Heaven has saved me from thy treachery , false Moor , ' cried Alfonzo . Thou hast shown us Christians how to trust a Mussulman . From this hour look upon Alfonzo the Destroyer as thy relentless foe . ' And take the same challenge , Moor , from Gaspar , the wolf-slayer ! ' shouted the stout herdsman , as the plume of the Saracen 's turban was disappearing beyond the foliage of the copse . The two brave patriots then hastened away rapidly through the well-known paths of the wood , and while they heard the Moorish horsemen vainly riding hither and thither in search of them , the angry voice of their chief heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far behind , and in a little while regained the foot of the cliff of the cataract . There they paused and listened . The Moor could no longer be seen or heard , and far and wide the cork-wood forest lay buried in the repose of the sunny afternoon . They have given it up , and thought it best to go back to Cordova , ' said Gaspar as he stopped and leaned his chin upon the end of his pike . You have made a good escape from the false rogues , boy . It is well I was at hand . Yet I did not help you much , for you seemed to be able to do your own fighting , many as they were . But I never saw a man harder pushed than you were . ' Well , I will tell you the truth , since good hath come of it : after you departed I resolved to follow you , and when you should quit the Moor , join him myself , and give him a chance of defending his jewels and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' By the mass , I thought you would never leave him until you got to the gates of Cordova . ' The treacherous Saracen led me on by pretending fear of any parties of mountaineers . But his apparent timidity I now see was treachery . He meant to have betrayed me to Ali Hamet , if he had not met the party of horse . ' I saw you stop and talk , and then discovered the Moorish horsemen coming , even before you did ; for I was higher up on the road . I then crept forward to see what would be the issue of the meeting to you , for I saw that you lingered . I then trembled for you , Alfonzo , for I know too well how little a Moor is to be trusted . I was sure you would be betrayed ; so I came up to help you ; and see ing you set upon , I shouted as if I had a party at my back , and dashed at them . ' Your presence was timely , father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner but for your outcry . They fell back and gave me time to recover myself . But for you , I should have now been a captive to the Saracen , on my way to Cordova . ' If they had taken thee , I would have rescued thee with an army of mountaineers . I would have taken thee from the very dungeons of the Algarf ! ' I owe my life to thee , father , ' answered Alfonzo , grasping his hand and affectionately laying it against his heart . Then my design to plunder the Saracen has proved a good one for thee . So thou hast no words to say against it ! He deserved to be stripped and murdered  --  the false Moslem hound ! My boy , we men of Spain bear too much and too patiently the bonds of these unbelievers . ' I know it , father , ' answered the youngman with stern sadness . I know it , father ; and would to God there were a David to arise in Spain to free our nation from the Philistines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands , or serve other princes . None remains but the poor man , who can not leave , or is too insignificant , so think the conquerors , to be troubled . Yet , father , there are seven hundred thousand such men in Spain .  --  Would to God they had a prince to lead them against the eighty thousand Saracens that enslave them ! ' Amen to that , boy . But the spirit of our people is crushed . The children of Spain , with their king slain , are like sheep without a shepherd . Timid and cringing , they strengthen the very chains the hand of the Moslem has laid upon them . Dost thou know that Christian men and women , young men , young maidens are bought and sold in the shambles of Cordova like beasts ? ' I have heard it , father , ' answered the young man , with a crimsoned cheek and a kindling eye . Yes ; within the last two months they have openly made a slave-market . And men who have been in Cordova tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the unprotected female or youth , wherever they can do it safely , and barter them in the city to the keepers of the slave bazaars for gold . It is enough to make a Spanish man blush with shame that these things should be so and we suffer it . ' I know it , father . I have thought of all these things and have wished that I had the power in my single arm to redeem Spain . But we can only weep and pray for our enslaved country ! There is no spirit in the people . There is no prince to raise the standard of the cross for them to rally around . ' When Taric the conqueror beheaded the king and queen , he did a wise thing , for the stability of his own power , to destroy also the three princes . If one of these had lived and Spain could behold him , lethargic as you think the people are , they would rise as one man and follow him wheresoever be would lead them . The wrongs we have endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us desire their overthrow , even at the price of our own blood . Spain would fight now , boy , more bravely to recover her soil , and temples and homes , than she fought to defend them . Then she had not felt so bitterly the weight of the Moslem rule as she has since done . She did not have such reason to hate the Moor as she has since done . May God have pity upon us and send us help from Rome or some other Christian power . It is the cause of Christendom to drive out the people of Mahomadoun . We should make pilgrimages to their courts , and on our naked knees implore them to send a Christian Prince to succor us and lift the standard of the Holy Cross up against the accursed crescent . I have never looked on the new moon , which they take for their device , since the battle of Xenil , without feeling it is unlucky to undertake anything before its second quarter . The moon was crescent and shone upon our ranks when we fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its light and conquered . It was and is the Christian 's evil star . But we need not stand here and talk of the wrongs of our country , boy . The day is passed that I hoped to see Spain redeemed . But one day , as says father Godfrey , the arm of the Lord will be made bare and the mocker at the cross will come down to the dust . But I shall not live to see it . ' With these words , uttered in a desponding tone , Gaspar turned and began to ascend the steep path by the side of the water-fall . What news have you from Cordova within a day or or two , father ? ' asked Alfonzo , as he walked by his side . Nothing . The council of Emirs still rule like so many snarling dogs watching a dead deer . I hope they will soon cut one another 's throats . But it matters little to us whether Spain hath twenty or only one ruler , so that the power is Moslem . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were daily expected to fight among themselves for the Caliphate . Each one of them had fortified his Seraglio , and went about attended by an armed force , and even met in conclave , like enemies during a truce , holding a council on the battle-field . ' Yes ; and this state of things can not long last . They are so well balanced against each other in point of numbers , that neither dare make the first move . They say , those who go into the markets , and from whom I learn these things , these people say that the most powerful of these is Algezir ; not that he has more followers or more gold to buy over adherents , but on account of his indomitable spirit . They all fear him and he despises them all . But prudence keeps him quiet until the suitable time shall arrive for him to act . He will then make a move . But he has an enemy and rival he fears more than he does his fellow Emirs . ' You mean Abdelasis , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am glad I have seen this rich young Emir , of whom I have heard so much ; I am glad , too , that he has shown me his true character ; I am resolved , father , that the false Moor  --  prince though he be  --  shall pay dearly for his treacherous designs upon me . But these are idle threats ! I am powerless : what should a poor herdsman do with menacing vengeance against a powerful prince ? ' This Abdelasis is indeed powerful , and he is a powerful rival of the ambitious Emirs ; ' said Gaspar , as he fastened his spear in the crevice of the rock , and drew himself upon the verge where commenced the level space on which the hamlet was built . Yes , he is rich ; and being the son of a popular Emir , has many friends of his father . It is true he has no authority . and lives , as he told me , simply as a citizen in Cordova ;  --  but his court is like that of a prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emirs . They all fear him ; and Algezir , men say , feels that he is the only rival who can interpose to defeat his pretensions to the throne . But Abdelasis has remained quiet , outwardly , though all men know he will not continue so for a moment after the Emirs shall break the peace of the city . ' It is my belief he will yet be Caliph of the kingdom , ' said Gaspar , as they approached the hut . The Saints forfend ! then Spain would indeed bleed . Young and noble-looking as he is , we know , father , that he has a heart base enough to suggest , and a hand ready enough to carry out any deed of wickedness . God save poor Spain from his rule ! ' CHAPTER XXVI . THE HERDSMAN 'S BOARD . The two speakers had now reached the front of their cabin , and Gaspar , saying that he had to look after his goats , turned to leave Alfonzo at the door . You will go in and get some dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past noon . ' That is true ! ' answered Gaspar , entering the cabin ; I had forgotten that I was as hungry as a bear on a month 's fast . Here comes Xariffa with a pitcher of goat 's milk in her hand , and the table is set for us , I see . Well , girl , the Moor is on his way to Cordova , and , by the mass ! we are well rid of him . Ah ! holy father , art thou still honoring my humble roof ? Thou shalt eat with me this day , for long abstinence is not good for thy age ; fasts are for young , lusty fellows , to mortify the flesh , not for thee . Come , here is a flagon of sour wine : it is the best the Moors have left us , and we must call it Aldana , and believe it so ! Here is goat 's milk on the board , holy father , if thou likest it better ; and I see that the active Xariffa  --  Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . Come , father , say a grace , and let us fall to ! ' Thou art too hospitable for thy purse , son , ' answered the monk ; but I will eat with thee gladly ; I have need of strength , for I have duties before me . ' With these words the hermit drew up to the humble board ; and while Alfonzo , Xariffa , and old Gaspar , stood reverently around it , he asked a blessing upon the coarse fare . They then sat down , the three men , while Xariffa walked about the table waiting upon them , filling now Gaspar 's brown mug with sour wine , now urging the hermit to take more of the fresh goat 's milk , or help himself to more of the loaf , and now filling her brother 's cup with fair water . They ate with appetites and enjoyment ; and when the first edge of their fasting was taken off , Gaspar proceeded to relate , in his blunt way , the adventures of himself and Alfonzo in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moor , and Xariffa could hardly refrain from openly expressing her indignation . But she discreetly kept quiet , for fear that she might , by some unadvised expression , betray the fact that the false Saracen had seen and talked with her . She knew that such intelligence would deeply , and with reason , afflict her brother , and that she could scarcely succeed in clearing herself from all blame in the face of the fierce and angry excitement which the knowledge of it would produce . She , therefore , listened in silence , her features expressing to her brother vividly enough her sense of the infamous conduct of their late guest . I do n't know that I ought to be surprised , my children , ' said the monk .  --  This is the Moor 's character . It would have been surprising , had you returned , Alfonzo , and told me you had guided the Saracen till he fell in with a party of his followers in search of him , and that he suffered you to depart in safety . ' By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' responded Gaspar , as he put down from his lips the half-emptied mug , after a long draught . There is no red mass , my son , ' answered the hermit , in a severe tone of reproof . I have often had occasion to re mind thee that thy oaths are not well chosen , and are too frequent . ' Then , by the mass ! I 'll swear no more , holy father , save when I come across a Moor ; then I will swear . They are always swearing by their Allah and their Prophet 's beard , and I am not going to be put down by such hounds , in this matter . Besides , a good oath , sworn in faith , hath a blessing in it ! ' Thou mayest swear , if need be , on certain occasions ; but see that thou use no more thy favorite adjuration of the red mass . There is no mass but one . ' I thank thee , father ; but I have heard Christian knights swear by the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indeed reddened by the blood of him who was nailed thereon . ' I see , father ! My religious education was something neglected in my youth ; and I thank thee for thy teaching . Would it be a sin for a Chrisrian to swear by Allah ? ' It would be both a sin and a great evil , my son ! Thou shouldst make no use of the words of the Infidel . I know not if it is right to learn and speak their barbaric and unholy tongue so much as we do . Daughter , this bread is very sweet and palatable ! I never find such bread in any other house in the Sierras . Thou art an excellent housewife ! ' That she is , holy father . Thou canst never throw away praise in giving it to Xariffa . She is a rare maiden for one who has been so many years without a mother ! Such a man as I am , father , makes but a poor dame for a girl ! But I have done my best , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily . Alfonzo here has , however , done most for her . She must thank him and not me ! ' Nay , father , I owe myself , all that I am , to both of you ! ' said the pleased Xariffa . And to the holy father ! He hath had the religious teaching . But for him thou wouldst not have known the difference between a red mass and a white one . Thou shouldst thank him also . ' I do , dear father Godfrey , ' responded the maiden , smiling gratefully upon the venerable face of her teacher . I know that I belong to each and all of you ; and I ought to be happy to be so loved and protected . ' Yes , thou wilt find protection , daughter , not only from our arms , but those of every youth and old man in the Sierras , for many leagues west and east . They all know thee and love thee . It is no light affection that causes all people to call thee the Star of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty title by all the young men and maidens , than by thy own christened name . It shows thou art good as well as comely ! ' My father always goes on thus praising me when one begins , ' said Xariffa , laughing and blushing , as she looked towards the hermit . He has said none too much , daughter If thou couldst hear Alfonzo discourse of thee thou wouldst not heed thy father 's praise . ' I know the boy loves her almost as well as I do . ' As well , father ! ' cried Alfonzo , I will have it that I love her quite as well . Who is so dear to me as my sister ? ' Xariffa thanked him by a sweet look of affection , but at the same time gave him a glance so peculiar that he knew that she would have said , had she put the glance into words , I know I am dear to thee , brother , but still I believe that Genilla is still more dearly beloved . ' The humble meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gaspar to go after his goats , which he had left under the care of Pablo , up the cliff , and Alfonzo to return to the charge of his gazelles , which the faithful Ban had been guarding , as they fed far up the mountain . I am going up to my cell , and will ascend the pathway with thee , son , ' said the hermit . I am glad I can help thee up , father . I hope you will accept my father 's kind invitation , and live with us . Thou art getting too old to climb the mountain . ' Thanks , sons , both of you . But I am yet strong . I have , it is true , been something ill of late ; but it was , I doubt not , from too much fasting . I will take more care of my health : as I find I ca n't endure the vigils and penance I once did . ' It is impossible you should , father , ' answered Gaspar . Now , fare thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a nice garden on the cliffs , which I dig in while my goats feed . The soil is as rich as butter . Thou shalt eat garlic and Spanish lentils from it yet . ' Thus speaking , Gaspar started off alone taking his way along a path that led through the gorge . Alfonzo and the old man went up the mountain track , the latter refusing the aid of the young man . At length they gained the uplands of the Sierras , and Alfonzo found his gazelles feeding in security under the guardianship of Ban . I will go on with thee to thy cell , father . ' No . I will not take thee from thy flock . Besides I would sleep awhile when I get there , and thou wouldst be alone . ' You have been abroad much of late , father . ' Yes . ' Did you not go into the valley , last night ? ' asked Alfonzo , wishing very much to know , if he could draw it from him , the object of his visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' asked the hermit quickly . Alfonzo was about frankly to tell the holy father , but he feared to let him know that he himself was also at Ben Osmin 's ; therefore he said , evasively . I saw thee go in the direction of the valley . It is dangerous for you to venture far from the mountain , father . The Moors will not even respect thy white hairs . ' I must go and come as my duty calls me , my son , ' answered the hermit ; and he fixed his eyes keenly upon the quiet face of the young man , to see if there was any reason to suspect that he knew where he had been . True , father . How clear the atmosphere is here , father . Yonder party of horse is full three miles away over the valley , yet how distinctly we can see them from this height . I should not be surprised if it were the troop commanded by the treacherous Abdelasis . I can not see so far , my son ; my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Moslem banners . ' There is the Moor who lives by yonder tower , at the foot of the Sierra , ' continued Alfonzo ; is he a quiet person ? ' It is Ben Osmin ; and I believe , for a Moor , he is an honest man , ' answered the hermit . Why this question , my son ? ' It becomes us to know well who our neighbors are , father , in these troublesome times . We must know who to trust ; this Ben Osmin may be a spy of the Emirs . ' No ; I believe he lives quietly there with his daughter ;  --  but thou shouldst not think of him , for then thou wilt think of her . Remember thy sin , my son ! Turn away thine eyes from temptation . But I wrong thee ! I do not fear that thou wouldst ever give thought to an Infidel maiden . Hast thou forgotten this one ? ' I hope I shall never be censured by you again , father , on her account . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thy herds , and thou wilt leave little room for the magic of Moorish women 's arts to hurt thee . ' Thus speaking , the hermit bade him farewell , and went slowly up the remainder of the path , and was soon afterwards lost to the eye of Alfonzo . In spite of the holy father 's caution , the young mountaineer let his eyes wander in the direction of the Emir 's tower ; and sharply did he gaze down into the court of the cottage , in hope that he should espy the fair form of Genilla , with whom , since he had been her lover , he had often exchanged signals from the cliff ,  --  he waving his shepherd 's scarf , and she her snowy veil . But he did not see her , and it suddenly came to his recollection  --  what the recent stirring events had caused him to forget  --  that Genilla had doubtless departed that morning with her father , Ben Osmin , to visit Cordova .
