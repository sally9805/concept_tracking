txt OF all forms of government , a republic stands most in need of laws , and of power to execute them . If it be not a government of laws , it is no government at all . Where the people are sovereign , and every man a law-maker , there is the greater need that they make and sustain laws which all will acknowledge , a tribunal to which all must submit . Such a tribunal presupposes a system of restraints and penalties . Penal consequences must be annexed to the violation of law , and some certainty must attend these consequences , or the whole is unmeaning and useless , if not pernicious . These are axioms . And yet , with these on their lips , a large portion of the people of this republic are talking and acting in direct opposition to them , or entire disregard of their meaning . They are retaining laws in their statute-books which are never enforced ; they are withholding that public expression which alone gives strength to law ; they are erecting tribunals which the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipate even the judgment of the law by a violent execution ; in another , they overawe both judgment and execution by their antipathies or sympathies ; while everywhere , at times , they suffer local interests and excited passions to control , if not to defy , the operation of all laws . This is one view of existing facts . In another direction , there is an increase of the opposite feeling , a jealousy , byalty , *hnd conservative energy , roused by this very tendency to lawlessness , and as yet holding it in check . Which will // prevail ultimately is not our inquiry . Every one must see that nothing will be gained by pushing to extremes in either direction . If one class think to supersede law , and to find something better even than a Christian government , their destruction is sure . If the other class resolve to see no good in any change , ascribing all dissatisfaction and attempted reform to weak understandings or the worst motives , they may hasten that which they fear . And to both extremes there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpass the soft sentimentality and one-sided condolence which some persons express in reasoning upon crime and the criminal , complaining of the severity of laws , and tracing all offences to physical disease or unavoidable influences . The charge of malevolence or cruelty in our common jurisprudence , the appeal to pity those who suffer , however justly , the attempt to connect all crime with misfortune rather than guilt , and the disposition to screen the murderer under the plea of insanity , are symptoms which might in themselves be overlooked as indicative only of an unsound mind , did they not strike at the highest truths and eternal distinctions . But this is not the only extreme . There is another , which seems to us as false , if not as dangerous . It is the grave attempt , stimulated evidently by the opposite folly , to defend our penal code by the first ever given to man ; to urge the oldest seventies , not only as justifications , but commands , for all after ages ; to show , as more than one writer has lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the murderer stands on equal authority with the Decalogue , and that to repeal it would be as wicked and fatal as to disregard those ten commandments ; even to argue that Christ 's repeal of the Jewish penalties and retaliations was not on account of their injustice , severity , or incongruity with his own religion , but because they had been abused . Indeed , we have seen recently , in the resolutions of some religious body , the broad assertion , that the Mosaic code has never been repealed ; though we have not yet seen any attempt to reinstate its thirty capital offences , including witchcraft , adultery , blasphemy , man-stealing , blood-eating , and Sabbath-breaking . We have seen it asserted that Christ himself reenacted the legal penalty of death for murder , when he said , " All they that take the sword shall perish by the sword . " It is declared that the death-penalty is in accordance with 4* // the very mercy of the Christian religion , if not demanded by its great object ; inasmuch as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed convict to repentance , while protracted life , though in confinement , would lead only to abuse . Yet more , it is declared that the divine enactment of the law of " life for life " prepared the way for , and helped the efficacy of , the death of the Son of God . Mr. Cheever , in the book whose title we have placed at the head of this article , says , - " God would prevent the cheapening of human life , in order that the value of the sacrifice of Christ 's life might not be diminished in men 's estimation . In very truth , had no law ever been promulgated annexing the penalty of death to the crime of murder , it is not too much to say that the sacrifice of a writer in the Biblical Repository for July , 1843 , reasons in defence of the punishment of death from the government of God thus - " HE visits transgression with uncompromising retribution . HE did not spare even his own Son . " Here is another extreme . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sect is answerable or censurable for such opinions . We give it first as a simple fact , and then as one of many reasons for subjecting this matter to a rigid and candid investigation . We had ignorantly supposed , until recently , that the Scriptural defence of capital punishment was almost relinquished . We find it not only retained , but renewed and enlarged . Now , if there he ground for this , - if it be verily an original and eternal command of God , that the murderer be put to death , and its observance be essential to the principle of obedience , the existence of society , and the salvation of souls , then we say , in all soberness , this nation is guilty before God , and hastening to destruction . For not only is the law of God assailed by many who view it differently , but it is constantly set aside by those who retain and declare it . It is not enforced by those who maintain the right , and possess also the power , to enforce it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , the law requires it , in every State of our union . But in no one of them are half the murderers convicted , or , if convicted , executed . Here , again , is a fact , and it is a very serious fact , independently of its causes . It is worthy the consideration of all , that the highest sanction of our country s criminal law has no urnform // or sure validity . It is something , that , while other offences beside murder are made capital in nearly every State , their number ranging from two to twenty , it is hardly ever the case that the law is enforced for any crime hut murder . This is something , when considered as indicating the progress of opinion in regard to severity , and as tending to weaken the power of law . It becomes momentous in regard to murder , when it is maintained that the death of the murderer is authorized and required by the law of God and the life of society , and yet the murderer is constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy , hut also through the conscientiousness of jurors , and the laxity of administration , failing to convict , or pardoning or commuting after conviction . We have here given the material facts , in the present position of the subject . The least that can be said of them , and probably the feeling of all is , that they demand some action . What shall it he ? It may be presumptuous in us to say ; we attempt it in no spirit of self-complacency , still less of dogmatism or rash innovation . This is not a question of one side , or one argument ; nor is it a subject for the imputation of had motives , it is not to be assumed that the opponents of capital punishment are either wiser or more humane than its advocates . Nor , again , have its advocates any right to charge upon the opponents a want of principle , as to law or religion . It is pitiful to attempt to identify the proposed reform with moral or social ultraism . Were there no higher principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should save it from that suspicion . We are pained to find even the excellent Chancellor of the New York University , Mr. Frelinghuysen , in his Introduction to to Mr. Cheever 's hook , lending his sanction to the unjust allegation , worthy of weaker men , that to abolish the deathpenalty would , in effect , if not in design , proclaim " impunity to murder . We have more reason to charge impunity upon the present system . Against its friends we bring no charge . Its effect we pronounce worse than neutral ; uncertain , unequal , ineffectual , and pernicious . We call for proof of the opposite . Our position is affirmative , not negative conservative , not destructive . We speak for law ; we uphold government . We believe man is selfish enough and corrupt enough to re ( luire restraints and penalties . We see // a spirit of lawlessness in the land , a tampering with constitutions , and oaths , and liberty , and life , that call loudly for reproof . We maintain the right of society to impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see not where it is to derive the right to imprison , especially for life , if it have not also the right to take life . But we deny that its right to take life rests upon any positive command of God , or any sure permission . We deny that it finds the least favor in the precepts of Christ , or the spirit of Christianity . We deny that the death-penalty is justified by any experience of its usefulness , or proof of its necessity . And we throw the burden of proof , for each of these points , on the advocates of the present law . The alleged proof of a divine command or permission lies in a single passage , if we may not say in a single word . " Whoso sheddeth man 's blood , by man shall his blood be shed . " - Gen. ix . 6 . Shall ; on that one word , in that one verse , depends the Scriptural argument . Change the word to will , which both the Hebrew and the English language permit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God 's providence , that violence begetteth violence ; as in the Psalms - " Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days . " But leave the passage as it is ; the first part of it will bear a different rendering , though the common version seems to us as natural and probable as any . We admit that the Hebrew future often stands for the imperative ; but it does not always stand for it ; and whether it does here , or has only the force of the future , as in Cain 's assertion , - " Every one that findeth me shall slay me , " - depends on the context , and other considerations . Thus the whole argument becomes an inference and different men-men , too , who do not differ in their general religious views - draw different inferences from the context , and express opposite opinions as to the passage . Professor Stuart , of Andover , thinks the Hebrew for " shall be shed " is " the most passive form which the language admits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has " the indefinite form of the Hebrew future , " and finds in it neither command nor permission . Professor Turner , of the Episcopal Seminary , New York , says it may be permissive , but can not be obligatory . All scholars will allow that the verb is future , and no one can assert more than that it may be im // perative , and is so in his opinion . Is this proof ? Is it a sufficient foundation for the system that has been reared upon it ? But grant it ; on whom is it imperative ? To whom does it give even permission to take life ? Its words are , - " By man shall his blood be shed . " And the preceding verse says , - " At the hand of every man 's brother will I require the life of man . " May the murderer be put to death by any man , or by the brother of the murdered man ? This is the literal sense , if you adhere to the literal ; it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And more , it was the interpretation of the passage in that age , so far as we know of its being used . Singularly enough , it is never afterward referred to in the Bible , though so constantly referred to now . Moses subsequently slew a man , but did not apply the passage or its penalty to his own case . In his code , it is said , - " The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer ; when he meeteth hini , he shall slay him . " There is another clause of the context , which was made a part of the Jewish ritual , but has never been observed by Christians . It is the injunction to abstain from " flesh with the life thereof , which is the blood thereof . " It stands in close connection with the favorite passage . If one be imperative , universal , and perpetual , why not the other ? The proof is not made out ; the burden is heavier upon the advocates than they seem aware . They must first show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is a permanent and universal ordinance , though others near it are not ; then , that in itself , or the context , it gives to government , and not to individuals , the right and duty of killing the murderer ; then , that it was ever applied by the Deity himself , or by any of his servants and commissioned ministers , except in the Mosaic code ; and lastly , that , in principle and spirit , it has not been repealed by him who abrogated its fellows , - " An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . " We have reason to say " its fellows , " for , besides the principle , there is a fact here to which we call earnest heed ; namely , that the law of retaliation , which Christ did abrogate , comprised originally the very law of life for life . " Life shall go for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot . "  --  Dent . xix. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as the principle of social order and eternal justice , is it not remarkable , // that , when he was the only lawgiver , judge , and punisher , he not only spared the life of the murderer , but forbade any one to slay him , and said nothing even of his deserving death ? Mr. Cheever has his own way of accounting for this , and using it . He intimates that this " divine lenity was a chief cause of the wickedness of men before the flood , and was revoked by the Deity when he saw the abuse . God spared Cain , and the consequence was , since no murder could ever he committed under more aggravating circumstances than that of Abel , that every murderer felt secure . " Thus the experiment of a milder legislation , as another writer has declared , was first made by the Deity , and failed We might ask , if the bloodiest code of Moses answered a better purpose ? But no irreverence . Admitting the bold intimation , it does not remove the difficulty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " after the supposed enactment of life for life . Moses became a murderer ; and God spared him also , though the act was revengeful and deliberate . Before this , hut after the command , Simeon and Levi , sons of the patriarch Jacoh , committed a treacherous and most foul murder on all the males of a city , because one of them had " defiled their sister " ; the same offence , avenged more horribly and infamously , yet in the same way , as that of Mercer recently , where the murderous brother was saved hy acclamation . Simeon and Levi were not so rescued , hut simply let alone . Jacob reproved them , but no application or mention was made of the existing " imperative law . " And omitting all inferior cases in the history , David was a murderer , in every just view ; adding this great sin to another , which was also capital in his own code . But he also was spared the ordained penalty . Is the fact , then , established by the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the penalty of life for life was imperative , of universal obligation , always observed and enforced by the Deity , never repealed or even virtually superseded by the Saviour ? Is it , can it be , proved ? We have said the proof rests on a single passage . No other passage has ever been quoted for the purpose from the Old Testament , to our knowledge ; none so strong , none indeed having the aspect or pretence of a commandment and universal law , can be found in any part of the Scriptures , as all will concede ; and should this passage be relinquished , // half the advocates of capital punishment would abandon the ground of divine authority . It is , then , a very serious question , whether this one passage , at the most and the best , is so clear and unquestionable as to be rightfully or safely taken as the foundation of a fearful system of criminal law , for all nations , and all ages , world without end . If we were willing to turn the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would go into a particular examination of the passages sometimes adduced from the New Testament . But we can hardly believe that any Christian scholars or reasonable men are in earnest , when they quote , in support of capital punishment , such passages as the declaration of Christ already referred to , and used by most men for the opposite purpose , - " All they that take the sword shall perish by the sword . " It is yet harder to understand the cast of mind in those who think to vindicate this interpretation and strengthen the argument by quoting a similar but even weaker proof , more and more against themselves , from the Apocalypse - " He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity ; he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . " Paul likewise is drawn into the defence , because , when accused and arraigned , he appealed unto C*esar , and expressed his willingness to suffer the utmost penalty of the existing laws , if guilty - " If I be an offender , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to die . " And again the same apostle 's use of the emblem of office , in describing the power and terror of a ruler , - " He beareth not the sword in vain , " - is brought as additional and conclusive evidence of his opinion , and of the authority of the Christian religion in favor of capital punishment . Lest we be suspected of misrepresentation , we refer the reader to the fifty-second page of Mr. Cheever 's book , where he says , - " There is no other possible view that can be taken of this passage " ; and then quotes Calvin , as calling it " an illustrious place , " to prove , adds Mr. Cheever , " the divine authority of capital punishment . " These are the arguments drawn from the New Testament . It seemed ribht to show what they are , and add their weight - or weakness , as others may think - to the law of " blood for blood . " To our mind they prove only the impossibility of bringing the gospel into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them from the gospel itself ; if it // does not answer them by its whole tone , we despair of doing it by any extracts or reasonings of our own . We have thrown the burden of proof on the other side , and we have a right to leave it there . The power of which we speak is tremendous , and they who assume or exercise it must show their warrant . To take life , - to take it on evidence which , in the nature of the case , can scarcely ever be more than presumptive , - especially to doom one murderer , when others as guilty are spared and have been from the beginning , is a fearful use of power , not to be justified by any thing less than the express word of God , and the absolute necessities of human society . In the word of God there is no justification , certainly no proof . l*Te turn to the argument of expediency , or necessity . Expediency alone can avail nothing against right ; but if a plain necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truism to say , we must yield . And here , again , too much has been assumed , and the advocates forget how much is to be proved . Expediency and necessity are confounded , and both stand upon fear , rather than fact . A man 's opinion of what is best is taken as evidence of what is essential ; and the fear of change grows easily into an idea of certain ruin whenever the change shall be made . The worst evils have ab . ways been predicted , at every instance of relaxation in the criminal code of any country . Yet in every country that code has been softened and abridged ; England having reduced her capital offences from one hundred and sixty to nine , and practically ; it is said , to one ; and the people of our own country , even those opposed to the entire abolition of the punishment of death , demanding , and virtually requiring , that it be confined to murder alone . Yet it is assumed that to relax this last hold would be fatal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of society ; that the murderer be put to death is a social universal necessity . This is said and repeated . But where is the proof ? We have just given it ; the proof is the assertion . There is no other . The alleged necessity is an opinion , and nothing more . So general an opinion has it been , and held by so many wise and good men , that it would ill become us to say , it is without foundation . But we do say , it is without proof . They who hold the opinion have a right to retain and declare it , but no right to insist that it makes out a case of necessity in favor // of continuing the present law . They have not proved that which they assert . There is no " necessity , " except in their associations and fears . These , we own , must often guide us , and define to us law and duty . But whether they may do this in the case of life and death is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he justly a part of all criminal law , that no jury shall pronounce a man guilty , while there is room for one reasonable doubt of his guilt , much more is it the duty of society to save life from that uncertain judgment and awful peril , while there is one " reasonable doubt " of the clear right and absolute necessity . This is not merely an equal , but a paramount duty , inasmuch as it is the first decision , on which all the rest depends , and which involves the whole responsibility . The community are hound to consider themselves the grand jury , whom God and their own act have made judges of the law , as well as the evidence . Blackstone has given us his opinion of the kind of evidence which alone should satisfy us . " To shed the blood of our fellow-creatures is a matter that requires the greatest deliberation , and the fullest conviction of our own authority ; for life is the immediate gift of God to man ; which neither he can resign , nor can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or permission of him who gave it , either expressly revealed , or collected from the laws of nature or society , by clear and indisputable demonstrations . " There being no clear and indisputable demonstrations , we can only examine the reasons of an opinion , the grounds of assumption . These may all be reduced to one . It will not be even assumed that there is any " necessity " for capital punishment , except on the principle of " self-defence . " The principle of retaliation is forbidden and disclaimed . The principle of reparation has no place . All purpose of revenge is indignantly disowned ; though , from the frequency and emphasis with which we hear it said that the murderer " deserves " to die , we might suspect it . Mr. Livingston tells us , that an exalted and excellent magistrate confessed to him , after yielding other points of defence , " that there was some little feeling of revenge at the bottom of his own opinion " ; and we fear this is common . But we do not charge it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would not help the argument of necessity . Self-defence only can sustain that . The right of self-defence we admit , but we do not // admit that it implies always the right of taking life . That , every one allows , depends upon the emergency . There are many modes of self-defence , and no individual may resort to the extreme mode hastily , however clear may seem to him the right of using it at all ; still less , society . The cases are not even parallel ; the individual kills his assailant , *o save himself ; society kills the murderer , to save - whom ? Not the murdered man ; he can he neither saved nor restored , nor can his loss be repaired by another loss . Nor can society save itself , unless from the repetition of the outrage , by the man himself , or by others . Here is the whole argument . It is the opinion and the assertion , that there is " no other way " in which it is possible to prevent a murderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . This also the advocates are bound to prox e . And they never can prove it , except by trying other ways , and finding that they utterly fail . Is it not clear , that , on all principles of natural right , abstract reason , or Christian law , men are bound to try other ways first , instead of last or not at all , before assuming the ground of necessity , or even ex-pediency ? We deny both the reasoning and the fact ; and we pass now to the consideration of facts . 1 . Capital punishment has not prevented murder . It has been often inflicted , it has slain its thousands and tens of thousands , and still its work goes on , and still its power is defied . No man can say , that it has had power in proportion to its magnitude , or to that expectation which has been its defence . No man can say , that it has done any good compared with the sacrifice of a single innocent life , even if we think nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who can show that it has done any good at all ? It has not prevented murder . It has not lessened the number of murders . So many have they been , that , had capital punishment been abolished , the frequency of crime would be ascribed to that . Seventy-two thousand persons were put to death in England , in the single reign of Henry the Eighth , making two thousand a year . But instead of deterring or preventing others , the number of victims seemed but to provoke anew , as by the sight of fresh blood , the appetite for crime and murder . The whole history of England and of France gives the same lesson . And the history // of all nations , it is believed , will sustain the remark of Beccaria - " The countries and times most notorious for severity of punishments were always those in which the most bloody and inhuman actions , and the most atrocious crimes , were committed . " The principle , indeed , that merciful laws afford more protection to society than severe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . By the strong voice of facts , the argument from self-defence is turned against the advocates of capital punishment . It has done its best and its worst for more than five thousand years . It has not abolished murder , or lessened the number of its victims . How much longer term is needed for trial ? 2 . Capital punishment has never been sure or equal . It has never been consistent with itself , or with the boast of its benefits . None of its advocates have tried or trusted their own professions . They have set it forth as a divine commandment , and they themselves have violated it . They have declared that the good of society required it , and they have cheated society of half its blessings . They insist that every murderer forfeits his life , and they deliberately suffer half the convicted murderers to live . Always has it been so never was the law uniformly executed . To go no farther back than our own era , - though , as we have seen , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the days of Pilate , who " was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would , " murderers have been released in every age , at the demand of the people , or by the policy of rulers . We find recorded , as a single fact in a single land , and recorded by an opposer of the abolition of the deathpenalty , that , " out of 23,700 persons , who were convicted of crimes of various grade made capital by the laws of England , from the year 1813 to 1833 , not more than 933 were actually executed ; presenting the remarkable spectacle of about twenty-five convicts reprieved from the gallows for every one actually executed . " There is no certainty in this punishment . And certainty , not severity , is the admitted principle of power in all criminal jurisprudence . Not only is it true that certainty is better than severity , but it is the judgment of eminent jurists , confirmed by reason and fact , that the severer the penalty , the greater the uncertainty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is never sure // must be always unequal , often grossly unjust ; we mean , not unjust in reference to guilt , but in partiality and distinction . Let any one compare the many executions with the many pardons or commutations , and see if there be any justice , or pretence of justice , in half of them . Here is a double wrong . If the law be divine , the penalty righteous and salutary , men have not even a discretionary power , after proving the guilt . And when , disregarding this , they exercise not discretion , but caprice , policy , and passion , hanging a murderer to-day , and pardoning one to-morrow , and banging the next lest two successive pardons be dangerous , and pardoning the next lest so many executions seem sanguinary , it is using a mild word to call it unjust . Such legislation is a bold and cruel mockery . It mocks itself , and common sense , and the people 's safety , and the criminal 's deserts , and the God of equal justice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take one side or the other of the great question . And be it noted , this terrible defect belongs to the very nature of the law . It is not accidental , it is not temporary or local . It is inherent , universal , and unavoidable . It grows out of the severity . Such a law can not be uniformly executed . Neither the executioners , nor the people , who in fact are the executioners , will bear it . They will rather commit the most palpable inconsistencies . They will hang men , as they often have done , in the face of the pardoned convict , and pardon others within sight of the loaded gallows . Instances may be found along the whole line of blood ; our own neighbourhood and the past year will furnish them . In Rhode Island , Gordon was executed within the very walls that held three murderers , convicted and undoubted murderers , whose sentences bad been revoked , and their lives spared ; while Gordon 's brother , believed to be the instigator of the whole foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is now at large on bail . In Massachusetts , the recent execution of Barrett , at Worcester , was followed by another murder within a few days , in sight of the very place of execution , and De Wolf was arrested , convicted , and condemned ; but eight thousand voices called for mercy , and the sentence has been commuted . We rejoice in the result , but the consistency is another question . We rejoice that the life of Mercer was not taken ; but that he should // have been wholly unpunished , his high-handed murder actually applauded , and the advocates who had procured his acquittal on the plea of insanity welcomed to the city with public and tumultuous acclamation of both sexes , is a rnelancholy proof of the impotence of the present law , and its gross injustice . Mercer was released and applauded in Philadelphia for murdering the seducer of his sister ; Eager was condemned and hung in New York for murdering the seducer of his wife ; and the difference between them was , that Mercer was conscious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repented . We have no sympathy with an indiscriminate and reckless mercy . Mercy it is not , but cruelty , to the offender , to the injured , and to society . But we ask , whence comes it , and who are responsible . Has it no connection with the nature of the penalty ? Can rulers and jurors be just , in the eye of the law , if the law be not sustained by the community ? Here is another wrong , inflicted upon another party . We require our jurors to be just , and our rulers to execute the law , and we ourselves render it all but impossible . Ten years ago , Governor Everett made an appeal to the legislature of Massachusetts , on this very account ; saying , " The law must be respected as well as obeyed , or it will not long be obeyed . A state of things which deprives the executive of the support of public sentiment , in the conscientious discharge of his most painful duty , is much to be deplored . " It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal had regard to other capital offences besides murder . The principle is the same , and the argument is strengthened so long as those other offences are retained as capital . It is a singular commentary on the criminal code of this good Commonwealth , that , while arson and burglary have been frequent occurrences , and robbery and rape not very rare , the penalty of death has seldom been executed upon them for thirty or forty years ; while of murderers themselves more have been spared than hung . During this period , how many eyes have been wilfully shut , laws trampled upon , and criminals emboldened ? Are these necessary evils ? No ; a different penalty might greatly diminish , if not wholly prevent , them . They belong to a law which never was equally enforced , which never can be made sure , but which , in its essence and unavoidable operation , is uncertain , nnequal , and fearfully unrighteous. 5* // if we look to England , the evidence of these evils becomes oppressive . It has compelled a constant mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The principle on which this change has been made belongs to every infliction of the death-penalty . It is the sense of injustice , or at least the fear of injustice , so strong as to disregard an oath rather than execute the law , and turn criminals loose upon society rather than punish them with extreme and irrevocahle severity . Blackstone , in his day , protested against " so dreadful a list " of capital offences , and bore a testimony against them which has come in fact to apply to every one , murder not excepted . " Juries , through compassion , will sometimes forget their oaths , and either acquit the guilty or mitigate the nature of the offence ; and judges , through compassion , will respite one half the convicts , and recoinmend them to the royal mercy . ' ? Every one knows what cunning and falsehood were resorted to , and perjury braved , to save offenders from the rigor of the law ; as where a woman , convicted by her own confession of stealing much more than the law declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing hut thirty-nine shillings , and thus saved . Of two persons indicted for stealing the same goods , one was found guilty of enough to hang him , and the other of so little that he was released . Such facts abound . Lord Suflield , speaking on this subject , said - " He held in his hand a list of five hundred and fifty-five peijured verdicts delivered at the Old Bailey , in fifteen years , beginning with the year 1814 , for the single offence of stealing from dwellings ; the value stolen being , in these cases , sworn above forty shillings , but the verdicts returned being to the value of thirty-nine shillings only . " Now an oath is an oath ; and if men will violate it in one case , they will in another , where the same motives are addressed . Nor is this bare assertion . The known cases are not few , the unknown may be many , in which , by bold perjury , or crooked casuistry , or the aid of technicality , the guilt of murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or an acquittal given , or , at the xvorst , commutation , if not pardon , obtained . And not jurors only , hut the whole community , are similarly affected , and affect the entire administration of justice . It is always more difficult to convict after an execution than before . In a state of anarchy and times of savage ferocity , as // during the Reign of Terror , the sight of blood may madden the populace , and they and their leaders call for quicker and quicker modes of wholesale slaughter . But where law is supreme , especially in our day and land , it is instructive to see the effect of a single death on the gallows . There is a silent , often ill-suppressed , breathing of either satisfied or sorrowful feeling . The next prisoner , though guilty of the same crime , perhaps involved in the same plot , can not be so easily convicted . But then comes the injustice , and the dreadful accident . A long interval elapses , crimes are committed , and the people call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a victim . He has miscalculated ; he has not watched the ebb and flow of the great tide . Not for the peculiarity of his offence , so much as for the peculiarity of his time , he must die . Not because many may follow his example , hut because many have just been spared , he must die . He who follows him in the same career , though his purpose be formed at the foot of the gallows , and the fatal deed perpetrated before the revelling crowd disperse , will have a better chance of escape . This also is sustained by facts both in Europe and America . The whole difficulty of convicting and executing , whatever the offence , has long been admitted , and is constantly increasing . The law itself is constantly changing , and its changes show how dreadful has been its injustice , as well as powerless its terror . It is found in England , that , since the year 1810 , more than fourteen hundred persons have been executed for crimes which have now ceased to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statute-book have been reluctantly made , but the changes in public sentiment are such as to annul the statute , or aggravate its injustice . Hundreds of jurors are summoned , to find twelve that can or will serve . And when they have served , and have found complete evidence of guilt , they sometimes , as in a case in Massachusetts not long ago , ask if they may bring in a verdict of manslaughter , but not being allowed , bring in a verdict of murder with a petition for mercy . Such are the obstacles and inconsistencies , such the uncertainty , inequality , and injustice of the present law of death . Whatever the causes , the facts are indisputable . They seem enough to prove the inefficacy of the punishment , and the necessarily bad effect upon the sentiment of // reverence for law or life , and equally upon the temptations to crime and calculations of impunity . We leave it to sounder heads to judge of the principle which Livingston has laid down as one of the postulates of his f*mous code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can enforce . Therefore , whenever , from public opinion or any other cause , a penal law can not be carried into execution , it should be repealed . " 3 . Capital punishment has failed to punish the murderer , or relieve the friends of the murdered . We have shown , that , in a large proportion of cases , it fails to reach the murderer , - that it is never so sure as to preclude a fair calculation upon the chances of escape , - and that its infliction depends on other circumstances besides guilt . We might show , that , where it does fall upon the murderers , and upon the most awfully guilty , it is by no means sure to bring upon them a punishment which they will feel as such , or which will bear any proportion to the enormity of the crime . There is an enormity in wilful murder , which we are so far from attempting to extenuate or shield , that we pronounce it inadequately punished by the taking of life . We mean , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community say it should be visited with death . They are the very cases , ordinarily , in which death is the least punishment . The most criminal are usually the most h*irdened , least sensitive to the pains of execution , which are momentary , or to the ignominy , for which they care nothing . rVhe many instances of stupid brutality or shocking levity , under sentence of death and at the very gallows , should teach us something . It should be enough to know of one case like that so recent in New Jersey , where Robinson , the convicted and confessed murderer of Snydam , declared that he should " burst out a laughing under the gallows , " called for " a band of music , the big field , and twenty thousand spectators , " and said in his most sober moments , " I ye suffered too much poverty and misery in this life to care very much about leaving it . " Was he punished ? Saying nothing now of the doubtful , or rather , pernicious , effect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the suffering to the criminality , and what of the responsibleness of sending such a soul to judgment ? Let those , especially , consider , who are sure that death consigns the soul to an eternal punishment , for whose // torment there can be no insensibility or reprieve , and from whose unutterable misery even that wretched man might possibly have been saved by an imprisonment , which he would feel more keenly , and could use profitably if he would . Then let such believers , and all , consider further , that the very fact of this being an extreme case only goes to prove either the injustice or the inefficacy of the common punishment . If the many who suffer on the scaffold are less shockingly guilty and hardened than Robinson , it would seem a strange reason for condemning them to a present punishment which they feel infinitely more , but which falls alike on all degrees and differences of guilt . Add to this the large number of the accused whose guilt is presumed rather than proved ; add that other mournful class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain , - and say , if you are willing to continue your own share of accountableness for such unequal dealing with crime , or if you do not think it possible that human ingenuity or Christian fidelity may devise a punishment that will he at once more seVere and more just . It has always been assumed , that the love of life is the strongest of passions , and its loss the greatest terror . Without denying the general truth , we maintain that there are many facts which greatly qualify it , and are too little considered . Most of the sick , who expect to die , die calmly the good in faith , the bad in helpless submission . Multitudes , particularly of the vicious and criminal , consider their death as fixed and inevitable . Thousands brave death in war , in pestilence , in perils of ocean , in destructive occupations , - now for the life of a friend , now for the smallest lucre , and now for the very love of daring and vaunting . More than this , convicts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in detailed cases in O'Sullivan 's Appendix . Indeed , on any fair doctrine of chances , men deliberately expose their lives to as great danger , at least , as does the cautious murderer , with all the present uncertainties , through detection , arrest , witnesses , advocates , jury and judge , pardon or commutation . The bad may not coolly calculate upon all these , but the knowledge of them has its effect , quite equal to the fear of death . Moreover , death itself is often invited . Every form of death is premeditated and self-inflicted . The water , the rope , the razor , // the dagger , the pistol , and poison , are in frequent use in every land . Governments can not monopolize the liberty of killing . Individuals use it everywhere , with and without known cause . Suicides in some countries are ordinary events ; as in France , where the record of a single year , 1839 , gives 1,747 cases . Where is the awful dread of death ? Men may continue to quote from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all that a man hath , will he give for his life . " The aphorism of Bacon is more worthy of consideration - " There is no passion in the mind of man so weak , but it mates and masters the fear of death . " No ; the murderer is neither effectually deterred , nor adequately punished . The punishment falls upon his friends more than himself . His innocent family , many virtuous connections , may suffer for generations from the grief and the dishonor . Is it said , This is a necessary consequence of all sin and crime ? So far as it is necessary , let it come . But there is a dread peculiarity in this mode of punishment , which brings a needless aggravation of shame and sorrow , and is felt more by the innocent than the guilty . Then , what reparation or relief does it bring to the friends of the murdered ? Too often are their sorrows and suffering forgotten , in compassion for the reckless assassin ; a gross injustice , with which possibly the mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But neither the fact nor the mode should make our mercy forgetful and cruel . It is cruel to send our sympathies only to the cell of the felon , and not to the home and hearts which he has made desolate . Yet we would offer those hearts a truer and sweeter balm than revenge . If they crave that , our pity may he the greater , but it is wholly changed . The deeper their wounds , the more would we implore them to try the Christian remedy , - forgiveness ; not the forgiveness that palliates crime , or would avert its just penalty ; hut that which prays that life may he spared , and opportunity given for contrition and reformation . Should the hand of violence strike from us the most valued life , it would he a poor comfort to know that another life tnust be sacrificed , other friends agonized , and a guilty soul destroyed . Grant us rather the solace of doing what we may , with justice and security , to overcome evil with good , and at most inflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repentance , not in the goadings of retaliation . This to many // will seem visionary . Enough , if it be Christian . It is not Jewish , we own ; it is not heathen or savage ; neither is it lax or perilous . It possesses the element of justice as well as mercy , with more of certainty , strictness , and probable efficacy , than any known operation of the law of blood for blood . It is worth serious thought , whether the common arguments for capital punishment contain any thing distinctively Christian . Of the several objects of law and penalties , - reformation , restitution , protection , punishment ,  --  does it not put the first last , and the last first ? And does it accomplish either ? Reformation is scarcely possible , and is usually scouted . Reparation is never pretended . Punishment itself is altogether uncertain , and fearfully unequal . Protection , or prevention , alone remains . That we are to consider . All we have said will pass for little , with many , if it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friends of the murdered . We take , then , another position . 4 . Capital punishment fails to protect society . As at present administered , the law affords no protection against the murderer himself . It does not always pursue him , but sometimes exults in his impunity ; it creates or uniformly encounters many obstacles to his conviction ; it suffers him to live , though condemned , and often opens his prison-door . But more , it fails to protect from other murderers . This is an essential view ; it involves the strength or weakness of the common defence . The strength of this defence consists in the example ; its chief argument is the bxample . This is its demand , this its confident boast , this the avowed necessity , from which the right and duty follow . We bring it to the test of facts . If facts already cited are facts , the death of the murderer has not prevented other murders , or lessened the proportion of them to the population . The proportion has been largest where the axe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than murder , this is acknoxvledged , and the acknowledgment is material . The whole civilized world confess , and make proclamation now , that the punishment of death is not favorable , but pernicious , in a multitude of offences once capital . Is not the influence the same in all offences ? We speak of the example . There it is , be the offence large or small . There is death ; and in some countries , death has been a moral certainty for the offender . Yet // in its very face , offenders have braved it , and beneath the very gallows have so terribly multiplied , that the collected wisdom of England and France has cried out against it , demanding a change . The change has been made . One hundred and fifty capital crimes have been expunged from the English code ; a motion was made in Parliament in 1833 to expunge all that remain excepting murder , and failed by only one vote ; in 1840 , another motion was made for a total abolition of the death-penalty , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both there and here , that murder alone should be punished with death , and against even that there is a power rising everywhere which has ceased to be despised . Whence this great revolution ? Not least , if not most , from that very fact on which the retainers of capital punishment now plant their foot , - example . The example is against them . Death on the scaffold bas not prevented , but provoked crime . The sight of the gallows , with victim upon victim , has produced levity , licentiousness , and a frightful increase of iniquity . And if it has produced , or not prevented , minor offences , will it prevent greater ? Will the same spectacle , or the same penalty , which fails to deter from crimes that are cool and deliberate , prevent those which proceed from the most vehement and reckless passions , the malice , wrath , jealousy , and drunkenness of man ? On criminals themselves we know the effect . All conversant with them tell us it tends to make them worse . Mr. Wakefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their opinions were there changed from a favorable to a wholly unfavorable conviction as to the efficacy of public executions . The closest observers have expressed a similar opinion as to the effect on the whole community . And we feel authorized in saying , that capital punishment has not only failed of its object , but has caused immense evil . We say has caused ; that may be too strong a term . We admit , it involves a question on which a great deal depends in this whole discussion . We need no doubtful arguments . We will not assume more than can be proved or possibly known , as do many on both sides of the controversy . The opposers of capital punishment clearly assume too much , if they insist that the gallows is certainly the cause of all the evil it witnesses , or that similar evil does not attend or follow many innocent exhibitions , and even religious gatherings . // The more we consider the common hasty reasoning upon cause and effect , - one of the deepest and highest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and every subject . Men know very little of causes , in physics , morals , or events . But this we aver , - all that we do know , in this connection , is against capital punishment ; and that is all we assert or want . The argument , at this point , is necessarily one of inference . And the inference begins not with us , hut with those opposite . They infer , or rather assume , that the influence of capital punishment is salutary and effectual . We assume nothing , and only infer the cause of that which we see , - facts . The facts they admit , hut deny that they are effects . Grant that they are not effects , or rather that we can not he sure of it . Can we be sure of any thing ? How are we ever to know that any law or custom has any influence ? Is there any better mode than observation ? Grant , again , that observation brings different results , and that facts may he found , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to establish . Facts still remain , and are the best , and at this point the only possible , evidence . Those two thousand executions a year in the time of Henry the Eighth may have had no connection with each other , and none with the many of Elizabeth 's time afterward , when " the rogues were still trussed up apace , " as the narrator says . But this is certain , - they did not prevent the many crimes that followed them . The forty arrests for robbery at the execution of two men in England may not have been caus*d by the hanging ; but certain it is , the hanging did not prevent them . The recent execution of Zephon , in Philadelphia , did not prevent four other murders within two days , near the scene , though the poor negro was twice hung , his neck not being quite broken by the first fall . The hanging of Barrett at Worcester , for rape and murder , did not prevent another murder within ten days , close at hand , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiply cases . They abound , as given by O'Sullivan , Spear , and many others . They prove this , if nothing more , - the utter impotence of the gallows to awe even the gazing crowd , or restrain from instant and continued crime . They confirm what the pickpocket said in Newgate , - " That executions were the best harvests that he and his associates had . " And then we retort , and say to the defenders of capital // punishment , Prove something in its favor . Prove that it is the cause of some good ; show some connection between your principles and known results . Your whole argument is based upon precisely the kind of reasoning , which you call so loose and vapid in your opponents . Worse ; you not only reason from facts which may be owing to other causes , but from facts which do not appear . Assume less ; prove something ; prove that the gallows does any good to the criminal or the innocent , the old or young . Demonstrate by any reasoning , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any possible means , the beneficial effects of the example of public executions . True , the publicity of executions has been partially removed . A portion of Europe , and ten of our own States , have been constrained to unsay what bad always been said before , and have tbrown away at once half the efficacy and the strongest prop of the honored institution . Prove still that even now , in the prison-yard or prison-dungeon , a violent legalized death secures any protection to society , or bestows any blessing on mankind . We deny it . We have dwelt too long upon the negative ; yet we may call it positive , in the power of facts , principles , and avowals . We deny the right of capital punishment , as sustained by necessity , or demonstrated by salutary efficacy . We assert that there is no proof of its good effects , and abundant proof of the bad . We ask room for two other positions , partaking still more of the positive . 5 . Capital punishment has done irrevocable wrong . Unintentionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deter or punish the murderer , it has been itself the slayer of the innocent . There is an early and immutable law of Jehovah , - " Thou shalt not kill . " We believe this refers only to murder , and has been wrongly used against all taking of life . Jehovah himself , after giving it , allowed the taking of life in the Jewish economy , and Christ interpreted the commandmeat , " Thou shalt do no murder . " But we see in that commandment an obligation to guard the sanctity of life most scrupulously. lit forbids the stoutest loyalist and the freest self-defender to take life , in any case , rashly or needlessly . In connection with the Christian law , it says it is far better to yield life to violence , than to take it by violence . That we hold authority from man , that government is the // creature of God , and anarchy fatal to society , are not facts to lessen the sacredness of life , but to guard it the more , and to fill us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not , then , a terrible fact , that life has been one of the lightest bawbles with which kings or subjects have ever played ? Is it not the most melancholy phase of history , that more has been expended in the destruction of life , than for all other objects , - that human blood has been spilled like water , not only by the hand of violence , but with the sanction of law and religion , - that governments , instituted to protect the lives and liberties of men , have held their lives cheaper than the smallest coin or the slightest fame , and have erected civil , martial , and ecclesiastical altars for the sacrifice of human hecatombs ? Governments declare and sustain war ; and war has slain its myriads , by a right which Christianity renders doubtful and fearful , at the very lowest point of view , - at the highest , impious . Governments sanction duelling ; and the real or attempted murderers walk among men unrestrained and honored . Governments have made capital punishment their special prerogative ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the world , has passed since this prerogative was used , that it has not , in some quarter , cut short the life of an innocent man . The calmest retrospection will show that this statement is not extravagant . Take into account the reckless disposal of life under the despotisms of the earth , - remember the multitudes that have been slain by heathen ' and Christian powers , either as victims or heretics , - consider the number and rigor of penal laws in the best governments , until very recently , - consider the proverbial uncertainty of the law , the necessary dependence on circumstantial evidence , the fallibility of human judgment , and the worse than fallibility of many judges and jurors , under the sway of prejudice , ignorance , excitement , interested or local considerations , - and you have a countless host of doomed sufferers , wholly guiltless , or hut partially guilty . The mind revolts , the heart grows sick , at the thought of the vast numbers of innocent beings who have been immolated on this shrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perished , with all the advantage of able and humane defenders , and without any malice , that , when we attempt to add the unknown and probable , it seems impossible to do less than say with Lafayette , // - " I shall ask for the abolition of the penalty of death , until I have the infallibility of human judgment demonstrated to me . " England is a land of freedom and law . One of her best sons , and one competent to judge , Sir James Mackintosh , showed by careful returns , that , when capital punishments were very frequent in England , " the average had for many years been at the rate of one person executed every three years , whose innocence had been afterward satisfactorily established . " A committee who have since followed up the inquiry there have found more than a hundred , a late account says , a hundred and fifty cases . Dymond tells us , that at one assizes not less than six persons were hanged , who were afterwards found to be innocent . Srnollett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rape and murder were perpetrated upon an unfortunate woman in the neighbourhood of London , and an innocent man suffered death for this complicated outrage , while the real criminals assisted at his execution , heard him appeal to Heaven for his innocence , and in the character of friends embraced him while he stood on the brink of eternity . " In Dublin , 1728 , a surgeon of note was found alone in the house with his maid-servant who had been just murdered , and he himself was bloody ; he was tried and convicted , protested his entire innocence , but was executed ; a few years after , the actual murderer confessed to a priest , that he had entered the surgeon 's house for robbery , when no one but the girl was there , and being stopped by her as the gentleman returned , killed her and fled . Mrs. Child , in her Letters from New York , gives the particulars of two cases of strong circumstantial evidence , one in New York , and one in Missouri , where the innocence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Hamilton in Kentucky , some txventy-flve years ago , made a deep impression . Dr. Sanderson was found murdered in a cross-road , with Dr. Hamilton 's pistols lying by him . The latter , of course , was arrested and tried ; he made his own defence , and showed that he could not have been such a fool as to take that mode and place of killing a friend , and leave his pistols to betray him ; but it availed not ; he was executed , and in three months , two robbers confessed on the gallows that they first stole Dr. Hamilton 's pistols , and then committed the deed . In a speech at Exeter Hall , 1832 , Mr. // O'Connell says - " I myself defended three brothers of the name of Cremming , within the last ten years . They were indicted for murder . I sat at my window as they passed by , after sentence of death had been pronounced . Their mother was there , and she , armed with the strength of affection , broke through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was but twenty-two years of age ; I saw her hang on her second , who was not twenty ; 1 saw her faint when she clung to the neck of her youngest boy , who was but eighteen ; and I ask what recompense could be made for such agony ? They were executed , - and - they were innocent . " There are no words for such facts . rihey are unutterably awful , and should make the whole civilized world pause . ONE only knows how many they are . It is useless to say they can not be numerous , when , besides those not ascertained , there is the glaring fact , that those which are known were seemingly among the least doubtful cases . This is the most serious and terrible feature . The evil is in no way accidental , and no one 's fault . It is not haste , it is not malice , it is not the sin or error of judge , jury , or witnesses . The law is plain , the evidence direct , the guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is perfectly astounding , to see the weight of evidence all refuted by subsequent events . A father has been murdered at home ; the only person there a son , sworn by a sister to have been dissolute and anxious for the father 's property ; his shoes are tracked from the house to the spot of the murder , and his hammer is found concealed with marks of blood he is necessarily condemned , - and on her death-bed that sister confesses herself both the parricide and the fratricide . Two men have been seen fighting in a field , old enemies one is killed by a pitchfork known to belong to the other , and too late this other has been found innocent ; the true murderer sitting on the jury that tried him . A father and daughter have been overheard in violent dispute ; the former goes out and locks the door behind him ; groans issue from the room , with the exclamation , " Cruel father , thou art the cause of my death ! " the daughter , found stabbed and dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause ; - lie returns , betrays every sign of guilt , and is hung ; - a year afterward , a letter is found in her own hand , declaring her determination to kill herself , because her cruel fattier forbade her marrying as she wished ; and the public authorities , to atone for the 6* // error , wave colors over his grave , in token of his inno-cence ! We refer to none of the cases of innocent death caused by the confession of the sufferers themselves ; for though frightful , they are few , ( yet if we take the case of witchcraft , these innocent and fatal confessions have not been few , ) and belong to a kind of monomania , for which no human wisdom can account and no law provide . But we protest , in the name of justice , religion , and humanity , against every unnecessary peril of this awful character . And we repeat , it belongs to the very nature of the penalty . Continue that , and you can not avoid the peril , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those proved guilty must be punished . Punish them in a way not irremediable . Do you say , If innocent , any punishment is a wrong , and can not be recalled ? True , this is a necessary evil . But death is not necessary . And death , death only , is wholly irremediable . This is the point ; this is the mighty wrong . And until it can be demonstrated that it is an absolute necessity , - as it never can be , - no fallible creature , no earthly power , can pronounce the irrevocable doom , without assuming a sov. * ereiguty and defying a danger that are perfectly appalling . 6 . We come to our last position . Capital punishment has been abolished , with safety and advantage . It has been abolished universally for a vast many offences to which it was once attached ; and though fears for the consequences were not wanting in any case , and in some were as terrible as those that now prevent the last change , the offences themselves , thus relieved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced back in the experiment . But the abolition has not been restricted to minor crimes ; it has been carried to the greatest ; and it will require more sophistry than has yet been found to prove it a failure . We have used too much space to give the historical details on this point , and we will hope they are not unknown to our readers . They begin with Rome , where the Portian law forbade the infliction of the punishment of death upon a Roman citizen for any cause , and continued in operation two centuries and a half . 1Jontesquieu , Gibbon , and Blackstone speak of the good effect . The last says : - " In this period , the republic flourished ; under the emperors , severe punishments were revived , and then the empire fell . " In // Russia , during the reign of Elizabeth , and then of Catherine , capital punishment was expressly and wholly abolished , and is said to have been used but on two occasions to the present time . Blackstone , in his Commentaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the good consequences of the change , in the diminution of crimes . In Tuscany , the Grand Duke Leopold , in 1786 , abolished by law " the punishment of death , for ever . " For a quarter of a century , this edict remained in full force , with the happiest effect . Napoleon , for reasons which we could quote in his own language , characteristic and instructive , repealed the edict and restored the punishment . Dr. Baird and Mr. Cheever have ventured to proclaim , that this restoration was owing to the failure of the experiment . We find no ground for such an intimation , and are content to set against it the positive declarations of Leopold himself , Berenger and Carmignani of France , Franklin , Rush , and Livingston of America . We add the experience of Sir James Mackintosh ; during the entire period of his government of Bombay , the punishment of death was not once inflicted ; and he himself says of it , " Two hundred thousand men have been governed for seven years without a capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we might add the experience of Belgium , where , without its formal abolition , this punishment is said to have been disused now for twenty years , with none but good results . These facts are enough . We can imagine but one answer to them , or one evasion of their force . " Th* trials have been too short to verify the principle . " We reply , " Make them longer . " And we have a right to ask it . As citizens and as Christians , we demand that the professed religion of our land be allowed at least a fair trial , where justice , life , and eternity are involved . It is not humanity , it is not common , still less , Christian wisdom , to refuse to attempt reforms , because they have succeeded only as far as they have been tried . Besides , the first trial , the first ten or twenty years after a change which is considered dangerous , ought to be the worst . They ought surely to disclose some of the danger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gallows . Experience proves nothing in its favor ; its necessity can not be established ; its influence is all against it . Its assumption of sacred ground is at best an assumption , pressed with difficulties , and feebly sustained by fact even in // the early ages and the theocracy of the world . In Christianity it finds no countenance . Its long history has been one of carnage and dread accountableness . The millions of the guilty , whom it has doomed alike , though with every shade of guilt , from the lightest to the darkest , the army of the innocent , whom it has cut off in mid-life , imperatively demand the fair and full trial of a more equal , more merciful , more just , and less irrevocable punishment . Imprisonment for life is punishment enough for any one to hear . It may be made terrible , beyond all other . It may he clothed with a fearfulness that shall he more powerful to deter or punish than all tortures and deaths ; and this , too , without cruelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the murderer , the moment he is sentenced , be borne away silently and swiftly from the face of man and the light of heaven , to be consigned for a time to a darkened cell , alone with his conscience and his God , the past and the future , - soon , indeed , to leave that intolerable dungeon , but to leave it only for the simple meal or the busy workshop , and then return for the long night , and again rise to the same toil , and again go back to the same loneliness , the same , day after day , for weeks , months , a year , five , ten , twenty , fifty years . Is there a man that can think of this , without a more awful shudder and horror than the fear of death can cause ? The only objection is its severity . Yet they who bring that objection say that it will not deter from crime It need not be hurtfully severe . We would relieve it of all those aggravations which injure the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and social privileges consistent with order and safety . We would surround it with those kind moral influences which are found most effectual in softening the heart and converting the souls of men . Nor have we any of the poor fear , that this very kindness will defeat the object . It will leave enough of the terrible , in the monotonous , unending imprisonment . With all prisoners , kind treatment is as sound policy as it is true humanity . The principle is now demonstrated , and we see it stated in prison reports , that the convicts who are best treated are least likely to return . " Where the greatest severity is practised will be found the greatest number of recomniitments . " This is human nature , and might have been learned before . Let society treat its offenders severely , - they will avenge themselves as soon as they can . Make the laws hard , even // seemingly unjust and vindictive , - those laws will be again and again broken . Here is one of the causes of the pernicious effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there he a change . Let imprisonment be real and enduring , consuming all the active portion of life , or let it be perpetual ; but fill it with healthy occupation , with mental and spiritual blessings . Let earth be shut out , but heaven freely come in . Above all , let it be certain . Why can it not be ? For no reason but the use and abuse of the pardoning power . That , at the worst , would not be worse than at present . It might be infinitely better . The court that condemns has now the power to order a new trial , if new evidence appears . But this is a mockery , if you kill the man before the evidence can appear . Some of the States , as Vermont and Maine , have recently extended the interval between sentence and execution to a year or more . This is the beginning of mercy , though it seems little more than justice . Why not go on ? Allow a longer interval . Let the period before death be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - where is the danger , either to society or the prisoner , if there he a power lodged solely *n the court of ordering another trial , should circumstances in their judgment demand it ? Ay , but the murderer may commit another murder , says one more objector . The prisoner may kill his keeper . This , it has been confidently said , is alone a sufficient reason against the change . Then is it a sufficient reason for hanging the insane man who kills his keeper . If you can protect the state by confinement in the one case , you can in the other . But though you were compelled to punish the repetition of murder with death , it would be no argument for the law as it now stands and works . Besides , most of those who have killed their keepers have been men doomed to die themselves . It is an evil of the present system , and we throw back the objection . Let men live , deal with them mercifully as well as justly , and what motive will they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoke a severer punishment ? Let them live to repent , not to destroy . Let them live to work for society which they have defrauded , or for the families which they have bereft . Then may all the purposes of law and penalty be accomplished ; condemnation , confinement , suffering , reparation , and probable reform . Is not the bare possibility of this better than the certainty of the present accumulation of wrongs and evils ? // The most depraved and guilty are still men ; God requires that they he treated as men . Let society first protect itself by universal moral education . Let it he more anxious to prevent crime than to punish it . Let it punish in a way to prevent ; let it not expose and tempt to evil , and then cut off the evil-doer . While it compels men to fight , and honors them in proportion as they kill , it invites the retort of the murderer in England - " I have killed many men to please the king ; why should I not kill one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make murderers are protected by law and upheld by high influence , and the largest number of murderers issue from the licensed dram-shop , what justice is that , or what wisdom , which rewards him who maddened the brain of another until the fatal blow was given , and hangs him who madly and unconsciously gave it ? Drunkenness is no apology ? No ; it is an aggravation . Excuse it not , but punish with some measure of justice . It may he , that many would think it a lighter wrong to themselves and to society , that one of their family be even murdered in his innocence , than that their sons he degraded and lost through the selfishness and depravity of men who go unpunished and unrestrained . Human laws may not he able to reach both offences equally , but they can deal with them more justly . They have no right to give impunity to the one , and visit upon the other the heaviest retributions . Let law and religion be supreme . Let the violent and corrupting be restrained , - not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be helped , - not left to desperation . Let the ignorant be instructed , and the willing employed , the exposed protected , the fallen raised , and the innocent saved . The guilty must suffer ; let them suffer . Let them be surely and justly punished . The murderer especially , the wilful destroyer , the violator of God 's holy law and man 's sacred life , let ' him know that he will suffer , - not alone in the tortures of an outraged conscience , but in exile from an outraged community , with time and solitude for husy remorse . Let him suffer , - not in vengeance , that is not ours , - not for satisfaction , that is impossible , - but for the security of the good , the terror of the wicked , the penit*nce and regeneration of his own soul . Let God 's first mark rest upon him , that none may slay him , but all recognize and reprobate , while they pity and would save.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
