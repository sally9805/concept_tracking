THE BATTLE OF STILLWATER ; Or , THE MANIAC The Battle of Stillwater ; or , The Maniac was first produced at the National Theatre in Boston on March 16 , 1840 . No satisfactory assignment of authorship has hitherto been made , the only reference being Quinn 's remark ( History of the American Drama , Vol . I , p. 282 ) that " it has been attributed to Rufus Dawes but shows no trace of his style . " The evidence for ascribing its authorship to H. J. Conway , though not conclusive , appears valid . The title-page of the Seymour Collection manuscript of the play reads as follows : " The Battle of Stillwater or The Maniac , In Three Acts , founded on National events , by the Author of Pirate of the East , Black Douglass , Ida Stephanoff , The Fatal Prophecies , Nix 's Mate , &c.; &c.; &c."; Of these last plays , three are assigned to Conway by Wilson in his History of the Philadelphia Theatre 1835-1855 . These three are Ida Stephanoff , The Fatal Prophecies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East , all produced in Philadelphia , the last one also having a New York production recorded by Odell . Further , Conway 's career , as evidenced by many plays , includes plays written for various theatres in Philadelphia , Boston , and New York , at such periods as would fit in with the time of the Boston and New York productions of Stillwater . Many plays already ascribed to Conway are of the same pattern and style as Stillwater . Odell lists a number of Conway 's " moralized melodramas . " His New York Patriots ; or , The Battle of Saratoga even uses the same theme , for Stillwater is but a fictitious name for Saratoga . Conway had a long career in the theatre , as playwright , prompter , and business-office man . He was for several years , beginning in 1835 , prompter at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia . After a brief period in the 1840 's apparently spent in Boston , he became active in New York , writing plays for Barnum 's , The Old Bowery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1852 he held the position of treasurer at the Castle Garden Theatre , New York . His wife was the popular British actress , Miss Courtney , who made her American dbut in 1832 . Conway 's early Philadelphia plays were not very successful , but The Battle of Stillwater won ready acclaim . Its New York production on May 3 , 1841 was followed by a very successful adaptation , Charles O'Malley ; or , The Irish Dragoon , and in later years by such popular pieces as Uncle Tom 's Cabin , The Old Brewery , Anna ; or , The Child of the Wreck , and The Orphan 's Dream . The New York Patriots , mentioned above , won Conway a five-hundred dollar prize . The Battle of Stillwater is a turgid melodramatic mixture of patriotism , rustic humor , and a sensational love plot , climaxed by the surrender of Burgoyne , and a pageant of the " Genius of Liberty . " The author 's primary interest seems to be in the rustic humor of his " character " part of Uzzial , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heroine 's parents , played by Mrs. Thorne and the Bowery idol , J. H. Kirby . The Battle of Stillwater is printed in this volume from the National Theatre ( Boston ) copy in the possession of Princeton University , and supplied through the courtesy of Dr. Robert H. Ball . The manuscript copy , which is very clean , was obviously that used by the prompter , J. B. Wright , for whose benefit the production was given . With some definite evidence in favor , and none to the contrary , the assignment of this play to H. J. Conway has been made .

Uzzial Putnam Why , damn it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of it and tuk my cart and horse , pumpkins , squash and all , as quick as you could say Jack Robinson , and not particler perlite neither . I only saved two for seed , ' cause they are all killin ' good uns for pies . Gen. B. General Burgoyne Well , Uzzial , since you are taken , you must make the best of it . What are they doing in your camp ? Uzz . Uzzial Putnam Scratching his head Why , I do n't know  --  I do n't exactly know . They 're eating taters , whittling , making pandowdy , and telling stories ; and some on ' em talking like fools about what they shall do with all the fine things they s'pose they shall get hold on when they take all you officers prisoners . Gen. B. General Burgoyne Laughs Major , what do you think of this , eh ? Major . Major Ackland His last observations are rather personal , general . And perhaps too amusing to any ears but our own . Looking at Sidearms Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exit with the two Soldiers So they talk in this way , do they ? We shall see .

Look at his men  --  some of them chaps as live up among the rocks of New Hampshire . Them 's the chaps . When they want fresh meat they go out and kill a bear . Look at their mouths . They can eat granite and drink a mill stream . They 're real snowgers sic ! They can live on the feed of a mule and carry more than a horse when their dander 's up . Gen. B. General Burgoyne Excellent qualities for a soldier . I wish ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is that stout tall man with a light-coloured frock on , and stands without a hat ? Uzz . Uzzial Putnam That 's Virginia Morgan . He 's got the true mountain stuff about him . He can hit a squirrel on the full gallop with his rifle ball . You can hear him farther off than you can the roar of a wild bull . He 's a real roarer . And if you have a tough fight , he 'll be up knee-high in business . I had rather fight a catamount than that ' ere Morgan . Gen. B. General Burgoyne Well , Uzzial Taking glass , you rascal , I suppose you are a spy and I ought to have you hanged in ten minutes . By the bye , major , it is reported to me that daring young rebel , Harry Cotton , as he is called , has escaped to the American lines . Our outposts must be on the alert .

Guess I could have got out of the way , but I had always a sneaking liking for you , general  --  whatever the Boston folks said about you  --  and I ai n't afeared but I shall get my horse and cart again , whoever eats up the notions I had in it . Gen. B. General Burgoyne Smiling Uzzial , how came you to know all these Yankee officers so well ? Uzz . Uzzial Putnam Why , I have heard father , and Uncle Jo and the town clerk , and Deacon Doughnut talk a heap about ' em . Then , I have tended horses ever since I was ten year old , and I shall be twenty-six year old next grass , and you know there 's nothing in creation like a stable to get introduced to gentlemen .

Wal , as I was saying before , I was born jist by the river , but I did n't stay ther long . I was an orfin afore I was six and got put out to bring up at Rufus Pikes , and a tarnations good place it was , too  --  dreadful pretty location just at the head of Newfound Pond and about fifteen miles below Uncle Bill Willoughby 's , and suthin ' like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Elijah Blood 's mills .

Uzzial Putnam Well , hug me to death in a pretty gal 's arms , if he did n't find he 'd ketched the wrong animal that pull anyhow . By gol ! I wonder if his legs and the legs of the table did n't get into a snarl .

But I was took in the wust kind . There war n't no shine about it . Well , I went down to the wharf and struck a bargain with a chap to go to the West Indies and was off to sea next day like a frog into a moat .

Lucy . Luce Lambson What , hang you ? Uzz . Uzzial Putnam No , worse  --  wallup me . Says I , " Captain , reason is reason , and there a n't a stick of reason in my going up them ropes feelin ' so all-killin ' bad as I do now ! And I 'm a chap what always adheres to its dictates , so ropesend or no ropesend , I sha n't do it ! " Well , at that , he gin me a cut .

Lucy . Luce Lambson My , Uzzial , you war n't senseless all that time . Uzz . Uzzial Putnam Clean out o ' my head .

You see , just as we got near the coast here , there cum a gale what peeled the bark off anything I ever see afore . Down come masts , spars , rigging and all , like lightning ; and before I had time to collect my scatterin ' idees , the vessel went right over  --  slap-dab carouse ! And I found myself holding onto a hencoop out in the open water . Lucy . Luce Lambson Goodness , a hencoop ? Uzz . Uzzial Putnam Guess you 'd have thought I had a dreadful liking for poultry , if you 'd seen me hug the old hencoop . But it war n't no joke , for I kept myself atop of water all night with it .

Harry Cotton was all-killin ' kind to me and had me rubbed and basted and soaked in Jamaica spirits till I felt just like a new critter . Lucy . Luce Lambson Uzzial , did n't a small grain of the Jamaica run down your throat ? Uzz . Uzzial Putnam Why , you  --  should n't wonder if a small trifle did leak in .
