Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : THE TWO SABBATHS. from The two sabbaths ( 1847 ) The Song of Creation burst forth like the floods , That bow , as in worship , the rock-rooted woods ;  --  Like streams of rejoicing the harmonies run , Uranus repeating the hymn of the Sun  --  " The work of Creation is finished  --  is blest  --  And Earth may enjoy her sweet Sabbath of rest ! " Oh , listen !  --  there mingles a murmur of wo  --  One note of complaining , so lengthened and low , It seems like the sigh of the flowers when flung , All fresh in their bloom , on the grave of the young ;  --  The moan is for man , wrung from Nature 's sad breast ; His sin has unhallowed her Sabbath of rest ! The Song of Redemption flowed soft as the light , When turning to angels the spectres of night ; The clouds wore an iris , the sunbeams a smile , As though in the chorus they chanted the while  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may enjoy her sweet Sabbath of Love ! " Oh , listen !  --  the voices of Cherubim young Pour out their hosannas as incense is flung ; No more from the world shall God 's Spirit withdraw ; The blood of the Cross blots the curse of the Law ; And mortals below , and immortals above , Now hallow one Sabbath  --  the Sabbath of Love !
