txt THE advent of a popular book , is about as evident , from certain attending signs , as the appearance of a comet among the steady and fa . rniliar bodies of the solar system . On the occurrence of the heavenly phenomenon , astronomers are busy in the investigation of its appearance and laws ; the learned professor wheels out his long telescope , and gazes the live-long night at the misty thing he has espied in one of the constellations . His accurate pupil turns to his books , to determine the elements of its orbit , and whether it is Encke 's or Halley 's . Men stand in crowds , watching its flight from star to star-journals of science and heralds of news spread authentic information of its progress , rate of velocity and time of disappearance ; and he who had not seen the celestial wonder , would know that it had actually appeared . It is somewhat so with the terrestrial phenomenon . As soon as it is fairly " out , " in the shape of letters from abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or biography of warriors , literary circles are busy in the discussion of its merits , according to the established rules of criticism ; half-literary circles talk of its fine passages , interesting hero , thrilling catastrophe , elegant binding , and the perfection of the art of printing . Reviews , journals , magazines , quarterlies and penny papers are filled with extracts , comments , recommendations , puffs . Circulating libraries of " choice reading , " circulate with new velocity-there is a buzz in the saloons of Washington and Saratoga , about the Glory and Shame of England , or Napoleon and his Marshals . The bookseller , reduced to his " last copy , " assures his eager customers , that a new edition is " forth-coming , " and a man a thousand miles from New York or Boston , is aware that a new star is blazing in the literary world . From some of these signs we knew of the existence of " Headley 's Napoleon "  --  the book to which we shall principally direct our attention at this time , reserving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author . If any of our readers should think that a more critical notice than we were able to give to this work on a former occasion is uncalled for , we need only say in self-justification , that a " philosophical estimate of the French Revolution , " which has passed through eight or nine editions , and received from the press the most flattering commendations , deserves more than a place among our literary notices . One editor calls this work , " the most deeply interesting and widely popular book of the season ; " another pronounces it " superior to the writings of Scott and Alison ; " another calls it " a philosophical estimate of the French Revolution . " One praises the " august title " and the " portraits of the marshals , " and says , " if there is such a thing as being born for a particular profession , Mr. Headley was born for a military commander . " One discourses in this style : " he is an ardent admirer of Napoleon , worshiping him with almost a poetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great soldier in the days of his glory , he would have loved him with adoration . " If now and then a voice has been raised in another strain , it has been lost in the din of general approbation . And yet this very popular work which is doing much to shape the views and moral sentiments of American youth , is not , in our opinion , either a trustworthy history , or a tale of sound July , // moral influence . We invite the reader 's attention to the justice of this opinion . The leading and most conspicu. ous chapter of these two volumes , is a forced effort to defend Napoleon against English historians , by prov. ing him guiltless of provoking those wars , which convulsed the world from his accession to the consular throne of France , to his final defeat at Waterloo . This design is announced in the following language . " Before entering on his character , it is necessary that whatever unjust prejudices we entertain , should be removed , and our errors in history corrected . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the conviction every where enter . tamed , that he alone , or chiefly , is chargeable with those desolating wars , that covered the continent with slain armies . " To show how hearty and urgent were Napoleon 's efforts to secure a general peace , his memorable letter , written soon after he assumed the consulship , to the King of England , is brought to view , with some lofty paragraphs about the good intentions of the author . In alluding to the manner of its reception by the British government , it is said , " Mr. Pitt returned an insulting letter , and declared that England must see some signs of repentance and amendment before she could trust the proffers of peace ; and that the restoration of the Bourbon throne , was the only guarantee she would deem sufficient for the good behavior of the French government . " If this last assertion had been uttered as merely the opinion of Mr. - leadley , drawn from his observations when he " traveled , " as he informs us , " amid the monarchies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " it might have been classed with many of his startling conclusions , and been passed off for what it was worth ; but it is another matter , when it is asserted as a fact in history , that to proposals of peace made by the first consul , Mr. Pitt ( rather , Lord Grenville ) replied , that the " restoration of the Bourbon throne was the only guarantee England could deem sufficient for the good behavior of the French government " - refusing all terms of accommodation until this security was obtained . It appears from the official correspondence on the subject , that no such condition was considered Indispensable to the existence of friendly relations between the two nations . On the contrary it was expressly declared in the reply of Lord Grenville , that his Majesty made no claim to prescribe to France , what should be the form of her government , in order that a " solid pacification " might take place . We will quote the language of the British minister . " The best pledge of the reality and permanence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of princes , which for so many centuries maintained the French nation in prosperity at home and consideration abroad . But it is not to this mode that his majesty limits the possibility of solid pacification . He makes no claim to prescribe to France , what shall be the form of her government , or in whose hands she shall vest the authority necessary for conducting the affairs of a great nation . " M. Talleyrand , in his rejoinder , speaks of the allusions to the house of Bour. bon , as " insinuations which tend to an interference in the internal affairs of France , " but not as indispensable nor as proposed conditions of peace . In reply to this despatch ofifalleyrand , it was protested that the King of Great Britain " had no desire whatever to prescribe to any foreign nation , what should be the form of its constitution . " Yet , after having made quotations from these important state papers , Mr. Headley asserts , " England would have no peace while France continued to be a republic , " Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hostile to the published policy of a government which on all occasions , conceded to France the right to rule herself , only requiring of her to abstain from aggressions upon other powers , and to maintain such an attitude , and to keep within such bounds , as would be consistent with the independence of the British empire and those of her allies . This being the avowed principle of her conduct , proclaimed by ministers in Parliament , announced to the cabinets of Europe as the basis of treaties and alliances , she was not so foolish as to declare to the world , that she refused peace , and waged war for the restoration of the dethroned Bourbons . We come next to the rupture of the peace of Amiens , in which Napoleon is made to play the part of grand pacificator and defender of the law of nations and of the faith of compacts and treaties . All the blame of the disturbance of the world 's repose , and of the wars which followed it , is charged as usual to the wicked British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretext , a solemn compact . It is apart from our main design to discuss this subject , or any subject contested by writers on opposite sides of the British channel-to bandy authorities about nice points of history , or to undertake to say , what judgment shall be pronounced upon Napoleon for his share in the horrible campaigns of Austerlitz , Jena , Eglau , and Friedland . Our object is to correct some mistakes of our author concerning facts not in dispute among historians . He says , " his part of the treaty of Amiens , Napoleon had fulfilled within two months after its completion ; but tea months had now elapsed and the English were still in Alexandria and Malta . But Napoleon , anxious to preserve peace , did not see fit to urge matters until it was suddenly announced that the English government had proclaimed her determination not to fulfill the stipulations she had herself made . The only pretext offered for this violation of a solemn contract , was her suspicions that France had designs on these places . " Nothing is said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as early as the date of the treaty of Amiens-nothing of the irritable state of the people in both countries , evinced by the ebullition of the public journals-nothing of the call of the First Consul upon his Majesty 's government , to " take effective measures to put a stop to seditious publications , " and to require certain French emigrants to quit the territory of the British empire-nothing of the correspondence relating to the interference of France in the affairs of the Helvetic republic , and to the protracted occupation of Hotland-nothing of the alledged impracticability of delivering up Malta in conformity with the treaty-noth. ing , in short , of a long series of complaints , demands , explanations , projects , criminations and recriminations , of the flourish of diplomatic weapons for many months , between two rival nations , which led by easy steps to the infraction of a definitive treaty and to a declaration of war . One would infer that Napoleon while reposing on his laurels , dreaming of the aggrandizement of France and of universal pacification , was disturbed by the sudden announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to evacuate Egypt and Malta . But what is most objectionable , is the assertion that " the only pretext offered for the violation of a solemn compact , was the suspicion that France had designs upon those countries . If this is true , England has more sins upon her guilty head than are commonly charged to her account . But it is not true . From the official correspondence which took place while* this question of // peace or war was pending , it appears that many reasons were assigned , why Malta had not been surrendered according to the contract of Amiens . These reasons are stated in form , in the instructions given by the British minister of foreign affairs to Lord Wilworth , plenipotentiary at the Court of the Tuileries . " With regard to that article of the treaty which relates to Malta , " says Lord Hawkesbury , " the stipulations contained in it , owing to circumstances which it was not in the power of his Majesty to control , have not been found capable of execution . The refusal of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Maltese langue should be abolished ;  --  the silence of the Court of Berlin with respect to the invitation that has been made to it , in consequence of that treaty , to become a guaranteeing power ; - the abolition of the Spanish priories in defiance of the treaty to which the King of Spain is a party ; - the declaration of the Portuguese government of their intention to sequestrate the property of the Portuguese priory , as forming a part of the Spanish langue , unless the property of the Spanish priories is restored to them ;  --  the non-election of a grand master : - these circumstances , without any other special cause , would have been sufficient to warrant his majesty in suspending the evacuation of the island , until some new arram*ement could be adjusted for its security and independence . But when it is considered how greatly the dominion , power , and influence of France have of late been extended , his majesty must feel that he has an incontestible right , conformably to the principles on which the treaty of peace was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any new arrangement which it might be necessary to make with a view of effecting the real objects of that treaty . And these considerations , sufficient as they might be in themselves , have received additional force from the views which France has recently and unreservedly manifested . ' * These reasons are assigned again and again , not only for the occupation of Malta after the time prescribed for its evacuation , but for the determination of the British government not to withdraw their troops from the island until the real objects of the treaty were secured . " Yet , " says Mr. Ileadley , " the only pretext offered for the violation of a solemn contract , " &amp;c. &amp;c . Not satisfied with making these misrepresentations , he presses Mr. Alison into the service of throwing upon England the guilt of provoking an unnecessary war . " Mr. Alison , " it is said , who certainly will not be accused of favoring too much the French view of the matter , nor too eager to load England with crime , is nevertheless compelled to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewing the circumstances under which this contest was renewed , it is impossible to deny that the British goveminent manifested a feverish anxiety to come to a rupture , and that so far as the two countries were concerned , they were the aggressors . ' And yet at the opening of the campaign of Austerlitz , " says Mr. Ileadley , " he indulges in a long homily on the ambition of Napoleon . And these are the works we place in our libraries as histories . " The sentence quoted from the English historian being torn from its connection , conveys a meaning which the writer never intended to convey . He concedes that England evinced a spirit of hostility and a determination to resort to arms , by evading the mediation of a third power , and demanding the passports of her minister . But , he goes righ on to say , in substance , that these measures were unavoidable , as precautionary means of self-defense : // from the imperious tone of the First Consul-his encroachments upon independent states in time of tranquillity-his stretches towards universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purpose was to remain at peace until his vast resources could be turned with consummate talent against the power of Great Britain . Mr. Alison concludes ,  --  " Such being his evident design , as it has now been developed by time , and admitted by himself , there can be but one opinion among all impartial persons as to the absolute necessity of resuming hostilities , if not in 1803 , at least at no distant period , and preventing that formidable increase of his resources during the interval of peace , which with him was ever but the prelude to a more formidable future attack . " Here is revealed a ground of defense taken by England in coming to a rupture with France . If a writer would throw light on this part of her history , and the opinion posterity is to form of her conduct on this occasion , he must go farther back than to the time of the declaration of war , and bring to view something besides the olive branch held out by Napoleon , or the broken treaty of Amiens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distrust his pacific purpose , from a knowledge of his character , acts and declarations . He might have been as perfidious in his policy , as treacherous in his conduct , as cruel in his friendship towards England , as he had been towards Sardinia , Tuscany , Genoa and Switzerland ; and the flight of courier after courier with proffers of good-will and amity , and even years of rest upon his arms , might have been only a stratagem of war . He might have been p laying on a larger and less defensible scale the game which he played with Alvinzi , in 1797 , when , seeing his troops attacked on all sides by superior numbers , and no means of escape from the Austrian bayonets , he sent a flag of truce to Alvinzi proposing a suspension of arms for half an hour , under the pretext that a messenger had arrived from Paris with important dispatches concerning peace . By this artifice he gained time to dispose of his army so as defeat his enemies . Hostile preparations , aggressive acts , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorting to such measures ; - springing from remote provocations , such as encroachments upon territory , violation of rights , neglect of grievances , threatenings , coalitions , the known intention of a powerful ruler and the annexation of a state , they are often necessary measures of self-defense . If there is sufficient reason to believe that serious injury is intended , it is a justifiable cause of war , according to the common law of nations . We are now speaking conformably to this code , and not to our own convictions of the right mode of settling international disputes . In a time of profound peace , Frederic the Great obtained such information as convinced him , that a formidable confederacy of the powers of Europe had determined to seize his dominions and divide the spoils . His plan was instantly formed-he resolved to strike the first blow . Saxony was immediately invaded by sixty thousand Prussian troops , " Pirna was blockaded , and Dresden was taken . " Judging from appearances , Austria and her allies were the injured party , and Frederic was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England-understanding the policy of her arch-enemy , knowing his disregard of previous treaties , his encroachments upon the liberties and bounds of neutral states , his ceaseless and gigantic efforts for the aggrandizement of France , his towering ambition , his implacable hatred of the British name , his cherished plans of conquest , extending to every quarter of the habitable globe // - had good reason to be alarmed for her own safety and that of her allies , she was as defensible in rejecting overtures of peace and in retaining possession of Egypt and Malta , as was Frederic in the invasion of Saxony ; or as Alvinzi would have been had he answered the flag of truce at Rivoli by a charge of his grenadiers . We have indulged in these criticisms not merely for the purpose of vindicating Mr. Alison , whose history of modern Europe is the ablest and most impartial estimate of the character of the great subject of that history , which has ever been written , as well as a splendid monument of genius and learning ; but to show , incidentally , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . if all his statements are true , they prove nothing : the preliminary and fundamental question he has not even touched . We can not follow him through all his misrepresentalions : enough has been said to show , all we intended to show , how much he is to be relied upon for historical accuracy . There is scarcely a matter of history , leading to important conclusions , in this incoherent chapter on Napoleon , that is not to be taken with many grains of allowance either for the ignorance or partiality of the writer . The conclusions , many of them involving difficult questions of national policy , and requiring careful discussion , are settled in a sentence or two-dashed off with the careless rapidity of one of his battle scenes . If it is in this way that our " prejudices are to be removed " and " our errors in history corrected , " we are likely still to retain them , and to regard the " Great Captain " as Mr. Ileadley does in his " Alps and the Rhine , " when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could make a flattering press say what he liked , and the world would believe it ; but the tumult and false splendor of his life have passed away , and men begin to scrutinize this demi-god a little more closely . One 's reflections of him always end painfully , and the mind runs down from emperor , hero , warrior , to robber . " We concede to Mr. Headley 's admirers much thatthey claim for him , as a descriptive writer . There is a charm which every reader feels in his lively and brilliant style . This is most conspicuous in his sketches of warlike scenes . As a describer of battles , sieges , heady fights , gallant charges , routed armies , he is often bold , graphic , stirring , dramatic . As a specimen , we give the following : " The next moment the plain fairly rocked and trembled under the headlong charge of the Prussian cavalry , as they came pouring on the French infantry . The shock was terrific ; hut that splendid body of horse recoiled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of a rock instead of living men . The French threw themselves into squares , and the front rank kneeling , fringed with their glittering bayonets the entire formations , while the ranks behind poured an incessant volley on the charging squadrons . These would recoil , turn and charge again , with unparalleled , but vain bravery . Prince William , who led them on , disdaining to abandon the contest , again and again hurried them forward with an impetuosity and strength that threatened to bear down every thing before them . Sometimes a square would bend and waver a moment , like a line of fire when it meets the blast , but the next moment would spring to its place again , presenting the same girdle of steel in front and the same volcano of fire behind . Goaded to desperation and madness by the resistance he met with , and confident still of the power of his cavalry to break the infantry , he rallied his diminished troops for the last time , and led them to the charge . These brave men rode steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that swept their path , till they came to the very muzzles of the guns ; but not a square broke , not a battalion yielded . " This is one of the best samples of what may be considered cur author 's forte  --  the dashing off of battle scenes . It is not so much encumbered with repetitions and crowded with figures , as many specimens which might be selected . A critic 's scissors would lop off some redundancies , and cut out one or two of the metaphors ; but on the whole , it is well done . The shock and recoil of the cavalry  --  the firm array of the French squares , " fringed with glittering bayonets "  --  the momentary yielding of a single square , as it " bends and waves , like a line of fire when it meets the blast , " and the last onset of the furious horsemen , are well represented . The rapid and changing action of the scene is quite dramatic , and occasionally there is a touch of fancy , which seems to spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing our author is more at home than in still scenes , or narrative , or delineations of character . Where the " war thunders rattle , " he is as cool and self-possessed as Ney himself , scanning in the midst of the storm every part of the field , and detecting at a glance every grand mane*uvre and brilliant charge . But we can not concede to him that rank as a descriptive writer , which some critics have done , whose lavish praise would lead one to suppose that the wand of the " great magician " had descended to Mr. Ileadley , or that Alison , the historian of " Modern Europe , " was eclipsed by the author of " Napoleon and his Marshals . " He has neither the natural grace of the one , nor the classic taste of the other ; while he is inferior to both in clearness and accuracy . The most striking fault of his style is excessive exaggeration . Every thing is described as grand and magnificent ; every battle is tremendous and sublime-every army is splendid and glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun "  --  the squadrons all " rush like a storm , " charge " like a thunderbolt , " and fall " like an avalanche "  --  the sabre strokes ring like a thousand anvils ; and " when the stars come out upon the sky , their rays are dimmed by the dazzling sparks , as sword crosses sword , or glances from steel armor . " The chief actors in the drama have an unnatural , and even a supernatural air ; there never were such splendid heroesof such " towering forms , " " flashing eyes , " and " iron wills " - able to deal such terrible blows , perform such prodigious feats , and to " wring victory even out of the iron hand of fate , " " with more than human valor . " See what a figure , half of earth and half of air , Ney presents . " Then his eye glanced like an eagle 's , and with his form towering amid the smoke of battle and flash of sabres , he seemed an embodied hurricane sweeping over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his shattered column , he moved like the God of war amid the tempest that beat upon him , " " and like a pillar of fire to his men marching straight on death . " The reader is reminded all along of one of Ossian 's hyperboles. - " I saw their chief , tall as a rock of ice , his spear the blasted fir , his shield the rising moon ; he sat on the shore like a cloud of mist on the hill . " It is not surprising if we meet among so many tropes and figures , and where there is such a straining after intensity of expression , some incongruous images ; such for example as a " tortured war cloud " - " a bridge scourged with grape shot and bullets . " We hardly know how to classify the sentence which follows ; while it may come un*3er the head of mixed metaphors , it seems to belong to a branch of art somewhat different from rhetoric . " The next // July the useless battle of Talavera was delivered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sometimes we have such pictures as the following : - " No husbandman was driving his plough , no groups of peasants were seen going to their toil , but that bright valley seemed holding its breath in expectation of some fearful catastrophe ! " Again , " The spectacle was sublime , and each army held its breath in awe , as these warlike hosts went rushing on each other . Their dark masses looked like two thunder-clouds riding opposite hurricanes and meeting in mid-heaven . " Now and then a sentence , in its hurry to carry out a swelling thought , slips clear of the traces of dull prose , and breaks into a kind of poetic handgallop-as , " Mortier 's honor is free from the stain , that dims the lustre of Marmot 's name . " There is a perpetual recurrence of the same figure . " Girdles of fire " - " girdles of steel " - " impetuous streams " - " iron wills " - " iron lips ' ' - ' ' marble brows , ** are as abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bayonets were in the grand army . Some of his gramiriatical and verbal blunders are too glaring to be overlooked . We have such phrases as the following : - " the Americans who never weary of hanging wreaths " - " at the fierce fought battle " - " neither English or French " - " there never was a braver fought battle " - " Rastan his faithful Mameluke , which he brought from Egypt . " " He asked if the guard were in want of nothing . " " Instead of being ambitious men , there never were juster wars waged . " " The dense fog that curtained in the dark and chilly morning , lifted and rent before the fierce acclamations that answered him , and with the first dawn his columns were upon the enemy . " We find words and phrases in a wrong regimen , and sometimes in no regimen at all - verbs without their nominatives , and nominatives without their verbs - moods and tenses used without regard to time , condition , or sense . Mr. Head ley is probably acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grammar , and is capable of applying its simplest rules ; but , either through carelessness or the contempt in which genius is apt to hold such trifles as etymology and syntax , he has greatly disfigured his work , and committed grievous offenses against the king 's English . But the moral tone of this book is worse than its literary execution . We refrain from remarking o nsuch sentiments as the following : " There were never juster wars prosecuted , than those in which the marshals of France won their laurels . They were not only waged against tyranny , as was our revolutionary war , but unlike the latter , could not be helped , for they were purely defensive . " " We need not fear the effect of stimulating too much the love of glory in this age of dollars and cents . " " War waged from principle is the same as that carried on by the direct command of heaven . " Our business is chiefly with the warlike tendency of this book , arising from its general style and spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted to stimulate the minds of men with visions of martial glory ; to make them covet military talents and military fame , and deify and enshrine some military hero ; to foster a passion which has covered the earth with human skeletons , and shed an ocean of human blood-which has dug the grave of every departed nation , and threatens to destroy every living one , and which yet impiously calls forth to celebrate its achievements , thanksgiving to the " God of battles . " We do not therefore agree with a coteinporary in the opinion , that " the whole work shows a heart alive to truth and moral excellence . " A heart alive to truth and moral excellence , would have a sense of the // horrors of war and the crimes of warriors , of those especially who have slaughtered human beings on the largest scale . Such a heart would reveal itself , on every page , in a bleeding sympathy for the victims of the sword , and in condemnation of those who have piled heaps of such victims on a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon and his marshals , presents them in their glitter and parade , and not in the naked deformity of their actions as truth and moral excellence would present them . We have before us the grand army  --  the complex but harmonious movements of a hundred thousand men , coming into the line of battle-the marshals of France in full uniform , surrounding the square figure of Napoleon in his renoxvned frock-coat and cocked hat  --  the furious onset of fifteen thousand horsemen-the steady charge of a column of infantry right upon the enemy 's centerthe shock-struggle-victory and pursuit-all this array and strife set forth in such a manner , as to captivate ardent minds and hold them delighted with the scenery of war . This is the natural effect of such an exhibition : men are pleased with the show of armies-they admire " tossing plumes , " flashing helmets , advancing columns , charging squadrons-they are stirred by the strains of martial music . Now let a writer represent these things in dramatic style with all the exaggeration of perspective and scenery , while the horrors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for the purpose of finishing a description or clouding a picture ; let it be seen that in his mind the field after a battle is better fitted to inspire poetry , than to strike the terrors of retributive justice to the consciences of the guilty instruments of war ,  --  and he excites in his reader admiration of its pomp and circumstance , without giving a true impression of its actual horrors . If warriors are represented in the most dazzling manner-if all the imagery of language is employed to show them in their plumes and epaulettes - if every glance of their eyes is like the eagle 's , every flash of their swords like lightning , every blow a thunderbolt , and every charge a storm-if they are made to appear more like demi-gods riding scatheless through the storm of battle , than like common men of flesh and blood , while the fiendish passions which they usually display in scenes of pillage and slaughter , are slurred over ; we get a wrong impression of their characters , and of the effects of their actions . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his gay costume , leading his cavalry into action , or exhibiting himself to the wondering Cossacks , or plunging into the thickest of the fight : we almost forget that he was a man of blood , who gloried not in a common slaughter , but in one where he could " hear the hones crush , " as Marshal Lannes said ,  - -  *vho seemed to rush to battle as joyfully as to a banquet , and to riot on acres of crushed and bleeding men , - who fought from pure love of carnage ,  --  so merciless and wholesale a manslayer , that he was sometimes called , even by his war-loving companions , " the butcher . " But says Mr. Ileadley , " all history should be written " - " if history should be abjured when it treats of battles , it would be reduced to a very small compass . Objections to books of this kind would repudiate most of the Old Testament , and make the heroes which the pen of inspiration delineated with such graphic power , curses of their race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we object to , but the treating of them in the vain-glorious style of Mr. Headley . Books written with truthfulness , presenting both the lights and shadows of history , do no harm ; naked scenes of war stimulate no love of martial glory ; fighting men , // shown in their true character , excite no shouts of enthusiasm . We lately read in that old volume , considered , in some places , worthy to be imitated in its manner of presenting all truth , an account of a battle , which is so strikingly in contrast with the heroic strain , that we shall make a liberal quotation . " And the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate ; and the Syrians were by themselves in the field . When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array agai*ist the Syrians ; and the rest of the people he delivered into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them i/* array against the children of Ammon . And he said , if the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strono* for thee , then I will come and help thee . Be of good courage , and let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our God ; and the Lord do that which seemeth him good . And Joab drew nigh , and the people that were with him , unto the battle against the Syrians : and they fled before him . And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled , then fled they also before Abishai , and entered into the city . So Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem . " Here is a description of a battle like Napoleon 's grand manouvre of accumulating large masses of troops at vital points , and beating the enemy in detail ; but no martial pageant-no display of glittering helmets and bucklers , of chariots and spearmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and no glorification of the conqueror : all that is said about him after the victory is , " So Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem . " The sacred historians always exhibit wars as the manifestations of divine power and vengeance , without the exaggeration and poetic coloring of some modern sketches , and not in a manner to excite admiration of warriors or emulation of their exploits . Without fear , we would trust even our author , in his most martial mood , to read the stoi*ies of Moses and Joshua and Gideon and Barak and Jephtha and David , and of all those who " through faith waxed valiant in fight . " We would recommend the study of these worthies to the Rev. Mr. Headley , especially as he thinks that such objections as our own to his book , " would repudiate most of the Old Testament , and make the heroes which the pen of inspiration delineated with such graphic power , curses of their race. ** Besides the dazzling effect given in this book to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they do not appear in their true character and excite proper detestation of their deeds , is the artful setting off , without any contrast , of some agreeable quality , or some scene in which they are made to appeal to our sympathy or admiration . It is like the art of the limner , who gives an unnatural prominence to one feature of the face , that the eye of the observer may not rest upoa the deformity of the other lineaments . By this kind of representation , favorable opinions are often secured for the most detestable characters . It is sometimes said in vindication of George the fourth , that he was the most polished gentleman in Europe ; - this libertine , gambler and drunkard , who turned his princely dwelling into a brothel , and committed every crime that can degrade a man , is held up as a pattern of manners , and we are invited to lose our abhorrence of his vices in admiration of the royal gentleman . The notorious Crocksford , of St. James ' , London , is represented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' a man-somewhat pious withal , because he shuts his gambling house on the Sabbath , and once refused to lend a gentleman a pack of cards on Sunday . How often is the libertine shielded from public scorn and admitted into good company , because his manners are agreeable and lie is reputed to be kind at home . Even the murderer feels the favoring influence of this partial estimate of character : if he is a graceless villain , with a thick neck , harsh voice , bad scowl , and a scar over one eye , he is condemned already in many minds ; but if on the other hand he is a pleasing person , with a trim form , high forehead and classic profile , and especially if any good deed that he has ever done is whispered about , the favorable verdict of the multitude is half secured . When we come to popular novels , it is all in this fashion ; - interesting villains-genteel pickpockets-gentlemen robbers-heroic pirates and assassins -- charming adulteresses and lovely victims of seduction , are the heroes and heroines of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daring villain , as he dashes in fine style through a series of extravagant adventures , becomes familiar with diabolical passions and crimes under soft names , and comes to the conclusion that the guilt of vice is in its grossness . Poetry in the same strain , trains its choicest epics , to celebrate the valor of warriors* cruel as the gray c  --  the gallantry of knights degraded by lustthe glory of kings treading on the necks of their subjects  --  the skill of statesmen most skillful in crimethe splendor of conquerors enslaving the world . Even history is justly chargeable with misrepresentation in recording the extraordinary and brilliant actions of men , and omitting those that are mean and characteristic , or by coloring these and clouding those-in hiding some of the most prominent actors in the scene of life , and pushing forward others of less importance , and leading us to admire bravery and genius and learning , rather than goodness and truth and self-control . We have a specimen of what we have alluded to , in Mr. Headley 's account of the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear very interesting as chief mourner . As this is considered one of the gems of the second volume , we quote a part of it . " At length , to break the mournful silence and to express the sympathy they might not speak , the band struck up a requiem for the dying marshal  --  the melancholy strains rose and fell in prolonged echoes over the field , and swept in softened cadences on the ear of the fainting warrior  --  but still Napoleon moved not . They then changed the measure to a triumphant strain , and the thrilling trumpets breathed forth their most joyful notes , till the heavens rung with the melody . Such bursts of music had welcomed Napoleon as he returned flushed with victory , till his eye kindled in exultation ; but now they fell on a dull and listless ear . It ceased , and again the mournful requiem filled all the air . But nothing could arouse him from his agonizing reflections-his friend lay dying , and the heart he loved more than his life was throbbing its last pulsations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eulogy on Napoleon was that scene . That noble heart which the enmity of the world could not shake , nor the terrors of a battle.fleld move from its calm reposes nor even the hatred and insults of his , at last , victorious enemies humble ; here sunk in the moment of victory before the tide of affection . What military chieftain ever mourned thus on the field of victory , and what soldiers ever loved a leader so ? " Noble soul ! magnanimous spirit ! afflicted chief ! - how much to be pitied ! " here sunk before the tide of affection ! " " Vive l'Empereur ! " How cruel the fate which // called for the sacrifice of poor General Duroc , so unexpected , so unavoidable ! It was probably intended that we should cry here . This Napoleon-this " victor at the rate often thousand men a day , " as General Moreau called him-this destroyer of more than five millions of the human race  --  and here , in violation of the most solemn treaties , driving on in his bloody course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fallen friend Jonathan , or like a tender parent lamenting for a son whom a ruthless hand unseen and unprovoked has torn away . The whole scene , of which we have given only the conclusion , has a ridiculous look . It is in keeping with the profound duplicity of the man who through his whole career , would have the world believe , that he was a meek apostle of peace , bent only on obtaining his inalienable rights , and who could talk in plaintive tones of the suffering that " ought to inspire princes with the love of peace , and horror of war . " But if it was not a mere performance on the part of theEmperor , we wonder if conscience had not something to do with his grief-if he saw only his dying friend before him-if the shade of the murdered Duke of Enghien  --  the ghosts of the victims of Pavia , and of the prisoners of Jaffa , and those from some of his hundred battle-fields , did not flit before him , accusing him of his crimes and beckoning him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrors of his own conquests-by the bloody sacrifices yet to be made to his ambition , and the shadows of another life darkening his soul , that " stern heart " was not wrung with the pangs of remorse ! If the feeling exhibited by Napoleon on this occasion , was a natural gush of affection for a dying friend , how much ought it to relieve his towering selfishness or mitigate the sentence of impartial history ? No man is so far sunk in crime as to be destitute of every feeling of humanity . A whole monster is not to be found in human shape . Without falsifying history , by the use of a little art , and the play of a little fancy , Cain , Jezebel , Herod , or Judas Iscariot , might be made to appear interesting on certain occasions . The most infamous characters of profane history , afford some trait or accomplishment on which the eye may rest without abhorrence . Nero excelled in the elegant arts of music and poetry , and he was by nature averse to the shedding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice and infamy , " won the favor of the people by his graceful person and popular address , and he " may be praised for his lenity towards the Christians . " " The Nero of Popes " was zealous in the cause of the church , and not wanting in natural affection for his son Cnesar . Robespierre was fond of pictures , and so strictly honest that he was called the incorruptible . Even Satan , as Milton describes him , was not a fiend without a mark of a better nature . " His form had not yet lost All its original brightness , nor appeared Less than archangel ruined , and the excess Of glory obscured . " He could mourn for his fallen mates as well as Napoleon . " And his eye , but cast Signs of remorse and passion , to behold The fellows of his ci'ime , the followers rather condemned Forever now to have their lot in pain . " And " Tears such as angels weep burst forth We think Mr. Headley has not been very successful , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his heroes , owing not so much to his fault as to his misfortune , in having scanty materials for the production of biographical portraiture . The distinguished qualities of the whole group of marshals , are sufficient to make but one striking picture . Of course , this // gallery of military chieftains is filled by the multiplication of a single piece . In spite of forced distinctions , labored antitheses , favorable points of observation , and the implied stupidity of those who can not see the difference-Murat , with the exception of his black whiskers , purple pantaloons , yellow boots and white plume , seems just like Ney , and Ney just like Murat-Victor like Mortier , and Mortier like Victor - Sachet like Soult , and Soult like Sachet , and so on to the end of the chapter . Davoust at Auerstadt , Lannes at Ratisbon , Murat at Borodino , McDonald at Wagram , Dessaix at Marengo , Ney conducting the retreat from Moscow , or leading the old guard at Waterloo , present no variety of character-they are the same dashing , thundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality the same cruel , revengeful , blood-thirsty men  --  and from each field of conquest , there comes , to claim our praise , the same terrible shape , begrimmed with smoke and powder , besmeared with blood , and brandishing in fiendish triumph the same reeking sword . We must in conclusion , express deep regret , that a writer of Mr. Headley 's ability-one , too , who treads the " Sacred Mountains " - should have employed his powers in the production of this eulogy of warriors , which is as well fitted to stimulate the love of martial glory , as one of Buonaparte 's proclamations . It is in vain for its apologists to deny this tendency , or to frown upon the critic who dares to assert it . It may be as fruitless for us to be concerned about the public taste for such stimulating , camp food , or to express that concern on these pages ; but there is sometimes consolation in speaking out , if it is only for conscience ' sake . The appearance of this book is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their estimate of military honors . Some people are getting tired of this shouting about the mighty chiefs of war , and of the quick succession of volumes celebrating their exploits . They are beginning to think that these lusty old heroes have long enough " swallowed all the glory up ; " and that it is time better men should have a share ; - that some other distinction should be coveted than to be pointed out as the " killer of Tecumseh " - than to have it said , there goes one who belonged to the " army of occupation " - there goes one who was wounded at " Palo Alto " - there goes one who fought at " Fort Polk ! " - that , there are arts , as well as arms - heroic virtues in still life as well as in the camp ; - that war-gods have sat too long in Christian templeswar-priests too long offered them sacrifice ; - that some other rite than the " baptism of blood , " should be administered to the young men , starting in the career of ambition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially their prince , Napoleon ; since " he has fought his last battle " - since his body rests in the tomb of the Invalides , let his shade if it must always come in hollow armor , breathing the incantation that bound the world , rest too , unlamented , uninvoked ! There are signs of coming changes which every author should hail and proclaim - signs in the objects of government , the legislation of states , the terms of national intercourse , the policy of cabinets , the progress of things , the tolerance of the strong towards the weak , the concession of selfish claims for the general good , and in the spreading abhorrence of all war and of all the glory of war . there is a faint ray of hope streaking the political sky of this republic , even in its miserable plight in the eye of the world-engaged in an aggressive war with a neighboring state , weak and broken , and chiefly interesting from the fact that she has caught a spark or two of that liberty which is deposited with this people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees more glowing signs - seen first in the vision of prophets and displayed under the divine sanction-signs of the coming sway of the kingdom of righteousness and peace . An orator says of the vast possessions of Great Britain , held by an endless chain of military posts , that her " morning drum-beat , following the sun and keeping company with the hours , encircles the earth daily , in one continuous and unbroken strain of the martial airs of England . " Faith exults in view of the time when another song , following the sun and keeping company with the hours , will encircle the earth daily in one unbroken strain , the song heard at the advent of the Prince of Peace , sung by angelic choirs , " Peace on earthgood will to men ! "
