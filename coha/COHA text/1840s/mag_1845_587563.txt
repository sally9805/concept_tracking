txt BUT this unfitness and unseasonableness of studies are not our worst sins . Common as it is to overtax the mind by severity , it is , if possible , still more common to overwhelm it by multiplicity of studies . Great evil is undoubtedly resulting to education from the number and variety of subjects that solicit the student 's attention . Since the beginning of the present intellectual era , sciences have multiplied so much , that we may now say of them what was once said of books . There have come to be so many things of which we think we must learn a little , that we can afford time to learn but a little of anything . Streams for us to fish in have got so abundant , that we go chasing from one to another , contenting ourselves with a few " glorious nibbles " in each , but catching nothing . We seem , often , to think it enough , to place ourselves where the words of knowledge may visit the ear , and form themselves in the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we acquire a sort of tip-of-the-tongue knowledge , and the language of intelligence comes to drop from our mouths as fluently , and almost as thoughtlessly , as words *lrop from the niouth of a parrot . We do not so much learn to think , as to make others believe we have thought , by smattering and smuggling the thoughts of others . Among us practical men , a certain stump or drawingroom flippancy , or counting-house dexterity , is , for most part , the beau-ideal of intelligence . This may , indeed , be a good enough way to develope the tongue ; and such knowledge may be justly called a co et preterea nihil : but we should recollect , that if the tongue grow too large it will push out the brains . He who would stub and totter slowly along beneath a full head , can , of course , hop , and skip , and dance to admiration beneath an empty one . To say this is not education is not enough ; it unfits us for education : for it takes away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leaves us without either knowledge or docility . It is curious to observe how much false philosophy , as well as practical error , there is on this subject . People not only act , but speak as if each study were exercise but for a single faculty of the mind ; they therefore huddle together as many studies as they can reckon up different susceptibilities . It requires but a moment 's reflection to see that the very reverse of this is the true course ; for the business of education is , to form the mind , not to fill it ; - not to accumulate stores , but to build up a capacity . Its whole process , therefore , may be expressed in two words , development and discipline . To unfold , and deepen , and strengthen the faculties , is the first and last of its duty ; and it is by concentration , not by dispersion of them , that this is to be done . Non multa , sed multum , is , undoubtedly , the best maxim that was ever given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things we learn something about , but how much we learn about one thing , that determiiies our real progress . To exercise all the faculties on one subject is infinitely better than to exercise one of the faculties on all subjects , for the latter only tends to mar that harmony and integrity of mind from which true wisdom springs . Surely , too , everybody must know that when we attempt to look over many things , we can not look into , or look through , any of them . In the words of Bishop Taylor , a mind entertained with several objects is intent upon neither , and , therefore , profits not . One subject thoroughly understood-exhausted-is far better than fifty , or five hundred , subjects merely glanced at and guessed at ; for the habit of glancing and guessing thus formed , casts a blight on whatever promise there may have been of something better . Neatness , precision and depth of thought , in a very limited sphere , involve such a development and discipline of mind as will best prepare us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no field so narrow but that it has an infinite extension upwards ; and he who piles thought upon thought , within a very small circle , will of course , build nuch higher and much drmey than he who scatters himself and his efforts over all creation . To disperse the faculties , then , over a multitude of studies , is to dissipate , not discipline , the mind ; a course that tends only to make scatter-brains and mountebanks and blue-stockings . The lung pull , and strong pull , and pull altogeth*r , of all the powers , is what brings success and triumph . It is at the focus and convergence of all the faculties that their power becomes effectual , so that the object kindles and blazes up into Ihe light , of true intelligence . Separate any one of the elementary rays from the solar combination , and there is no light about it , but only darkness and discoloration . Our first business , then , plainly is , to fix upon some subject that will give due exercise to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . developed , and then to bring them all to bear upon it , so as not merely to see it , but to see into it , and see through it  --  to separate it into its parts , and reproduce it as a whole . It would not be unsafe to assert , that generally , and within very moderate limits , the quality of an education will be in inverse proportion to the quantity of studies pursued . In the best European institutions , where education is now carried to greater perfection , perhaps , than at any other place or time whose voice has reached us , young men spend the best part of seven or eight years on three studies ; while , among us democrats , lads and misses , too green to be trusted away from home , must despatch three times as many studies in about one-third of the time . Parents have boasted to us , that their sons , before the age of twelve , had read through more Latin books than we ever read in . Upon inquiry , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing creatuVes mankind have become by crossing the Atlantic Ocean ! If they go as much farther west , matters will doubtless be completely reversed , and men will be wi*est at birth . Of the teachers who lack the power to detect , or the principle to furbid , such pract.ices , of course nothing is to be said . VOL . XVII. - NO . LXXXV . Doubtless they labor for wages , and are too philanthropic to peril their own interest by holding back their pupils . So great , indeed , and so general is this rage for quickness and universality of scholarship , that it has deeply vitiated our means of education . Almost all our popular text-books are purposely made superficial , to meet our unnatural and extravagant demands . The utmost efforts are constantly put forth to divest them of that wholesome severity which makes it impossible to proceed in them without insight and understanding . They are not so much aids and stimulants to thought as substitutes fur it . It is doubtless grateful to our indolence , to think that knowledge is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made too easy , it ceases to be knowledge : and so much has been done of late to make knowledge easy , that it is truly high time something were done to make it bard ; for nothing can be vainer than the notion that it may be had without work . As teachers we have , ourselves , been plagued with books so outrageously easy , that they could not possibly be understood . Do we not know how much easier it is to grasp a club , than a grain of silk ? and that if we attenuate things into spider 's web , they become so very easy , as to be invisible ? If we wish to feed the mind , we had best give it something big enough and hard enough to masticate . Nature , ( and she is the best teacher and textbook we know of ) nowhere attempts to instruct us with perfectly simple sub .. stances . All her works are highly complex ; nay , they are instructive chiefly in virtue of their complexity : and a mind at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree genial in its structure and movements , is rather blown out than fed by perfect simplicity of object . Even the air we breathe is a compound substance ; analyze it into its constituents , and it will kill us . How many teachers have felt themselves encumbered with the help of our popular text-books , it is of course impossible to tell ; that some have , there is no sort of doubt . For students will not , perhaps can not , stop to understand a thing , when they can recite through the whole without understanding it . It is like attempting to chew water ; we can not choose but swallow it without grinding ; and if we try to chew it , it runs either out of our mouth , or down 4 .. // our throat . We speak with the more positiveness on this subject , because we speak from bitter experience . The truth is , we may as well despair at once of ever seeing a railroad to the land of knowledge ; and while there are so many railroads which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trudge slowly and painfully thither on their own feet , as mankind always have done , and always must do . It is only of its own free , vital activity , that the mind can be either enriched or invigorated ; and our case is nearly hopeless when the natural stimulants to effort are turned into narcotics . All true knowledge implies growth and development of mind ; and that sort of knowledge , which can be taught by book or voice , and passively received into the memory , is as worthless as it is easy . Even the contents of memory must be taken up and reproduced by the free activity of higher powers , before they deserve the name of knowledge ; for it is just as impossible that another should think for us , as that another should digest for us : and if our food be digested before we eat it , it will not feed us at all , but only starve us to death . Of our so much puffed and boasted facilities of education , we may safely say , that instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indolent . Intellectually and morally we are all of us born into a wilderness , where each has to cut and pave his own road . To acquire strength , and skill , and courage for this task , is , indeed , our chief errand here . Of course others can lend encouragement and guidance to our efforts ; but they can no more supersede them , than they can do our eating and sleeping for us . The only true course , therefore , for students , is , first , to do one thing ; to do it . They will thereby gain strength and skill to do many things , so that they will really do more things , within a reasonable length of time , by first perfecting one , than by doing at a multitude at once and thus perfecting none . The purpose of education is , universality of mind , not universality of acquirement ; the former is practicable , the latter is not even possible : and universality of mind comes rather by singleness than by multiplicity of subject . A Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Parr puts but a fraction of his being into a cart-load of volumes ; and a para graph of the former is worth a volume of the latter . If a waste of time and means were the worst result of this course , it would be comparatively harmless . But such is by no means the case . For , as we have already said , it takes away docility without giving knowledge , and drives out no-understanding to make room for mis-understanding . In other words , it leaves people in a sort of iutellectual half-way house , without power either to finish their journey or to return home . Botching and blundering could be borne much better , if they did not tend to make confirmed botchers and blunderers . The marring of the work were a trifling matter , if it did not mar the workmen . Ignorance is at least silent , but misknowledge is always voluble , and very honestly thinks it is showing its wealth when only exposing its poverty. ; that is , it makes people conspicuous the wrong way . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a dangerous thing ; " for it takes men away from the light of nature without delivering them over to the light of reason , and leaves them in a state of spiritual betweenity , with too much pride to walk , and too little strength to fly .. The darkness of mere instinct is obviously better than the twilight of half-knowledge : since the former , along with realities , hides the ghosts , and goblins , and bug-bears , and humbugs , with which such twilight peoples them. - There are , it is said , three classes of people in this country : a large class in total darkness ; a still larger class in twilight ; and a small class in daylight . Those in total darkness of course do not see the humbugs amongst us at all those in daylight see through them , and therefore despise them ; those in twilight see them , and are marvellouslydelighted with them . But this is not all . In this age of Fastidious Feeble-xvits , surely all must know what1 Bellesletterism , or literary Brummelism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generated , is not so well known , and we have been trying to explain it . Like its twin sister , Fashion , it is " gentility running away from vulgarity , and afraid of being overtaken by it : a sure sign that they are not far asunder . " As fashion is the art of wearing clothes purely on their own account , so bellesletterism is the art of speaking merely for the sake of speaking . The dandiprat and the ticklebrain // are the same soul , or rather want of soul , done up , now in cloth , now in words . Both imply a sort of inverted heroism ; the heroism of vanity perfected into negation or oblivion of self . The lip-blossom and dress-wearing gentry are the two-fold efflorescence of vanity , and agree in sacrificing truth to taste ; excellence to elegance ; whatever , in short , is to be looked into , for something to be looked at . Of course these bellesletterists are vastly given to flirtation with books ; a pursuit which probably has fewer recommendations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Human life does not need the embellishment of literary coquetry . Flirts , as all most know , are those whose hearts are so full of self-love as to leave no room for the love of anybody or anything else ; bookflirts differ from others only in the direction , not the nature , of the passion : and the surest way to make them is , to feed the vanity of people with the shows of knowledge , without jostling or disturbing it with the substance . True intelligence never feels itself above the proper tasks and services of human life ; on the contrary , it always raises them up to itself . Those who are merely taught to flirt and coquet with knowledge , are of course always the last to get married to it . The best way , moreover , to keep people from babbling and blue-stockingism is , to give them something to say ; for knowledge , like virtue , sufficeth unto itself , and rather shuns , than courts alliance with euphuism . He who has ideas will use language only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will use it as a substitute for them ; and it takes far fewer words to express ideas , than to hide the want of them , Nor is this the worst . This frivolous bellesletterism , bad as it is , is far better than sneering sciolism . Now , he who is carefully taught to understand as fast and as far as he goes , will not readily forget to go no faster or farther than he understands . The very labor of penetrating through a subject makes him feel his ignorance of subjects over which he has not labored . Having foundthe heart of one object , he takes for granted that other objects are something more than skin . Knowing a few things , he therefore knows himself ignorant of many things . Having found a little light , he can of course distinguish light from darkness ; and therefore is in no danger of benighting others , when he means to enlighten them . 1-lence genuine knowledge al* ways begets intellectual modesty ; for such knowledge knows the depth of its objects , and therefore distrusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , he who has never looked beneath the outside of a subject , of course , thinks he understands every subject whose outside he has seen . From studying nothing but the surface of things , he gets to presume that things themselves are nothing but surface . Equally ignorant of all , he therefore conceives himself equally master of all . A Newton , after " visiting the outskirts of creation , and carrying the torch of discovery round the universe , " shall bear a heart as humble as the child that kneels beside its mother to repeat the infant 's prayer . Though competent to originate what scarce any others are competent to understand , he shall yet bow with reverential awe before that book which an adroit and flip .. pant Voltaire shall scoff at with shameless effrontery . But my Lord Surface must perforce wed my Lady Heartless ; and Contempt , and Flippancy , and Presumption spring from the match at a birth . It is not strange , therefore , that a Voltaire , or a Paine , should boldly rush in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He , the man without eyes , is never dazzled by the sun , not he ! Thus it is , that moral blindness and recklessness , and worthlessness , naturally spring from intellectual shallowness . " Through the empty house the wind roars loudest . " Fill up the drum , and it loses its great voice . Such , too , is the way that incipient mental instruction moulds and fashions the whole character . Surely , if it is not good for the soul to be without knowledge , it is far worse for it to have but the show and conceit of knowledge . It is not to be denied or concealed , however , that such is not always the result . There are minds of so much constitutional modesty , that pride and presumption find no place in their character . But in these cases the results , though less disgusting , are scarcely less unfortunate . Instead of conceit and inflation , there spring up a distrust of his powers , a vacillation of purpose , and a trembling apprehensiveness of mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the aid of crutches and stays . Having no sufficient roots of his own , he becomes a mere parasite , and attaches himself to the nearest , perhaps the meanest thing he may find . having experienced , perhaps , the instability of his foundations , he either builds not high enough to shelter himself , or lives in perpetual dread of dilapidation . What is really a defect of education , he attributes to a defect of nature ; and ceases aspiring to he a man , because he has never been developed into the form of a man . Not having vigor and independence of mind enough to think for himself , he most of course have his thinking done up at his hands ; and thus stands at the mercy of those who have the power or the presumption to manufacture opinions for such as are weak enough to patronise them . Irresolute , indecisive , impotent , having no centre of his own , and describing no orbit of his own , he stands ready to become the satellite of any one who has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equally capable , perhaps , of being made a tool for good or for evil ends , he is far more apt to be used for the latter ; for those who have virtue enough to pursue good ends , have too much respect for human nature to use it as a tool for any end . In short , it is easy to see that self-dependence and self-reliance , however liable to abuse , are indispensable to excellence . Assuredly , there is no ignorance so mischievous or so deplorable , as that which springs from false or shallow instruction . With our load of responsibilities to carry , it is infinitely wiser and better to confine our movements to a rod of genuine known solidity , than attempt to walk over acres or miles of mere vapor But let us not be understood to encourage the forming of low and limited hopes . It matters not how high and beautiful our hopes are , provided the ground we select for the.ir basis be not so soft as to prove their grave . Assuredly , it is not always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lowest hopes are delusive and extravagant to him who builds on the sand . But we should remember , that if the world has many sand-banks , it has also many rocks ; nay , that the sand-banks themselves rest upon rocks ; which , if we but patiently and perseveringly dig , we shall be sure to find . In instruction we say , therefore , be cautious , be thorough , be deep , be anything rather than hasty and shallow . Be wise , be judicious in selecting the means ; be constant and faithful in employing them ; and then wait , hopefully but patiently , for the result . Education , we repeat , is not a merc manufacture , to be hastened and cheapened by labor-saving machinery ; nor is it a mere superficial figure , to be fashioned and polished from without ; but a development from within ; a vital growth , an organic evolution of the germs which nature has wrapped up in the human constitution . Nor , yet , is it the quick product of any hot-house vegetation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human life and action , where the suns , and rains , and tempests of human experience may all contribute their wholesome and invigorating influences . In the art of education , our best guides are the manifold beautiful analogies which nature in her workings is ever affording us . Now , nothing but mushrooms and toadstools grow to perfection in a night ; amid the rest of their existence is spent in dying and rotting . The largest and beautifulest flowers are generally those whose riches and beauties have longest slumbered invisible in the bud : did they unfold themselves sooner , it were only becs use they had less to unfold . It must be a bloating , and no true growth , that immediately swells the infant up to the size and stature of a man ; should we see it growing thus , we should take for granted that death was near . Fruit does not ripen till it has ceased to grow ; ripening prematurely , it must prematurely fall : and its precocity at once mars its quality , and hastens its decay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind ; for you will thereby only stunt and impoverish the inward growth . Feed the mind as carefully as you feed the body , and even then you may count yourself fortunate if the former come to manhood as soon as the latter . The business of education is , not to supplant or supersede nature , but simply to aid and encourage her growth and development . We may lend assistance and alleviation to her labors ; we may furnish her with strength to endure and peribrmn them ; but we can provide no substitute for them . Even if we would // guide her advances , we must first be guided by them . We must lead her movements by first watching their direction , then stepping before her , and clearing the road for her progress . Any attempt to change her course will but check , perhaps stop her advances . We need but clear the path of her own choosing from obstructions , and screen her progress from collateral deflections . Above all we should guard against attempting to kill that which , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or be transformed , and appear in a shape of beauty and excellence . Even the suckers can not always be pulled without injury to the principal stalk ; and , if left to themselves , will often die down into nourishment for that which is better . The mind , in short , must be left in the soil of nature , that garden of God . We may pull away the weeds , to let in the sunshine and the breeze ; we may gather around it the aliment of truth , and water it with the dews of affection ; but we must not attempt to transplant it . What though its first up-springing be unlovely and unpromising , nevertheless touch it not ; despair of it not : all the colors and riches of Paradise are sleeping in its bosom ; and a little fostering patience , a little of the awakening sunshine of love , will in due time disclose the heavenly dower ! Various figures have been employed to illustrate the process of education , the only objection to which is , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , the mind has been compared to a vessel , into which knowledge is to be poured , as water is poured into a cistern . Again , it has been likened to a store-house , in which ideas , or bundles of ideas , nicely done up arid labeled , are to be stowed away , to be called into use as occasion may require . Now these expressions not only convey no truth , but they convey positive error , and , what is worse , practical error . The mind is not a cistern to be filled , but a principle to be developed . Education is not a stuffing-in , but a drawing-out ; not a filling-up from without , but an evolution from within . The mind is not to be jugified into a receptacle of intelligence , but openedout into a perennial , up-gushing fountain of intelligence ; a well of thought springing up into everlasting truth . It must be made to think , to originate and i3sue thoughts , not merely to receive and circulate them . What we want is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given subject or set of subjects , stowed away for occasional use , but the power to seize , to appropriate and expound the truth on whatever subject may come before us . In brief , we want , not stored-up cargoes of thoughts , but the faculty of thinking closely , severely , profoundly . Truth , or facts containing truth , must indeed be presented to the mind , but only that the mind may take up , and assimilate , and incorporate the truth with itself ; for the mind is essentially veriform , and grows but by absorbing truth . We may lumber in facts , nothing is easier than to lumber in facts , till we suffocate the mind 's assimilative power , and leave it without insight to distinguish , or comprehension to unite them . In this way a man may , perchance , if he be all memory , become a mere walking library ; but a keensighted , far-seeing , truth-discerning intelligence he can not become . Talk not , therefore , of enveloping the student in an encyclopedia of ' objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the very light that is to render its contents discernible . First give the student an eye to see for himself and then he will find nature an infinite and everlasting encyclopedia . Stuff him not with a cargo of mere remembered , hear-say truths , to prattle about and trade with in the business of life , but discipline him into that depth and ubiquity of insight , which , meeting truth everywhere , face to face , may always discern and embrace her as an allsufficient , omnipresent friend and guide . From what has been said , the proper materials and method of instruction may doubtless be easily inferred . The basis of all right education must of course be laid in severe intellectual discipline ; for keenness and clearness of vision are the key to all true knowledge . The perceptive and reflective powers must first be drawn out into vigorous , healthful activity . It is this training and initiating of the intellect , which gives both insight to discern and comprehension to grasp the principles of things-which enables the mind to strip off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lay bare its living laws ,  --  it is this which brings success , and the want of which brings defeat , on all our other means of education . But intellectual discipline is not all . There is a much wider and // deeper culture , a far broader and higher discipline , which embraces our whole many-sided being , and of which intellectual discipline is but the corner-stone , altogether indispensable , indeed , but altogether insufficient . It is a discipline of humanity , producing a confluence and co-operation of all the feelings and faculties in one and the same movement . The perceptive , reflective , creative , sensitive , and elective powers should all be drawn out into harmony and convergence . It is this blending and interfusion of all the rays , that produces the pure white light of a well-cultivated mind . Besides , it is vain to disclose noble objects to the mind , unless , at the same time , we give it noble impulses . And in the crowded markets of the world , skill to select is quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth before the eye of the soul , avails not , unless it have a faculty to converse with the heavens ; for it is only by the stars that we can direct our course aright on the earth , and nothing less than the everlasting sun can give us light sufficient even for our worldly pursuits . The severe , elective energy of a well-disciplined taste , and the perfusive , vivifying grace of a *vell-disciplined imagination , are really among the usefulest as well as beautifulest results of human culture . For it is as important to discern the social and moral fitnesses of things , as to perceive their relations ; to recognize " the Power , the Beauty , and the Majesty " of nature , as to trace her laws and connections . The follies and failures of men spring quite as often from want of sentiment , as from want of understandino and the richest ores that lie about us are useless without the fire of noble passions to burn off the dross from the precious substance . To converse with the higher objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be dignified in submission and humble in command ; to be modest in prosperity , and self-reverent in adversity ; to be inflexibly , just without cruelty , and unflinchingly brave without audacity ; to meet the just courtesies of society without scanting our duties to ourselves ; and to recognize the divine beauty of human life without forgetting the fearful guilt and degradation of human character : - all this , assuredly , requires the intervention of other faculties than the mere understanding . To quicken , therefore , and subdue the feelings ; to temper yet intensate the passions ; to chasten , and beautify , and enrich the imagination ; to give energy and discrimination to the taste ; and to unfold that indefinable power of sentiment which acts with almost the quickness and sureness of instinct ; - these are really as necessary as to deepen and strengthen the intellect , and are essential parts of that profound and comprehensive discipline which every just and generous plan of education contemplates . The means of mere intellectual discipline are as various as the objects of human knowledge . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most perfect in resl ) ect of the understanding alone ; but then they are the most imperfect in respect of the co-ordinate faculties , and their unfitness for purposes of general discipline lies in their tendency to make mere abstractionists and d ialecticians . Their relation to various arts and sciences of course renders a knowledge of them indispensable as a preparation for certain branches of professional labor ; but as a discipline of humanity , in the proper sense of the term , they are rather a hindrance than a help . For the evenness and entireness of culture , of which we have been speaking , the experience of several centuries has fully tested , and , doubtless , permanently assigned the study of the Greek and Latin Classics . Whether as an introduction to the study of modern literature , or as " eternal forms of the human mind , " they evidently merit the unquestionable and almost unquestioned d ictinction they have attained . To a profound and generous culture , they have long been , and must long continue to be , indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what time has set up innovation does not easily blow down ; the experience of ages is not easily set aside by the theories of a day ; and the latter , various as they have been , have as yet offered no practicable escape from the former . But , aside from this consideration , the Greek language and literature itself is , perhaps , the most perfect transcript of the human mind in existence . The mastery of it probably involves a more thorough and universal discipline than any other single study whatever . Itself a full-length portrait of our many-gifted nature ; the world 's excelling model , // both of thought and of style , both of grace and of power ; the mould in which the mind of modern nations has shaped , and the mirror in which it has dressed itself ; the awakening and creative genius of modern civilisation , and the shaping and informing spirit of modern culture ; the study of it , in its principles and its structure , affords at once a full development of almost everything within us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was when the minds of both sexes were first formed by the mastery of this divine language , and then enriched from the store-house of nature herself ; when Homer , and Plato , and Sophocles , and Demosthenes , formed at once the labor of the closet and the entertainment of the chamber ; and when they supj ) lied the places both of our fashionable novels and of our useful-knowledge libraries , that England produced her loveliest women and her wonderfulest men . Whether , therefore , we consult the reason of the thing , or the results of general experience , or the suifrages of the most competent judges , we may safely assert that , aside from the mathematics and strictly elementary branches of English education , the study of the Classics alone might be substituted , with far less cost and far more profit , for the whole long array of studies and text-books and professorships which swell the catalogues of our academies and colleges . After the mind has been thoroughly formed and disciplined by these studies , the inexhaustible stores of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain . It can then go nowhere without meeting splendid visions , and search nowhere without finding precious gems . In short , the mind will then have , itself , the key to the whole panorama of nature , and science , and art ; and can select and appropriate , at will , such treasures as are most consonant to its taste , or most essential to its aims . In regard to the proper method of instruction , we have room to say but little . In this age of abstractions , the great trouble with most teachers is , that they aim to instruct , not individual minds , but only the abstract idea of a mind . The alleged necessity ofeducating all , forces us upon a thousand shifts and expedients for shortening and cheapening the process . In our rage for system , we must have not only the matter , but even the manner of instruction reduced to formularies ; it is so much cheaper and quicker to turn and tend some teaching machine , gotten up on scientific principles , than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into saints , and dunces into sages , by machinery ; else how can we work fa*t enough to satisfy our huge philanthropy ? A knave can distribute tracts as well as a saint , provided he be paid for it ; and with a suitable contrivance , such as modern wisdom profi*rs , a dunce can teach as well asa sage . Surely , then , a scheme that should supersede the necessity of saintship and sageship , would be a most valuable ncquisition ! Doubtless we have laid Providence under vast obligations by our systematic patronage . There are those who seem to think that even Christianity lay bound up in the crysalis until our scientific researches and philosophical speculations hatched her out into the butterfly . Within our own recollection , system after system has been proposed , all equally arrogant , and all equally impotent , yet seeking votes by showing immediate results , and whose only effect has been to cultivate a passion for system , in a sphere where all systematic operations must perforce be worse than useless . It would , doubtless , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be devised , to educate the abstract idea of a mind , and which the most ordinary hand could turn and tend as well or better than the most extraordinary head . What with our system of black-boards , and text-books with questions , and approved code of pedagogy , have not dunces , always so plenty , and sages , always so scarce , been brought nearly to the same level for all practical purposes ? One very obvious advantage of this method is , that it dispenses with all personal sympathy , and acquaintance between teacher and pupil . One man can thus teach five hundred without even knowing their names , as well as he can teach twenty with a full knowledge of their individual characters ; and , in this way , increase the profits to himself , while diminishing the costs of his employers . To preclude the necessity of discrimination in finding and rewarding teachers , by thus locating their qualifications in their pockets and schoolrooms , is certainly a glorious achievement ; glorious alike for // its economy and its benevolence . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , under this dispensation , pupils soon become wise enough to govern themselves . Happily , the system of pedagogical pufi*ry , inseparable from this state of things , has now nearly cracked it own cheeks ; and the fire , which threatens us , is fast getting smothered with its own smoke . Now , it so happens , unfortunately , that nature gives us no abstract ideas to educate , but only individual minds ; and it would be well for us to remember , that to educate the abstract idea of a mind , is , after all , but to exercise the abstract idea of education . The truth is , no person can possibly teach another , or be taught by another , until and so far as they are personally and individually acquainted with each other . In vain do we try to secure good instruction by systematic arrangements ; the same system which takes from teachers the power to go *vrong , also makes it impossible for them to go right . The sooner , therefore , we throw our abstractions into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better . Our schoolroom clock-work not only does nothing towards supplying the place of brains to teachers who have them not , but is sure to obstruct and paralyze the brains of teachers who have them . The teacher and pupil can give and receive instruction , just so far and no farther than they are brought to study and know each other . An immediate intercourse , therefore , between them is indispensable ; and the teacher is but separated from the pupils by the media through which he tries to operate . A mind can not possibly be produced in the same way as a watch . Mechanical arrangements can not assist the process of vegetation . The apparatus , by which we try to stretch a tree , will only pull it up by the roots ; so that we shall only make it look taller by stunting or killing it . In short , our abstract method is a perfect outrage on nature , and can not choose but miseducate . We might as well have all our coats cut to a common shape , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then fill out or pare down our bodies to lit the coats . But in this matter all of course know that the dress is to be fitted to the form , not the form to the dress . And undoubtedly that method of instruction is best , which most adapts itself to the wants and peculiarities of its subjects . The true teacher is an artist , not an artisan ; be works by inspiration , not by mechanism ; and to proceed by system is to degrade teaching from an art into a mere handicraft . It is with the teacher , as with the painter , whose subject , when he succeeds , always seems to paint itself ; and his work is never good for anything when he knows how he does it . It may even be questioned whether the dependence we place upon books is not worse than to be entirely without them ; just as the circulation of the Bible and of tracts is thought by many to have done injury , by seeming to preclude the necessity of the Church : and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that the true idea of instruction is well nigh lost . At all events , of this we may be assured , that true instruction always proceeds , and always must proceed , not by a fixed inflexible system , now shrinking or stretching , and now bending or straightening its subjects , to suit its own preadjustments ; but by " a slow , tentative process , requiring a patient study of individual aptitudes , and a oonstant variation of means to suit the endless varieties of mind . " A few words touching the utilitarian spirit , which has given birth to so much reforming and system-making , will close this article . Now , one of the greatest evils of utilitarianism in education is , that it is suicidal . " He who seeketh his life shall lose it , " is as good in philosophy as it is in religion ; and the seeming paradox , " he is oft the wisest man , who is not wise at all , " is one of the profoundest truths . Too much anxiety to hit the apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking too steadfastly at our interest , makes ns unable to see it . Viewed objectively , indeed , and in reference to the lastresults , there is no antipathy between the wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of the dove ; but , viewed subjectivery , they are as antipathic as heaven and hell . The darkest cunning and the whitest innocence doubtless converge to the same ultimate point ; but the crime and curse of the cunning is , that they never can see this . Self-interest comes by self-sacrifice ; but the spirit of selfinterest and the spirit of self-sacrifice are utterly incompatible . Truth , if honestly sought , will always do more for us than we can do for ourselves ; but when pursued as interest , the pur* // suit inevitably defeats itself . If we seek first the kingdom of heaven , all things else shall be added unto us ; but not if we seek the former for the sake of the latter . It is thus that we find our interest by forsaking it , and get salvation , here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become our own saviours , we utterly lose ourselves . In short , all salvation that is worth the having , comes by faith ; by faith in the Truth , not by foresight ; by oblivion , not by calculation , of interest . But the genius of utilitarianism of course aspires to a higher wisdom than is implied in working and waiting . Mammonism arid modern philanthropy must climb up some shorter way to their ends , than the straight and narrow path of truth and nature . Instead of asking for wisdom and getting riches , they ask for wisdom in order to get riches ; and of course miss , as they deserve to miss , them both . Nature , to preclude the pride or vanity of well-doing , has wisely . ordained , that the triumphs we gain in the service of truth should seem to us the truth 's work , not ours ; so that when we are doing the most good , we think we are doing the least , in the same way , and for a similar reason , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least conceit of wisdom . Accordingly , the most useful men are always those who , from love and holy passion , pursue what the world esteems useless . And their merit is generally as unknown to vs as to themselves ; for , to us as to themselves , what they do seems the work of truth and nature ; so that while bringing heaven down to us , they are often lost in the splendor of their gifts ; and the blessings we owe to their labors appear to come of their own accord . Probably nothing , on the other hand , has done so much mischief to education , as the exclusive desire to be useful ; for it is the misery and meanness of utilitarianism , that while calculating the profits of knowledge , it kills the passion for it . For example , the discovery of the occultations and emersions of Jupiter 's Satellites , after being made , was found available for purposes of navigation . But if the discov*rer had been in quest only of something to aid navigation . he probably would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore would not have found anything so useful for that purpose . The true reformer , in like manner , always becomes such without knowing it ; and those who set up for reformers , are generally the greatest pests and nuisances society is afflicted with . No men are so dark as those who are always trying to make their light shine ; for they always make their bellows so strong as to blow the fire out , instead of blowing it up . Their hard tugging for truth 's sake is but a more cunning form of conceit and selfwill , and proceeds not so much from a sense of obligation to truth , as from a desire to lay truth under obligation to them . Those who have deitmed their own ideas , of course think themselves qualified and commissioned to construct the world anew ; and many a strutting sophomore has conceived himself wise enough to convert the Pope , and has mistaken the swellings aud crowings of his own pride , for the expansion of the human mind under his instructions . Here , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , defeats itself . The true benefactor sheds out his influence unconsciously , and always loses it in proportion as he undertakes consciously to exercise it . Thus , nature cunningly hides from us the good we do , and wisdom , to prevent conceit and vanity , always steals into us , and steals out of us , without our knowledge . When we abandon ourselves to truth in love and faith , truth flows freely into us and through us , and heaven is with us in hours of self-oblivion , always finding us children , or making us so . Nothing , then , is vainer than attempting to substitute convictions of interest and utility for noble passions ; such convictions never can ensure , and never ought to ensure , the successful pursuit of knowledge or of any other good . We have ourselves lived to see study well nigh banished from the closet by the perverse efforts of certain moral and intellectual financiers to make out a balance of economical motives in its favor .. By forcing in such motives we only force out , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going so much on the belly , and seeking truth for the stomach 's sake , have they not yet learnt , that in the mouths of such seekers the fruits of the tree of knowledge always turn into ashes and bitterness ? It is truly high time the money-chantrers were scourged out of the temples . What // with our Paleys , and Benthams , and Franklins , and Biddies , the doctrine that " the chief end of man is , to serve and glorify Mammon , and to learn the art of buying and selling , " has been virtually tau gbt us , in one form or another , lung enough : it has mad&amp; us , out and out , a nation of MammonistsMaminonists in politics , Mammouists in education , 1*'Iammonists in morality , and Mammonists even in religion ! And does our practical wiseacre still keep saving , aim at the useful , aim at the useful ? Well now , our good sir , or our had sir , or our indifferent sir , we have heard enough of your everlasting cant about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you had it of the devil in the outset , and we hugely suspect you have not paid him for it yet : in heaven 's name , return to him before you have worn it all out . Aim at the useful ? Away with it ! Aim at the true , the beautiful , and the good , and we 'll risk but that you will be useful enough . Then God will use you ; now we suspect none hut Satan can use you . You are a clerk , we take it , in his trea sury department ; are you not in quest of pudding or praise , to fatten yourself or others with for his service ? or are you only hastening to pay him his old price for the kingdoms of this world ? At all events , please keep the snout of your sensualism or utilitarianism out of the pulpit , the chair , and the closet . True , true , the stomach says yet bacon , yet bacon ; and , sure enough , we must have bacon ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have even bacon ; and we reckon his word is nearly or quite as good as the stomach 's ! *Ve will end by simply remarking , that a passion for knowledge finds the pursuit thereof its own exceeding great reward , and therefore cleaves to it , and is satisfied with it . A calculation of profit , impatient of the pursuit , and anxious only for results , gets cheated , as it ought to he , by its own cunning into taking up with the appearance of results ; seeking , meanwhile , to abridge the process by resorting to system and machinery ; and hence the succession of improvements and reformations with which society has so long been cursed.
