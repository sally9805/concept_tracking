Prime , Benjamin Young , 1733-1791 : MEDITATION OVER A DYING PATIENT . from Muscipula sive Cambromyomachia : the mouse-trap 1840 I. Well ! I have done , I can no more , But must my baffled aim deplore ; I 'll lay my drugs and cordials by , For art is vain and he must die . II . When heaven demands a mortal 's breath , And fainting nature yields to death , Nor love nor art avails to save The tott'ring fabrick from the grave . III . But may I in this mirror see What I ere long must also be ! And while a pitied patient dies , Receive instruction and be wise . IV . Fix 'd is th ' unalterable date , Fix 'd as the firm decrees of fate ; ( And , O my soul ! it may be nigh , ) When heaven will call and I must die . V. In vain physicians may be near ; In vain my friends may drop a tear ; For medicines will not relieve , Nor love procure an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm arrest This throbbing movement in my breast , And spite of nature 's feeble strife , Victorious storm the seat of life . VII . Then must thou , O my soul ! obey Heaven 's high command to quit thy clay : Then must thou breathe thy final groan , And take thy flight to worlds unknown . VIII . But where , O where ! thy last abode ? In glory near the throne of God ? Or must thou ( O ! forever ) dwell , In the dark dismal shades of hell ? IX . Lord make me to myself a friend , To meditate my latter end ! Teach me the number of my days , And guide my feet in wisdom 's ways ; X. That when this tenement of clay Must sink to ruin and decay , I may to some blest mansion rise , A house eternal in the skies . Prime , Benjamin Young , 1733-1791 : PRAISE TO GOD FOR RESTORING GOODNESS . A PINDARICK ODE . from Muscipula sive Cambromyomachia : the mouse-trap 1840 A. D. 1757 . I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; With awe profound adore The wonders of his healing pow'r , With grateful joy let thy warm passions move ; Then to HIS name in lofty numbers raise A sacred song of solemn praise ; Who in a dangerous hour Preserv 'd of late thy life and lengthen 'd out thy days . II . Oft has He sav 'd my soul from death ; Borne up my sinking frame ; Restrain 'd my flying breath , And calm 'd the tumults of the vital stream ; When I 've lain wasted by some dire disease , While burden 'd nature found no ease , And I drew near the dead ; Oft has his hand sustain 'd my head , Sooth 'd all the sorrows of my bed , And made my anguish cease . His word pronounc 'd the high command , And his preserving hand , His hand omnipotent to save , Restor 'd me from the gloomy borders of the grave . III . But chief , my soul review The memorable night ; When death , grim tyrant , rose to view , Shook in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to th ' unequal fight , ) And aim 'd it at my heart : How trembling and aghast I stood , And felt past crimes my vitals gnaw , While all before mine eyes I saw The terrours of a broken law ; A slighted Saviour 's blood : And oh ! amazing sight ! Array 'd in piercing light , Insufferably bright , The dread tribunal of an angry God ! IV . And ah ! what tongue can tell , What agonizing pain my bosom tore ; While , as I thought the day of patience o'er , I saw heaven shut ! a yawning hell ! A frowning Judge ! a frowning Saviour too ! And in the pit below , Astonish 'd heard a fiery storm , Of wrath almighty roar ; Half felt the tortures of the deathless worm ; And in the horrid gloom , With dire amazement , read my doom To never  --  never  --  never-ending woe . V. But oh ! while thus a criminal I stood , By law condemn 'd to die , The prisoner of almighty wrath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my often injur 'd God , Repuls 'd the bold demands of death , And gave a kind reprieve : Bade me avoid the sinner 's road , His offer 'd grace receive , And spend my future life for him who spar 'd my breath . VI . And though the grisly foe , With all his gloomy terrours arm 'd , Has often since my trembling soul alarm 'd , Yet God has still his rage disarm 'd ; Nor would he give The tyrant leave , To strike the fatal blow : And while half victor in the strife , Of late , he almost triumph 'd o'er my life , And unrelenting , saw my kindred mourn ; My God compassionate as just The bands of my confinement burst , Redeem 'd my body from the dust , And bade my soul return : Untir 'd , his patience knows no bound , Amazing is his grace ! While three long years Have roll 'd their circles round , I 've stood a cumberer of the ground ; Have oft provok 'd him to his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbears . VII . Great God ! on such a stupid creature , why Dost show'r thy blessings down ; Who not deserves the notice of thine eye , And yet provokes thy frown ? I would review The kindness thou hast shown , With wonder and confusion too , How good art thou , O God ! but , how unthankful I ! Vast is the debt of gratitude I owe , For mercies great beyond the bounds of thought ; How should my bosom glow , With sacred flames , and bless the gentle blow Of thy chastising rod ! But ah ! my rebel heart Still acts a treacherous part , Forgets the wonders thou hast wrought , And wanders from my God . VIII . My God , subdue this heart of stone ; Melt all my stubborn passions down ; Each rebel-wish control ; By the chastisements thou hast giv'n , Embitter sin , and teach my soul Entire submission to the will of heav'n . To heavenly things exalt my cares , And from this world 's bewitching snares , O ! set my spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My breast , and set my heart on fire , With love and zeal and warm desire , To dedicate my life , and all my powers to THEE . Prime , Benjamin Young , 1733-1791 : AN ELEGY , On the death of Doct . Nathaniel Scudder , who was slain in a skirmish with a party of refugees , at Shrewsbury , New Jersey , October 16th , 1781. from Muscipula sive Cambromyomachia : the mouse-trap 1840 " Quis desiderio sit pudor nut modus " Tam cari capitis ? "  --  Horace . Poem section I. Scudder , my friend , art thou , dear man , no more ? Sad victim fall'n on Shrewsbury 's fatal plain ! Must I thy end so tragical deplore , In virtue 's cause by murd'rous traitors slain ? II . More splendid titles did thy name adorn , When thou , erewhile , with unremitting zeal , Didst losses , toils and dangers nobly scorn , A strenuous champion for the public weal . III . But oh ! the tender title Friend alone Can speak what language most expressive needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bemoan , Smarts with keen anguish and deep-wounded bleeds . IV . Let those who knew thy publick merits most , With wreaths of honour decorate thy urn ; With me , the patriot in the man is lost , And less my country , than my friend , I mourn . V. Friendship 's pure flame did in thy bosom glow , And a kind fervour to thy words impart ; While gentle manners shew 'd , thou well didst know , All the fine feelings of the social heart . VI . Thou dear companion of my early years ! I 'm taught , when I our former lives review , By heart-felt pangs and daily flowing tears , I ne'er before , how much I lov 'd thee , knew . VII . The paths of science we together trod , Ambitious rivals ; yet so kindly strove , That competition but endear 'd the road , And emulation fann 'd the fire of love . VIII . How did our souls a mutual passion prove , My brother Scudder , wonderful and rare ! If not less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' enraptur 'd lover and the fair . IX . How art thou fall'n , Scudder , highly priz 'd ; By what vile hands depriv 'd of vital breath ! A crew , of whom , whole hundreds sacrific 'd , Were not sufficient to avenge thy death . X. How art thou fall'n into death 's cruel jaws ! At an untimely date , a sudden prey : Just in the crisis of thy Country 's cause , Just at the dawn of her triumphant day . XI . High were thy hopes of our late conquest rais 'd , ( But thou , to see the great event , denied , ) When Washington 's meridian glory blaz 'd Eclipsing splendour on Cornwallis ' pride . XII . So , erst the giver of the Jewish law , To enter Canaan earnestly desir 'd ; But the good land from Nebo only saw , And on the top of Pisgah 's mount expir 'd . XIII . But the Supreme saw fit to call thee hence , Where thou , for freedom , hast so nobly striv'n ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear glad tidings to the court of heav'n . XIV . There , Scudder , thou , we trust , dost glorious reign , By trials , well for that bright world prepared ; Sharing from liberality divine , A faithful servant 's exquisite reward . XV . There , this great victory by thy country won , Well known ev'n there , shall thy glad songs employ ; And all the wonders God , for us , has done , Add still new raptures to celestial joy . XVI . There , O my Scudder , may I meet thee there , Where discord , war and desolation cease ; Where reigns complete tranquillity , and where All the blest world is harmony and peace  --  XVII . Where rules no tyrant ; from the common cause , Apostate spirits draw no trait'rous sword : But all unite t ' obey the righteous laws Of an Almighty and all-gracious LORD . XVIII . Where selfish aims , each gen'rous temper spurns , In concert sweet , the social passions move : Each heart with an exalted friendship burns , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sung thy friend , by fond affection mov 'd , To drop the tears of sorrow o'er thy urn : But soon , by conscious sentiment reprov 'd , Saw greater reason for himself to mourn . II . So bright , bless 'd shade ! thy deeds of virtue shine ; So rich , no doubt , thy recompense on high : My lot 's far more lamentable than thine , Thou liv'st in death , while I in living die . III . With great applause hast thou perform 'd thy part , Since thy first entrance on the stage of life ; Or in the labours of the healing art , Or in fair Liberty 's important strife . IV . In med'cine skilful , and in warfare brave , In council steady , uncorrupt and wise ; To thee , the happy lot thy Maker gave , To no small rank , in each of these to rise . V. Employ 'd in constant usefulness thy time , And thy fine talents in exertion strong ; Thou died'st advanc 'd in life , though in thy prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VI . But I , alas ! like some unfruitful tree , That useless stands , a cumberer of the plain ; My faculties unprofitable see , And five long years have liv 'd almost in vain . VII . While all around me , like the busy swarms , That ply the servent labours of the hive ; Or guide the state , with ardour rush to arms , Or some less great , but needful business drive . VIII . I see my time inglorious glide away , Obscure and useless like an idle drone ; And unconducive each revolving day , Or to my country 's int'rest or my own . IX . Great hast thou liv 'd and glorious hast thou died ; Though trait'rous villains have cut short thy days ; Virtue must shine , whatever fate betide , Be theirs the scandal , and be thine the praise . X. Then , to my soul thy memory shall be , From glory bright , as from affection , dear ; And while I live to pour my grief for thee , Glad joy shall sparkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too shall fire my breast ; If heav'n permit , with thee , again I 'll vie : And all thy conduct well in mine express 'd , Like thee I 'll live , though I like thee should die . Prime , Benjamin Young , 1733-1791 : THE DESPERATE WISH , OR MELANCHOLY EXTRAVAGANCE . from Muscipula sive Cambromyomachia : the mouse-trap 1840 A. D. 1760 . I. Tell me , ye Furies , where to find Some subterranean cave , Dark as the horrour of my mind , And silent as the grave . II . Where none but melancholy things Possess the dreary plains ; Where darkness spreads her raven-wings , And night perpetual reigns . III . Near some vast heap of ruins be The desolate abode ; Like those astonish 'd trav'lers see , Where ancient Babylon stood . IV . Rubbish should all deform the ground , And make a rueful show ; Wild brambles all the place surround , And nettles rampant grow . V. Dragons should there their stations keep , And wave their ragged wings ; There vipers hiss , foul lizards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voracious monsters there should stray , In quest of human gore ; There savage tigers howl for prey , And hungry lions roar . VII . There , perch 'd on each dry blasted oak , Should nest each rav'nous fowl ; There should the om'nous raven croak , There scream the odious owl . VIII . No arbours drest in living green , No groves should there be found ! Without a leaf each tree be seen , Without a flow'r the ground . IX . The yew alone and cypress there , In melancholy state , Should flourish sacred to despair , The emblems of my fate . X. No gentle zephyrs there should yield The calm refreshing breeze ; With silky pinions fan the field , Or gently curl the seas . XI . But winds with warring winds engage , And angry tempests roar ; While the tumultuous ocean 's rage Lashes the groaning shore . XII . No trickling rill should soothe mine ear , Or sparkle in mine eyes ; But putrid lakes lie stagnant there , And noxious vapours rise . XIII . Hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Should lie devoted to the dead , And guard their mould'ring bones . XIV . There mystick groans should pierce my ear , Prophetick of my doom ; There frowning spectres should appear And stalk amid the gloom . XV . No place should such fair objects gain As suit a jovial taste ; But ghastly desolation reign , Through all the dismal waste . XVI . In these sad regions , I 'd employ My life 's remaining span ; There live exil 'd from social joy , And shun the face of man . XVII . No sprightly , gay idea there Should e'er admittance find ; No pleasing scene , with smiling air , Should entertain my mind . XVIII . But gloomy thoughts should break my rest , And through my fancy roll ; Despair should swell my anxious breast , And overwhelm my soul . XIX . There would I make my doleful moan , There solitary sigh ; There spend my days , unseen , unknown , And unlamented DIE .
