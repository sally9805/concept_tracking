txt no questions of policy does the power and . chaincter of the Conservative Whig Party appear more conspicuously , than in those affecting the institutions of the South , where the spirit of those institutions puts their supporters for the moment in an attitude of hostility to the general government , or to the free States . By the most liberal concessions , by the most judicious compromises , and by a conduct at once temperate , firm and patriotic , the Whig Party in the South have succeeded in preserving and confirming the Union , and maintaining a true respect and feeling for it in the breasts of their constituencies . The contrast of feeling and principle in the two parties is remarkably displayed in the two manifestoes lately issued by Mr. Calhoun and Mr. Berrien , and their friends ; both holding the same views in regard to the subjects agitated ; but one , that of Mr. Calhoun , addressed to the South , and threatening at a division of the Union ; the other , Mr. Berrien 's , addressed to the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the oppressed . Notwithstanding that we are compelled to dissent , in most particulars , from the views expressed by Mr. Berrien , yet we can not fail to express the respect which we feel is due to him for having observed such an important distinction in his manifesto . The extremes of party feeling in regard to slavery lie outside the lines of the Whig VOL. 111. - NO . III . NEW SERIES . party . Mr. Calhoun , in the South , represents the positive ; the radical anti-slavery Democrats of the North , the negative extreme . In the Whig ranks , on the contrary , though there are vast differences of opinion as to the good and evil of the Southern institutions , there is but one opinion as to the paramount importance of the Union . On this first point of policy the Whigs of all the States are essentially and profoundly conservative . When our Southern friends hear of abolition movements , and of propositions for the dissolution of the Union made by abolitionist orators , or of propositions for amending the Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberties of the State sovereigaties , they know very well upon what species of partisans to lay the blame of such proceedings . And with equal certainty the Whigs of the North attribute the spirit which originates threatening inanifestoes to its proper party in the South . A proposal for extending the institution of slavery over new regions , could not originate with the conservative Whig party of the South , nor could any plan of encroachment upon the domestic rights of the Southern States proceed from the conservative Whig party of the North and West . Propositions of this character must proceed from the radical and disorganizing party , and , being antagonist propositions , they divide that party against itself . A manifesto of southern slave-15 // holders for the extension of slavery , is met in the North by a more settled resolution on the part of the radical party , to attack the institution of slavery with every weapon that offers ; not sparing to wrest the Constitution itself , if that were possible , and to direct the forces of the nation upon the liberties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dissolution of the Union , as the most devout admirer of Mr. Calhoun could desire , even to the end of seeing him made president of a Southern republic ; for it is their first desire to remove the Southern States from under the guaranties of the Constitution , in order that they may be set off in a relation of hostility , and afford a perfect justification for such secret or open measures for the liberation of slaves , as might be taken by the agents of fanatical associations . Nor would the Northern States , in case of such separation , hesitate to protect the runaway slave . A border line , dividing the North from the South , would become a boundary , over which the slave would have but to set his foot , to become a freeman . The soil of the Northern States , like the soil of England , would thus confer freedom upon the ne*ro ; a condition which would very soon resolve the problem of the continued existence of slavery in the northern tier of slave States , and soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , considered with sufficient care with what a degree of kindness and forbearance these things are looked at by intelligent and sober citizens of the North . Well assured , as they might be , of the certainty of an extinction of slavery to follow upon the division of the Union , their regard for the safety and prospects of the nation , but especially of the South and West , forbids them to allow that consideration to operate in their minds against the spirit of union and brotherhood . Agreeably to a previous notice , eighteen southern members of the Senate of the United States , and fifty-one southern members of the House of Representatives , met in the Senate-chamber at Washington at seven o'clock on the evening of December 23d , 1848 . The object of this meeting , understood to be called and organized under the advice and influence of Mr. Calhoun , was to adopt a series of resolutions , and to address a warning to the southern citizens of the Union , expressing the opinion of the delegates in regard to the long agitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is and is not constitutional or within the power of Congress in legislation , affecting the institution of slavery . General Thomas Metealfe , Senator from Kentucky , was elected president ; Mr. Gayle , of Alabama , fir-st vice-president ; Mr. Atchison , of Missouri , second vicepresident , and Mr. Venable , of North Carolina , secretary of the meeting . Mr. Bayly , of Virginia , presented a preamble and resolutions . The resolutions express a firm determination to support the Constitution , and , constitutionally , the government-declares their attachment to the Union , as they understand its objects-because a faithful observance of its principles , as they understand them , can alone secure liberty and union to themselves and their posterity . That the government of the United States is one of delegated powers , limited by the plain sense and intention of its Constitution , and that all powers not delegated by the Constitution to the general government , nor prohibited to the States , are , by the express terms of the instrument reserved to the States respectively , or to the people-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy the right of property in slaves , either in the States , the District of Columbia , the territories of the United States , or in any other place whatsoever , nor to prohibit the transfer of slaves from one place to another , except in the power delegated toit over the foreign slave trade , which has been exhausted ,  - -  that an act of Congress impairing property in slaves , or prohibiting the transfer of slaves , would be a violation of the Constitution ; and that , moreover , with such a power conferred or insisted on , the Constitution could not have been adopted ; that the recent efforts to interfere with domestic slavery in the District of Columbia and the territories , and to prevent the transfer of slaves between different parts of the Union are to be regarded as alarming and dangerous , and , if persisted in , must lead to a dissolution of the Union . That there is a necessity for a more effectual interposition to arrest these efforts 222 March , // - that there is a perfect equality of rights among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union are the common property of all the States , that equality would he violated were any conditions or restrictions with regard to property to he imposed upon the citizens of some of those States , passing into the territories , which were not imposed on other citizens . That a law of Congress , prohibiting citizens of any of the States from holding any property they may possess , in the territories , could not by free men be submitted to with honor-That in cases like the present , threatening the rights of States and their citizens , it is proper , where their representatives in Congress have exhausted their power of resistance in vain , for the States whose people are aggrieved to propose the means of redress . After which follows , presented by Mr. Calhoun , from a committee of fifteen , " THE ADDRESS OF THE SOUTHERN DELEGATES IN CONGRESS TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS . " The resolutions adopted at this meeting , expressing the sense of a body respectable for its character , its numbers , the importance of the interest which it represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country as an expression of deliberate opinion , and as a ground and reason of the intended future conduct of the members of that body , and of , at least , a respectable portion of the citizens whom they represent . It is necessary , therefore , for all those who make the proceedings of public bodies a subject of inquiry and of remark , to consider carefully and weigh accurately the open , and , if possible , the implied and hidden meaning of their resolutions ; not for the purpose of predicting consequences rashly , not for the purpose of exciting public indi , , nation or its contrary , not to excite the passions of one part of the nation against another , not to blow up the fires of rebellion , not to express the coiitempt of an individual ; but , if possible , to ascertain how far they are likely , by their real force , to affect the policy of the nation , to sway its counsels , and to urge it toward evil or toward good . It is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensible from the real in these resolutions ; to show , if it can be shown , what there is in them of prejudice , of sophistry and of falsehood , ( if there be any of these , ) and to make every allowance in this estimate for the influences of birth , of education , of remoteness , and of institution . In the first resolution we find the members of the body assembled expressing a firm determination to defend and maintain the Constitution of the Union . It is nerhaps fair , and does not savor of a too jealous disposition , to infer from this expression that the adopters of the resolutions feel that they are engaged in a line of conduct which draws upon them the ill opinion and perhaps the just Suspicions of those who value the integrity of the nation above all other considerationsabove all price . To guard themselves against the ill-will of such , they have simply said , that they intend no hostility against the present order of things , with this reservation , that their own opinions and designs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of the nation itself . They love the Union , but they love it temperately , judiciously , and with a well-weighed and interested affection . They " most solemnly declare a warm attachment to the union of the States . " Upon the construction of those few words - " the union of the States " - hang conclusions of infinite moment ; for we have now to inquire whether by the union of the States is meant a union of the States , or a union of the individuals who compose the nation . What is a State , in the meaning of the Constitution ? Is a citizen of this nation a citizen merely by virtue of his allegiance to his State , or is he a citizen by virtue of a principle-of a nationality-over which State sovereignty has no control , into which State sovereignty can not look ? . State sovereignty can not alter-cannot confer or take away  --  the rights of individuals . State sovereignty can not say to this man , do this and do that ; possess this , resign that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are based upon the ancient laws-laws which take their origin from the decrees of God . " Thou shalt not steal , " is a command laid not only upon individuals , but upon sovereignties . " Thou shalt not deprive thy neighbor of his property without an equitable reason. ** These are principles , these are laws , older , 1849. 223 // more venerable , than State sovereigntie s ; they can not be violated . But greater than these , and necessary to their accomplishment , is the right of the citizen , by his allegiance , to his nationality . State sovereignty , a member of the great system of powers , can not impair the validity of that great first contract  --  the contract of allegiance and protection between the citizen and his nation . It can not even look into and examine the grounds of this contract . The re*olvers declare that it is their " duty to watch over and oppose every infracdon of those principles which conStitLite the only basis of the Union , because a faithful obscrvance of them can alone secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their posterity . " But it b also the duty , in a free nation , of ever* citizen to whom nature has accorded the poxx er of thought and of speech , and who be 1 X Cs that governments are moral organization , to watch over the laws and liberties whiAi protect him ; and especially to notice and comment on the movements of public bodies which assemble to declare intentions and express opinions af fecting the existence of his nation . With humility , hut with earnestness and sincerity , he is permitted to speak in defense of what is dear to him . A citizen of the North is boun l to every citizen of the South , if not by the sacred and pathetic ties of kindred and of friendship , yet by the bonds of a common language , a common origin , a common principle , a common country , and , above all , by a common nationality , This tie , which connects every citizen with every other , which binds every citizen with every other , is maintained and represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bound to protect every citizen ctqamst every other . This is the end of governmeht , that the one shall be protected aoainst the many , that the minority shall be protected against the majority . But if , renouncing , in a heat , their allegiance , the minority remove themselves , or attempt to remove themselves , from under the protection of the nation , and at the same time endeavor , by assuming the power of State sovereignty , to be what it is not  --  to break and divide the bonds of the nationality of others , their fellow-citizens ; threatening by the mere act of a provincial sovereignty , to separate large bodies of citizens from the nation of which they are integral parts and members ; in what light are those who endeavor this to be regarded by the sincere and patriotic citizen ? The resolvers declare that the government of the United States is one of delegated powers , limited by the plain sense and intention of the Constitution , which is the only legitimate source of them ; and all powers not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the States , are by the e*press terms of the instrument res rred to the States respectirely , or to the people . On casting an eye over the Constitution of the Unitcd States , we find no such " express terms . " * The first terms of that instrument are , that " we , the people of the United States , " for several reasons , " do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Uiiited States of America . " The PEOPLE of the United States are in mass a power superior to any one State , else would they not have the power to establish a Constitution for all the States , or rather for such State or States as may by the act of union concede this power to the NATION . Ihe nation is the ' possessed of a power in its sphere , fully equal to all the exi*en&amp;ics and necessities of the nation 0 but , more than all other powers , with that of maintaining the uinity , the existence of the nation as a whole , or , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the fourth section of the fourth article we find the Constitution guarantying to every State in the Union a *epublican form of government . This power of guaranty implies a power of protection against internal changes or external force , possessed and to be exercised by a third party , , superior , by the terms of the * The only " express " reservation of power to the States is for their appointment of militia officers . On the other hand , not only by no express terms , but by no terms whatsoever , are any legislative or executive powers reserved to the " people . ' The people sanctioned and adopted the Constitution , and in that Constitution they have laid certain commands upon the State governments , and restrjcfcd thoir powcr* within certain well-ascertained boundaries . They have guaranteri them their liberties . Is it not po5sib*e that the *ent1eme , n who drew up these resolutions had no copy of the Constitution near them at the time ? 224 March , // guaranty , to either of the contesting parties . By this guaranty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation to exercise that imperial power , conferred upon them by their nationality , over rebellious elements . rj7he Constitution , therefore , has , conferred upon it , a power of the most exalted kind  --  a power of enforcing by command , by threat , and , when necessary , by force of arms-compelling the establishment in permanence of a particular form of government . Such a power carries with it all the conditions necessary to its exercise . By no presumption of authority , by no conditions while the guaranty is maintained , can a single citizen be withdrawn by the act of other citizens from under the protection of such a power . Nor do we find " by the express terms of the instrument " a reservation of powers to the States respectively on the one hand , and on the other to the nation ; as though the States as a body were set off against the people ns a body , and had made , as equal powers , a certain equal division of equal rights . The rights of a State arise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessities which give rise to State rights , though absolute and inmerative within their sphere , like those of the nation , are yet inferior in extent to these , and do not stand upon the same level with them ; - just as , from the height of his individuality looking downward , the duties of a man are perfect and his rights perfect , yet differ in degree and in rank from those of his neighbor , so the rights and duties of the State are perfect in their sphere , though inferior to those of the general government . Neither were the rights of the States established , as might be inferred from the words of our resolvers-so vague are the terms of these important resolutions by a concession from the people to the States-in that imaginary division of equal powers between equal parties . Previously to its establishment by Constitution , the government of this nation existed potentially , only , as the necessity of things made a place for it . Its elements did not lie distrihuted among the States  --  the powers of the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally , but the powers of a State did not ever extend beyond its geographical boundaries , nor did they embrace any of those conditions of nationality upon which , and for which , merely , the general government was established . The general government , therefore , is inspired ( so to speak ) with another soul ; the soul of the whole people , and not with that subordinate , provincial soul , as inferior in gr de and dignity , though it be as free and inviolate in its functions , to the national soul , if we may be pardoned the mysticism , as the soul of a lower grade of spirits might be to a seraphic grade . It is usual to speak of a social contract ; but there is a contract of a nature not to be violated by the will of the contracting parties-that natural and unwritten contract , which , being founded in a physical and moral necessity , unites m* n with man in the observance of common humanity and of common justice , in the various relations of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men can not agree to be enemies , nor to live in a state of barbarism , or of mutual distrust . Almost every action of our lives is wholly , or in part , aiiV*cted by an unexpressed conciousness of thc unity of society , and of the *oi*l of jusice and of honor , of faith and of forbe ir'rnce which creates and maintains that ii uty Society is in this sense , indeed , *a conti act rihe terms of its agreement , comino out from the past , reach forwai d throcvrh succeeding generations . Divisions feuds the sep*ration of interests , these are but violations of that great unwritten contract which is the life of a nation , of which its constitution , its laws , its history , are but a documentary evidence . The aim of this contract , nay , its very essence , is nationality ; the union of as many as can be bound by the ties of kindred , country , language and a common destiny . It is therefore.the first and greatest of crimes to attempt lightly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to ( Iraw lines of division cutting the body of the state along those vital parts where nature has made an union , which must , in ceasing , let out the life and soul of the nation , and reduce it from an organized a ad perfect whole to a number of convulsed and antagonizing members . Whoevei* attempts without reasons of the most sacred character to impair the unity of a nation , commits a sin against humanity , both in the past and in the hi1849. 225 // ture ; for he not only subverts what has been established by the best efforts and the wisest care , by the blood and toil of all good men who have gone before us ; but he extinguishes in hope , nay , stifles in their b birth , the future generations of his race ; since not only the pride of a people , but its power , its growth , its advance in wealth , in knowledge , and in morality , depend almost entirely on the preservation of its nationality and its unity . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States upon the Congress to impair or destroy the right of property in slaves ( for we are come now to the issue ) in any place whatsoever , nor to prohibit the transfer of slaves from one place to another , except in the power delegated to it over the foreign slave trade ; and that any act of Congress designed to impair the right of property in slaves , or to prohibit the transfer of slaves , would be a violation of the Constitution . Not to repeat here what has been already said in regard to the power of Congress over territory acquired by the United States , * we can only declare that we see no impropriety nor unconstitutionality in an act of Congress forbidding or pronouncing contraband any species of property which may be transported into the new territories , and which in the view of the majority of Congress may tend to impede the settlement of those territories * While the territories remain unorganized or are in process of occupation , the people of the United States as a nation possess a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperial control over all national affairs has been acquired by the act of union or naturalization , which confers upon the general government the powers enumerated and implied by the Constitution .

By these arts of cession , all the powers of a king or a sovereign state over its territory were necessarily transferred to the people or nation of the United States . Third , as owners of the soil the people exercise certain rights . It appears by this examination that the authority of the govermrient of this nation is perfect over the territory which they have acquired , for it originally includes the threefold power of imperial control , of State sovereignty , and of ownership. - Am. 1 ? eriew for August , 1848 : . ulrticle on Oregon Bill . by the free citizens , whose arms and whose taxes have secured it to the nation . The question of the population of these territories is between the negro and the white man . Shall it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last like St. Domingo to its original barbarism , or shall the free white southern emigrant possess it in common with his brothers of the North and with the naturalized citizen ? The object of the resolvers is to secure to themselves and to a portion of their constituents , the valuable privilege of introducing into the new territory a species of property , which must have the effect of excluding almost every other species ; of colonizing a soil which is the rightful property of the white man , with the inferior race of Africa ; of excluding the adventurous free emigrant from the new and untried country of his hopes , and of extending an institution incomparably inferior , not only in moral dignity , but in all its economical and social effects , to those of pure republics . We do not mean here to contend , that in countries suited by their climate to the temper and habits of the African race , the institution of slavery may not be preferable to that of negro or Mexican barbarism . The institution of slavery , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a republic of landholders , governing with a despotic power a nation of slaves . To the slave , the white man is an aristocrat , an hereditary lord paramount . Republicanism founded upon slavery is the purest and most exclusive form of aristocracy , or , in other words , a predominance of a superior over an inferior race . The Saxon governs the Celt with an imperfect , hardly acknowledged , superiority -  --  the South Carolinian governs the negro with an unquestionable , a confessed , an undisturbed predominance . We have now neither time nor inclination to enter upon a discussion of the merits of Southern slavery , compared with other institutions of slavery . Whether the caste of India , the helotage of Sparta , the serfdom of Saxon England , the bond service of the Mexican Indian , the despotism of the Turk , the social , intellectual , subordination of the Chinese , the vassalage of the landlaborer , or the legalized penury of the English pauper ; whether these , or any 226 March , // other form of human subordination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now our intention to inquire : suffice it , that to ourselves the condition of the negro seems far better than that of any of those classes whom we have named , and that the institution of slavery , as it exists among ourselves , seems to be not wholly intolerable . Institutions become wrong and immoral only when others more profitable and more conducive to human happiness can be directly substituted for them . Nothing directly wrong or immoral can be predicated of form or institution of government ; and before any change can be effected , the necessity for a change must become imperative , not only in the minds of the governors , but of the governed . The only valuable liberty is perhaps that which we ourselves have seized and possessed ; for political liberty is not , like religion , a thing given by authority of another , but is a something possessed and held with perpetual vigilance . Let us beware therefore how we rush into fanatical extremes . Is not the disposition to meddle with the affairs of our neighbors , and to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar and intolerable conceit ? Wisely therefore did the fathers of the Constitution commit the regulation of domestic servitude , of the relation of the superior and capable to the inferior , and as yet incapable , race to the sovereignties of the States . They knew how near and perfect an acquaintance with any institution is required in those who are to be its reformers . Domestic reform , under the free act of the State legislatures , has moved southward over one-half the continent . Already the Northern tier of slave States begin to feel sensibly the disadvantages and encumbrances which impede their moral and economical progress ; but it is not the power of a moral fanaticism which informs the slaveholder-it is rather a conviction of the political , the economical , and , above all , the social disadvantages of his position , which drives him upon considering whether he does not pay too dearly for the ease and honors of mastership . We hold it to be an unjust imputation , a violent and ill-considered reproach , when our resolvers throw upon the body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the Southern sovereignties . There is , indeed , a phase in human character-it may be , perhaps , a disease in the moral nature of man , infesting a certain portion of society , but more especially of that portion of the human family which are now the acknowledged masters of the earth  --  the phasis or epidemic of Propagandism , which affects different ages in different degrees , and sometimes moves whole communities and nations to engage in enterprises of the most unjust and ruinous character . It excites but little attention in the South to learn that an army of infatuated mystics have moved off into the western wilderness , led by a false prophet , to perish of cold and hunger in the passes of the Rocky Mountains ; but had this army of fanatics , led by a prophet of a different caste , moved southward over the cottcn fields of Carolina , inspired with religious rage against an institution as offensive perhaps , in idea , to a Northern Democrat as the paganism of the Ammonites to the pious Democrats of Israel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexplicable to those who make a study of human motives ? Is there not , therefore , a mixture of thoughtlessness-of thoughtlessness , ' do we say ? - nay , even of blind , unthinking audacity , in the counsels of our resolvers , who , removing themselves from under the grand and imposing shadow of the Constitution -- stepping out from that asylum and city of refuge , within whose bounds their institutions , however odious to the sectaries , and even to the upright and forbearing citizens of the North , remain inviolate-draw themselves off in an attitude of hostility , inviting the hostility which they deprecate , and removing the last barrier between their own unpopular privileges and the exasperated sense of Radicalism , spurred on by fanaticism . The imputation of treason can not seriously light upon the resolvers , when we consider that it is not so much the ruin of the State , as their own ruin , they are resolutely bent on completing . Under the protection of a government the firmest , the most unchangeable in the world , or that has ever existed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not satisfied with holding what they already possess-they 227 // are not satisfied with the full sovereignty , and the guaranty of that sovereignty by the nation , over their ancient and undisputed territory , though they are perfectly aware that a vast majority of the nation regard their privileges as of a character inconsistent with , almost repugnant to free institutions-  --  the idea of the Democratic Republic requiring that the utmost degree of moral and physical liberty should extend to every accountable adult man ; they are not content with holding , in the face of the opinion of all enlightened nations , privileges which , notwithstanding this opinion , no prudent statesman will ask them to lay aside until they can do so with perfect safety to themselves and to the State ; they are not satisfied with maintaining and defending their sovereignties-they seek , in the face of a large majority of the nation , to extend what the majority among themselves , even , admit to he an evil and undesirable form of government over new and vast regions ; they wish to devote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race of Africa , or to a contaminated and inferior blood , between the white man and the negro . By what motives are we to think they are impelled ? Is it possible , is it judicious , to charge upon them any other impulses than those of a heated and misguided imagination ? Dare we call them by any worse name than that sufficiently odious one of political sectaries ? Southern gentlemen and senators can not be accused of mercenary motives the danger of a fall in the price of slaves , or a hope of a rise in that commodity , could not be supposed to shake the resolution or exasperate the obstinacy of the senator of South Carolina , or of that heroic and indefatigable band of orators who cry around him in the Senate and echo him in the House . Power and opinion must have a moral as well as an economical basi* and argument , when they rise against the existence of the most settled , the most dignifled , and the most powerful government that the world has ever seen ; a governruent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution above human frailty and the fluctuations of interest and passion , it can support and defend in its own bosom-not merely tolerate , but support and defend-institutions perfectly op posite , and adverse to its own spirit ; a Constitution so wise , so just , so patient and full of sublime hope , it is able , like a Divine Providence , to entrust the working out of its principles to the inevitable laws of economy and necessity . What then are the moral motives which impel our resolvers to place themselves in their present attitude of threat and of defiance ? " In every political proposal we must not leave out of the question , the political views and object of the proposal ; and these we discover not by what he says , but by the principles which he lays down . " The principles laid down by our resolvers , is , that there is a perfect equality of rights among the states , over the territories of the Union ; hut the territories of the Union are not possessed by the states in their capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of management over the joint possessions of the sovereignties ; but Congress is no more a committee of management for the common property of the union , than it is a board of directors for the management of the common taxes . The taxes of the nation are not apportioned by the State legislatures , they are laid , on the contrary , directly upon the people , or upon commerce ; or upon some other source of revenue , without regard to a division of states . These taxes originate in the House of Representatives , which stands not for the states as an aggregate , but for the body of the people as an indivisible nation . A territory purchased by taxes originated in this manner , is a territory purchased by the nation , and not by the States in aggregate . Our resolvers have therefore assiimed as a fundamental principle of the Union , the existence of an equality of rights which have no existence . They have assumed that to be the common property of the aggregate of States , which was purchased by taxes laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , without distinction of States . They assume , also , that Congress in forbidding the transport of slave property into new territories , has imposed a condition and a restriction upon the citizens of some States which it has riot imposed upon the citizens of ethers. rHie absurdity of this assumption is evident on a moment 's reflection , for this 228 March , // declaration of contraband upon a certain species of property , extends to every citizen of the Union ; the Connecticut farmer is as strictly forbidden by it from converting his money into slaves to be transported into the new territories , as is the Georgian banker or manufacturer from converting his monied capital into negroes for the same purpose . It is certainly in the power of Cono'ress to forbid the importation of ardent spirit into the new territories , in order to prevent an injurious traffick with the Indians , and yet the owners of this species of property in the North might with as great propriety exclaim that the equal rights of the States entitled them to supply the Indians with ardent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition , notwithstanding the interdiction of Congress , as might the southern slaveholders , or any citizens possessing , or intending to possess , slaves , protesting against the interdiction of their transportation into the new territories . The interdiction is imposed equally upon every citizen of the Union , and it is highly ridiculous to suppose that because a citizen happens at the time to be in possession , in his own State , of a ( *uantity of the interdicted article , be it slaves , ardent spirits , or scalping-knives , that he is therefore , in the words of our resolvers , " placed in a condition of inequality , inferiority and degradation incompatible with the essential principle of the Union . " The absurdity of this supposition does not seem in the least degree to have struck the excited imaginations of the resolvers , for immediately upon stating it , they add , not that the assertion of a just n*ht is demanded of them , but that by a principle of honor , they would be bound *o violate any such interdiction . How or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor , a southern gentleman could be converted into a slave smuggler , the most plastic imagination can not shape to itself . Our migniloquent resolvers declare that it would be impossible for freemen to submit with honor to a law of Congress , prohibiting the territory of the white man , purchased with the blood and treasure of all the fee citizens of the Union , to be colonized by negroes . Now let us , if we choose in terms of law , assort the negro with the cattle , and other movable property of his master ; he is nevertheless , a man ; with all the affections , passions and powers of a moral being ; it is his stupidity and brutality of character , that makes him a slave ; he is then a colonist , lie is an inhabitant , he occupies land , lie imparts his character to the country lie inhabits ; left to himself , he makes it a wilderness ; under the guidance of a white master , ho makes it something better ; but still , excepting in situ* tions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negro raises the soil but one degree in the stages of improvement . A country occupied in great part by negroes , is a country doomed to semi-barbarism . To the black race , labor is peculiarly hateful , and in their distribtition upon the face of the globe , we find them occupying regions where n* ture pours out with a lavish hand the means of subsistence over the surface of the earth . A wise foresight would , therefore , very justly exclude from our new and vast possessions , a race of inferioi beings , the most prolific , idle , and consuming , of the human family , and , from the relation in which they neccs*arily stand to the white man , excluding the possibility of a true gradation among the free population , and throwing the political power of the country into the hands of a few influential persons , distinguished by the extent of their dominion over the inferior race . Although the impartial observer can not fail to discover in this form of govern- ment-we mean thedespotism of an aristocratic republic over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most evidently conducive to an audacious freedom of soul , a superiority of character , a defiance of encroacliment , and to all those rioted qualities which mark the *outherfr gentleman ; yet , it is not an obligation imposed upon the national legislature to try experiments upon humanity for the cultivation of a few superior persons , or the pi production of a few remarkable instances of character . Although it is clearly impossible for the nation , as it regards its own integrity and existence , to interfere with the domestio institutions of the States further than to guaraiity to thea ' a republican form of government-  --  a guaranty L citly excluding . all persons who were not already free at the time of the adoption of the Constitution1849. 229 // it is yet bound to do everything for the new territories , so long as they remain under its guardianship , that the majority of Congre ss may deem necessary for securing the rights of its own citizens of all conditions , but especially those of the South , as being nearest , in the occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress it seems proper , from considerations of climate or the existing condition of the population of a territory , to allow the introduction of every species of property , under the conviction that a negro population , under the control of white masters , will be best suited to any part of the new territory , then the majority will either pass a law with full constitutional powers , permitting the introduction of negroes , and providing the necessary protection of courts and a military force for the establishment of the institution of slavery ; or , if the contrary appears to the majority of Congress , then it has full powers to forbid such introduction . For we will not go so far as to say that the permission of slavery by Congress , in the territory of the people , would be , in spirit , unconstitutional ; though a very strong argument , with very good grounds , might be raised to show this . For instance , if the greatest dangers which this nation has to endure proceed from the institution of slavery , should it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the increase of such an influence ? If the genius of constitutional liberty is opposed to the institution of slavery , should not all true republicans oppose its extension with might and main , be they slaveholders or not ? Is not that an unconstitutional permission or passivity in Congress which allows a few States to *. xtend their private institutions over the public territory ? On both sides of this question we find the inquiry as to constitutionality conducted in the most careless and prejudicial style . The objection on the ground of constitutionality raised against that exasperating measure , the " Wilmot proviso , " were based only on the asserted want of authority in the nation to control its own territory , and no one seems to have thought of as king whether the Proviso might not be objected to on other and more tenable grounds . It appeared , tacked to a bill of appropriation for money to be spent in a war for the acquisition of territory by force of arms : thus the principle of the Proviso itself was more injurious than the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood , at that time , that we were to purchase the territory for which we were then making war . The Proviso admitted a greater evil for the suppression of a less ; it carried the appearance of a weak and undignified opposition - it exhibited a great dislike to a certain institution , but carried no force of reason with it . It not only tacitly admitted the constitutionality of the war , but it did more and worse-it attempted , by an act of Congress for this year , to trammel the Congresses of succeeding years . It incorporated in the grave body of a law the hostility of a faction ; it gave money to the Executive loaded with a condition , in the manner of supplies voted to a king on condition of his good behavior ; which it was surely inexpedient for a body representing both the nation and the States . It betrayed a want of confidence in the power of the General Government over the territories of the nation ; for this power once acknowledged , as it must inevitably be by all who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not , surely , a course dictated by confidence in it , to forestall its legitimate action bya proviso attached to a bill , anticipating the possibility of its being called into action , in the management of territory unlawfully acquired . This was a complication of absurdities . The Proviso , however , had its intended effect ; it served as a point of concentration for the excitement of both North and South ; it crented parties of passion , and not parties of deliberation . We have , remarked , in the above paragraphs , in a somewhat irregular and cursory way , upon the salient points of the resolutions as they meet the eye of a constitutional inquirer . It remains only to add a few words , addressed more particularly to our Southern friends , on the address of the Southern delegates to their constituents . As a tolerably full account of the proceedings of Mr. Calhoun 's sectional caucus is given in our Congressional Summary for this month , we need only refer our readers to that summary , and proceed as though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents that the body politic is subject to a disease which threatens it existence , and proceeds to describe this disease : a true diagnosis being supposed necessary as a first step towards effecting a cure . Now as the description given in the address is not of the disease itself , or of its causes , but only of its effects or symptoms , sympathetic and constitutional , being a brief history of the pro and anti-slavery movements in and out of Congress , since the formation of the Constitution , it may as well , perhaps , be intimated , once for all , that the sole recognized and world-wide " disease , " incompatibility , or defect , in the system of American society , is domestic slavery itself . It is a disease affecting the white population of the South - impairing their wealth , hindering their prosperity , and forcing them into a false political position in regard to other parts of the Union . The cure of this defect , or if a cure could not in time be efl*cted , its palliation , was committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignties themselves . The majority of them have extirpated the evil , and many more are are well advanced toward a healthier condition . With several of those , however , who are the most deeply affected by it , certain symptoms appear , of a nature not at all surprising , when we consider the character of the disease . These are , first , a strong and steady purpose appearing in a certain party of the South , of which Mr. Calhoun is the ostensible leader , not only to maintain and nourish the so-called disease in his own State , for which that State alone is responsible , but to force it out over the new territories of the Union , under the idea of satisfying certain rights , real or fictitious . The sympathetic and attendant symptom of this first one is , that in the North and West an extreme abolition party is created , consisting of a number of enthusiastic persons , who use various indiscreet and boisterous expressions , in regard to the cure of the disease , which hetray a profound ignorance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the effects of the remedies they propose-remedies more likely to kill the patient than to cure the malady . We should think that , however , to be a very unscientific diagnosis , which should class among the morbid effects of a disease , the efforts of constitutional practitioners to suppress its ravages and prevent its extension . We therefore can not reckon among these the various acts , resolutions , and compromises in Congress-by which slavery has been confined as far as pos. sible within its ancient limits , and excluded from the North and West-as being symptoms of a diseased action in the body politic ; on the contrary , they seem to indicate a very liberal , just , and healthy action , such as we have already urged . If the great danger of the Union is from contests about this institution of slavery , the less it extends itself , the better it will be for the safety and peace of the whole . The address enters very largely into a detail of grievances , suffered in the violation of the law for the escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held to service or labor , escaping , from their bonds into another State , shall be delivered up , carefully avoiding to mention the word slave . In many of the States , the feelings and education of the people being such , that the idea of slavery is so intensely odious to them , they can not forbear regarding persons who have escaped from aettial slavery as proper exceptions to this provision of the Constitution ; the nature of their bonds seeming to justify the violation of them . In the case of apprenticeship or other regular forms of bondage according to the old Saxon law , they would make no difficulty . There seems to be a radical difficulty in this , to be overcome , which requires on the side of the South the greatest discretion , and on that of the North the most exact and self-denying observance of the Constitution , without regard to those misguiding impulses of pity , or that prejudice ' in favor of those who are supposed to be oppressed . But this manifesto of Mr. Calhoun 's is rather calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case an actual disunion be accomplished , slave property , excepting in the extreme South , must lose all value , and become a mere incumbrance . The manifesto farther argues that all agitation in the North against slavery , by societies , newspapers , debating clubs , and the like , is a manifestation of hostility , not to be endured by the South-that it is a sound maxim in law and morals , no one 1849. 231 // has a right to do that indirectly which they can not do directly . This is really an astonishing stretch of confidence ! The writer of this manifesto wishes to control the expression of opinion in the North , and thinks it a political sin against the South for a moral philosopher to write against the institution of slavery . " Slavery , " he says , " is a domestic institution , " and therefore no man must meddle with it . But it is of the very essence of despotism that is domestic . But is that a domestic in*titution which allows a man to he transported across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a political , a purely political institution , and comes under the especial care of government ; and it is only because they were able and competent to the duty , that the State sovereignties are the proper and natural guardians of such institutions within their own limits . The signers of the manifesto profess to regard the movement of the Northern politicians against slavery in the territories as preparatory steps to the emancipation of slavery in the States . As far as we are acquainted with the spirit of the Whig party in the North , there is no such interference intended . All that the North looks to is , that this " domestic " institution be not converted into a national one . Beyond that , they leave everything as it stands , leaving the rest to the force of circumstances , and the wisdom of Southern legislation . It is unnecessary to do more than merely deny the imputation of the manifesto , , unless we add , in retaliation , that the desire to interfere with slavery in the South , is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Whigs to extend it over the common territory . The people of the free States , who are opposed to the extension of slavery , think that it is inconsistent with their rights to allow its existence upon territory of which they are , as citizens , joint owners : they think , perhaps , that slavery is a " domestic institution , " and they think that in legislating for the national territory , representatives of the nation should not attempt to make it a national one ; that it would he an unjustisable interference for any legislator to attempt to do so . But upon this point we must leave everything to the free opinion of representatives . Congress has full power over the national territories , and if a bill for the exclusion of slavery from them is stopped in the Senate by a Southern vote , every good citizen will acquiesce quietly in the decision of that great conservative body , supposing that they have deemed it more expedient to allow the boundaries of slave institutions to be fixed by natural causes , and by popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes in view , they are unwilling to exasperate the South by any measures betraying a sectional hostility . The complaints and representations of the manifesto against the action of the Northern members of the House upon the question of slavery in the District of Columbia , are of such a spirit as may well excite a smile . It warns the South of terrible movements going on in the District of Columbia for the suppression of the internal slave-trade ; while to the movements in Kentucky , and other Southern States , by large bodies of citizens in those States , it makes no such allusion . It is surely in the highest degree natural and proper that there should be a difference of opinion expressed in Congress by members from different parts of the Union , and it , seems to be equally proper and natural that if the majority of the senators and representatives of the Republic of North America are ashamed of seeing a large traffick in negroes conducted within sight of the Capitol , they should prevent it . If they have not power to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the world suppose them to be . The manifesto states that the District would become a refuge for fugitive slaves ; but against that evil there is full provision in the Cont , stitution . The general government , composed in large part of southerners , would not be likely to allow the Constitution to be disregarded , in that point at least . The manifesto declares " that the great body of the North are united against , Southern institutions . " Now , we venture to affirm , that the great body of the North are industrious , respectable persons , who mind their own business , and wish very much to see their neighbors attend to theirs . But , at the same time , it must be admitted , the North is very generally averse to slavery , and have abo 232 March , // lished it from their statute books . It is certain that the North will not go to war , except where its own liberties and interests are at stake . Bet all the States would rise up in arms against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sovereignty of any Stale of the Union . Among the most important features in this manifesto is the history which it gives of the Missouri question . We subjoin it in full . " We now return to the question of the admission of Missouri into the Union , and shall proceed to give a brief sketch of the occurrences connected with it , and the consequence to which it has directly led . In the latter part of 1819 the then territory of Missouri applied to Congress , in the usual form , for leave to form a State constitution and government , in order to be admitted into the Union . A bill was reported for the purpose , with the usual provisions in such cases . Amendments were offered , having for their object to make it a condition of her admission , that her constitution should have a provision to prohibit slavery . This brought on the agitating debate which , with the effects that followed , has done so much to alienate the South and North , and endanger our political institutions . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high grounds of the right of self-government . They claimed that a territory , having reached the period when it is proper for it to form a constitution and government for itself , becomes fully vested with all the rights of self-government ; and that even the condition imposed on it by the Federal constitution , relates not to the formation of its constitution and government , but its admission into the Union . For that purpose it provides as a condition , that the government must be republican . " They claimed that Congress has no right to add to this condition , and that to assume it would be tantamount to the assumption of the right to make its entire constitution and government ; as no limitation could be imposed , as to the extent of the right , if it be admitted that it exists at all . Those who supported the amendment denied these grounds , and claimed the right of Congress to impose , at discretion , what conditions it pleased . In this agitating debate , the two sections stood arrayed against each other ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the North opposed to it without it . The debate and agitation continued until the session was well advanced ; but it became apparent toward its close , that the people of Missouri were fixed and resolved in their opposition to the proposed condition , and that they would certainly reject it , and adopt a constitu tion without it should the bill pass with the condition . " Such being the case , it required no great effort of mind to perceive that Missouri , once in possession of a constitution and government , not simply on paper , but with legislators elected , and officers appointed , to carry them int@ effect , the grave questions would be presented , whether she was of right a State or Territory ; and if the latter , whether Congress had the right , and if the right , the power , to abrogate her constitution , disperse her legislature , and to remand her back to the territorial condition . These were great , and , under the circumstances , fearful questions-too fearful to be met by those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , how to escape the difficulty . Fortunately , a means was af .. forded . A compromise ( as it was called ) was offered , based on the terms , that the North should cease to oppose the admission of Missouri on the grounds for which the South contended , and that the provisions of the ordinance of 1787 , for the government of the northwestern territory , should be applied to all the territory acquired by the United States from France , under the treaty of Louisiana , lying north of 36* 30 ' except the portion lying in the State of Missouri . The Northern members embraced it ; and although not origin'sting with them , adopted it a their own . It was forced through Congress , by the almost united votes of the North , against a minority consisting almost entirely of members from the Southern States . Such was the termination of this . the first conflict under the Constitution , between the two sections , in reference to slavery in connection with the territories . Many hailed it as a permanent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts ; but others , less sanguine , took the opposite and more gloomy view , regarding it as the precursor of a train of events which might rend the Union asunder , and prostrate our political sys .. tern . One of these was the experienced and sagacious Jefferson . Thus far time would seem to favor his forebodings . May a returning sense of justice , and a protecting Providence , avert their final fulfillment ! Now under favor we conceive that the manifesto misrepresents the whole spirit of the Missouri Compromise . The compromise line extended westward to the Pacific , but no one anticipated at that time the sudden extension of our Southern boundaries . California was not at that time in process of settlement by free white men , and it was not even imagined that a vast republic , to be the centre of the commerce of Asia , and source of the precious metals for all the world , was to be founded 233 // there . Very naturally the North entertains at present a very justifiable jealousy of the extension of territory by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Northern taxes , for the extension of an institution which the Constitution does not name , and the vast majority of taxpayers disapprove . The manifesto declares that the general government has no power to extend slavery , nor to abolish it , and yet the fact remains unquestionable that notwithstanding a citizen may be in possession of a certair* commodity , Congress , under the rule of Salus Populi , has full power to declare it contraband . " So far from maintaining the doctrine which the issue implies , we hold that the Federal Government has no right to extend or restrict slavery , no more than to establish or abolish it ; nor has it any right whatever to distinguish between the domesti.c institutions of one State or section and another , in order to favor the one and discourage the other . As the federal representative of each and all the States , it is bound to deal out , within sphere of its powers , equal and exact justice and favor to all . To act otherwise , to undertake to discriminate between the domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in total subversion of the end for which it was established  --  to be the common protector and guardian of all . Entertaining these opinions , we ask not , as the North alleges we do , for the extension of slavery . That would make a discrimination in our favor as unjustand unconstitutional as the discrimination they ask against us in their favor . It is not for them nor for the Federal government , to determine whether our domestic institution is good or bad , or wheth3r it should be repressed or preserved . It belongs to us , and us only , to decide such questions . What , then , we do insist on , is , not to extend slavery , but that we shall not be prohibited from immigrating , with our property , into the territories of the United States , because we are slaveholders ; or , in other words ; that we shall not on that account be defranchised of a privilege possessed by all others , citizens and foreigners , without discrimination as to character , profession , or color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely enter and remain ; we only being excluded . " We conclude this somewhat irregular discussion of the manifesto , with an illustration of the mode in which the powers of the general government over its territory are ascertained , und we then dismiss the subject , as the one of all others which we had the least inclination to discuss , and to which we mean if possible never to return . " At the peace of 1763 , France ceded to Spain all the country known under the name of Louisiana . ' In 1800 , by a treaty between the Republic of France and the King of Spain , in consideration of the Republic enlarging the territories of the Duke of Parma , Spain ceded to the French Republic the colony or province of Louisiana , with the same extent which it now has in the hands of Spain , and which it had when France possessed it , and such as it should be , according to the treaties subsequently made between Spain and other states . ' And in 1803 , the same territory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French Republic , for ever , and in full sovereignty , with all its rights and appurtenances , as fully and in the same manner as they have been acquired by the French Republic , in virtue of the above-mentioned treaty with his Catholic majesty . ' The above is from the Democratic Review for June , 1845 . Now it is worth the inquiry whether , if all powers of sovereigaty were ceded to the nation as an organized body , they do not remain in the nation to this day , to be exerGised at will.
