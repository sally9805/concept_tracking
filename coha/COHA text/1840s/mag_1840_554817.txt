txt LORD ChESTERFIELD 'S name is intimately connected with the subject of I ) rivate education and the formation of manners ; and in many minds it is identified with hypocrisy , worldliness , and libertinism . These we suppose are his * The title-page of this work may mislead the reader on two points . First , the Life is not on mat , since it consists mainly of selections in the very words , from Dr. Maty 's Life of Chesterfield ; and , secondly , the Edition is not complete , as it does not include the Correspondence and Miscellanies , which follow Dr. Maty 's Memoir and fill two volumes . Perhaps the word " American " was intended to modify the meaning of the word " complete , " so that it might he better adapted to our republications of foreign works . // present distinctions , and the chief points for which he will be remembered . His brilliant accomplishments as a courtier and companion , his skill in diplomacy , his refined eloquence , his liberal views and independent course as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have passed from the minds of men . They occupy but a small place in general history , and there was nothing in his character or course of life to give them importance beyond the day , merely on account of himself . As a patron of literary men , which he certainly was , he might have promised himself a distant and bonorable fame in the writings of poets and historians , whom he had assisted or courted ; and yet his connexion with authors would now be scarcely known , but for Johnson 's celebrated letter , resenting the Earl 's tardy recommendation of the English Dictionary , and some previous supposed slight of the author 's application for his favor . Still further , Chesterfield would be scarcely known now as an author ( in the usual sense of the term ) , had not Johnson , in the same letter , designated two papers in " The World , " in which his Lordship recommended the forthcoming Dictionary to the public . And it must be owned that Chesterfield himself , if we may take his word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes thus on the subject , to Dr. Madden , in 1748 , when be was past fifty and living in retirement , and apparently quite competent to give a fair opinion in his own case . " The few light , trifling things that I have accidentally scribbled in my youth , in the cheerfulness of company , or sometimes , it may be , inspired by wine , do by no means entitle me to the compliments which you make me as an author ; and my own vanity is so far from deceiving me upon that subject , that I repent of what I have shown , and only value myself upon what I have had the prudence to burn . " - Miscellaneous Works , ( Dublin , 1777 , ) Vol. i. p. 330 . And , again , in his sixtieth year he writes to his friend Dayrolles " I will confess to you , that I often scribble . What will finally come of it , I do not know ; nothing , I am sure , that shall appear while I am alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spectators , upon some new folly or absurdity that may happen to strike me , as I have now and then // helped Mr. Fitz-Adam in his weekly paper called " The World . " - lbid . Vol. iii . p. 257 . He seems at this period to have contemplated writing historical tracts of his own time , but he had little hope that he should accomplish any thing . Hi* health was broken , long before the weight of years alone would account for his withdrawing from public business and remitting his literary projects . And , though he lived to nearly fourscore , yet for the last twenty-five years of his life , the care of his health , and contrivances for resisting the languor and depression of vertigo and deafness , allowed but brief intervals of repose for mental effort , and little of that " flow of active spirits , " be says , " which is so necessary to enable one to do any thing well . " Accordingly , we do not find that he left any thing at his death for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renown for any thing he had written . The Correspondence on which his fame rests , was published by others , as they could collect it , and probably comprises but a small part of his letters . We are not aware , that he left any directions on the subject , or bed any band in making the collection ; and there is good reason to suppose , that he rarely made copies . As he says , that he never rewrote a letter , we presume that we have his most familiar correspondence in the first draught ; and there is no cause to regret this . Probably , in point of literary excellence , it would have been the worse for retouching ; and , in point of trustworthiness , the difference is great , let the writer be ever so honest , between the first unpremeditated expression , and the carefully corrected and guarded copy which is offered to the general reader . Dr. Maty wishes , that the Earl had lived to publish his letters to his son , as be might then have bad an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though a lady , felt no scruples on the subject ; and it might have been difficult for any one , not excepting Chesterfield , to heal a general , lurking disease , by removing eruptions . Dr. Maty 's apology is worth something , if intended to screen the Earl from the charge of a deliberate purpose to corrupt the whole body of English youth ; but when be calls the obnoxious passages " transient errors , confined to a period of three or four years , " the period may seem pretty long to instill poison into a young mind ; and the Earl 's character // will gain little by the apology , when it is considered that the vicious passages were addressed to his own child . The recent publication of Chesterfield 's Letters , in this country , has led us to inquire into his history and writings , with more curiosity than we had ever felt on either subject . We had heard of him in our youth as the great master of manners , the lawgiver and authority on all points of exterior propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of warning , conveyed a censure of all rudeness , and hinted every thing that became a well-bred man . We had read in our school-books several of his excellent letters on good behaviour , and in due time we had learned , that he who could condescend to a boy 's civilization , was a peer of England , who had declined a pension and dukedom , and a minister of state , who had retired of his own accord . We might have suspected , and with safety , that much of the sententious wisdom which we had listened to from our elders , was a repetition of the practical sayings of one whom we had regarded , with trembling , as our master of ceremonies . The teacher of accomplishments was also a sage . There was an oracle among the Graces . There can be no doubt of his authority with two generations at least , both here and in Europe , whatever it may be now . The character of his influence we will consider hereafter . We have spoken of him as indebted for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence was preserved . He was by choice , and upon system , a man of business , of pleasure , and of the world . At the age of nineteen , after passing two years at Cambridge , he set out upon his travels , alone . The custom of gross pleasures at the University , he had deemed a proper accomplishment for an English gentleman ; and during his first absence from home he seems not to have wholly freed himself from this rude prejudice . It was at a little later period , that he conceived his idea of a perfectly refined man , and learned to despise his coarse , awkward countrymen , of what rank soever , who herded together for company in foreign states , and sought their pleasures , as at home , in the lowest haunts of vice . Upon the accession of George the First , he went into the House of Commons and made his first speech in support of the new government . He was yet under twenty-one , and it // is said , that , to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal age , he went a second time to Paris . And here begins his noviciate as a man of fashion , or what he would call a pretty gentleman , one of those " pretty fellows , " for whom we have devised another name . This training , however , is part of his system for moulding a man of action . He had no idea of becoming a beau or coxcomb for the sake of the accomplishment . His flue gentleman is to be a man of power in the highest callings of active life . When he has acquired all learning , and necessarily a great deal of rust with it , he must mix with those who are experienced in high life , that he may obtain the full use of his possessions . The whole body must be taught to serve the mind , and never be in its way ; a noble doctrine , according to the object . He gives his son an account of his embarrassment on first going into company , and the method of relief which a foreign lady adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the awkwardness and rust of Cambridge about me , I was first introduced into good company , I was frightened out of my wits . I was determined to be what I thought civil ; I made fine low bows , and placed myself below everybody ; but when I was spoken to or attempted to speak myself , obstupui , steterunique cornw , et vex fauci bus heesit . If I saw people whisper , I was sure it was at me and I thought myself the sole object of either the ridicule or the censure of the whole company , who , God knows , did not trouble their heads about me. " - " If now and then some charitable people , seeing my embarrassment , and being di*seuvr*s themselves , came and spoke to me , I considered them as angels sent to comfort me , and that gave me a little courage . I got more soon afterwards , and was intrepid enough to go up to a fine woman , and tell her that I thought it a warm day . She answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which the conversation ceased , on my part , for some time , till she , good-naturedly resuming it , spoke to me thus ; C J see your embarrassment , and I am sure that the few words you said to me cost you a great deal ; but do not be discouraged for that reason , and avoid good company . We see that you desire to please , and that is the main point ; you want only the manner , and you think you want it still more than you do . You must go through your noviciate before you can profess good-breeding ; and , if you will be my novice , I will present you to my acquaintance as such . ' As soon as I had fumbled // out my answer , she called up three or four people to her , and said , Do you know that I have undertaken this young man , and he must be encouraged ? As for me , I think I have made a conquest of him ; for he just now ventured to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will assist me in polishing him . He must necessarily have a passion for somebody ; if he does not think me worthy of being the object , we will seek out some other . However , my novice , do not disgrace yourself by frequenting opera girls and actresses , ' &amp;c . The company laughed at this lecture , and I was stunned with it . I did not know whether she was serious or in jest . By turns , I was pleased , ashamed , encouraged , and dejected . But when I found afterwards , that both she , and those to whom she had presented me , countenanced and protected me in company , I gradually got more assurance , and began not to be ashamed of endeavouring to be civil . I copied the best masters , at first servilely , afterwards more freely , and at last I joined habit and invention . " - Lelters to his Son , Am . Edition , pp. .318 , 319 . It might have been expected , that , after acquiring abroad all the defences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best society , he would be proof against annoyances in any shape , and able to set himself down in any place and with every sort of people , as if it were his home . But Dr. Maty was told , that his Lordship failed of making a figure in the House of Commons , because of the chagrin he suffered from one of the members , who used to make him ridiculous by mimicking his tone and action . " Possibly , " adds the Doctor , " this circumstance , had he remained long in the lower House , might have deprived his country of one of its finest orators . " This is almost enough to shake one 's faith in the universal sufficiency of a thorough French training . But , fortunately for himself and his country , he was , upon the death of his father , removed to the House of Peers , and is now to be considered as in all respects prepared for a brilliant career as a statesman . Though a man of pleasure and fashion , he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had applied himself to the study of public law , of foreign policy , institutions , and usages , and of British interests . He had lived in the midst of able public men and orators , and no man surpassed him in the power of turning his experience to good account . He started with Whig principles of government and never deserted them ; // but , whether from ambition or virtue , he held himself at liberty to he a Whig of his own sort . He resisted Walpole , till he saw the prostration of his long-held power , and was disgusted with Pulteney for wavering at the moment when he stood before the nation , as " the arbiter between the crown and the people . " He would not be a slave to party names , nor defer to a great leader merely because of his position . Chesterfield looked for power to his standing well with the people ; and his expressions of deference to the popular will would do honor to any democratic philanthropist of the present day . He takes office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were doing him a favor , and only glad of power as it may enable him to do more , than he could do out of place , for humanity and peace . Foreigners , whether they meet him as negotiators or companions , are delighted with this rare specimen of urhanity and polish from England . Cheerful , amiable , convivial , a perfect master of himself , his pride held in check by his prudence , his fastidiousness softened by good-nature or cloaked by art , he was accessible to all , and able to impress every sort of men favorably . There was no weakness in his courtesy or conciliation . He was decided and plain-spoken in exacting fidelity from officers in his department , and not less so in apprizing his sovereign of what he expected as a condition of his continuing in office . And , last of all , this man of refined pleasure , and literary tastes , and carefully formed by himself to the most perfect observance of artificial manners , is a hardworking man of business . When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office of principal secretary , one whom he calls a very genteel , pretty young fellow , but not a man of business ; and he told him on his first visit , " Sir , you will receive the emoluments of your place , but I will do the business myself , being determined to have no first minister . " And hence , perhaps , his great popularity and success , in that most difficult government . Certainly , the view here given of Chesterfield presents no argument against his system of a fine gentleman 's education , so far as the faithful discharge of public office , or general fitness for any work of civil life , is concerned . There is not one mark of feebleness , indolence , or self-seeking . He is firm , energetic , honorable , fair-minded , and benevolent . And // it is clear , that every man near him is aware of his presence and his power . No doubt , a great deal is still wanting to make him an olject of interest . Even the changing fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A baffled and disgraced statesman , driven into exile or waiting for impeachment , has sometimes obtained a place in our affections , which all the splendor , talent , and enterprise of his administration would never have secured . But Chesterfield received no heavy blow from any of his employers . He was never more active and cheerful than while in the opposition ; and when he resigns the seals and retires for ever , it is to suit himself . " The audience , which Lord Chesterfield had of his Majesty on resigning the seals , passed in a very different way from that which he had four years before , when he took leave on setting out for his embassy . The King urged him to retain his office , and expressed his satisfaction of the manner in which he had filled it . His Lordship 's answer was , that he found he could be but a useless servant , and that his honor and conscience did not permit him to continue in a post , in which he had not been suffered to do any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his master himself was not at liberty to distinguish those who had his service most at heart . The monarch was not offended at this freedom . He even offered to give him personal marks of his satisfaction , either by a pension or the title of duke . these o*ers were declined , and only one of the places at the Board of Admiralty , for his brother John Stanhope , accepted . In return , he begged leave to assure his Majesty , that though he ceased now to be in his immediate service , he would never cease to give him proofs of his respectful attachment , and , reserving to himself the liberty of giving his vote on national points as his reason should direct him , he would keep himself entirely clear of cabals and opposition. **-Maty 's Ljfe of Chesterfield , pp. l8* , 183 . Writing to IDayrolles , shortly after his resignation , he says , " I shall now , for the first time in my life , enjoy that philosophical quiet , which , upon my word , I have long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while I was young , I lived in a constant dissipation and tumult of pleasures ; the hurry and plague of business , either in or out of court , succeeded , and continued till now . And it is now time to think of the only real comforts in the latter end of life , quiet , liberty , and health . Do not think , by the way , that by quiet and retirement , I mean soli // tude and misanthropy ; far from it ; my philosophy , as you know , is of a cheerful and social nature . My horse , my books , and my friends will divide my time pretty equally . I shall not keep less company , but only better , for I shall choose it . " - Miscel1aneou* Works , Vol. in .   ' 177 , 178 . Such language is very common in the mouths of retired statesmen , but probably is not often as sincere as in the present case . So far as we can discern , Chesterfield would not suffer himself any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonplaces , when he was talking to a friend of his own state . Disease followed him to his retirement , and his philosophy was soon to have its trial . And it is now that for the first time we see a shade of tenderness and privacy stealing over his mind . For once , his pursuits seem to be wholly suggested by his condition , and therefore to be natural , or , at least , unforced . He is in his garden , or among his books and his friends , or corresponding with the absent , or occupied with building a house in town and furnishing it to his taste , and collecting pictures and arranging his library and in summer he is improving his beloved villa and grounds at Blackheath . For once , he is conversing with people as if they were private men , and had an interest in him and a beauty in themselves , unconnected with the charm of mere manners and the fascination of public office . To say , as many readers probably will do , that he has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry , no undefined visions of glory in the improvement of his own soul , is to say what he would have admitted as not entering into his plan or into his nature . He would not have admitted , however , nor would it have been true , that the strictest adherence to his system of manners , or devotion to affairs of state , necessarily brings to an end whatever of imagination and warmth may have belonged to the mind originally . The natural quality is not so easily destroyed , if it ever existed in any considerable strength . But he had little or none of it . lie was content to accomplish what he aimed at . The object was not very high ; and he would only have been impeded by affections and desires , which naturally looked another way and far higher . It was at this period of illness and decay , and of subdued ambition , that Johnson took offence at the Earl 's superfluous patronage , and recalled an instance of his real or supposed // neglect in former years , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own view of the matter , and Boswell has given it to the public . Chesterfield , it should seem , took no notice of the indignant letter beyond reading it to his visiters , commending the style , extolling the powers of the writer , and pointing out the severest passages ; and this liberality and indifference are ascribed to duplicity . He had been a patron of Johnson , and it has been said , that he hoped to secure the dedication by publicly showing an interest in the English Dictionary on the eve of its publication . And as it is assumed , that he must have been mortified by Johnson 's disdainful repulse of his commendation , what else could he do but appear magnanimous and unhurt ? Certainly , nothing else but to be so . Why should we enter so narrowly into the motives of this old man of the world , who had , for all that appears , done nothing more than a kind and seasonable act for an adventurous author ? He did not go out of his way to offer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " The World " ; and the style of the two papers referred to is as familiar , and the topics are sometimes as light , as those of his other essays . Probahly he was glad to have so good a subject for a new article ; and felt much less disquiet about the whole affair than Johnson . He would , we believe , have given Johnson money after the letter , as cheerfully as he had done before ; and he would have done it , we believe , after the publication of the Dictionary without a dedication ; and this too would have been ascribed to duplicity . We see little , in his history , that shows sensitiveness on the score of vanity , and therefore have little reason to suspect him of practising art to conceal the torture of a wound . He probably received Johnson 's taunting letter with more composure than he would have received a visit from him , with the most flattering dedication in his hand . And here , if we are allowed to entertain a not very unreasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters should not stand very propitiously between the parties . What contrast can we imagine more strong than between these two men at any period of their lives ? The delicacy of the one might be false , and the ungracefulness of the other was a misfortune for which he was not to blame ; but we are speaking of tastes in the choice of our society , a point on which no man should bear dictation . // The Earl would have endured Johnson , if necessary , or else he had gone to the school of manners for nothing ; but he would most probably have held it a better course to avoid him . Such we may suppose to have been the relation between the parties , before Chesterfield had grown old , deaf , infirm , and humbled by slow decay , and had withdrawn to seek , within a limited circle of friends , and in a few unambitious employments , the only relief he expected but death . What must the relation have been afterwards ? Johnson was more reserved than Chesterfield about the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstinence by assailing him on other points . He said of the " Letters to his Son , " that they " taught the morals of a prostitute and the manners of a dancing master " ; and there is much truth in the denunciation . But when he calls him " a wit among lords , " we can not perceive equal application in the sarcasm , if the term is used in its ordinary modern sense . It can not be just in its contemptuous bearing upon the English peers and , as to Chesterfield 's wit , though not of the highest order , it is prompt , flowing , and graceful , and belongs to the matter , and runs in the best English of the age . It is the most natural thing about him . If a lord could relish it , we should think none the worse of him for it . Those who dislike the French , may call it French wit ; those who regard him as a petit-madre in every thing , amy call it fashionable wit . These are phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit is very agreeable notwithstanding . It is a practice with some to sneer at the literature of that age for its barrenness , flimsiness , and varnish . It would have been better , if the changes , which are supposed to have put us so far forward , had taught us the first and most natural lesson , which a sense of superiority in any thing should inculcate , - the lesson of humility . No portion of the past is worthless as a study , and none is unconnected with the state of things which follows . When we have passed through a few more changes , we shall begin to feel our literary connexion with the last century to be a privilege , and to inquire how we came to overlook it ; how we could suppose that a modern age , which*abounded with great spirits in science , theology , and the questions of political freedom , should have been meagre in elegant and popular literature . We shall begin to // observe with some interest , that a system of taste and of literary propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to fasten itself upon men of the highest genius , who would have heen part of the glory of England in any age , and xx*ho were capable , one would think , of effecting a radical change in letters xvhenever they chose . We shall observe , that it was the trying time for authors , when men in power began to discourse upon settling the language , and particular writers of the day were put forward as authorities . It can not be above the spirit of any sound philosophy to observe the workings of really powerful minds under restraints and influences like these , and how much they accomplished , and how well our language passed through the inquisition . And quite as important will it be to observe the course of some who broke loose ; for , instead of returning to what is simple and true , as they would have done if instinct had not been harmed , they ran into pedantry , conceit , bombast , or vulgarity , each according to his temper , with the merit , however , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them by their vigor and their example of freedom . Men should never talk contemptuously or lightly of English literature in any part of the eighteenth century . If we have been drawn from our subject , we return to it to say , that Chesterfield was not one of the sufferers . He was thoroughly a man of the time in literature , and wore his chains like a gentleman . They were an ornament . He could not have spared them . To be clear-headed , and free from all mistakes about himself , with vivacity , shrewdness , and fancy enough for a wit , with the best society at home and abroad at his command , and a good library , these were qualities and advantages for a man of letters , which he would prize higher than the lawless excursions and original meditations of genius . A few personal passages from his letters will show the state of his mind in retirement , and his general estimate of himself . The first extract is from a letter to his son , in his sixty-sixth year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ; c'est ma place , and I know it , which is not given to everybody . Cut off from social life by my deafness , as well as other physical ills , and being at best but the ghost of my former self , I walk here in silence and solitude as becomes a ghost ; with this only // difference that I walk by day , whereas , you know , to be sure , that other ghosts only appear by night . My health , however , is better than it was last year , thanks to my almost total milk diet . This enables me to vary my solitary amusements , and alternately to scribble as well as read , which I could not lo last year . Thus I saunter away the remainder , be it more or less , of an agitated and active life , now reduced ( and I am not sure that I am a loser by the change ) to so quiet and serene a one , that it may be properly called still life . " - Letters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes to his friend , the Bishop of Wa-terford , " I now read Solomon with a sort of sympathetic feeling . I have been as wicked and as vain , though not so wise as he ; but am now at last wise enough to feel and attest the truth of his reflection , that all is vanity and vexation of spirit . This truth is never sufficiently discovered , or felt , by mere speculation ; experience in this case is necessary for conviction , though perhaps at the expense of some morality . " - Miscellaneous Works , Vol. iii . p. 361 . If in the flood-time of health and spirits , he had nothing of the moderation and tranquillity of Epicurus , the spirit of his philosophy seems to be gathering over him now . " All the infirmities of an age , still more advanced than mine , crowd in upon me . I must bear them as well as I can ; they are more or less the lot of humanity , and I have no claim to an exclusive privilege against them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no very pleasant hours ; but on the other hand , thank God , I have not one melancholy one ; and I rather think that my philosophy increases with my infirmities . Pleasures I think of no more ; let those run after them that can overtake them , but I will not hobble and halt after them in vain . My comfort and amusements must be internal ; and , by good luck , I am not afraid of looking inwards . Some reading , some writing , some trifling in my garden , and some contemplation , concur in making me never less alone than when alone . But this letter runs too much into the moral essay of a solitaire. " - To Dayrolles , ibid . Vol. in. p. 266 . The Bishop of Waterford seems to have addressed the Earl on the subject of religion ; and , from a few passages in his replies , we may learn , to some extent , how he regarded religion in its relations to himself . // me , I protest , my dear Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship I had given occasion to it , and I expected it both from your affection and your character . Those reflections are never improper , though too often unwelcome , and consequently useless , in youth ; but I am now come to a time of life both to make and receive them with satisfaction , and therefore I hope with utility . One can not think of one 's own existence , without thinking of the eternal Author of it and one can not consider his physical or moral attributes without some fear , though in my mind still more hope . It is true we can have no adequate notions of the attributes of a being so infinitely superior to us ; but , according to the best notions which we are capable of forming of his justice and mercy , the latter , which is the comfortable scale , seems necessarily to preponderate. " - ibid . Vol. iii . p. 339 . " I have within these few months more than once seen death very near , and when one does see it near , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a very serious consideration . I thank God , I saw it without very great terrors ; but at the same time the divine attribute of mercy , which gives us comfort , can not make us forget , nor ought it , his attribute of justice , which must blend some fears with our hopes . " - ibid. p. 359 . With this brief notice of Chesterfield , and leaving out of consideration his general abilities , and his opinions on public affairs and many other subjects , we proceed to take some notice of the only work for which he is at all popularly known , the " Letters to his Son " ; and these will be considered chiefly as containing a system of manners . In a letter to his favorite Parisian correspondent , a lady of rank and accomplishments , he gives the following account of the youth , and of his purposes in regard to him . CC J have a boy who is now thirteen . I will freely own to you , that he is not a legitimate child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown a partiality for me beyond my deserts . As for the boy , I may be prejudiced in his favor , but I think him amiable . His person is pretty , he is very sprightly , and does not seem to want sense for his age . He speaks French perfectly well , knows a good deal of Latin and Greek , and is thoroughly acquainted with ancient and modern history . He is now at school , where I intend to keep him till May next ; but as , in our schools , and indeed in this country , little care is taken to form the morals and manners of young people , and as // Lord Chesterfield . April , most of them are silly , awkward , and rude ; in short , such as you see them when they come to Paris , at the age of twenty or twenty-one , I will not let my boy stay here long enough to contract those bad habits , which , once taken , are seldom shaken off ; therefore , at fourteen I shall send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some substantial family . But , as he will be still very young , and will not have nearly completed his necessary studies , I shall send an Englishman along with him , a man of consummate erudition , who will keep up and improve his Latin and Greek , and teach him logic , rhetoric , and a little philosophy . This learned man will have him entirely under his government at home , and all the morning ; but , as he is not altogether qualified to polish his manners , or , if you will , to give him the ton of good company , which , however , is highly necessary , and perhaps as serviceable as all the Greek and Latin of Monsieur Vadius , could not I get at Paris some man , or some Abbe , who ( for money which I should gladly give ) would undertake the care of the lad from four in the afternoon ; who would carry him to the play , to the opera , and even attend him to your house , ifyou would give him leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this child , and shall take a pride in making something of him , since I believe the materials are good , my notion is to unite in him what I have never yet met with in any one individual ; I mean , what is best in both nations . For this purpose , I intend him his learned Englishman , who is likewise a man of sense , for the solid learning I would have him possessed of , and his French afternoon tutor to give him , with the help of the companies into which he will introduce him , that ease , those manners , those graces , which certainly are nowhere to be found but in France . " - " If I may presume to ask it , will you permit him sometimes to be your page in an evening , to give out the cards , to present the coffee , and reach the chairs ? That indeed would be his best school , but I dare not so much as think of it . As the circumstance of his birth might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it is best not to divulge it , but to give out he is a nephew of mine , as the cardinals do . " - Ibid . Vol. ii . pp. 340 , 342 . To the care of this darling child , he devoted himself with a warmth and anxious oversight , that appear only to be heightened by the circumstance of his birth . No one can doubt that the charge of his education is , of all his enterprises , the nearest his heart , and that he is *villing to give his life to it . Nothing displaces it , and every thing and person should seem // to be made in some way connected with it . He began the series of letters of which we are to speak , when the child was but five or six years old , and it terminated only with his son 's death . The object of the letters is to furnish a course of education , that shall prepare a man for success in public life ; and the instruction is ever accompanied by motives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the debt he owes to a fond and ambitious parent . Chesterfield was too wrapped up in his hopes of the youth to weigh the case fairly . He probably thought but little of the slights to which his birth was to suhject him , or he might have imagined that they together would be more than a match for the prejudices of such an age . He would not allow himself to see that the capacity he was training , though respectable , was but ordinary ; or that there was any thing ungainly in young Stanhope 's appearance or manners , that would not yield to a residence in Paris . In due time , he brought him into Parliament , and his first speech was his last . He failed . His father 's long inculcation of the necessity of attaining perfect selfpossession , and of preparing himself for the kind of eloquence that would suit the House , together with the warning that he must first make a figure there , if he would make a figure or fortune in his country , - all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , and encouraging . The veteran has sympathy with the infirmity of his novice . There *s no misgiving , no offer to settle a competency upon him , that he may retire to an honest obscurity , where the pride of the well-born will not wound him , nor the sense of his incapacity for business be a source of mortification . No ; if he can not figure in Parliament , he still may be a resident at some court , as was contemplated from the beginning . Situations were obtained for him , and , before reaching the prime of life , he died abroad . Thus was the seal set upon what seems to have been a signal failure . We do not know whether the system pursued had even been so far successful as to corrupt theyoung man 's heart . Probably he was not the sort of man to be made a complete impersonation of the Earl 's great idea of human perfection . But it must be allowed , that paternal assiduity , whether for good or ill , could not be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his years of separation , with anxiety and hope , in every place and at every // hour . He had been so warned and encouraged , that he could scarcely help feeling either that there was much laid up in him to be developed , or that so much pains must perforce create something uncommon. ; and that , in the end , a grand scheme of youthful culture would be exemplified in him . And all had failed , and death had caused hut a small part of the failure . Last of all , he had been uniformly treated by his father with a confiding freedom in all matters that he thought would do him any good , and equal confidence in return could not he doubted in any case ; and yet , shortly after his death , the Earl was visited by a lady , with her two children , who came to inform him , that she had been married to Mr. Stanhope for several years . We can not say whether Chesterfield 's conduct , upon receiving this intelligence , proceeded from duplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slay , or from the reflection that he , who had taught dissimulation , deserved its first fruits ; but certain it is , that he did not suffer resentment of this ungenerous concealment to fall upon the living ; for he took upon himself the care of providing for the children , and some very affectionate letters remain which he addressed to them and their mother . Such was the Earl 's paternal affection , and such the ending of his vast preparation and hope . We come now to his plan of education . The first thing that strikes one is its minuteness , its pertinacious notice and reiteration of the smallest things which enter into his notion of a complete man . He evidently puts out of consideration the work which every boy should be left to do for himself ; and would scorn the theory , that no teaching whatever should aim at any thing beyond giving to the mind a safe action . The whole application of a good lesson , and the whole result , be would leave with the master . The pupil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the artist is satisfied , there is no more to be desired . This we gather from the general spirit and manner of the instruction , and should not be induced to think differently by occasional hints , that are more liberal and just . The question is not , whether a comprehensive plan of education in general is hurtful ; whether certain principles and methods are not to be recognised as essential , and distinct objects to be proposed . But is a constant oversight for the purpose of making the system work // according to our notion in every thing , a perpetual warning that an omission , deviation , or addition is necess rily a fault , - is this course favorable to vigor , courage , independence , originality , and deep moral impulses ? Again , the objection here , though in some respects a very important one , is not to unity in our object , and keeping one great aim for ever in the pupil 's sight . Singleness of purpose often creates power , by holding a man strictly to one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal hostility when a boy , and we know x hat came of his nourishing this one passion through life . But an objection does lie against a teazing , petty , foreign interference with every act , scheme , pleasure , and acquisition of a young mind , with a view of achieving our own object . it would be dangerous , even if it were studiously adapted to the boy 's natural bent . Chesterfield , it must be acknowledged , had but one object in view in educatin0 his son , and that was to make him a statesman ; and he cared not what he risked by holding up public life and all its appurtenances for ever before his pupil . It would not be easy to say what special teaching is needed for a politician ; but the views of the present teacher are plain enough . A character formed under domestic influences , had such a thing been practicable in young Stanhope 's case , was not desired . An English home , English playmates , English manners , would make him nothing better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fit to live in it . If he could have obtained fortune and distinction equally well as an adopted Frenchman , the Earl , with all his Whiggism , would probably have consented to the expatriation . But it would certainly be a greater triumph still , to come borne an accomplished man of no country , flexible and prepared for people of every clime , station , and taste , - a universal stranger , a non-resident with a home everywhere , who was provided with a code of observances , a rule of practice , which saved all study and feeling , and suited everybody , and served all the purposes of natural sagacity and a profound knowledge of man . A law of amenity , condescension , and seeming self-forgetfulness , founded upon full faith in the weakness and self-love of every human being , was better than the instinctive impulses of benevolence , which are more likely to gush out in exaggerated acts of kindness , than to breathe that subdued sympa // thy which owes every thing to manner . The system , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he partial ; and , whether good or had , it was not at all impracticable in itself . And those who take it up as of general application , and designed to form the habits and direct the pursuits of the mass , would , after so fair notice is given in every page , have themselves alone to blame , were not the system so built upon human frailties in every condition of life , and so seductive in its substitution of appearances for inherent qualities , that many simple-minded people might be tempted to adopt its superficiality , and make themselves fools and rakes instead of accomplished public characters . But we must consider more particularly Chesterfield 's estimate of manners , and the discipline he enjoined for forming them . His view of the whole subject may be superficial and false , and unquestionably his aim is often low and vicious ; but he certainly has drawn attention to the subject ; and the importance of good-breeding is not easily overrated , in whatever light we regard it . Addison calls it " a kind of artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies a natural want , - Ubi homirtes sunt , modi sunt ; but our way of living together , the terms on which we shall exercise our natural liberty in social life , are conventional or customary , and so far artificial . Manners , it is true , sometimes lose much of their original significance , and become little more than form . At the highest pitch of refinement , they are often rendered ludicrous by the anxious observance of punctilio , and the airs and grimace of coxcombs . And at any time they may be made the instruments of hypocrisy . They are not unchangeable , like the instinctive courtesies of inferior animals , nor , like them , incapable of being perverted . And well-bred men of the same community may , from some diversity in their temper or associations , differ in the degree , and somewhat in the form , of their courtesy and deference . But , whatever may be the mode , manners themselves , in their origin and purpose , are moral expressions . They do not exist because we choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together ; nor is it in our power to put them aside and do without them . And he who will not conform to the usages of the class he moves in , is justly considered as neglecting some duty , and infringing some right . As expressions of respect // and good-feeling , then , the observance of manners can not necessarily or naturally lead to insincerity or folly ; and he who has brought them to the utmost perfection in himself incurs no peril on that account , unless we consider every thing unsafe in a moral view , the moment it becomes a habit . But they are more than proofs or signs of benevolence and respect . It is well remarked by Scott , " that some forms and restraints are to be observed , less in respect to others than to ourselves . " He who religiously bridles the tongue is unconsciously keeping the heart . A man may abstain from loud laughter , not merely because some think it rude , but also because he feels that it encourages frivolity and endangers seriousness of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of another , be it upon his weak point or not , may be , and often is , the beginning of hard-heartedness , and some portion of our delicacy is about to be sacrificed . A system of manners , then , perfectly acquired , is a perpetual hint to watchfulness over ourselves ; it is a guardian of our self-respect and of our benevolence . Now suppose a man to adopt this system , and carry it to perfection for the purpose of substituting it in the place of feeling ; and he at once gives up the whole ground and reason of manners . He does more than practise forms unmeaningly from habit , in which case he is rarely misunderstood ; he deliberately and purposely makes the form supreme , and gives it an exaggerated significance . Whatever his intentions may be , he has exposed himself to the corrupting power of falsehood , in one of its most treacherous shapes . If religion eleyates sculpture and painting , it is itself debased when the image is worshipped . And so it is with benevolence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original sentiment is abused and degraded . And it is , in part , for this substitution , that Chesterfield has been condemned . To take him on the most favorable side ; - he abhorred every practice and appearance which unfitted men for agreeable intercourse , which broke the level and smoothness of elegant life , and reminded people unpleasantly of individual peculiarities . Gentlemen should meet on , at least , as comfortable an equality as boors . This is well enough . But boors are at least sincere . Will it do for gentlemen to be sincere ? He evidently thought not . He had no faith in training a good feeling to observances , and // put it aside as merely useful in suggesting convenient signs . He probably never asked himself how much inward disease he might cause , or exasperate , by his attempt to improve the complexion with lotions . He admired the benevolent air of society which gave the French their charm , and thought the only way to make an Englishman tolerable was to apply the foreign varnish ; when probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit the English character , and that true ease of conversation which shows that , by conquering embarrassment , we have become more truly ourselves . His renedy for the false shame of his countrymen was to send them out into the world to get an armour of usages for security ; the defences and resources that might have been found in good principles and dispositions were overlooked . In general , he would rather make a false man to his taste , than honestly educate a savage according to his nature . And yet we can hardly say , that we have felt a proper indignation at reading letter after letter , addressed to a mere lad , and a beloved child , inculcating a systematized lie as his true preparation for meeting the world . This instruction is all so blended with parental solicitude , so mixed up with other things , and relieved by wise observations on human life and excellent rules of conduct for anybody ; there is such avowed abhorrence of every thing mean and low in our vices , such careful distinction between deceptive reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally , as if the boy must at once perceive that things are just so and must be so , however it may be disguised by prudes and priests ; the manner , moreover , is so frank , tinpretending , and business-like , and allowances are so charitably made for every thing but standing ill with others for what cause soever ; that one reads on with more patience than he may afterwards be disposed to justify . And , *f the worst should happen , if the enchanter should quite overcome him , is it no alleviation that , whatever his change may be , he will not be transformed into a swine ? It is not common to call such a man as Chesterfield a fanatic ; but he must have been one , in no ordinary degree . To take a single instance , what religionist was ever more scrupuious in attention to externals ? What care , what torture , to train the person . What a battle with self for appearance only . A fiercer struggle would not be required to make us spiritual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be disputed ; but one is surprised at the prominence that is given to them , the ceaseless warnings that are uttered , and the variety of methods suggested . lie forgets , that , with Chesterfield , they are of infinite value in themselves ; that they must be made a part of the man , and be cultivated as some would cultivate the affections . We can recall but one other authentic case in which this part of the system has been put in full practice ; and , as it xviii serve better than a caricature , we xviii venture to state the process . We refer to the case of Mr. Day , the author of Sandford and Merton , and a fanatic of another sort , as he detested fashion , dancing , dress , and all other frivolities of the kind . We borrow the particulars from Mr. Edgeworth 's autobiography . It seems , that Mr. Day had become attached to a lady of the family , so distinguished in the history of Mr. Edgeworth 's marriages and , though " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , to please , " the lady appears to have been sufficiently interested to put him upon his probation ; and , on Chesterfield 's plan , she sent him to the great foreign school of accomplishments . Mr. Edgeworth , who accompanied him , says , " We determined to pass the winter at Lyons , as it was a place where excellent masters , of all sorts , were to be found ; and here Mr. Day put himself to every species of torture to compel his anti-gallican limbs , in spite of their natural rigidity , to dance and fence , and manage the great horse . To perform his promise to Miss E. Sneyd honorably , he gave up seven or eight hours of the day to these exercises , for which he had not the slightest taste , and for which , except horsemanship , he manifested the most sovereign contempt . It was astonishing to behold the energy with which he persevered in these pursuits . I have seen him stand between two boards which reached from the ground higher than his knees ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permit him to bend his knees , and to rise up and sink down . By these means , M. Huise proposed to force Mr. Day 's knees outward ; but his screwing was in vain . I could not help pitying my philosophic friend , with his feet in the stocks , a book in his hand , and contempt in his heart . " - Memoirs of Richard Lovell Edgeworlh , Vol. i. pp. 260 , 261 . Some time afterwards Mr. Edgewortli states the result . " Upon Mr. Day 's return from France , Miss Elizabeth // Sneyd found , that , notwithstanding all the exertions he had made , and the pains he had taken to improve his manners and person , she could not feel for him the sort of attachment which was necessary for her happiness and for his in marriage . " - pp. .335 , 336 . Chesterfield 's theory of manners , then , is deliberately formed and carried out upon the idea , that appearance ( including not only the person but our whole demeanor towards others ) is all-sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , this appearance can only he secured by observation of life and constant practice . Spontaneous feelings could be of no use to a pantomime ; they would only embarrass the process of artificial movements , as the fairest wind is said to disturb the action of the apparatus of a steam-vessel . And now we are brought to the motive for urging this exaggerated regard for externals . The result , indeed , would ordinarily be the same , whatever the intention ; but the intention is clear . Man is held up as an object of distrust and contempt . He is cunning , but weak , and to be approached on the side of his weaknesses . You are not to reform him , or inquire whether your artifices will not help to perpetuate the evil ; but , taking him as he is , you are to circumvent him and use him for your purposes and this you can best accomplish by appearances and the hypocrisy of benevolence . " The more you know men , the less you will trust them . The same arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for balls , bats , and halfpence , men will make use of with you , when you are a man , for other purposes . " - Letters to his Son , p. 136 . If you would particularly gain the affection and friendship of particular people , whether men or women , endeavour to find out their predominant excellency , if they have one , and their prevailing weakness , which everybody has ; and do justice to the one , and something more than justice to the other . " " You will easily discover every man 's prevailing vanity , by observing his favorite topic of conversation ; for every man talks most of what he has most a mind to be thought to excel in . Touch him but there , and you touch him to the quick . " " Women have , in general , but one object , which is their beauty ; upon which scarce any flattery is too gross for them // to swallow . Nature has hardly formed a woman ugly enough to be insensible to flattery upon her person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all women , the least sensible of flattery upon that head ; she knows it is her due , and is therefore obliged to nobody for giving it her . She must be flattered upon her understanding ; which , though she may possibly not doubt of herself , yet she suspects that men may distrust . " - pp. 161 , 162 . " Seek for men 's particular merit , their predominant passion , or their prevailing weakness ; and you will then know what to bait your hook with to catch them . " - p. 210 . " Please the eyes and the ears ; they will introduce you to the heart ; and nine times in ten the heart governs the understanding . " Speak advantageously of people behind their hacks , in companies who , you have reason to believe , will tell them again . " - p. 255 . Showish and shining people always get the better of all others , though ever so solid . " - p. 408. * Of course , we shall not quote passages , in which he recommends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents his own example ; or those , in which he describes the arts hy which a married woman is to he corrupted , and which the editor , 1'Jrs . Stanhope , has done what she could to vindicate . In fact , these passages give us no more unfavorable opinion of the writer and his system , than those we have already copied ; and we can not but regard the suggestions as entering naturally into the general culture of his " unseasoned courtier . " It is probable , that Chesterfield has been judged hy the world , on all points , by the moral unsoundness exhibited in When we think over the long and laborious process of deception which Chesterfield prescrihed , to equip his son for dealing with men , we are a*reeahly reminded of a more easy and succinct method , which was adopted by his kinsman and contemporary , Earl Stanhope , while Secretary of State . We do not know , whether the whole race had a turn for artifice ; but , . if there must be false dealing , we prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wortley Montagu , in a letter to her daughter , the Countess of Bute , says , " t can truly affirm , that I never deceived anybody in my life , excepting ( which has often , I confess , happened undesigned ) by speaking plainly ; as Earl Stanhope used to say , during his ministry , he always imposed on the foreign ministers by telling them the naked truth , which , as they thought impossible to come from the mouth of a statesman , they never failed to write information to their respective courts directly contrary to the assurance he gave them . " // the " Letters*to his Son . " He has been held as responsible for the work as if he had published it . He came into our houses with his system , and sought the confidence of our boys and young men , and gave a pungency and authority to his instructions by offering them as the real communications of a parent to a cherished son . A vicious romance , or unsound theories and speculations upon life and character , conveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world against him . We have here one of the cases , in which an able man excites more alarm , and does more mischief , by direct appeals to consciousness and experience , than by presenting glowing pictures to the imagination . It is not surprising , then , that he has been condemned in the mass . But the reader , who has forbearance enough to discriminate , will not deny , that these " Letters " contain a great amount of practical good sense ; that the sketches of character and defects are in the first style of diverting and instructive satire ; and that the composition has the animation and grace which we should expect from a highly cultivated mind , occupied with delightful visions of a young man rising into brilliant fame under its guidance . And the reader , who can be satisfied with skilful and perfectly intelligible accounts of man as he is , - the superficial man of daily life , - and who can believe , that principles , drawn from observation of men under such an aspect merely , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connexion with the world has given to himself , - involve the whole of human nature ; will discover , in these " Letters , " as good a summary of wisdom as he ever found in a collection of French , or , perhaps , Roman sentences . Johnson 's short-hand condemnation of Chesterfield has already been cited ; and it is faulty in nothing , but that it appears to include all that can be said of him . Such is the sophistry of many a brilliant antithesis . Cowper 's amplified execration is scarcely less spirited , and it has the same defect . Thou polished and high-finished foe to truth , Gray-beard corrupter of our listening youth ; To purge and skim away the filth of vice , That so refined it might the more entice , Then pour it on the morals of thy son ; To taint his heart was worthy of thine own ! // Now , while the poison all high life pervades , Write , if thou canst , one letter from the shades ; One , and one only , charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , live yet ; One sad epistle thence may cure mankind Of the plague spread by bundles left behind . " - The Progress of Error . Mr Buiwer , who , by his abhorrence of cant and usage , is made fond of paradoxical interpretations and defences , has come out earnestly on the side of Chesterfield . In his " Disowned , " he makes Mr. Talbot say , " It seems strange enough , that a free country , like ours , where it is important to please every class , should , of all modern nations , appear the most zealously to condemn , rather than merely to neglect , manners and address . " Mr. Talbot considers the sea of manners as unexplored , or that Chesterfield is almost the only Englishman who has attempted a chart of the unknown deep . And Mr. Bulwer , speaking in his own person , is of opinion , that Chesterfield has been misunderstood , as to his " Letters " especially , and says , he intends to take an early opportunity " to do justice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be venerated as " the philosopher of benevolence , and the expounder of its more subtile , yet more customary laws . " We know not , whether Mr. Bulwer has ever followed out his purpose ; but we have no doubt , that the vindication would be ingenious and eloquent , and that he would make Chesterfield an object of admiration and gratitude . He would , we think , select the two following passages as examples of the benevolent spirit , and we can easily imagine his method of analyzing and applying them in support of the benevolent theory . " With a passionate desire of pleasing everybody , I came , by degrees , to please some ; and , I can assure you , that what little figure I have made in the world , has been much more owing to that passionate desire I had of pleasing universally , than to any intrinsic merit or sound knowledge I might ever have been master of . My passion for pleasing was so strong ( and I am very glad it was so ) , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman I saw in love with me , and every man I met with admire me . Without this passion for the object , I should never have been so attentive to the means ; and I own , I can not conceive how it is possible for any man of // good nature and good sense to be without this passion . Does not good nature incline us to please all those we converse with , of whatever rank or station they may be ? And does not good sense and common observation show , of what infinite use it is to please ? Oh ! but one may please by the good qualities of the heart , and the knowledge of the head , without that fashionable air , address , and manner , which is mere tinsel . I deny it . A man may be esteemed and respected , but I defy him to please without them . Moreover , at your age , I would not have contented myself with barely pleasing . I wanted to shine , and to distinguish myself in the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . And that ambition or vanity , call it what you please , was a right one ; it hurt nobody , and made me exert whatever talents I had . It is the spring of a thousand right and good things . " - Letters to his Son , p. 423 . " There is , in all good company , a fashionable air , countenance , manner , and phraseology , which can only be acquired by being in good company , and very attentive to all that passes there . When you dine or sup at any well-bred man 's house , observe carefully how he does the honors of his table to the ditl'erent guests . Attend to the compliments of congratulation or condolence that you hear a well-bred man make to his superiors , to his equals , and to his inferiors watch even his countenance and his tone of voice , for they all conspire in the main point of pleasing . There is a certain distinguishing diction of a man of fashion . He will not content himself with saying , like John Trott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you much joy ' ; or to a man who has lost his son , Sir , I am sorry for your loss ' ; and both with a countenance equally unmoved . But he will say , in effect , the same thing , in a more elegant and less trivial manner , and with a countenance adapted to the occasion . He will advance with warmth , vivacity , and a cheerful countenance to the new-married man , and , embracing him , perhaps say to him , If you do justice to my attachment to you , you will judge of the joy that I feel upon this occasion , better than I can express it . ' To the other , in affliction , he will advance slowly , with a grave composure of countenance , in a more deliberate manner , and , with a lower voice , perhaps say , I hope you do me the justice to be convinced , that I feel whatever you feel , and shall ever be affected where you are concerned . ' " - Ibid. , p. 480 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's benevolence , because it appears to us to be a part , and in furtherance , // of his own habit of confounding things . We have regarded his system of exterior kindness as superficial and selfish . If it be in reality a benevolent one , it is so no further than as it pampers the sensitiveness and weakness of men , and their morbid craving for the signs of sympathy and honor ; - no further , than as it attempts to systematize whatever practices have been found to be generally agreeable among men and flattering to their infirmities , and then recommends these to all as the only practicable method of keeping up such a demonstration of good-will , as all can appreciate and make . We know , that it is difficult to draw the line between good social dispositions and actions generally , and a sickly regard to false exactions ; and , to avoid useless discriminations , we shall venture to say , that we dislike much of the current language on the subject of pleasing . We dislike the phrase , " trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice itself leads to effeminacy or fraud . It puts men in wrong positions towards each other . To shun giving needless offence is one thing , and most important . This passive good-will or negative benevolence is not sustained without effort ; and , as it is little noticed by those whom it spares , it is likely to be disinterested , and can scarcely do harm to either party . Then , again , to give innocent pleasure to others by active efforts and personal sacrifices in their behalf , is safe for all concerned . And to gratify our friends by our moral excellence and high reputation is a natural reward , though we should not propose it as the object , of virtuous action . And undoubtedly our customary civilities and attentions are in part designed to give pleasure . But Chesterfield 's " passionate desire of pleasing everybody , " this endeavouring so to adapt ourselves to the dispositions of others , that admiration and gratitude shall beam upon us whenever we appear , and our very persons become idols , is not the prompting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true spirit and purpose of civility . There is selfishness on both sides , and mutual mischief . Men have no right to such a show of devotion , and we have no right to offer it . We are not placed here solely or chiefly to please or be pleased , even in the best sense that we can give to these terms ; but to be good and to do good . And , so far as manners promote // these objects ( and we believe that they enter closely into the great work ) , let them be cultivated with enthusiasm , as virtues ; and , so far as they then give pleasure , they yield a natural fruit.
