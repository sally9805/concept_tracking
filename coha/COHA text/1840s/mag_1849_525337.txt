txt In the Courier and Inquirer , ( New York , ) for Aug. 8th , we find a very full and satisfactory account of the proceedings of the New York Chamber of Commerce , in regard to Mr. Whitney 's plan for a grand Pacific Railroad . The Chamber fully approves the plan , as given in Mr. Whitney 's pamphlet . A full account of it has been given in our July number . We wish to add only a few points of argument in its favor , only lightly touched upon in that article , and which from the vast importance of the subject will bear repetition . A committee had been appointed " to inquire into the expediency of any action , on the part of the Chamber , in relation to the proposed railroad of Mr. Whitney to the Pacific , " and accordingly submitted a report . The report touched first upon the importance of the plan , looking forward to the formation of a new State on the other side of the continent , and to the opening of an extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitating intercourse with our countrymen and fellow citizens on the Pacific . Assembling various considerations , it admitted the pressing necessity of some such measure , and argued that a work of the kind should be undertaken without delay . It details the main points of the plan , as we have already given them in our article alluded to above , and as they are given in Mr. W 's pamphlet . It mentions other plans su*ested by other parties . It returns to Mr. W 's plan , and states objections that have been offered to it ; one of these objections is , that the road will not perhaps pay for itself , and so come to a stand ; another is , that the profits ought to be shared by Mr. XVhirney with the people . The two objections balance each other very nicely . From fifteen to twenty-five years is the estimated time of completion . Some persons think that a quarter of a century is a longer period than twenty-five years ; but it is not . If you say the road will be finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious ; but if you say this road will demand an age , a quarter of a century , for its completion , you cast a damp over the imagination . If California becomes a rich and powerful State , it can shorten the period by pushing out a road to meet Mr. Whitney 's ; but the plan of Mr. Whitney 's road is not merely to serve California , but to provide a means of emigration to Oregon , and a rout for Asiatic commerce with this country and with Europe . For our own part , we do not believe if Mr. W 's plan is adopted , that more than ten years will have elapsed before a perfect communication is established between the Atlantic an ( l Pacific . Let Mr. Whitney carry out the road as fast and as far on as possible ; should he fall short of the end , it will then be the duty of the Pacific and Atlantic States to come in to his aid ; but he will need no aid . Energy and enterprise such as actuates our projector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already discovered in his management in these first and most difficult stages of the enterprise , the securing for it , and for himself , an unconnected and unassisted individual , the confidence of all parties , and of all sections of the country ; such auspices need no prophet to read them . To other plans submitted by other projectors the r*port found serious objections , and agreed that the proceeds of the sales of public lands ought to be relied upon for the expenses of the work . It conceded that Mr. Whitney is entitled to the credit of having offered the " first matured plan for a railroad , to connect the Atlantic with the Pacific across the continent . " It also conceded that his plan and the location of his road from Lake Michigan is the correct one ; it being imperatively necessary that this international counmunication " should be directly connected with the commerce of the vast inland seas of our continent . " It would also , urges the*report , be the shortest route The report then suggests an amendment to Mr. Whitney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land for the first five miles of the route " should be accounted for , " and that after paying the cost of construction for the first ten miles , and a liberal compensation to Mr. Whitney , the remainder should be set apart as a fund for the finishing of the road , &amp;c. ; and that the work itself should then belong to the people , and be their " heritage . " To these emendations of the plan , Mr. P. M. Wetmore offered objections of such weight , that the report was set aside , and Mr. Whitney 's plan approved by the Chamber , to use 311 // the words of the " Courier and Inquirer , " both in its conception and in its details . " Mr. Wetmore 's objections to the amendments proposed by the Report , strike us as altogether weighty and conclusive . He " was opposed to that recommendation of the Report which contemplated the withholding from Mr. Whitney the benefits that would result from the completion of the road , and vesting the property in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could devote his life and means to forward an enterprise , of which the failure would ruin him , and the success-if successful-inust accrue to the benefit of others . Besides , it was inexpedient , in his view , that the Government should have any property or interest in the matter . " XVe can not but cordially assent to Mr. Wetmore 's objections-that the Government should undertake a work which can better be accomplished by individual enterprise , and at individual risk , is no part of our creed . We maintain that the aid of Government can be constitutionally extended to works of internal improvement only when they are of a magnitude which renders their completion by comparues , States , or individuals , impossible . Every improvement that can be undertaken by one man , is best accomplished by one man . XVhen one man is unequal to the task , then let several combine ; if a combination can not effect it , and it is still agreed to be necessary to the public welfare , let towns and cities engage in it ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail , it must be undertaken by the nation . It has , however , been satisfactorily shown by Mr. Whitney , that this work can be accomplished by individual enterprise ; and we hold that a true republican economy will therefore entrust it to him ; and that government can not justly engage in it until experience has shown that the individual projector can not of himself accomplish it . By the plan of Mr. Whitney , the work , will pay for itself as it proceeds . The profits of the first sections of public land will of necessity be laid by by the contractor for the extension of the road . A failure to do this involves the failure of the entire scheme . And in case of such failure , the whole will revert to the original owners . Now , no person ever doubted the constitutionality of a grant of land for public purposes to an individual . Land is granted to soldiers and pensioners , to academies and to colonists . Land may be granted in any case where the interests of the nation require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their opponents , and even incorporated as an article of opposition into the platforms of the other party , that they entertain " vast and unlimited schemes of internal improvement , " calculated to ruin the finances , create an immense national debt , and increase to an injurious degree the patronage of the Executive . The charge is false and injurious  --  a mere " device of the enemy . " The other party know very well that none but a few schemers entertain any such wild projects . The other party are themselves perfectly willing to appropriate the national funds to national objects ; the only difference we can discover , after some years of observation , between the two parties , is in the particular appropriations . The one party wished to apply the public money , before they took abolition ground , to the extension of the national territory . The $100,000,000 which they spent in the war , the Whigs would perhaps have spent in improving the navigation of the Mississippi river , and the harbors of the lakes . The Red Sea expedition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been more profitably spent in the establishment of important light-houses ; but such remarks are invidious ; we will not oppose any measure calculated for the advance-. ment of science . That , at least , is a national and a glorious object . We only wish to remind our - readers that the two parties do not differ upon the ground that national funds must be appropriated for national purposes , but that their differences arise upon the particular choice of objects . Now this project of Mr. Whitney 's recommends itself equally to the most determined economists , and the most sanguine adventurers . It is , like the project for securing banks by public stocks , a strictly " no-party " project ; it costs nothing , and interferes with nothing ; in a word , it eludes discussion by its mere simplicity . One of the grand objections to enterprises of internal improvement is that they are converted into " jobs " for the benefit of office-holders , commissioners , and contractors . A grand Pacific railroad , managed by government commission , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment on it , large salaries would be given to the principal managers ; at each change of dynasty the old managers and contractors would be turned off , and a new swarm con* in ; a committee of Congress woukf continually sit upon it ; quarrels and jealousies would arise out of it ; in brief , it would be like the introduction of a seton , or running ulcer , upon the body of the State . It would cost perhaps $200,000,000 , would be fifty years in building , and prove a curse to all concerned in it . Again , suppose a company with a capital stock of $100,000,000 , like a vast South Sea scheme , with powers , military and judicial , for the management of such a road . It might be got up in a fit of national enthusiasm , and would end in the ruin of thousands . Twenty years would elapse before it could pay a dividend In a word , we see nothing feasible that has 312 // After last line on page 312 , read first line on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , we see nothing feasible that has been offered except this plan of Mr. Whitney's. lie has , &amp;c. &amp;c .

Tammany Hall is making a strong effort to sustain the Baltimore platform , and the old organization . It has adopted a series of resolutions , rejects the anti-slavery basis , regretting the extension of slavery , condemning it as an evil and re-adopting the Syracuse organization of 1847 . A letter of Gov . Seward has appeared in the Philadelphia North American . In this letter he says , " Experience has shown that the counsels of that party lead to domestic prosperity , while they are imbued with national moderation and magnanimity . But there is now opening a field of political action hitherto unexplored by parties , and untrodden by statesmen . The inevitable conflict between human slavery and the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth at last . The *policy of abolishing slavery in the Federal District , and of prohibiting it in the Federal Territories , has excited a debate which pervades the Union and disturbs and tends to disorganize all existing parties and combinations . Intemperate zeal on either side of the debate threatens the subversion of the Government and the dissolution of the Union itself . " Gov . Seward considers that the period has arrived when slavery should no longer be protected against legitimate constitutional efforts to conflue it within the States*where it is sanctioned by constitutions and laws . Gov . Seward represents that extreme of the Whig party , in the North , which in ines towards abolitionism . He makes no secret of his opinions . lie will avoid any concessions to slavery beyond the letter of the Constitution .

It is very probable , however , that the managers of the Maine Loco-foco party are quite ignorant of their own history . GEN . CAss , in reply to Col. Webb 's letter from Michilimachinac , in which the general is represented as being a very estimable and worthy character , but as having two sets of political principles , one set merely speculative , for his private entertainment and his friends , the other , practical , at the service of the people , has written a very long and tedious letter to Thomas Ritchie of the Union , from which we gather that he is not pleased with the moral position assigned him by Col. Webb , and wishes to assume a different one-he , however , professes to have a great friendship for the Col. , and does not seem to be at all angry with him for representing that his ( the general 's ) private opinions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , did Col.

C. , ) says that the Baltimore resolutions contain his sentiments on the tariff . He denies the existence of a double conscience in himself . He says it can not be inferred from the Nicholson letter , that he is in favor of the extension of slavery ; that he merely says that he did not believe that slavery would be established in the new territories , and that he did not oppose the Wilmot proviso from any desire to see it established there . He quotes the opinions of Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Walker , that slavery will not be established beyond the Rio del Norte. lie dislikes the Wilmot proviso because it is disagreeable to the South-he regards it , in short , as an incendiary measure . He denies that there is in the Constitution any power granted to Congress to legislate over the territories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ought not to depend on loose constructions of the Constitution . He says that the people of the territories are fully competent to conduct their own affairs , and immediately after he says that one of our first duties is that of " organizing a government for California . " He says , " Is California to become a prey to intestine dissentions in the absence of all law , or is it to be driven separate from us because we neglect one of our first duties , that of organizing a government for it ? " It is perfectly clear to our own minds that General Cass is really and strongly opposed to the extension of slavery ; but it is his policy not to say so in a letter to the organ of Southern Democracy . He opposes the Wilmot proviso because he thinks that it is an unnecessary measure , but he trusts to the people of the territories themselves , to exclude slavery from their soil .

He says , " 1 have never disputed the right of Congress to improve some of the great harbors , and rivers , and lakes of the Union . " " While the Democratic party deny the power to devise and carry on a vast system of operations , whose pecuniary extent no man can foresee , and what is still worse , whose corrupting influence , as well in the legislature as out of it , can not be viewed but with the most serious apprehension  --  the great majority of that party has advocated particular appropriations , justified by the circumstances of position and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of the Democratic party is merely this , to take care not to enlarge too much the circle of power . This is all that we can gather of importance from the general 's very long , very obscure , and very judicious epistle . Moderate Whigs will hardly quarrel with its sentiments . We know of no Whig who contends for a lavish and unlimited expenditure of the public money , and we are very sure that the present administration has no disposition nor the remotest desire to plunge the country into a " vast and unlimited system of internal improvements . " All that conservative Whigs hope for , if we have any knowledge of that party , is to have a judicious care of the national interests , and to see that wherever a moderate and reasonable expenditure will largely increase the wealth of any section of the country , that such expenditure should be made . This too , it seems is good " Northern " Democratic doctrine . The parties can not be divided by such a line as has been drawn by General Cass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians , that the Whigs intend to rush into a " vast and general expenditure of money for public improvements , all over the country , is simply a foolish absurdity . Mr. Calhoun has replied to Mr. Benton 's attack upon him , and the reply , like the attack , is tedious and minute To the ears of our Northern readers , the report of this distant cannonading sounds very faint and far , and it is probable that few of them will have the leisure or the patience to wade through the periods of Mr. Calhoun 's reply . This reply is published under the title of " An Address , " &amp;c. and is equal in length to an article of twenty-four pages of the " American Review . " The address opens with a scornful repulse to Mr. Benton personally , intimating , and indeed plainly declaring , that the South Carolinian regards that " oldest senator " as a person quite beneath notice . Notwithstanding this effort of wounded pride , the entire address is a minute and circumstantial reply to Mr. Benton 's charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is purely a rhetorical scorn . Mr. Calhoun insists that not he , but Mr. Benton , most be considered as the true enemy of the South-that Mr. Benton , not he , is the deserter from the good cause ; he insinuates that he is not only a deserter but a traitor , though he does not apply that word to him . In reply to Mr. Benton 's charge , that the resolutions offered by Mr. Calhoun , claiming the right of Southerners to carry slaves into the new territories , were calculated for disunion ; he insists that these resolutions are confined to asserting principles merely . He insinuates rhetorically a commendation of the plan for a Southern convention , which will remind our readers of the famous Hartford convention , and of the abuse heaped upon it , by the South . He applies the word " arrogant " to the fixed determination of the Northern members during the last session not to accept a compromise ; which reminds us of his application of the word " insolent " to the expressed desire of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says that Mr. Benton had the " effrontery , " to call it by no harsher name , to charge him with the base purpose of destroying the Union . We are led here to ask which of the two parties , the nullifiers of Sooth Carolina , or the Northern opposition to slavery extension , are most liable to the charge of CoL. Benton , especially when we find in Southern Democratic newspapers very plain c*eclurations to the effect that slavery must be first maintained , and the Union itself ; treated as a seconda y interesU ; and in this very address of Mr. Cathoun 's an oblique apology given , more forcible than a direct one , for the plan of a Southern convention of States . Lie repels Mr. Benton 's rhetorical assertion that he ( Mr. Calhoun ) is the " author " of the Wilmot proviso with a great deal of indignatior . Mr. Benton called it the " Calhoun proviso , ' meaning by this that the proviso men were driven into that measure by the violent policy of the South . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so weak a line of defense as to deny as literal what Mr. Benton 's readers woud of course understand as rhetorical . Every one knows that the Wilmot proviso did not enanate from Mr. Calhoun ; and that the Missouri compromise which Mr. Benton also charges upon that gentleman by a similar rhetorical figure was carried through by Henry Clay . Mr. Calhoun 's agency in the matter extended only to the making a necessity for the introduction of those measures . The address asserts that the South gave in to the compromise , but never yielded its opinion as to the power of Congress over the territories . Our readers will perhaps consider that an agreement in Congress by which slavery was excluded from a portion of the public territories , call that agreement by what name you 314 sept. // qwq consequent authorship in Mr. Calhoun of the Missouri compromise ; and by a similar figure ,  --  the proviso being founded on the same power which sustains the compromise-the authorship in the same person of the Wilmot proviso itself . After disposing of this portion of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to refute at large the general charge against him , of bein a disturber of the Union . ile nevertheless defends his own principles introduced during the discussion of the Oregon Bill . " I will venture to say , " says Mr. C. , " they ( the arguments against restriction ) will never be refuted . Few have undertaken to refute them , and those who have undertaken it have signally failed . " It is the opinion of one of the few who have undertaken to refute the hon. gentleman 's arguments , that they have been once , at least , completely and easily refuted ; and such is the opinion of many . If Mr. C. is curious in the matter , and wishes to speak from ocular proof , he will find a full and satisfactory refutation of his own doctrine in an article on the Oregon Bill , in the number of this journal , for August , 1848 . It would be impossible within the limits to which we are restricted to give even a condensed abstract of the several passages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal repulses-which , though fine in themselves , establish Mr. C. 's position as a dignified gentleman , moving , as he intimates , in a sphere much grander than Colonel Benton 's , namely , the sphere of a philosophic statesman , yet make nothing for him as to the particular policy in question-suffice it that we touch lightly upon the remaining points of the defense . Mr. C. charges it upon Colonel Benton , that , as early as the session of 47 , 8 , that gentleman was meditating a desertion to the abolitionists . Col. B. asserts in his attack , that Mr. Calhoun " gave away Texas " by the Florida Treaty , Texas being a part of Louisiana ; whereas , in the debate on annexation in 1844 , he himself said , that " Texas never approached the Rio Grande , excepting near its mouth ; " adding that Mexico lay on both sides of the river . At the same time , cajolling the South , and for aggravation , he dwelt upon the value of Texas as a slave territory ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , running north and south , giving up one half to abolition . And , again , by voting for the bill which declared war against Mexico , he directly admitted that Texas did extend to the Rio Grande . " If it did not , and the assertion of the bill that blood had been shed upon American soil ' was a false assertion , then , " says Mr. C. , " the war stands without a justification . " But , say we , the most remarkable circumstance of all is this , that Mr. C. does not seem to perceive that the real injustice lay in the assumption of our title to the territory as a ground of war . It is a criminal evasion , and betrays a *vicked intention , to engage in war for the possession of a debatable land , under the assumption of a complete and unquestionable ownership . The ownership of the territory was a subject first of legal investigation , then of diplomacy and negotiation ; and finally , in case of extreme and evident necessity , of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas by the Florida treaty ; but as the treaty was confirmed by the unanimous vote of the Senate , and Mr. C. one of six , and the youngest member of Mr. Monroe 's cabinet , the charge of Mr. Benton is an absurdity . Mr. Calhoun , however , defends that treaty , and gives most excellent reasons for it . The next charge against Mr. C. is , that a certain strip of land , enough to form two States , lying west of Arkansas , was given up to the Indians as a permanent abode , and was lost to the slave States , while* Mr. Calhoun was Secretary of War and member of Mr. Monroe 's administration . Mr. C. shows , however , that nothing was lost , but a great deal gained , by that transaction , and that the conditions of the Indian title were not in the least altered by it . Another charge of the same character is still more completely refuted by Mr. C. Again , he is charged by Col. Benton with supporting abolition in a State because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend the Missouri compromise line to the western boundary of Texas ; in reply to which ' charge , Mr. C. throws off the responsibility of the resolution . Col. Benton himself favored a resolution by which Texas was to have been divided by a compromise line running north and south . The last charge is of the same character with the others ; the entire series being an attempt by Col. Benton to prove that Mr. C 's policy has been uniformly injurious to the South and to the slave power . It refers to the Ashburton treaty . Touching the case of the Creole and other vessels , Mr. C. says he voted for the Ashburton treaty , and by a speech in its favor , saved it from rejection . Mr. C. then alludes to the Oregon controversy with England ; he says that the two countries were on the very eve of a rupture , and when he took his seat in the Senate , two or three weeks after the commencement of the session , he found a bill on its passage without opposition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the wishes of the entire West , which was strongly in its favor-tlli t although he was then a candidate for the presidency , he did not neglect or swerve from his duty to avoid the opposition of the West . Col. Benton on the other hand , went for the bill ; its rejection through Mr. C 's opposition saved the country 316 *ept. // f *rorn a war with England . He argues , ( reurning to the subject of the Ashburton treaty ) that although it did not contain any stipulation in favor of owners of vessels ( which was an imperfection in it , ) yet that much ground was gained by the negotiations . Mr. C. then enters largely upon the circumstances and merits of the treaty . England had taken the ground that vessels driven by stress of weather into her ports in the West Indies and having slaves on board , those slaves should be liberated , because slavery had been abolished in the West Indies ; that Lord Ashburton , during the negotiations , had engaged that instructions should be given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not officiously interfere with American vessels , driven by accident or violence into their ports ; that the laws and duties of hospitality should be executed . Mr. C. contends that by this admission on the part of Lord Ashburton , which was accepted as a pledge by our Executive , the objects of the negotiations were secured , and the principles contended for , established . The address passes to a general reply-takes up the argument against the power of Congress and re-enforces it-asserts that no absolute power was ever exercised by Congress over the territory until the passage of the Oregon territorial bill-that the various compromise bills did not contain the principle of the Wilmot proviso , a ground which we have already confuted . The Missouri compromise was an agreement of the minority with the majority . " This compromise was carried , " says Mr. Calhoun , " by the almost united vote of the North against the South . " The compromise was therefore no compromise , it was on the contrary the measure of a majority , and has precisely the force of a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority in Congress can , either by compromise , by ordinance , or by law , exclude slavery from any part of the public territory : if that is what Colonel Benton means , by saying that the compromise gave rise to , or contained the principles of the Wilmot proviso , we think him unquestionably right , and we can not but express our surprise that Mr. Calhoun , with as clear an intellectual insight as he commonly manifests , should be unable to comprehend the meaning of what Colonel Benton says , when he insists upon placing the proviso and the compromises upon the same ground . Mr. Calhoun next denies that slavery is local in its character-he denies that slave property differs from any other property-he denies that slavery is a condition established by the law only-he says that the relation of master and slave was one of the first and most universal forms in which property existed-he says it is probably more ancient than separate and distinct property in lands , and quite as easily defended on abstract principles : the reply to this is easy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Property in lands is established by law , for by law property in lands has sometimes been destroyed . Laws are founded in the physical and moral necessity of the people ; they must harmonize with , or rather they must express , the progressive condition of the people : the law-making power is established by the strongest for the defense of the weakest  --  the antiquity of an institution is a presumption in its favor , but not a proof of its excellence . Slavery is a very ancient institution , and yet there are nations , and those the most enlightened , where it does not exist . Slavery is a consequence of a relationship of injustice and violence . Republican equality is a consequence of a relationship of justice and humanity . If slavery did " not originate in the acts of a legislature , " as Mr. Calhoun asserts , it is nevertheless protected and maintained by legislation . It has been abolished in the Northern States by legislation , it can be abolished in Southern States by legislation , and it will probably be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's doctrine requires however a more enlarged examination than our present limits will permit . It is unnecessary to enter upon a second refutation of this theory of the general government , as that has been already completely done in a number of this Journal for August , 1848 . The remainder of the address is chiefly occupied in pointing out the motives of Colonel Benton , political am'id personal , and concludes with a strong manifestation in favor of the Union , with the usual prayerful and oblique threat against those who are endangering the Union by attempting to prevent the extension of slavery . " Gen's. houston and Rush , " says the N. Y. Tribune , quoting the N. 0 . Cresent , Senators in Congress from the State of Texas , addressed a public meeting in Marshall , Texas , on the 14th nit . Both these gentlemen withheld their names from Calhoun 's Southern address , and one , Gen. II . voted for the Oregon bill . They entered upon a justification of their conduct . Gen. R. spoke first He hall never wavered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit that slavery is an evil ; but he would not be Mr. Calhoun 's follower ; he objected to the tone of the address , and to its assumption of the eminent importance of the crisis . The men who signed that address would be dishonored if they did not fight , but no such time had arrived . What was said in it about the rights of the South was too indefinite , and might mean disunion and war ; there were pass ges in the address which declared that unless the North ceased its course of aggression , that the slaves would assume the place of the whites and the whites become degraded like slaves . lie believed in no such thing . If disunion was 1849. 317 // not intended it should not be threatened-he spoke warmly in favor of the Union , and thought there was no hope of reconstructing as good a government . Gen. Houston followed . He spoke vehemently . He called Mr. Calhoun a great mischief-maker ; he intimated that the people of Oregon had asked only for what was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri compromise . As for the Wilmot proviso , he looked to have the President arrest it with a veto , but even if approved by him , he would oppose it by lawful and constitutional means , after which we might talk of committees of vigilance and safety . Mr. Calhoun was known more than once to have killed off his friends , but he was never known to have killed an enemy . He reviewed Mr. C's. political course with great severity . Mr. C's. address to the South was sectional , and therefore fanatical ; he said , we must sustain the Union . The Editor of the " Texas Republican , " who gives these speeches in full , dissents from the opinion of both speakers ; thinks they have departed from the democratic faith , and that they do not truly represent the South . It is evident that the two senators will side with Col. Benton and his friends against any concerted movement on the part of the South . Cal jfornia . The mode of digging gold in California is described in a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass . You commence by digging a hole about six feet square , sinking it through water and clay , sometimes to the depth of twelve and fourteen feet , trying occasionally with y our tin pan to ascertain whether the earth contains any gold . The labor is frequently performed under a hurning sun , and often without any return for your labor ; for it is a matter of chance whether you hit upon a rich deposit or not . Gold at the surface is found only in small quantities , the large yields are by deep digging . If any man is fortunate enough to find a few ounces at the surface , it is heralded by the storekeepers and others interested in promoting emigration , to all parts of the world , while nothing is heard of the thousands who are daily undergoing extreme labor , sickness , and privation , without a return sufficient to pay their expenses . XVe observe a general disposition in the newspapers to abate somewhat of their glowing representations , in regard to the yields of the California mines . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated April , which says that when a person arrives at San Francisco the journey is not half-performed . One has to carry one 's own blanket , tools , and provisions , and climb over the mountains on foot . For a very considerable pcrtion of the year , a very small portion only of tue placers can be worked , in consequence of the excessive cold in one season ; the excessive heat in another , and the periodical rise and overflow of the rivers . The miner digs through broken rocks and gravel clearing away a considerable space , until he reaches a bed of yelloW alluvial sand , a few inches thick , in which is the gold ; a shovel or handful of this sand yields a few specks or pieces of gold ; the light sand being washed away by hand in the river . These sandy deposits do not underlie the surface uniformly , hut are collected in hollows and on slopes . There are no certain indications of the existence of these beds , and you may dig in many places successively without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums by good luck , while hundreds have not made their expenses . The correspondent says , " Moving the rocks of all sizes , mixed with broken trees and gravel to find the gold , and afterward washing it out , is the heaviest work a man can do . I learn from the miners that not one in one hundred would have come if they had seen as much as I have , and three out of four that have come would not work at them if the mines had been near their homes . " This party made together only $8 the day , apiece , which does not pay their expenses , besides which there is outfit and voyage home , and the necessary interruption by heat , cold , and rise of rivers . The Steamer Panama brings home six disappointed gold-seekers , and a gambler , who shows $30,000 in gold dust , the result of three months play in San Francisco . A translation in the N. Y.

At an average , not more than two out of a hundred find anything , and even if found , " it is got with vast trouble , working with crowbars in a hard soil , often " in water up to the knees , shivering with cold , just as in any other mine . Nor can I describe the sufferings and privations of those who go to the placers . " The enormous cost of transporting luggage , the labor of ascending and descending mountains , the dreadful anxieties , * , fevers , danger of life , and uncertainty* in the end , make it the most undesirable of all possible adventures . " There are now at the mines some 3000 Mexicans ; 4000 Peru , Chili , San Luis , and Central America ; 2000 Spaniards , English , French , &amp;c. &amp;c. ; 1000 Californians ; 3000 Americans ! in all about 13,000 ; of whom 8000 work the mines , averaging perhaps four days ' labor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 are in business ; 1000 in mechanical labor ; 2000 gamblers and drunkards . " The writer of this article declares that the 318 Sept. // missionaries , who controlled the country before the Americans conquered it , knew of the existence of the placers . He thinks that the colonization of the country and the introduction of American commerce will be a benefit to Central America and Chili ; but that San Francisco , as a port of deposit , will lessen the importance of Valparaiso . The political spirit of the American population in California is just what we should expect and desire . The Legislative Assembly of San Francisco have issued a manifesto , ( see Herald , July 30th , ) setting forth the circumstances of their origin , the perilous condition they are in , from the want of a popular government emanating from , and therefore respected by , the people ; and condemning , in no measured terms , the neglect of Congress to provide a government for them , ( a neglect proceeding , as every one knows , from the too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The manifesto claims for the people of California all the rights and privileges of citizens , and complains somewhat na*rely of their being taxed when they are not represented ; the authors of the manifesto quite forgetting that the entire region was purchased at a cost of $20,000,000 , by the United States , and that vast expenses have been incurred , and are constantly incurred by the Union , for the protection of the newfledged liberties of California . The manifesto contains the usual declaration of human rights , but says nothing at all of the equally valid and natural rights of governments . " The people of California , then , have certain inalienable rights , ' and , to secure these , ' they have , in common with all men , the right to institute government . ' If the rights themselves be inalienable , the means to secure them must be equally so . We therefore assume it as a self-evident truth , that the people of California have the inherent right , in the absence of any territorial organization by Congress , to institute government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its just powers from the consent of the governed . ' The right to govern the people of California must reside somewhere , and it must , and of right ought , to be exercised by some power . If it reside at large in the people of the United States , then they have not exercised it , for they have not spoken through the legally constituted tribunals of the country , the only legitimate mode in which their will could be expressed . They have , therefore , abdicated the right of government here for the time being , and , by their neglect , the people of this country can not be deprived of their inalienable rights ; and the right to institute government must devolve upon the people here , until the mother country shall choose to act . The powers of government can not lie dormant , to the ruin of a people , without their consent . It is the duty of the government of the United States to give us laws ; and , when that duty is not performed , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This very ridiculous paragraph is followed by a goode sensible proposal for a convention , ( to organize a government , ) to be assembled forthwith . The moment they have a constitution digested , they are to ask to be admitted into the Union . In the Tribune , July 31st , we find a proclamation of Governor Riley , who seems to have made himself very unpopular in California , directing the observance of the existing ( Mexican ) laws , and also providing for the better regulation of the army . The authority of this gentleman has excited a great deal of jealousy among the leading political heads . He attempted to speak at a public meeting of the friends of organization , and could not get a hearing . At the same meeting the Hon. Thomas Butler King , who went to California , it is understood , for the purpose of urging and guiding this movement , made an eloquent and effective speech in explanation of the difficulties which had impeded Congress in the attempt to form a territorial government ; and also urging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procure their speedy organization as a State , and their immediate admission into the Union . Other speeches , very spirited and able , were made by other gentlemen present . The meeting was enthusiastic , but disgraced in some measure by personalities'and unjust reflections on the Government of the United States . The most strenuous efforts are being made by well-wishers to the Union for the immediate introduction of New Mexico and California as States . If this can be effected without delay , the responsibility of introducing or rejecting slavery xviii be thrown , where it belongs , upon the States themselves . By this movement the ground will be knocked away from under the feet of the new coalition , and that party will be forced to declare themselves openly abolitionists . It is rumored that dispatches have already been received at XVashington containing positive assurance that Californi* and New Mexico will apply for admission into the Union early next winter . A consummation devoutly to be wished . It is certain that they will be supported with all the legitimate influence of the present Administration , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whigs generally as a good omen for the future . Jt is greatly to be hoped that the proviso controversy will be quashed by this measure . It has already ceased to have any value as a political maneuvre . Civilization is making rapid progress in California . Schools are opened , new towns are laid out and commenced ; public meetings are held , men of ability are elected 6L 4 , *39J // to officiate ; the Anglo-Saxon influence controls every thing . We long ago predicted the disappointment that is beginning to be felt by our financiers at the smallness of the return of precious metals from the mines . To support the army of emigrants in California , an annual outlay xviii be needed of at least $50,000,000 of the floating property of the nation , while the total annual yield of the mines , at the best estimates that we have seen , will not exceed $25,000,000 . The amount of gold taken from the mines ought to be four times the above amount , or $100,000,000 , to realize the expectations of those who predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that she xviii be a valuable acquisition to the Union . " Money has for some time been easier than has been known for years , and we must look for a change . One of the greatest anticipated sources of supply has been reduced , and most of the hopes and calculations based upon the great accession to our gold and silver currency , from the mines of California , have been in the deep bosom of the ocean buried . It has been very often remarked in financial circles , within the past three or four months , that there was no possibility of the money market again being tight , as the supply of gold from California xvould be sufficient to meet any demand for commercial purposes . To what extent these anticipations will be realized remains to be seen ; certainly not to the extent which has been predicted . California will , f2om tIiS time forward , be an important part of the Union , and the Eastern States xviii find markets for large quantities of their manufacture.s and products ; but that hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold mines in California per annum , we have great doubts . In all the calculations we have made relative to the productiveness of these mines , we have taken , as data , the reported result of the diggings for 1848 . Upon that basis , and in view of the enormous emigration , we have made large estimates . The mines have been represented as inexhaustible . As yet , nothing is known to the contrary . It has also been represented that the gold was easily obtained , in large lumps and lots , without much labor . This , we now know , is not only untrue , but that the most robust and hardy men have sacrificed their lives , in their efforts to contend against the climate and the exposure necessary to gather the glittering dust . A man must be made of malleable iron to stand the vicissitudos necessary to ensure a successful result . The four seasons of the year appear to be equally unfavorable for digging : the winter , on account of the deep snoxvs ; the spring , on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its great heat during the day , and cold during the night ; and the fall , on account of its fever and ague . According to this there are obstacles to contend against sufficient to dishearten the most determined . There is , without doubt , all the gold in the mines of California that has been represented by the most sanguine and enthusiastic adventurers ; but we have lately arrived at facts relative to obtaining it , which have heretofore been studiously reserved . In the face , however , of all the known and unknown difficulties , which will have to be encountered in acquiring this precious metal , there are thousands who will , at every hazard , and at all risks , devote themselves to digging . It is too great a prize to be given up ; and , although we shall doubtless see an enormous sacrifice of life , a large amount of gold will be extracted from the soil . That the product will , under the circumstances , be large enough to have the effect anticipated upon the money markets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes be made out of the California trade ; but , on the contrary , we apprehend that much embarrassment and difficulty will be experienced by those who have become deeply involved in the movement . " - ( H6rald Aug. 2nd . ) To these considerations it must be added , that the country is not enriched by a mere increase of the amount of its circulating medium . It must be by its effects on commerce and production in the United States , and not by augmenting the quantity of gold , that it will enrich us as a nation . The following important cammunication we quote from the Republic of Aug. 4th. : A correspondent of that journal writes from San Francisco , in regard to the state of trade and speculation in that place . It is high time that the popular delusions in regard that wretched harbor , and the trade to be maintained there were dispelled . It is immoral and mischievous to endeavor any longer to sustain it . " This can never be the great seaport town of these waters . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day we have high winds and dust , in the other cold gusts and fogs . It is the most disagreeable , inhospitable climate I hax'e ever encountered in such latitudes . The thermometer to-day has been below 60g . Singular to say , the climate in the interior , within 30 miles of this place , is represented as being mild and equable . " Benicia , on the straits of Carquinas , between the bays of San Pablo and Soisson , is destined to be , in my opinion , the commercial city*of this country . Ships of the largest class can be moored close in shore . It is protected from all winds ; is open to a good fertile back country , and the site itself well suited for a city . This place has no such advantages ; but , having been made the port of entry for these waters , and having been connected in Li*IepJ. // acquired such a reputation and currency abroad that it will be a long time before its inconvenience as a city can be as generally known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benicia made a port of entry , and I hope it will succeed . " The reader *vi1l find on examination of the surveys of the harbor of Sans Francisco , made by Lieut . Wilkes , which we have given in our July number , ( p. 75. , ) that all the necessary information in regard to it has been for a long time before the public ; but has been carefully kept out of sight by editors and other persons interested in keeping up California excitement . " This state of things can not last long . I see nothing to warrant it . The business of the towns , if it were a hundred times greater than it is , the product of the mines , if they got it by pecks instead of ounces , could not warrant this inflated state of the market . A tremendous crash awaits some of these people . The dealers in dry goods and salt provisions are already beginning to suffer . Ready-made clothing ( coarse articles ) are now almost as cheap as in New York ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large shipments which are known to be afloat for this place , dry goods will sell cheaper here than in New York . I heard a man say , who has a cargo of goods on its way to him at this place , that if the crew could be saved , he hoped that the vessel might founder at sea , his insurance money being a much larger sum than that for which he would be able to sell his goods . The same remarks may now apply to salt and preserved meats . " Labor is so high here , and the difficulties of discharging cargoes so great , ( it can only be done on the flood tide , ) that nearly every vessel which has arrived here , has sunk her freight money in unloadino " and I even heard of one vessel which sailed out of this harbor a few days since , $800 poorer than she was before she undertook her voyage . On our arrival here we found some seventy vessels in the harbor . In thirty days the expected arrivals will bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year ago there were three miserable little schooners lying here . " The probability is , that California will not become either a large or a wealthy State . It has not got the materials . Oregon , on the contrary , being colonized by agriculturists , needs only to be made the terminus of the grand Pacific Railroad ; and with an orderly and industrious population , its splendid harbor of Puget Sound , one of the finest in the world , will become a port of entry and of exit , for an immense commerce . Texas . Accounts from Texas convey a dreadful image of confusion . Parties of hostile savages watch the frontier , and commit the most frightful ravages . The West Texian , published at St. Antonia , mentions the arrival at that place , on the 29th June , of Captain K. Lewis , from Brownsville via Corpus Christi , en route for Austin . He had left the Salt Lakes some twenty miles north of Brownsville , and was on his way to see Guy . Wood , for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be stationed on the lower Rio Grande , to protect the inhabitants from the incursions of the Indians-Tribune . Captain Lewis states that as many as three attacks have been made upon the Salt Lakes by different parties of Indians , and they have been as often repulsed and prevented from doing any injury , except driving away all the horses and mules belonging to the country . The Texian gives an appalling account of the atrocities of the Indians , upon the authority of Captain Lewis , which are represented to exceed anything that has occurred in Texas for the last ten years . The whole country bordering on the eastern side of the Rio Grande , from Loredo to within fifteen miles of Brownsville , is represented as one general scene of desolation  --  the heart sickens at the description . All the inhabitants have been forced to fly from their houses across to the western bank of the Rio Grande . Many have swum the river with their clothes tied upon their heads , while their wives and children have been dragged i.nto captivity by the relentless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and justly ) in relation to the defenseless and exposed condition of Texas , and adds : " Had Government at the close of the war ordered a sufficient force upon our frontier of that kind of troops capable of keeping the Indians at abeyance , it would have saved many valuable lives of our citizens , who have been butchered by the Indians , and their families now from being captives in the hands of the Camanches . " We want no better evidence of the present mode of protection on our frontier than the precedent recently exhil*jted to the world by the movement of the troops of El Paso . Six companies of the 3rd infantry arrived here last November , bound for El Paso , and immediately commenced fitting out for that expedition at an enormous expense to the Government ; they occupied nearly eight months to get ready , for it has been only a few days since they left for their place of destination , notwithstanding every exertion and vigilance were used by the officers to get under way . " The greater portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and should a thousand Camanches , or a less number , make a descent upon us , they could // Rivers , and return to their mountain homes before the commandant of the post here could get those troops in readiness to pursue them . The present defense on our border is a perfect burlesque upon military operations . The officers are discouraged for the want of men properly mounted , equipped , and provided for with supplies and transportation adequate to meet any emergency which occasion may require . Unless such arrangements are made by our Government , the troops in their present condition on our frontier are rendered a perfect nullity . " The protection of this frontier will for years he a grand item of expense for the United States , and new difficulties will continually arise until the Camanches are treated as the Seminoles were . FOREIGN . Mexico . The most influential political party at the present time is that called ) ioderados , i. e. conservatives . The object of this party , which is at present in power , notwithstanding the disorganizing attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption of the army through that influence . The partisans of the traitorous general were lately dismissed from the military service  --  a bold and useful , so far very successful measure . The great obstacle which true patriotic Mexicans have to contend with , is the poverty of the Government , and the inability to collect taxes . Entire regions of the republic have been desolated by the Indians , and the attention of Government is now chiefly directed to the defense of the people against these invaders , and to the general necessity of quieting the provinces , and inspiring confidence , after the disturbance given by the anarchy of military despotism , or rather discrganization , resulting from the almost total destruction of the Government . Jt is reported , though upon very doubtful authority , that the Americans are very popular with the lower classes , and hated , on the other hand , by the better classes . There is said also to be a party in favor of monarchy ; probably a very small one . The party of Santa Anna continues active and efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a great deal said about annexation in Vera Crux ; many people there having a great opinion of our system of government . There is said to be a powerful organization in our extreme Southern States for an armed colonization of the northern part of Mexico . We refrain giving particulars from the fear of drawing undue attention to a movement which may be of much less importance than is represented . The population of Mexico being nine-tenths uneducated , political movements in that State are of trifling interest , and seem to have no foundation to rest upon . The minds of the people are distracted by a variety of influences , and the entire country , may be characterized as a1*body striving to walk without head or heart , the lesser organs ambitious each to govern , and , failing in their turn , producing a mere chaos of factions . Hungary . There is at present very little hope for Hungary . Surrounded by hostile powers , and internally composed of a mixed population , of which the Magyar alone , composing only one half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm into the war-without credit or pecuniary resources-and , in the power of organization , several ages behind its German neighbors , this chivalrous and free-spirited people seem destined to fall before the superior resources of the two despotisms of Austria and Russia . Nothing could perhaps save the IX/lagyar race but an alliance offensive and defensive with England and Prussia ; but it is now too late for either of these powers , were they inclined to do so , to enter into the contest . What we have to look for in all human probabilitv , is a division of Hungary between the three great powers that invest her . Had the great Lord Chathamn been prime minister of England on the breaking out of the Hungarian war , we should perhaps have had England drawn into the contest , and Hungary , like Prussia might then have risen after a seven years ' contest to the rank of an independent kingdom , to become eventually the interposing power between Russia and the smaller States of Europe . On the first public appearance of the independent spirit in Hungary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army into the heart of Hungary , and took Pesth , the metropolis , with very little resistance . This was in the early part of the last winter ' * campaign . While the Austrians Were entering from the west , the Croats and military frontier districts on the east and south , furnished a second army under Jellachich , who advanced upon the cities of the lower Danube ; both of these armies were driven back by a general rising of the Magyars , and the citadel of Buda , on the south side of the Danube , was carried hy storm , by a division of the army under Gorgey . The Austrians fell back westward to Presburg , within three days ' march of Vienna . Now appeared a proclamation of the Emperor of Russia declaring the necessity , and asserting the principle of interference . The old // Emperor of Austria had resigned in favor of his son , who now sought the alliance of Russia , urging as a plea , the common interest of the two monarchs in Poland . Three armies now moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One from the northern side through Moravia , commanded by Paniutin-50,000 men ; one through Gallicia , from the north east , 100,000 , under Paskiewitch , to pass the Carpathian mountains , and overrun northern Hungary . Three other smaller divisions crossed the same range by other passes on the right and left , west , and southeast , of the main army ; while at the same time , Jallachich , the Ban or military chief of Croatia , on the*south , acted against the southern provinces that bound his district on the north and west . Either from policy , as some have faintly suggested , or from inability to meet the enemy with a sufficient force at more points than one , the Hungarian President Kossuth , retreated , for the time with his adherents , to the heart of the great Hungarian plain , Czegled . To reach the Magyars at this point the invading armies have to pass over a vast country left almost uninhabited , the cattle driven off , the bridges broken down , the green corn destroyed , and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the finest cavalry in Europe . Meanwhile several severe conflicts have taken place between the Magyar armies under their leaders Bem and Gorgey , and the invading armies . Neither side seeming unequal to the contest . By the last advices from Europe up to this date the 1 5th , it appears that the Ban of Croatia has been defeated by Bem , the leader of the southern Magyar army , and driven across the Danube , and that a considerable advantage has been gained over the Austro-Russian army by Gorgey , at Waitzen . The want of money is supplied by a government paper currency , issued by Kossuth , whose name gives it value with the people . Kossuth has made a successful effort to enlist the Jews in behalf of the Magyars ; the Jews having been themselves levied upon by the Russmns . Kossuth , it is said remains constantly on board an armed steamer , on the Danube , which transports him to Pesth , to Comorn , to Raab , to Buda , where his presence is necessary . Great crowds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clergy and people , carrying the red sword and the red cross , come up to meet him . With a powerful and rapid elocution , he preaches to them the holy war , the war of independence , and the oration is followed by hymns and prayers . It is thus that he everywhere arouses the people , and fills them with a desperate enthusiasm . Of the three leaders , Kossuth , Bem , and Gorgey , most extraordinary things are related , showing in them a character of enthusiasm , and a chivalrous magnanimity , without parallel since the days of Washington . There is a general impression that these men aim to make Hungary a republic ; its government has always been constitutional ; it will continue as before , if it attains its liberty , with perhaps the substitution of a President for life , or a continually re-elected President , instead of a king . Hungary has a powerful and wealthy aristocracy ; the people are not democrats and know nothing of democracy-of radicalism they have a German infusion , but that is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ; but they are also strongly attached to their ancient orders ; and any attempt to subvert them will , of necessity , fail ; the condition of the people will be ameliorated , liberty of conscience will be granted to all ; Kossuth has promised it to the Jews . The spirit of the present revolution seems to be created and to live in the eloquence of Kossuth ; he rouses the people to a hatred of the Emperor of Austria ; he appeals to their national prejudices . From the remote distance at which we regard the revolution in Hungary , it seems to ho managed by a few men ; and depending upon a few , and not upon a mass of educated intelligence , it is more in the hands of accident than might be desired by the friends of European liberty . The powers of the invaders and of the invaded , seem to be nearly at a balance ; report says , that General Bem , in Transylvania , has gained still farther advantages ; that a dreadful battle has been fought there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no quarter was given ; that the Russian army was driven into Transylvania -- that a corps of 15000 Russians were attacked and destroyed by only 2000 Hungarians ; on the other side , the great battle at Waitzen is spoken of as extremely disastrous to the Russians-  --  the Magyar horsemen do great execution in the pursuit , wounding dangerously great numbers of the enemy with their sabres . The latest account from all parts of Hungary are extremely favorable . The Ban Jellachich has been defeated by a division of the Magyars , &amp;c . Our limited space will not allow us to enter into the details of the numerous battles that have been lately fought in Hungary , almost all ending favorably for the cause of liberty ; and yet if Russia pursues her ancient policy , and continues to pour army after army into Hungary , we are persuaded that nothing can save that country , except an armed intervention of the neighboring powers . Oh for one years ' administration of a Mirabeau or a Lord Chatham , in France or England , to create a diversion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number we gave our readers a concise notice of the fact , that the French army under Oudinot was engaged in battering the walls of Rome , with every expectation of a severe and protracted siege . The courage or the resources of the defenders , however , gave way much sooner than was anticipated . On the 29th of June , the eighth hastion of the defenses was captured by the besiegers , and a destructive cannonade opened upon the second line of defense . At this moment consternation fell upon the city . The troops , excepting the followers of Garibaldi , the Students , and the Lombard allies , began to lose courage . The ground of St. Pectro in Montorio must be defended , but they refused to advance to its defense . Garibaldi , holding in charge the Porta St. Pancrazio. informed the Triumvirate , that he could not much longer maintain his defense ; that if they were resolved to hold out , the inhabitants must be all sent over to the left bank of the Tiber , the bridges he then destroyed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . The National Assembly thereupon resumed its daily sitting , but nothing of consequence was concluded upon , the Triumvirs not communicating the message of Garibaldi . At length a member rose and inquired why the message had not been communicated , whereupon the true position of affairs becoming known to the assembly , they passed certain resolutions , and it was determined to make the best possible terms . M. Mazzini opened communication with Oudinot endeavoring to make terms , but that general would be fettered by no conditions , and after a great deal of fruitless negotiation , it was agreed , that the French army should be permitted to enter quietly into the city . An amnesty was granted , from which , however , Garibaldi and his followers , with the foreign troops were excluded . The hour of 10 o'clock , on the evening of the 2d , was fixed upon for the entry of the French troops ; a manouvre on the part of the Romans , to give Garibaldi and his troops full time to escape . At sunset of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as his retreat was secured the defenses were left open to the French . Garibaldi it is said , took with him 4,000 infantry , and 500 horse , determined to take refuge in the Abruzzi , or to force their way into Venice . A strong division of the French army entered and took possession next morning , by the Porta del Popolo , of the famous hill Pincio . The height of St. Piedro was soon covered by the troops of France . These particulars were condensed from a full account given in the Times , and quoted from that paper by the New York Tribune . The following proclamation was published at Rome , on the 5th : " INHABITANTS OF ROME ! The general Commander-in-chief of the French army has named me governor of your city .

The French , Belgian and Spanish Ministers have gone also to Rome for the same purpose . The private correspondence of the Opinione , of Turin writes , on the 5th : " Hostile demonstrations continue . When a Frenchman enters a coffee-room , all the Italians withdraw .

The Constituent Assembly of Rome has been dissolved by force by the French . The Representatives had protested , and declared that the sitting was prorogued to an indefinite day . The Constitutionale Romano , which had suspended its publication , has reappeared . M. de Ia Tour d'Auvergne , accompanied by two secretaries , visited on the *th all the public prisons , to ascertain if they contained political prisoners . Gen. Zamboni , who was confined in the castle of Santangelo , and all the other persons imprisoned for political offenses by the Republican Government were subsequently set at liberty .

The Prefect of Viterbo , and the ex-Prefect of Civitia Vecchia , had been arrested . The French were said to have overtaken Garibaldi 's legion and captured the greater part of their baggage . On the 8th three or four of his men were brought prisoners into Rome , together with several wagons filled with wounded . A band commanded by an Englishman named Forbes , and forming the advanced guard of the Legion of Pianciani , was said to be committing all sorts of excesses at Terni .

The prorogation of the assembly has been voted . General Cavaignac voted against the prorogation , but it passed by 294 against 247 . The assembly will not separate until the 20th of the month . Democratic writers say , that the Republic has nothing to fear from dynastic pretensions : it is said , that General Cavaignac will be the next prcsident . Several distinguished Polish gentlemen have been banished from France , which proves beyond a question , that Russian diplomacy is powerful in that country . , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republic are the clergy , and the Bank of France . Radical revolutions look toward repudiation , and interfere dreadfully with the business of the country ; it is , therefore , extremely natural that businessmen should be opposed to revolutions . The Socialists leave religion out of their calculations ; it is , therefore , quite natural for the clergy to oppose Socialism . Louis Napoleon believes in a strong government , and is admitted , at last , to be a shrewd , enduring , and longheaded man ; his progress toward absolute power is by gradual but sure steps ; he may become Dictator , possibly , mperor . But the French are a people for wli om no calculations can be made , and the danger they fear is scarcely ever the danger that impends . England . Since the repeal of the Navigation laws , things remain very quiet in England ; the ministry , for the present , hold their place , but the Protectionists are evidently gathering strength . The most remarkable events of the times seem to be the Queen 's visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efforts to improve the condition of the poorer classes and of the public health.
