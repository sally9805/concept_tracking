txt MR . MILL needs no introduction to the readers of this Journal . Three years ago , we reviewed at some length his System of Logic , and the favorable opinion we then expressed of it seems to have been confirmed by the judgment of the whole class of readers - not so numerous a one , in this country , as we could wish - who are either able or willing to peruse more than the title-page of a book on abstract science . Political Economy is not quite so thorny and unpromising a topic as Logic , and in this age , indeed , more perhaps than in any other , we might suppose that it would be a favorite subject of study . Unluckily , It treats of wealth only in the abstract , and while it lays bare many of the causes of national grandeur and decline , it affords to individuals very little aid in what is to them the most important of all enterprises , that of making their fortunes . It is the science , but not the art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sciences , its general principles often seem to conflict very seriously with the practical rules - axiomata media , as Lord Bacon calls them - which common men draw immediately from their own experience in the counting-room and the stock-market . There is a common prejudice , therefore , against the reasoning and the conclusions of the political economists , a prejudice which is much increased by the dissensions and disputes which prevail among the economists themselves . Who shall decide when doctors disagree ? is the question that is triumphantly asked , both by the booby merchant who has blundered into a fortune , and hy the booby , if not dishonest legislator , who passes laws without any consideration of their ultimate effects on the material interests of the community , though he very // carefully estimates the bearing which they ivill have on his own popularity with his constituents . There is no subject pretending to the rank of a science , of which American legislators , merchants , and manufacturers are so profoundly and wilfully ignorant , as that o*political economy ; though there is none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever they would look beyond the present moment , either for their own interests , or for those of the public . We rejoice that they may now have the services of so competent a teacher as Mr. Mill , whose admirably pure and lucid style , correct method , copious illustrations , and stringent reasoning , carry light and conviction to some of the darkest problems and most vexed questions of the science , so as to remove the prejudices of the misinformed , and give understanding even to the simple . Two considerations recommend the present treatise to the attention of a large number of persons who do not usually concern themselves much about the doctrines of Adam Smith and his followers . The first is , that it is written up , if we may so phrase it , to the present time , - not only containing the latest improvements in the theory of the subject , but drawing many of its illustrations from recent events of great moment in the commercial world , such as the renewal of the Bank charter in 1844 , and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is satisfactory to be able , even now , to contemplate these events in the light of general principles , and thus to escape in some measure from the perplexing influence of immediate but temporary results and recent excitement , while the facts are still fresh in the recollection of all . The second recommendation of the book is , that it treats not merely of the production of wealth , but of its distribution , considered as affecting the general welfare of the community ; in our author 's own phrase , he expounds the principles of the scienc ? " with some of their applications to social philosophy . " In this respect he follows the example of Adam Smith , who , by his comprehensive treatment of the subject , embracing many questions of legislation , morals , and civil polity , which are inseparably connected with the doctrines of political economy strictly so called , gave so much popularity and influence to his great work on the Wealth of Nations . Later writers , wishing to treat of a distinct and independent science , and to mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow him in this wide range of speculation , and have thus greatly diminished the importance and effectiveness of their labors . By looking only at the econornjcal aspect of the questions which they discussed , they have come to be regarded as hardhearted and unsafe theorists , and by a large portion of the community their doctrines are viewed with suspicion and dislike . Mr. Mill , by going back to Adam Smith 's example , has gained for himself the opportunity of considering the great social problems of the day , the practical solution of which is even now convulsing a great part of the civilized world . A most valuable portion of his book is the clear and decisive refutation that it affords of the theories of the Saint Simonians , the Fourierites , the Communists , and other halfinsane speculators , who have reduced France to her present degradation and misery , and have found too many proselytes even on this side of the Atlantic . But our author is no blind conservative ; in England , indeed , he must be considered as belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economical science , and social philosophy . His doctrines respecting the ownership of land , the descent of property , the regulation of the currency , and other matters , go certainly to the verge , as most persons will think , of sweeping and hazardous innovation . He has a sort of hereditary right to be a bold speculator upon matters affecting the whole framework of society . His father was a prominent and far the ablest member of the little school which Jeremy Bentham collected around him , and all his opinions were deeply colored by the theories of that eccentric , but original and profound thinker . The early training of the son , we presume , was in the same school ; but he has long since risen to independence in speculation , and now judges with great freedom and correctness the doctrines and character of his old teacher , the great patriarch of radical theorists . He is a far safer guide than Bentham , being singularly free from the pride of system , and from the inconsistencies into which one is betrayed hy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retaining his early predilection for examining the fundamental ideas upon which every received doctrine rests , attaching no weight to prescription in matters of opinion , and boldly following out his speculations to whatever result they may lead him , having // regard only to the correctness of his data and his deductions from them , he is an agreeable and instructive companion even when we can not accept all his conclusions . On the whole , both as a writer and a thinker , he must be considered as decidedly at the head of the *nglish speculatists of the present day . No one shows a more entire mastery of abstract subjects , or greater power of recommending and enforcing his views and arguments by forcible and perspicuous language and pertinent illustrations . A complete exposition of the principles of political economy , with their applications to recent events and to the most important problems of social philosophy , by a writer so admirably qualified for the task , is a highly interesting and valuable work . We rejoice that the enterprise of our liberal publishers in Boston , Messrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the reach of American readers , in a very neat and correct edition , hardly inferior to the English copy in elegance , and quite moderate in price . It is to be hoped that it will immediately be made the text-book in all our colleges where the science is taught , to the exclusion of the very imperfect manual by J. B. Say , a work of some merit in its day , but now quite behind the age . The bulk of this treatise is no valid objection to its use for this purpose ; a judicious teacher will easily direct the attention of his pupils to such portions of it as are most important for present information , or most applicable to the circumstances of this country . Some chapters in it are abstruse , though made as clear as the nature of the subject will permit ; but the greater part of it is within the comprehension of diligent , though youthful , students . Political economy , as a science , is quite as much dependent as politics and ethics upon the principles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalization of the habits and dispositions of men in reference to labor and the acquisition of wealth . Its laws are the laws of human nature , expressed in terms which show their relation to the outward means of supporting man 's life and satisfying all his wants and desires . Wealth is an aggregation of valuable things , which have become valuable because they are objects of desire , and are more or less difficult of attainment . The principles of political economy are founded on observation of the manner in which the independent members of any society compete with or aid // each other in the attempt to create or acquire these things . They go upon the supposition , that man is disposed to accumulate beyond what is necessary for the immediate gratification of his wants , that his desire to make and store up provision for the future is*4n fact unbounded , that his disposition to labor is mainly controlled by this desire , that he is sagacious enough to see what branches of employment are most profitable , and eager enough to enter them , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a level . the science , then , is more closely allied with the philosophy of the human mind than with natural history ; the values which are considered in it are not outward and tangible things , but abstract conceptions , which , indeed , are often arbitrary or fictitious , since value in use so frequently differs from value in exchange . A student of this science , therefore , will usually be successful in proportion as he is shrewd and sharp-sighted as an observer of human nature , and sagacious in unweaving the intricacies of the motives and dispositions of men . It will never do for him to take his stand upon a single principle of the mind , though it be usually a prominent and governing one , and push that , by logical deduction , to its remotest consequences . This was the great fault of such economists as Ricardo , Malthus , and Say , men who attempted to build up the whole science by successive inferences from one or two cardinal positions , and thus gained a deceptive appearance of method at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the complexity of motives and variety of circumstances which govern human conduct , and they attempted to show what must be , in place of explaining what is . The a priori method is not often successful in the conduct of any inquiry ; it is easier and safer to ascend from facts to principles , than to make principles a guide to facts . The error that is often committed in the latter case may be easily covered up by giving a very abstract form to our statements , and by the exclusion of all qualifying circumstances but a wide discrepancy is then visible between - theory and experience , which makes common persons very suspicious of the accuracy of the reasoning employed and of the conclusions which are supported by it . Mr. Mill is a diligent and accurate observer , and to this cause , no less than to his sagacity in the explanation of phenomena , and to his dialectical // skill , the excellence of large portions of his work is to he attributed . His remarks on the manner in which the effects of competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accumulation as influenced by peculiarities of national character , are highly judi4ious and instructive . His general observations show that sound , vigorous good-sense , always a leading trait in the English mind , which in its highest degree we call practical wisdom . We must extract a passage or two , to justify this encomium , though scraps give one but a faint idea of a quality which exists only by diffusion , and seldom juts out in bold points . The following remarks are taken from the chapter on the cause of the various degrees of productiveness of productive agents . " Individuals , or races , do not differ so much in the efforts they are able and willing to make under strong immediate incentives , as in their capacity of present exertion for a distant object , and in the thoroughness of their application to work on ordinary occasions . In this last quality the English , and perhaps the Anglo-Americans , appear at present to surpass every other people . This efficiency of labor is connected with their whole character ; with their defects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Englishmen and Americans have no life but in their work ; that alone stands between them and ennui . Either from original temperament , climate , or want of development , they are too deficient in senses to enjoy mere existence in repose ; and scarcely any pleasure or amusement is pleasure or amusement to them . Except , therefore , those who are alive to some of the nobler interests of humanity ( a small minority in all countries ) , they have little to distract their attention from work , or to divide the dominion over them with the one propensity which is the passion of those who have no other , and the satisfaction of which comprises all that they imagine of success in life , - the desire of growing richer , and getting on in the world . This last characteristic belongs chiefly to those who are in a condition superior to day-laborers ; but the absence of any taste for amusement , or enjoyment of repose , is common to all classes . Whether from this or any other cause , the national steadiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English working classes , - those who never think of saving , or improving their condition . It has become the habit of the country ; and life in England is more governed by habit , and less by personal inclination and will , than in any other country , except perhaps China or Japan . The effect is , that where hard labor // is the thing required , there are no laborers like the English ; though in natural intelligence , and even in manual dexterity , they have many superiors . " - Vol. i. pp. 123 , 124 . Energy of labor , however , he goes on to say , is not an unqualified good , nor one*hich it is desirable to nourish at the expense of other and higher attributes of human nature . As much as the industrial spirit requires to be stimulated in such a case as that of the negroes of Jamaica and Demarara , after their emancipation , " so much does it require to be moderated in such countries as England and the United States . " " There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taught , but the use of wealth , and appreciation of the objects of desire which wealth can not purchase , or for attaining which it is not required . Every real improvement in the character of the English or Americans , whether it consist in giving them higher aspirations , or only more numerous and better pleasures , must necessarily moderate the all.engrossing torment of their industrialism ; must diminish , therefore , so far as it depends on that cause alone , the aggregate productiveness of their labor . There is no need , however , that it should diminish that strenuous and business.like application to the matter in hand , which is one of their most precious characteristics " Foreigners are generally quite unaware that to these qualities in English industry the wealth and power which they seek to emulate are in reality owing , and not to the ships , colonies , and commerce ' which these qualities have called into being , and which , even if annihilated , would leave England the richest country in the world . An Englishman , of almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , to use a common phrase , his heart is in his work . But it is surely quite possible to put heart into his work without being incapable of putting it into any thing else . The desirable medium is one which mankind have not often known how to hit : when they do labor , to do it with all their might , and especially with all their mind ; but to devote to labor , for mere pecuniary gain , fewer hours in the day , fewer days in the year , and fewer years of life . " - Vol. i. pp. 125 , 126 . From the very effective refutation of the principles of Communism we borrow the next passage , which seems as remarkable for felicity of expression , as for the accuracy and spirit with which it delineates one aspect of human nature . Every clear-sighted observer must admit its truthfulness , and see that it affords an argument to which there is no reply against the abolition of property . // " Assuming , however , all the success which is claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains to be considered how much would be really gained for mankind , and whether the form that would be given to life , and the character which would be impressed on human nature , can s*isfy any but a very low estimate of the capabilities of the spe*ies . Those who have never known freedom from anxiety as to the means of subsistence are apt to overrate what is gained for positive enjoyment by the mere absence of that uncertainty . The necessaries of life , when they have always been secure for the whole of life , are scarcely more a subject of consciousness or a source of happiness than the elements . There is little attractive in a monotonous routine , without vicissitudes , but without excitement ; a life spent in the enforced observance of an external rule , and performance of a prescribed task : in which labor would be devoid of its chief sweetener , the thought that every effort tells perceptibly on the laborer 's own interests or those of some one with whom he identifies himself ; in which no one could by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objects of his private affections ; in which no one 's way of life , occupations , or movements , would depend on choice , but each would be the slave of all : a social system in which identity of education and pursuits would impress on all the same unvarying type of character , to the destruction of that multiform development of human nature , those manifold unlikenesses , that diversity of tastes and talents , and variety of intellectual points of view , which , by presenting to each innumerable notions that he could not have conceived of himself , are the great stimulus to intellect and the mainspring of mental and moral progression . The perfection of social arrangements would be to secure to all persons complete independence and freedom of action , subject to no restriction but that of not doing injury to others : but the scheme which we are considering abrogates this freedom entirely , and places every action of every member of the community under command . " - Vol. i. pp. 247 , 248 . Here is an illustration of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recently attempted to turn the world upside down in France , and have come hither also , are not so much at fault in their abstract reasoning as in their observations of human nature . They would fain remodel society , when they are profoundly ignorant of the springs of human conduct , and of the manner in which character is affected by outward circumstances . It is easy for them to point out the misery and degradation of one class in the community , and the useless opulence of // another , and in their philanthropic frenzy to propose an equal division of goods as a remedy for both these evils . But they are not aware that the sight of these two extremes , the fear of falling into the one and the hope of risitig to the other , is the constant stimulus whk4 keeps up the energy and activity of the human race , through which alone these goods are created . Make men secure of a provision for all their wants , take away from them all objects of ambition , destroy both anxiety anc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enforced equality of property and condition , - and after a few years , even if there remained any thing to be divided among them , which there would not be , for their wastefulness under such circumstances would equal their indolence , they would become useless and discontented drones , devoured by ennui , or eager for wrangling and fighting with each other as the only means of relieving their otherwise stagnant existence . But the theorists tell us , that the necessity of laboring for the good of the community would supply the place , as a motive to action , of the necessity which each individual now feels of laboring for himself . We answer , that the common adage , " What is every body 's business is nobody 's , " is enough to show the folly of this supposition , which implies lamentable ignorance of the dispositions of mankind . The commonest observation proves , that , to make a man industrious , you must show him that the fruits of his industry will be wholly his own ; if he is to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared the particular effort which produced them , he will throw aside his implements of labor in disgust , or relinquish them on the first approach of weariness . The motive to exertion must be immediate , or it will not be sufficiently pungent . It matters not , if you prove to him by a demonstration , that his individual welfare is inseparably connected with the interests of the whole community . Men do not act from such far-sighted calculation as this they look first to their own interests at the present moment . Practically , each one will argue thus : - " I am but a unit in a vast multitude , and the effect which my idleness or industry at this time will have on the general welfare will be a quantity too small to be appreciated ; and little as the general stock will be diminished by my refusal to work , my personal share of that diminution or loss , being the quotient after // another partition among the whole multitude , will be an infinitesimal of the second degree , an atom that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome my present unwillingness to labor will be considerable . I will remain idle , then . " rill*is is very selflsh*and short-sighted reasoning , it is true ; but it needs very little knowledge of human nature to convince one that it is the only way in which the hulk of mankind will reason , and very little calculation of consequences to see what would be the result , if every member of the community should thus think and act . Of course , we shall be told that men must be educated , and taught to act with more foresight and less selflshn*ss , and from considerations of duty and benevolence , instead of blindly following the impulses of the moment . Certainly , let them be educated , and their moral condition be improved by all means ; when they have become universally intelligent , philanthropic , and industrious , and are no longer actuated by selfish motives , property may well be abolished , and society may exist under any form , for the social state then can not fail to be a happy one , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of the whole race will probably be a slow and tedious one , and as the new institutions will not be practicable till it is completed , it might be well to commence with the opulent classes alone , who are comparatively few in number , and who , when converted and made purely benevolent and unselfish , will need no persuasion , no new framework of society , to induce them to share their goods equally with their less fortunate brethren . Human nature , as it is now constituted , it is evident , is not compatible with the maintenance of your new institutions ; and any such improvement in it as might render it fit for their support would take away the necessity of making any change . But we pass on from the consideration of these dreams of half-insane reformers to matters of more practical importance . Mr. Mill 's views of the operation of the Bank charter act of 1844 , and of the effect of an excessive issue of bank-notes upon commercial iffairs generally , will be new to most persons in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he the ultimate opinion as to their soundness . His theory in the main is that which has been advocated in England by Messrs . Tooke and Fullarton , especially by the former , in his History of Prices . It is , // that the rate of interest , or what is usually termed the scarcity of n oney , does not in any measure depend upon the greater or less abundance of the currency , whether this be composed of specie or of circulating notes ; but upon the quantity of floating capit*4 which forms the supply of the loan-market , and upon the demand for it which is created by speculating operations . Trade may be unduly extended , through the expansion of the credit system , months before any unusual call is made for money ; and therefore the e*tcessive issue of bank-notes which then takes place , unless prevented by legal enactments , is the consequence , not the cause , of speculation and over-trading . The testimony of all the private bankers who were examined before Parliament went to show , that their issues were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vicinity , and that they could not send forth an unusual amount at any time without having it immediately returned upon their hands . The reason of this is obvious ; what is really borrowed by the applicant is not money , but the goods that he purchases with the money ; or rather , he borrows in order to fulfil the engagements that he contracted some months before in purchasing those goods . Money is only an instrument for facilitating barter , whether goods are immediately exchanged for other goods , or for credit , - that is , for a promise to furnish the other goods at a future day . Money is the oil which lessens the friction of the machinery in these transactions , but it is not the motive power , nor the raw material , nor the manufactured article ; consequently , its relative abundance can not determine the amount or number of those transactions . This is settled by the quantity of floating capital in the country , which is disposable for purposes of trade , or what amounts to the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mill 's conclusion is , " that bank-notes , bills , or checks , as such , do not act on prices at all . What does act on prices is credit , in whatever shape given , and whether it gives rise to any transferable instruments capable of passing into circulation , or not . " Speculation is often at its height when the money-market is in a very contracted state , that is , when the issues by the banks of their own notes are at a mmimum . The speculation may continue , and prices be maintained at an unnatural elevation , and still no unusual demand // will be made on the banks for accommodation , and consequently the amount of notes in circulation will not be increased . The number and extent of the purchases made cause prices to rise ; but advances from bankers are not applied for in order to purchase , but in or*r to hold on without selling when the term of credit has expired , and prices have not yet risen high enough for the magnificent expectations of the dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with China in 1839 caused an advance in the price of tea to be expected . The retail dealers at once began to lay in large stocks beyond the probable demand from their customers for months to come . This they were enabled to do , because at first they seemed to buy for the legitimate purposes of their regular trade , and not on speculation . " One was mentioned , who , having a capital not exceeding 1,2001. , which was locked up in his business , had contrived to buy 4,000 chests , value above 80 , OOOl . " This was done without the outlay of actual capital or currency in any shape . At last , a violent reaction came , because the high prices had brought many cargoes of tea into the country , and at the same time had diminished the consumption ; while the expiration of the credit season compelled many of the dealers to push their stocks into the market at any price . The demand for money now began , as these persons wished to avoid the necessity of selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank-notes certainly did not cause this speculation , and a contraction of them would not have prevented it ; on the contrary , a moderate increase of bank accommodation , at the moment when the tide turned , might have " eased off " the reaction , and caused prices to fall less hurriedly . Hence the beneficial consequences of government intervention in 1847 , when the ministry illegally suspended the operation of the act of 1844 , and the mere expectation of relief from the Bank of England arrested the panic . We are led to the same conclusion , says Mr. Mill , " if we consider the proportion which the utmost increase of bank-notes in a period of speculation bears , I do not say to the whole mass of credit in the country , but to the bills of exchange alone . The average amount of bills in existence at any one time is supposed considerably to exceed a hundred millions sterling . The banknote circulation of Great Britain and Ireland is less than thirtyfive // millions , and the increase in speculative periods at most two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen , hardly ever comes into play until that advanced period of the speculation at which the tide shows signs of turning , and the dealers generally are rather thinking of the means of fulfilling their existing engagements , than meditating an e*4ension of them : while the quantity of bills in existence is largely increased from the very commencement of the speculations . " - Vol. ii . pp. 66 , 67 . We are now prepared to understand Mr. Mill 's explanation of the commercial crisis in England in 1847 . " It is not universally true that the contraction of credit , characteristic of a commercial crisis , must have been preceded by an extraordinary and irrational extension of it . There are other causes ; and the most recent crisis , that of 1847 , is an instance , having been preceded by no particular extension of credit , and by no speculations ; except those in railway shares , which , though in many cases extravagant enough , yet being carried on mostly with that portion of means which the speculators could afford to lose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from vicissitudes of price in the commodities in which men habitually deal , and in which the bulk of their capital is invested . The crisis of 1847 belonged to another class of mercantile phenomena . There occasionally happens a concurrence of circumstances tending to withdraw from the loan-market a considerable portion of the capital which usually supplies it . These circumstances , in the present case , were great foreign payments , ( occasioned by the high price of cotton and the unprecedented importation of food , ) together with the continual demands on the circulating capital of the country by railway calls and the loan transactions of railway companies , for the purpose of being converted into fixed capital and made unavailable for future lending . These various demands fell principally , as such demands always do , on the loan-market . A great , though not the greatest , part of the imported food was actually paid for by the proceeds of a government loan . The extra payments which purchasers of corn and cotton , and railway shareholders , found themselves obliged to make , were either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised for the occasion . On the first supposition , they were made by withdrawing deposits from bankers , and thus cutting off a part of the streams which fed the loanmarket ; on the second supposition , they were made by actual drafts on the loan-market , either by the sale of securities or by taking up money at interest . This combination of a fresh demand for loans with a curtailment of the capital disposable for // them raised the rate of interest , and made it impossible to borrow except on the very best security . Some firms , therefore , which by an improvident and unmercantile mode of conducting business had allowed their capital to become either temporarily or permanently unavailable , becq**e unable to command that perpetual renewal of credit which had previously enabled them to struggle on . These firms stopped payment : their failure involved more or less deeply many other firms which had trusted them ; and , as usual in such cases , the general distrust , commonly called a panic , began to set in , and might have produced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not circumstances which may almost be called accidental given to a very simple measure of the government a fortunate power of allaying panic , to which , when considered in itself , it had no sort of claim . " - Vol. ii . pp. 56- 58 . The years 1846 and 1847 , which were so disastrous for England , formed a period of remarkable prosperity for this country . The crops were abundant , and our surplus of agricultural produce found a ready and extensive market in Europe , turning the course of exchange largely in our favor . Specie flowed into the country , and prices rose , not from mere speculation , which was kept down through the uncertainty and apprehension created by the war with Mexico , but because those who had sold large crops of grain , the price of which in former years would hardly pay for bringing it from the interior to the sea-coast , were now more able to purchase . This increase of business , and the full employment of all means of internal transportation , caused large dividends to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and directed much floating capital into those channels of investmeat where it becomes fixed . Great enterprises were commenced in building new railways and large manufacturing establishments , which gradually drained the loan-market ; and as these works required considerable time for their completion , those who had taken stock in them contracted engagements to furnish capital for years to come . This year ( 1848 ) , consequently , has been marked by a long-continued " scarcity of money , " as it is called , with which the currency and the conduct of the banks have had nothing to do . No one has thought of blaming these institutions , which were so much censured in former seasons of commercial difficulty . The rate of interest has been enormously high for the last // eight months ; yet there have been few failures and but little panic . It is not money , but capital , which is deficient ; the capitalists , deceived by two years of unusual prosperity , have undertaken enterprises which are beyond their strength . But we have followed *r . Mill far enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of his speculations , and to bespeak for him the confidence of our readers . He is no wild theorist , but takes sober and comprehensive views , which he expounds with great moderation , clearness , and ability . We may follow him with more assurance , then , when he comes to treat of the great problem on which the future welfare , almost the existence , of his country depends , - the situation of the laboring classes in Great Britain and Ireland . We have of late repeatedly considered this subject at some length in this journal , * hut it is still fresh in interest and copious in instruction , some of the gravest questions respecting the tendencies of modern civilization , and the temporal welfare of the human family , being dependent for an answer on the results of the great experiment which is now going forward in England . We call it an experiment , because to the present condition of the English and Irish people no parallel can be found in any other country on the globe , nor in the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the last century . Nowhere else is all the soil , or the whole food-producing power of the country , monopolized by less than one three-hundredth part of the inhabitants , while full half of the population are dependent entirely on wages , which are already reduced so low that most of the common laborers with their families are literally on the brink of starvation . Nowhere but in England is vastly the larger portion of the real and personal property owned by less than two hundred thousand individuals , while eight millions of their countrymen have no property whatever , and their labor , even when they have employment , which they can not always obtain , produces hardly enough to support life on the poorest and scantiest fare . Three millions of these are in a pauperized condition , one half of this number claiming public charity every year . Enormous as these evils are , they are rapidly // and steadily increasing ; the wealth of the prosperous class increases even more swiftly than their numbers diminish , while the poor multiply at a frightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it the avowed policy of the laws to foster this shocking ineqt. *lity of wealth , the division of landed estates being opposed by legal obstacles which are practically insurmountable , and the aggregation of personal property being favored alike by the laws , the habits and desires of the owners , and by natural causes . The present state of the laboring population of England and Ireland is one of unequalled destitution and suffering , and while present tendencies continue to work without check , they have nothing to look forward to but an increase alike of their numbers and their misery . Can this state of things continue a generation or two longer without producing a social convulsion as awful as any which is yet recorded in history ? The British government , upheld by a great majority of the wealthy and educated classes , seem to think that it can ; at any rate , they are still trying the experiment . But in Ireland the experiment has already failed maddened by suffering , the wretched inhabitants have once already broken out into civil war , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the government , though not without some sacrifice of life . Hopeless of success , not knowing what they are fighting for , the people are always ready to follow the impulse of a few miserable demagogues , and rush upon the bayonets and cannon which are pointed to receive them . They can but die , and what has there been in the condition of four millions of the Irish people for the last few years which could render life desirable ? They know that they are miserable , they have a vague belief that their misery is the consequence of oppression and wrong , and they now seek only for vengeance . One political nostrum after another ha* been tried , in the hope of appeasing them , and has utterly failed . As if political measures alone - Catholic emancipation , the extension of the franchise , the vote by ballot , or even the repeal of the Union - could fill up the yawning gulph of Irish famine The people asked for bread , and the government and the demagogues alike have offered them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be granted to them to-morrow , does any one believe that the social condition of the people // would be in the slightest degree ameliorated ? In ordinary years , Ireland produces vastly more food than is necessary for her own subsistence , the export of it being the chief branch of traffic that remains to this unhappy land . It is certain , therefore , that the. *nly immediate cause of Irish misery is the enormous inequality in the distribution of wealth , whether this inequality be chiefly attributable to the people , the laws , or to former misgovernment and oppression . There can be no dispute , that the evil manifests itself through this inequality , and that no remedy for it can be effectual which does not tend very rapidly to a more even distribution of land and food , to say nothing of the other forms of property . Yet in Parliamentary debates on Irish affairs , this immediate cause of pauperism , famine , crime , turbulence , and rebellion is seldom , if ever , mentioned . Even the Irish members would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be discussed ; the institution is sacred , and its amendment is no more to be thought of than its abrogation . The case of England is not quite so bad , though few who have read the evidence adduced in our former articles will deny that the same causes are working there towards the same inevitable result , and " little more than one generation , " to adopt 1Ir . Thornton 's language , " might suffice to convert England into an Ireland of human misery and degradation . " rhe situation of the third kingdom is well described by 1'Lr . Laing , who says , after a full investigation of the evidence , that " Scotch destitution has gone a step beyond English , and arrived , like that of Ireland , at a point at which all other evils are swallowed up in the urgent and ever-present danger of literal death by starvation . " If our readers will now remember that England is much the wealthiest country in the world , that full half of the population of the three kingdoms have no share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average of which is only enough to support life in such a manner as we have just described , that the whole population increases at the rate of sixteen per cent . in ten years , and that at least three fourths of this increase is of the laboring class who have no property , they will have before them the chief elements of what is called the Condition-of-England question . Of all themes for the consideration of the economist , the legislator , and the philanthropist , we know of none that equals this in interest and importance . // We looked , then , with much curiosity for the opinions of a bold and original thinker , like Mr. Mill , on this great subject . The defects and evils in the present constitution of society , the modes of supplying or remedying them , and the probable results of leaving therix*ps they are , or of applyir*g only insufficient means of prevention or cure , are topics upon which he has speculated widely in former publications , and always with great sagacity , comprehensiveness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the whole ground of political economy , he could not fail to consider , in all its relations and tendencies , the actual state of the laboring classes of Great Britain ; especially as his plan included the application of the principles of economical science to social philosophy . By this enlargement of the range of his inquiries , he has virtually admitted the justice of M. Sisniondi 's complaint , that the English economists hitherto have studied only chrematistics , or the art of nioney-making , while the science of political economy includes , as its name imports , not only the production of wealth , but the political regulation of society , as if it were a household , - that is , its government and direction with a view to the general well-being , the equal distribution of the means of happiness among all its classes and members . Are not some measures which tend to increase the wealth , and , perhaps , even the political power and importance of a nation , destructive in a greater or less degree of some of its higher interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Those who contend that such a conflict of aims is impossible must maintain that riches are every thing , the sum of all good , or else that the pursuit of them , under all circumstances , and to the utmost extent , is perfectly consistent with every other enterprise in which an intellectual and moral being can be engaged . The wealth of a nation consists of the aggregate wealth of all its members , and it may be advantageous for the power and political importance of a state that this wealth should all be owned by a very few persons , since it will thus be more accessible when the government needs to expend it for the national defence , and it is only when accumulated in large masses that capital produces its grandest and most striking results . It is by this aggregation of wealth in the hands of a few , that England has become the most opulent and powerful nation on the face of the earth ; at what cost she has // risen to this proud eminence , let the present terrible condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet her political economists and statesmen , her great landlords , wealthy manufacturers , and merchant princes , continue to defen4 and support the system of legislation which produces these shocking results . 1*vLr . Mill does not acknowledge either the justice or the expediency of favoring the concentration of riches , and leaving the bulk of the community destitute or dependent . He recognizes the great truth , that " property is only a means to an end , not itself the end " ; and consequently , even if capital when in large masses should be a more effective agent of production than when distributed more evenly , the legislature ought not to favor its aggregation , if it should appear that this enlarged production was not a sure means of promoting the general welfare and the highest interests of the community . Here is the vice of that narrow definition of political economy to which we have alluded , that , by restricting the inquiry to the means of increasing wealth , writers upon this science have been led to advocate measures which tend to diminish the sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of justice and the feelings of common humanity . We yield our hearty assent to the doctrines expressed in the following passage , which is entitled to more weight in the estimation of the judicious , because it immediately succeeds , in Mr. Mill 's work , that decisive refutation of the theories of the Communists and the Saint-Simonians upon which we have already remarked . " There has never been imagined any mode of distributing the produce of industry , so well adapted to the requirements of human nature on the whole , as that of letting the share of each individual ( not in a state of bodily or mental incapacity ) depend in the main on that individual 's own energies and exertions , and on such furtherance as may be obtained from the voluntary good offices of others . It is not the subversion of the system of individual property that should be aimed at ; but the improvement of it , and the participation of every member of the community in its benefits . The principle of private property has never yet had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , in this country than in some others . The social arrangements of modern Europe commenced from a distribution of property , which was the result , not of just partition , or acquisition by industry , but of conquest // and violence ; and notwithstanding what industry has been doing for many centuries to modify the work of force , the system still retains many traces of its origin . The laws of property have never yet conformed to the principles on which the justification of private property rests . They have made property of things which never ought to be *operty , and absolute property where only a qualified property ought to exist . They have not held the balance fairly between human beings , but have heaped impediments upon some , to give advantages to others ; they have purposely fostered inequalities , and prevented all from starting fair in the race . That all should , indeed , start on perfectly equal terms is inconsistent with any law of private property : hut if as much pains as has been taken to aggravate the inequality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken to temper that inequality by every means not subversive of the principle itself ; if the tendency of legislation had been to favor the diffusion , instead of the concentration of wealth , to encourage the subdivision of the large masses , instead of striving to keep them together ; the principle of individual property would have been found to have no real connection with the physical and social evils which have made so many minds turn eagerly to any prospect of relief , however desperate . " - Vol. i. pp. 252 , 253 . These remarks in their full extent nre applicable only to England . In this country , in France and several other nations of Continental Europe , the policy of the law does not favor the inequality of private fortunes , but operates against it , and in some cases so strongly that many persons are disposed to think that the subdivision of property thereby effected is excessive . We hold , however , that no approach to equality in this respect can be injurious , which leaves unquestioned to every individual the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings and exertions . This will nourish sufficiently the desire of accumulation , and thus keep industry and frugality alive in the community , while it will always insure the command of capital in masses large enough for undertaking great industrial operations . Mr. Mill goes on to expound his opinion as to the mode in which succession to property vacant by death should be regulated , so as to insure the proper diffusion of wealth and the equality of chances for all classes and members of society . He would take away the right of inheritance , as distinguished from bequest , altogether ; the property of intestates , whether 33 * // of land or movables , should escheat to the state , to be distributed anew among its members , yet always with some regard to the expectations naturally created in the children of the deceased by the style of life in which they have been brought up . After making due p*vision for them , which in no case should exceed that which is considered as a moderate conipetency in the class of society in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the common stock . The right of collateral relations to inherit should he abrogated entirely , the state not being bound to make even a pecuniary provision for them , as they do not now expect any thing when there are direct heirs . Mr. Bentham and other eminent writers long since recommended , that when there were no heirs either in the ascending or descending line , the state should take all . The provision even for children , Mr. Mill thinks , ought not to be more than enough for their individual support ; for the means of supporting a wife and family , every man should depend on his own exertions . Our author 's opinions all tend to the discouragement of marriage , on the ground that it is necessary to check the growth of the population . The right of bequest is admitted as an incident to a man 's natural right to enjoy his earnings , and to dispose of them as he sees fit . But as this admission would go far to render the preceding regulations inoperative , as it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill rather inconsistently proceeds to limit bequests almost as strictly as inheritances from intestates . Entails should never be allowed , and when property is left for public uses , the testator should not be allowed to prescribe the details of its application for ever . Even in the simplest case , our author would limit , " not what any one might bequeathe , but what any one should be permitted to acquire by bequest or inheritance . Each person should have power to dispose by will of his whole property ; but not to lavish it in enriching some one individual , beyond a certain maximum , which should be fixed sufficiently high to afford the means of comfortable independence . " This restriction , he thinks , while it would insure the distribution of property , would also induce individuals to devote more of their wealth to objects of public usefulness , " either by direct bequests to the state , or by the endowment of institutions as is already done very largely in the United States , where // the ideas and practice in the matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The principle of the French law , a compulsory partition among the children , he condemns , because the misconduct of a child ought to operate as a forfeiture of its claim , *d the certainty of inheriting a fortune tends to encourage idleness , filial disobedience , and profligacy . We suspect , however , that the French plan , or some combination of it with the American system , is the only practicable mode of insuring the distribution of wealth with any near approach to equality . Mr. Mill puts too much upon the state , by burdening it with a multitude of details which could not be provided for by general legislation , nor safely left in each case to the discretion of particular magistrates . A law , to work well , must be simple and concise in its enactments . The provision to be made for each of the direct heirs of an intestate , and the sum which any one person should be permitted to acquire by bequest , should vary , he thinks , according to the amount of the property left , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How shall these variations be determined with precision in a general law , applicable to every case ? And how could the state dispose of the numerous parcels and little remnants of properties , which would accrue to it under such a system , without great waste and injustice ? The case of property in land is so peculiar as to deserve separate consideration . So far as the productive power of the earth is not the consequence of the labor which has been expended upon it , it can not be made private property , on the principle which secures to a man only the fruits of his own toil and skill . As the original qualities of the soil were not created by individuals , so they can not justly be appropriated by them , but belong to the public stock of the human family , who at first enjoyed them in common . It is only when the value added to the land by cultivation exceeds that of its natural fertility , that exclusive ownership of it becomes justifiable . Such cases are not infrequent ; sometimes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogs are drained , or land is reclaimed from the sea . " One of the barrenest soils in the world , composed of the material of the Goodwin Sands , the Pays de Waes in Flanders , has been so fertilized by industry as to have become one of the most productive in Europe . " The principle , then , is plain // enough ; the proprietor of land has a good title to it only when he is also its improver , and when his improvements are nearly or quite equal in value to the original fertility of the soil . This is not always the case with great estates , even in England ; the land is *ten so deeply mortgaged , that its nominal proprietor has no surplus income to invest in the soil with a view to future profit . To do so to advantage , moreover , he must have made a study of the science of agriculture ; and Mr. Mill says the " great landlords have seldom seriously studied any thing . " " Landed property in England is thus very far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifiable . But if insufficiently realized even in England , in Ireland those conditions are not complied with at all . With individual exceptions ( some of them very honorable ones ) , the owners of Irish estates do nothing for the land but drain it of its produce . What has been epigrammatically said in the discussions on peculiar burdens ' is literally true when applied to them ; that the greatest burden on land ' is the landlords . Returning nothing to the soil , they consume its whole produce , minus the potatoes strictly necessary to keep the inhabitants from dying of famine ; and when they have any notion of improvement , it consists in not leaving even this pittance , but turning out the people to beggary , if not to starvation . When landed prop-p erty has placed itself upon this footing , it ceases to be defensible , and the time has come for making some new arrangement of the matter . " When the sacredness of property ' is talked of , it should always be remembered that this sacredness does not belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the land . It is the original inheritance of the whole species . Public reasons exist for its being appropriated . But if those reasons lost their force , the thing would be unjust . " - Vol. i. p. 272 . This is but a brief abstract of Mr. Mill 's views respecting the distribution of property ; but it is enough to show that they are well considered and defensible , however much they may conflict with existing notions . Those who wish to see the argument on the opposite side stated with some force and elegance , though with but a meagre array of facts in its support , may turn to the work by Mr. McCulloch , the title of which stands second at the head of this article . His object is to defend English institutions as they are , and accordingly he fights stoutly for primogeniture , entails , and all other contrivances // for preventing the division or alienation of estates . We shall take some notice of his reasoning and conclusions hereafter ; hut for the present we must follow the abler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . rrhe scheme for the division o*property in its passage from one generation to another , which we have just explained , is not proposed by its author with direct reference , as it seems , to the immediate effect which it would have in improving the condition of the majority of the English and Irish people . It is rather a speculative sketch of what Mr. Mill considers as just in itself , and desirable for its economical consequences and its effects on the constitution of society at large , than a plan to alleviate or remove the present sufferings of the laboring classes . Mr. Mill , we are sorry to see , reasons after the old fashion of the English economists upon this great and perplexing subject ; in his opinion , the whole evil consists in low wages , and the only remedy , the only means of raising the rate of wages , is to check the growth of the population . He is a follower of 1Ialthus to the full extent , and therefore almost a fatalist in his view of the evils which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the opinions and conduct of the poor in relation to marriage and the increase of their kind do not undergo a total change . H* endeavours to speak hopefully of the prospect that the laboring people will learn to be prudent in this respect , and looks to an effective system of national education as the chief agent in making the change ; but it is easy to see that his fears predominate , as he admits that " education is not compatible with extreme poverty . " Yet on the possibility of converting the common people to Malthusianism , both in opinion and practice , " depends the acquittal or the condemnation of the industrial system prevailing in this country , and regarded by many writers as the ne plus ultra of civilization , - the permanent dependence of the whole laboring class of the community on the wages of hired labor . The question we are considering is , whether of this state of things overpopulation and a degraded condition of the laboring class are the inevitable consequence . " Substitute for the very gentle phrase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its true meaning , namely , a state of utter destitution and misery , exposed to the constant and imminent peril of starvation , and we accept the question as here proposed , and maintain an affirmative answer . // Like all the professed followers of Maithus , Mr. Mill is somewhat dogmatic in his enunciation of the theory , and quite impatient of any doubt or question as to its correctness . The propositions of which it is made up , he says , " may now be regarded as axiorx*tic , " though " a sentimental horror of Maithus , " which is as rife in France as in England , " every now and then gives birth to some ephemeral theory , speedily forgotten , of a different law of increase in different circumstances . " This positiveness arises from a perception of the unquestionable correctness of the data on which the theory is founded , and of the chief features of the theory itself , while the general reluctance to accept it proceeds from involuntary dread of the shocking conclusions which it has been made to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application . The doctrine of Malthus is sometimes understood , in its extended sense , to comprise the whole body of these inferences from it , together with its immediate application as advice to men for the government of their conduct and the regulation of society ; and it is when thus understood , that the common sense and natural feelings of mankind shrink from it with that strong aversion , which *v1r . Mill designates as " sentimental horror , " for it presents a view of human nature , and of the destiny of the race , which no one but a fatalist or a " hard-hearted political economist " could look at with equanimity or resignation . Taken in the more restricted meaning , which is always used when the theory is controverted or denied , Malthusianism contains nothing but one or two truisms about the law of increase that is common to the human race with the whole animal creation , which have no practical importance whatever , except for the purpose to which they were first applied by Malthus himself , namely , to confute an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social state . Upon this ambiguity of meaning , as we shall show , depends the whole cont*oversy as to the law of population , and its consequences upon the well-being of society . The proposition upon which the whole theory rests is this , - that the power of increase of any race of animals , the human species included , is indefinite or incapable of exhaustion and if it were exercised to the utmost , without any check from external circumstances , the earth would not be large enough , - we do not say merely , to afford subsistence , - // but even to give standing-room to the beings who would claim a place upon it . The capacity of increase is necessarily in a geometrical progression ; for each pair being capable of procreation , if the race , under certain circumstances , increases within thirty years fr*x ten thousand to twenty thousand , a mere continuance of the same cause and the same circumstances would enlarge the number , within the next thirty years , to forty thousand , and the third period would carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is evident that within a few centuries the earth might literally be overstocked with human beings ; if they could stand shoulder to shoulder , as thickly as the stalks of wheat in a cultivated field at harvest-time , every plain , valley , and hill-top , the surface even of every sea and ocean , might yet be covered with them ; and there would still be a call for room , for the next thirty years would inevitably double even this immense assemblage , which we have supposed to be already like the sands of the sea for multitude . Strictly speaking , this is the whole doctrine of Malthus , and certainly its truth , whatever we may think of its practical importance , is undeniable . This law of possible increase in a geometrical progression belongs to every species both of the animal and vegetable kingdom of which we have any knowledge ; it is an immediate and logical inference from the self-evident fact , that every pair , whether of the earliest or the latest generation , whether forming part of a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of continuing or multiplying its kind . Its prolific power is not at all affected by the greater or smaller number of its fellowcreatures which may be already in being . And this doctrine or fact is quite sufficient to refute the dreams of Godwin , who held that society might be brought to perfection , all moral and physical evil being done away , or , in other words , all checks to this capacity of increase being removed , and yet man might be at liberty to follow nature , or to gratify all his original inclinations and desires , without any necessity for watchfulness , prudence , or self-restraint . Malthus made this decisive reply , that even if all other evil could be removed , this certainly would remain , that the rapid and indefinite increase of mankind under such circumstances would soon cause the earth to be over-peopled , and the insufficient supply of food for so vast a number would necessarily create // again contentions and wars , and thus bring back the whole train of sufferings and disasters which Mr. Godwin hoped to banish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple form , is undeniable , and yet that it has*io applicability to the present state of human affairs , and we have no immediate concern in establishing its truth or falsehood . If a speculatist in natural philosophy should undertake to demonstrate that the sun was gradually but surely expending its stock of light and heat , constant drafts being made upon it in those immense floods of radiance and warmth with which it now inundates every part of the solar system , and there being no means of supplying the waste , so that the time must inevitably come , in the lapse of ages , when this now glorious orb will appear utterly dark and cold , we should listen to his evidence certainly with attention and respect , as to the announcement of a curious truth in science ; but if any individual , on the strength of this supposed discovery , should preach up the instant necessity of economizing with the utmost care our fuel and oil , should advise people to go to bed at sundown in order to save candles , and to warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably be alarmed for his sanity , and would urge him to retire for a while to a madhouse . Yet the Malthusians reason and exhort after the same fashion , and call all people insane who will not listen to them . They preach a crusade against matrimony , and proclaim war to the knife against the multiplication of the species . Dr. Chalmers and Miss Martineau , par nobile , were driven almost frantic by seeing that people would be so foolish and obstinate as to get married ; they would have had an act of Parliament declaring the jus trium liberorum to be transportation , and they affirmed that John Rogers , the first martyr , richly merited his doom * Even so sober a thinker as Mr. Mill loses all patience and discretion in reprobating the blindness of people upon this subject . He insidiously attempts to allure the women over to his side , by advocating their " emancipation* ' and their right to receive as high wages as men , saying that the law and custom which ordain that a female " shall have scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Rogers was burned in Smithfield , February 4 , 1555 , a pardon being offered him at the stake , which he refused , though he had a wife and ten small children unprovided for . " - Neal 's History of the Puritans. // except as a wife and mother , is one of those social injustices which call loudest for remedy . " He is comforted , however , by believing that the true doctrine , " as soon as it attained any prevalence , would have powerful auxiliaries in the great majority of women " ; for on the *. ife always " devolves , along withall the physical suffering , and at least a full share of the privations , the whole of the intolerable domestic drudgery resulting from the excess . " Pray economize fuel and oil , good people , for one of these days the sun will surely be burnt out . The great and palpable error of the Malthusians consists in assuming , without a particle of evidence , without condescending even to argue the matter , that the time has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there is even now a deficiency of food , so that the only mode of increasing the happiness of the lower classes is to lessen their numbers . When asked to furnish proof of this assertion , they immediately begin to talk of something else , - of low wages , starving Irish , insufficient employment , and the like , and invariably end by appealing to the rapid and immense effects of increase in a geometrical progression , and so concluding that , if the time has not yet come , it will be here very shortly , which amounts to the same thing . Now we utterly deny that any evil of this sort is at hand , or that its near approach is to be dreaded ; nay , we believe that it is quite as far off as Mr. Godwin 's dream of the perfectibility of society , which certainly does not lie on this side of the millennium . The absurdity of talking about the necessary pressure of population upon the means of subsistence , as an explanation of the evils with which society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years ago , by Colonel Thompson , in his adnirable Catechism on the Corn Laws . We borrow a part of his pungent exposition of the subject . " If it should be urged , that there must always come a time when population will press against food , and therefore there is no use in attempting to escape it ; this would be like urging , that there is no use in a man 's escaping from murder now , because he will not be immortal afterwards . There is all the difference in the world between enduring an evil by the will of Providence and by the act of man . Human life , in the whole , is but the procrastination of death ; but that is no reason why men should die just now for other men s convenience . There may come a // time when there will he no coal to burn , no iron to make tools , and perhaps no salt left in the sea ; but this is no reason why men should not make something of the interval which must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food must , to a great manuf*turing and naval people , . be almost as remote as the time when there will be no salt left in the sea . And come when it may , it must always come gradually , which is by itself no small diminution of the mischief . The maximum of contingent evil in prospect is only equal to what it is proposed to bring on at once ; and all the world must be cleared and peopled before the evil can arrive. ** Our position is , that in the most thickly populated country on earth , the number of the people is yet very far within the limit of the subsistence which the land is capable of affording , even if we look only to the capacities of their own soil , and not to the immeasurable supplies which their commerce and wealth might pour in upon them from other shores . To adopt the favorite metaphor of the iVinithusians , the weights which are now actually keeping down the spring of populat*on that spring which they think is always ready to fly up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - are war , vice , unnecessary or curable disease , ignorance , idleness , bad habits , bad government , and inequality of wealth fostered by bad laws . Remove these , one by one , or in a mass , and there will he room for an almost indefinite expansion of the compressed force , and a consequent increase of human happiness , before the ultimate check , which may be considered as a weight hanging much higher up , comes into action through the absolute inability of the earth to contain and support more . In truth , it is demonstrable , both from reason and experience , that population never can rise to the point where it will meet this last and insuperable obstacle . Among the lower weights to be first removed are ignorance , vice , and the widely spread misery caused by laws whose sole purpose is to compel a frightful and unnatural inequality of condition these are the causes which render men imprudent and reckless , and induce them to burden themselves with a family , because they are already starving , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of improving their estate . Whatever tends to keep men hopelessly poor is a direct encouragement , the strongest of all incentives , to an increase of population . Take away the causes of misery , remove the insurmountable // barriers which now keep the various classes of society apart , and educate the people , and there will be no fear of an excess of numbers . Take away the lower weights which keep down the spring , and it will never rise high enough to meet the upper one . The bounty of*iature never fails ; it is not the increase of population which causes the misery , but the misery which creates the excess of population . Ireland is an instance directly in point to bring the doctrines of the Maithusians to a test . They say that the island is over-l ) eopled , and that their excessive number is the cause of the wretchedness of the inhabitants . But in ordinary years , Ireland not only supplies food for her whole population , but her exports of the cereal grains alone amount to five millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to at least half as much more . It is absurd , then , to say that the population is here pressing against the limit of subsistence ; and if the doctrine does not hold true . in this case , to what country in the civilized world is it applicable ? Another view of the question leads to the same result . If the land were parcelled out , and if the same modes of cultivation obtained , in Ireland as in the Netherlands , it is demonstrable that the soil would furnish abundance of food for twenty-six millions of inhabitants , instead of supporting , as it now does , but nine millions , one half of whom are constantly on the brink of starvation. * Is it too much to say , then , that , in the strongest case which can be produced , the doctrine of 1'Ialthus has no application , no practical value whatever , and never can have any , at least for centuries to come The North American Indians , when their hunting-grounds generally exceeded ten square miles for every member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great fertility , were often severely pinched by famine . For this reason , infanticide was not unknown among them , and the savage wars that were waged between neighbouring tribes operated still further as a check upon the population . So far , then , as the mere lack of food proves excess of numbers , the Malthusian might as well have preached abstinence from marriage to them as to the Irish . In both cases , the bounty of Provideuce is not exhausted , hut men do not make proper use of the means that are within their reach for satisfying their // bodily wants ; it matters not whether they leave the soil untilled altogether , or send a large portion of its product out of the country , though millions are famishing at home . As food is the only great article of export from Ireland , it is , in truth , the coin through wkjch the wretched people pay their rent to their opulent absentee landlords . The princely incomes of the Duke of Devonshire , the 1'Iarquis of Conyngham , the Earl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made up by taking from each of the cottier tenants of their vast estates the pig , the whole crop of grain , and part of the potatoes which he has raised during the year , - the laborer himself and his family being left to eke out what remains with boiled sea-weed , to beg , or to starve . Who can wonder that such treatment , continued for two centuries , should have reduced " the finest peasantry in the world " to the condition and habits of savages , rendering them fierce , reckless , idle , turbulent , and cruel , so that the only hope of the philanthropist for them , seeing this utter depravation of their character , is that large numbers of them may speedily perish , leaving room for a new generation to spring up tinder happier auspices ? It is mockery , under such circumstances , to speak of the excess of population as the only source of these manifold evils , or to complain of the perversity of the people in continuing to multiply their kind , and bring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With quite as much truth might the Malthusian urge the want of standing-room as the want of food , when he seeks to inculcate prudence as to the growth of families ; no one can help seeing that there is abundance of both . There is but one consideration that gives any plausibility to the theory of Malthus . Certainly , no one , under present circumstances , would advise either an English or an Irish laborer , who is dependent entirely on wages , to diminish his chance of keeping out of the workhouse by taking upon himself the support of a wife and children . What would be imprudence for an individual would be imprudence also in the whole class or body of men to which he belongs , or whose position in life resembles his own . The economists do right , then , at the present time , in dissuading the laboring poor from marriage . But we do not hereby acknowledge that the actual wretchedness of this class is the consequence of their having already multiplied up to the farthest limit at // which the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the doctrine which tends to make the wealthier classes in Great Britain hard-hearted and indifferent at the sight of the sufferings of the pQvr , since it teaches that this misery is their own fault , the in*vitable result of their own perversity and improvidence in keeping up their numbers too high . On the contrary , the very fact , that it is now imprudent for them to marry , is what they have most right to cornl ) lain of , since it is not their own fault , but that of the laws and the aristocratic institutions of their country If the policy of the English law , for the last half-century , had favored the distribution of fortunes as directly as it has actually encouraged their aggregation , or if it had been only neutral in this respect , as it is in this country , and had allowed property to take its natural course of an equal division among all the children when the parent had expressed no wish to the contrary , the laboring classes of England , like the peasantry of France and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might now be free to follow their own inclinations without incurring the charge of imprudence . Their right to do so would be established by a fact of the first importance in the eyes of a Maithusian ; they would not have become so numerous as they now are . The population of France , under the law which compels an equal division of the parent 's estate among his children , increases at the rate of only five per cent . in ten years , while the rate for England is more than thrice as great . Yet no one supposes that the Englishman is naturally more careless and improvident , or more inclined to excess , than his neighbour across the Channel . Mr. Mill and his brother economists make the great mistake of confounding the undue relative number of a class with a general excess of the population . The former evil might be corrected by portioning out society anew , through the gradual influence of altered laws , so that the divisions or castes which are too thin in number might be recruited from those which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the necessity of adopting any measures which would affect the bulk of the people . The latter difficulty , if it ever really existed , could be removed only by war , pestilence , famine , or a general adoption of the doctrines of Malthus . The number of persons in Great Britain who are entirely dependent on the wages of hired labor is 34* // unquestionably much too great ; the proportion of this class to the whole people is probably ten times as large as in any country in Continental Europe . Diminish their number , then , by all means . But how ? The Maithusian economists assume that the only mod*of effecting this end is to check the natural growth of the whole population , to lessen the yearly average of marriages and births . But would it not be equally effectual , and more practicable , to recruit from them the classes which are strikingly deficient in numbers , and thus restore the proper balance of society ? It is certainly an anomaly and an evil , that more than half of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither capital nor land ; but is it not equally anomalous and injurious to the welfare of the whole nation , that only 85,000 persons should own all the land , * and less than 200,000 possess four fifths of the whole property , both real and personal ? Restore " the yeomen " of England , of whom her poets , historians , and statesmen made so much account a century or two since , though they now exist only in fiction ; convert the greater part of the hired laborers into peasant proprietors , and we shall hear no more complaints about the lowness of wages or the excess of population . It may be difficult to accomplish this object without peril to the present political constitution of England ; but we can assure Mr. Mill that it will he more easily effected than any general alteration of the habits of the working classes produced by their conversion to Malthusianism . Surely , the greatest of all absurdities is the attempt to convince destitute , ignorant , and starving millions of the truth of a theory in political economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their inclinations , and not to burden the state with more children . The true mode of raising the rate of wages is to alter the relative numbers of employers and employed , not to diminish the total population . The present undue proportion of hired laborers to the * In the very rough estimate , which we presented in our last number , ( pp. 133 , 134 , ) of the whole number of landed proprietors in the three kingdoms , we were careful to avoid error only on the side which was favorable to our argument , and were well aware that the number given was probably much too large . Tue Times , newspaper , has recently stated that the land-owners of Ireland do not exceed 8,000 , while we allowed 24,000 . The number for the United Kingdom is probably much nearer 50,000 than 85,000. // other classes of English society , which is the real evil that the Maithusians have in view , though they grossly mistake it for proof that the island is over-peopled , is chiefly attributable to the heartless policy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the4iantity of human labor employed in agriculture to a minimum , of extending the system of large farms , and cultivating them , as far as possible , by the application of machines , and of driving off the dispossessed rural tenantry to the towns and manufacturing districts , so as to avoid the necessity of maintaining them under the Poor Laws . With how much barbarity and injustice this policy has been carried out , especially in the Scotch Highlands and the most wretched districts of Ireland , where immense domains have been literally " cleared ' * of their human encumbrances , though these were the descendants of the ancient co-proprietors of the soil , and had never resigned their rights , we showed on a former occasion . The work is still going on in England by the rapid absorption of small farms into large ones , and , as Mr. Mill tells us , " by preventing cottages from being built , or by pulling down those which exist** ; - a measure which be objects to , however , since it only keeps down the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any material effect on population generally . " How far this depopulation of the rural districts has been carried , and how rapidly it is still going on , is shown in a very striking manner by the proportion of the agricultural to the total population at different periods . In Queen Elizabeth 's time , from two thirds to three fourths of the whole nation were engaged in tilling the soil , a proportion which will not be deemed excessive , for a larger one now obtains in this country , and the ratio is probably quite as high on the average in most countries on the Continent . But in England , the non-agricultural population now exceeds twelve millions , while the number of the cultivators of the ground is but little more than one fourth as large . The following table , from the last Census Report , giving the proportion in which the classes engaged in agricultural , commercial , and miscellaneous pursuits stood to each other at different periods , shows with what rapidity , of late years , this change has been effected . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being divided into these three classes . // Years . Agricultural . Commercial . Miscellaneous . 1811 35 44 21 1821 33 46 21 1831 28 42 30 1841 46 32 Within thirty years , then , the agriculturists have fallen from more than one third to little over one fifth of the total population . For a parallel to this , we must go back to that depopulation of the rural districts in Italy which accompanied , if it did not cause , the decline and fall of the Roman empire in the West . Who can wonder that , under such a system , the supply of food is not adequate for the wants of the people ? As it is well known that the natural growth of the rural population is far more rapid than that of the urban and manufacturing classes , even the foregoing figures , striking as they are , do not tell the whole story as to the speed with which the great land-owners of England are " clearing " their vast estates . Mr. Mill insists strongly on the fact , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , the want must be supplied by cultivating soils more sterile than the worst which were formerly under culture , " or by applying additional labor to the old soils at a diminished advantage . " This is the use which the Malthusians make of Ricardo 's theory of rent , striving to show that an increase of population under any circumstances is an evil , as it creates a necessity for more labor with constantly diminishing returns . The statement is paradoxical , for it applies as well to an infant colony established in a vast territory , on a virgin soil , as to a crowded country like England . Does our author seriously mean , that an increase of population in Australia , or in the valley of the Mississippi , is a misfortune ? Yet this is a legitimate inference from the theory ; and he says explicitly , " A greater number of people can not , in any given state of civilization , be collectively so well provided for as a smaller . " But his argument amounts to nothing , for , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more work to be done , there are more bands to do it ; and as it is demonstrable that even in Ireland ( until its population shall be thrice as great as it is at present ) the labor of one person upon the soil must produce more than is necessary for his personal subsistence , the more hands there are employed in agriculture , the greater will be // the surplus for those engaged in other occupations . That the surplus xviii not increase in the same ratio with the number of agricultural laborers is a fact of no irnporiiance ; before the growth of the population can be checked by absolute deficiency of food , there must cea* to be any surplus , and the earth must not yield enough even for the subsistence of him who cultivates it . We may have as much dread of this contingency as of the sun 's expending its whole stock of light and heat , or of there being no salt left in the sea . Mr. Mill confounds the net profits of capital employed on the land with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , go on diminishing with the increase of the population and therefore the great land-owners seek to depopulate their estates , and the economists preach up abstinence from marriage . A fallacy , pervades the whole reasoning of the Malthusians on the relation of the supply of food to the growth of the populaLiOn . More grain is raised because there are more men who need it , and not more men are raised because there is more grain to feed them with . Procreation is not stopped because there is no more grain , since misery and the peril of starvation only cause people to multiply faster . But agriculture is stopped when there are no more mouths calling for food ; a cessation of demand causes a cessation of supply here , because the husbandman is looking only for pecuniary gain . But in the case of population , a want of demand does not occasion a want of supply , since men are urged by their natural inclinations , and not by the state of the childrenmarket , or by the desire of profit . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want a wife . It is true that the call for more food , which is created by an increase of numbers , will not be " an effectual calling , " unless the people have the means to purchase it with ; but these they will never lack , if the wealth of the country is distributed according to the natural course of things , - that is , in exact proportion to the increase of each family , all the children sharing alike . At any rate , if the demand be rendered ineffectual from this cause , the real evil , the real check upon population , is not the insufficient supply of food , but the want of property . Turn the matter as we may , it is not the niggardliness of nature which is the source of misery , but the devices of man and the injustice of the laws . // rrhe true law of the increase of population in a civilized society is not hard to find , though it is difficult to express all the modifications that it undergoes from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclination of people to marry is controlled hy their opinion of the effect which marriage will have upon their position in life . If they have no fear that the additional expense thus incurred will depress them to a lower rank in society , or interfere with their hopes of rising in the world , they will follow the impulse of natural affection and desire . The eldest son in a wealthy family , where the right of primogeniture prevails , will marry because his future is secure . The miserable laborers on his father 's estate , who do not taste meat once in a month , will marry because their future is secured in another way ; nothing can sink them in the world , and no degree of prudence or self-denial can ever raise them above a laborer 's estate . The younger sons in noble or wealthy families remain single , because matrimony to them would be certain degradation and as the marriage of only one person out of a family can not do more than keep up the number in the class , and often may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die out and if it were not for promotions to their rank from the middle classes , the upper orders of society would gradually disappear . Of course , this gradual diminution of numbers tends strongly to the concentration of wealth , especially when the property is tied up by entail on the male line . Estates , when once united by marriage or collateral inheritance , can never be divided again by a multiplication of heirs . In the intermediate conditions of life , the frequency of marriages will still depend on the same rule , though its operation will be affected by the general circumstances of the country , and by the particular position of individuals . In a newly settled region , children are a help to the parents ' advancement , because labor is so valuable ; in a more thickly populated country , they are a hindrance . But even in the latter case , those who are in easy circumstances will marry , while those who can but just maintain themselves in the condition in which they were born will often remain single . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who cultivate their own little farms , and are perpetually admonished by the moderate size of their properties that any increase of their number must lead , not indeed to starvation , but to a forfeiture of their position as land-owners . // The general effect in the Old World , then , may be thus stated , - that the numbers of the poor increase most rapidly , the middle classes more slowly , and the upper or wealthier ones not at all . This is strikingly illustrated in Sweden , where the census and the regist*tion of births , deaths , and marriages are taken with reference to the division of the people into three classes . The official returns for 1835 give the following results . The whole number reckoned as belonging to the class of the nobility was 10,556 , and the yearly excess of births over deaths among them was 7 , or one for every 1,508 . There were 67,101 " persons of property and station , " and the yearly excess for this class was 105 , or one for every 640 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one year exceeded the deaths by 20,884 , which is one for every 107 . Among the nobility , 13 per cent . of the married males were but 25 years of age or under ; among the peasantry , 37 per cent . were married at this early age . In wretched Ireland , more than one half of the males who are over 17 years old are married . Observe , now , that in not one of the cases enumerated does the prospect of obtaining a bare subsistence , or the fear of starving , operate to foster or prevent the growth of the populatmon . The half-famished Irish peasant marries , though morally certain that the lot of his offspring will be harder than his own . In all other situations , if doubts be entertained as to matrimony , they refer only to the loss or gain of social advantages , never to a question of life or death . Actual hunger , as an epidemic and a chronic disease , is nowhere known in the civilized world , save in the British Isles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds to influence their conduct . Commerce brings the uttermost parts of the earth together for all matters of vital concern , and wealth lays every clime under contribution to satisfy both the natural and artificial wants of man . The whole stock of food in the world , and the facilities for increasing it , are so great , and exceed so obviously any possible demand for it for centuries to come , that the necessity of providing a sufficient store of it does not usually enter into the calculations of men , as they take it for granted that an abundance can always be had , though at a fluctuating price . Agricultural products are but one of the myriad forms of wealth for the time being , and absolute privation // of them is not possible , except as one phase of excessive poverty , which is never a general complaint , if it be not directly fostered by the laws . The unequal distribution of food , and the consequent extreme suffering of the poorest class in the community , * but the manifestation in its worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more a real and insuperable difficulty , imposed by the penuriousness of nature or the defective care of Providence , in supplying the poor with food , than there is in giving them standingroom on the earth , or in providing them with clothes and domestic utensils . The doctrine of Malthus , in respect to its application to the present affairs of the world , is but a melancholy humbug . We have but little space left in which to consider Mr. McCulloch 's defence of the English system of laws that regulate the succession to property ; and in truth not much is needed . The principal argument in favor of the monstrous inequality of fortunes of which they are the chief cause is , that it is absolutely necessary for the preservation of an hereditary aristocracy . This will be satisfactory to all who believe that the few who are born to the certain possession of vast estates are more likely to be virtuous , intelligent , and capable than any other persons in the community . It does not agree very well , however , with Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said that it had the merit of making " only one fool in a family . " Nor is it quite consistent with what Mr. McCulloch himself remarks in another connection , that , " if you would develop all the native resources of a man 's mind , you must make him aware of his inferiority in relation to others , and inspire him with a determination to rise to the same or a higher level " and that " it is not to those placed by their fortunes at the head of society , but to those in its humbler walks who have raised themselves to eminence , that mankind are indebted for the greater number of those inventions and improvements which have made such vast additions to the sum of human happiness . " But we do not need to discuss the merits of aristocratic rule in the abstract ; the practical question is , whether the blessings it confers upon the country at large are enough to make up for the misery which it entails upon the lower classes ; whether the support of the dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset for an Irish // famine and rebellion , and for seven millions sterling annually expended on the English poor . Doubtless , it is desirable to have a body of fifty thousand wealthy landed proprietors in the state , many of whom are accomplished gentlemen and fit to be hereditary legislators ; but , *iluckily , they can not he had without bringing with them a million and a half of paupers every year , and reducing the rate of wages , on which half of the nation are entirely dependent , to the lowest point that will sustain life on the poorest and scantiest fare . But it is feared that the motive for accumuiation will not be strong enough , if it is not stimulated by a sight of the splendor and luxury in which the great landlords live , and the influence and consideration which they enjoy . To this Mr. Mill 's answer seems suflicient , that " in America there are few or no great hereditary fortunes ; yet industrial energy and the ardor of accumulation are not supposed to be particularly backward in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mistake , when they put so much stress upon the necessity of keeping up the incentives for people to get rich . Human nature requires no urging in this respect . Wealth is coveted originally , no doubt , for some ulterior motive , - for the enjoyments that it will bring ; but it soon comes to be loved for its own sake , the passion and the habit of money-making leading to the sacrifice of every object for which riches at first seemed desirable . The certain and undisturbed possession of a fortune for one 's own lifetime is motive enough for exertion ; we do not believe that the springs of industry and economy would be sensibly relaxed , if a man 's power over his wealth should cease entirely at his death , the state then appropriating it , and giving but a small portion to his children . However this may be , Mr. McCulloch is wrong in supposing that the sight of great estates tied up perpetually in the same families is so effectual a stimulus to industry as if the same amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to hand , the alternations of fortune being frequent , and the chance to every individual of being successful sooner or later being consequently increased . To induce men to buy tickets in a lottery , there must not only be great prizes in the wheel , but some chance , however small , of drawing one within a definite period . Every lawyer who begins practice may hope one day to be von . Lxvii . - No. 141. 35 // come Lord Chancellor , for as that splendid office is not handed down by hereditary descent , some member of the bar must obtain it ; and this hope , slight as it is , is one of the springs which keep up the activity and learning of the profession . But a countit* gentleman with a thousand a year sees no possibility of his becoming a Duke of Buccleuch with an income two hundred times as great ; and therefore the country gentleman usually does nothing but hunt foxes and go to Newrnarket . To take great estates out of the market , as is done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families , making alienation , division , - and we may add , improvement , - alike impossible , is in fact to lessen the number of the prizes of industry , and so far , while rendering one man improvident , wasteful , and idle , to lessen the hopes and deaden the exertions of all others . Go to the other end of society , and you find the same cause working out similar results . What hope has an Irish cottier , a Tipperary boy , exert himself as he may , of ever obtaining more generotis fare than buttermilk and sodden potatoes ? and who can wonder that , without such hope , he should become the reckless , lazy , and quarrelsome beggar that be is ? What encouragement is it to him , that , from the door of his mud cabin , he can see the magnificent but deserted abode of his absentee landlord , who comes over once in a year or two to look after his Irish estates which yield him an income of ? 20,000 a year ? It shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of these extremes of opulence and misery descending in the same lines from one generation to another , the accident of birth alone determining who shall continue in them through life , has not long ago extinguished ambition and effort , and rendered society torpid and motionless . In the learned professions , indeed , and in manufactures and trade , there is some room for changes of fortune , and therefore some incitement to activity . But even here the deadening influence of a fixed hereditary transmission of employment and social condition is felt . We have heard of one family in London which has sold tea at retail , on the same stand , through five generations . The institution of castes among the Hindoos affords the only parallel to such a social state , though even the Pariahs might compassionate " the irretrievable helotism of the working classes " in Great Britain , and the Brahmins wonder at the prejudices of the English aristocracy . // What a contrast to this state of things is afforded by the aspect of society here in America ! Wealth here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A great fortune springs up , like the prophet 's gourd , in a night , and is dissipated by s6&amp;ie unforeseen accident on the morrow . Every one is made restless and anxious by this exposure to sudden change ; but one great good comes of it , that it keeps down permanent discontent , and stifles the jealousy that is usually nursed by social differences and inequalities of fortune . How is it possible , indeed , that the poor should he arrayed in hostility against the rich , when the son of an Irish coachman - we are not supposing a case - becomes the governor of a State , and the grandson of a millionnaire dies a pauper ? Hence the institution of property is really more secure here than in any other country on the globe , because it is defended , not only by those who are partakers for the time being of the power and enjoyment which it confers , but by those who hope - nay , who actually expect - to share with them in this respect hereafter and these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally unreasonable enough to defend their expectations with more zeal and ardor than their actual possessions ; to rob one of an expected benefit , which has been the object of his hopes and exertions for months or years , is usually felt by him as a more serious injury than the taking away of wealth of which he has long considered himself as the undoubted owner , and therefore has spent no thought upon it . The consequence of the whole is an unceasing energy and activity in the pursuit of wealth , which accomplish greater wonders than all the modern inventions of science , which actually generate enthusiasm of character , and are regarded by foreigners with surprise and distrust , as the token of some constitutional disease in the body politic . Even the Irish immigrant here soon loses his careless , lazy , and turbulent disposition , and becomes as sober , prudent , industrious , and frugal as his neighbours . Nearly all the enormous fortunes that have been gathered in this country are the growth of a single lifetime , and therefore , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of their founders , there would not be a smaller number of them in the succeeding generation . Consequently , they are regarded as the prizes of industry , economy , and enterprise , // and the sight of them stimulates and sustains exertion , instead of chilling and repressing it , which is the effect produced by the fixedness in certain families of the vast hereditary estates in our mother land . To begin with little or nothing is no discourage*ent here , while it is the almost certain commencement , in England , of a lifetime of toil and penury . That riches are not the only good , however , and that the constant strain of the faculties , the restlessness , the feverish anxiety to get on , which are seen in the eager pursuit of them , are not the most desirable habits or traits of character , nor the most conducive to the real welfare either of the individual or of society , we are quite as ready as Mr. Mill to admit . But the following lively picture , which he draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some respects , is overcharged in others , and is unfaithful because incoml ) l ete . " I confess I am not charmed with the ideal of life held out by those who think that the normal state of human beings is that of struggling to get on ; that the trampling , crushing , elbowing , and treading on each other 's heels , which form the existing type of social life , are the most desirable lot of human kind , or any thing but the disagreeable symptoms of one of the phases of industrial progress . The Northern and Middle States of America are a specimen of this stage of civilization in very favorable circumstances ; having , apparently , got rid of all social injustices and inequalities that affect persons of Caucasian race and of the male sex , while the proportion of population to capital and land is such as to insure abundance to every able-bodied member of the community who does not forfeit it by misconduct . They have the six points of Chartism , and they have no poverty : and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole of one sex is devoted to dollar-hunting , and of the other to breeding dollar-hunters. " - Vol. ii . pp. 308 , 309 . No , Mr. Mill , it is not all . The energies which are first awakened in the pursuit of wealth soon find other objects on which to expend themselves , and the gratifications of the taste and the intellect are as eagerly sought here as in the Old World . Hereditary fortunes unquestionably give more spare time to their possessors ; but abundance of leisure is not the only requisite for the attainment of the higher graces of life . Activity of mind is at least equally essential , and // those who are born to vast estates and high social position are more apt to allow their faculties to rust from disuse , or to turn them in search of trivial or gross amusement , than those who are obliged first to achieve these advantages by their own efforts . Letters , scie*e , and the arts find ardent votaries even in this paradise of dollar-hunters ; the progress of invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably more rapid here than in Great Britain . Yankee ingenuity has long been proverbial , and Mr. Mill allows himself to be blinded by the representations of mere caricaturists , if he supposes that this ingenuity is all expended in devices how to grow rich . We have philanthropists and reformers , too , who are not deficient either in numbers or in zeal ; whatever we may think of the wisdom of their proceedings , they certainly are not seeking for wealth ; yet they strive , and cry , and jostle each other with an earnestness and vigor , cempared with which the exertions of the money-changers seem tame and feeble . We have just proved to the world , that the passion for military glory is as rife on the banks of the Ohio and the Mississippi as among the countrymen of Frederick the Great and Napoleon . Or , to take a more agreeable illustration , compare Lowell with Manchester in respect to the care which is taken for the moral and intellectual training of the operatives , and then say over which city the statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the past twenty years , more has been accomplished here in the cause of popular education than the joint efforts of the Parliament , the Church , and the landed gentry have effected in England since the beginning of the century . Forty per cent . of the English people can not write their names ; while the last census found but one half of one per cent . of the population of Massachusetts in this condition , and most of these were probably recent immigrants from Great Britain . While Mr. Mill is commenting on this eagerness in the pursuit of wealth , which appears to him so prominent a trait in the American character , he seems to forget the remark that we have alrendy quoted from him , on the great liberality with which this wealth is expended for public objects . Rapid alternations of fortune do not lead to contracted views of the use of riches , or to penurious habits ; we may be a speculating , but we are not a miserly people . A fortune which 35 * // has been spedily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , is usually held very freely , or with an open hand , while it is in the individual 's possession ; that which has been slow* ly amassed from very small savings , and by the practice of rigid economy through a ng period of years , is commonly hoarded with a jealous and sordid care . In a country like England , if the founder of such a *fortune has had any other motive than a mere love of pelf , it is , probably , that his hardly earned wealth might be held undivided and inalienable in his own family through future generations . An object so remote as this seldom enters the mind of an American , and if it did , he would see but little chance of its attainment ; he is more likely to covet immediate applause , and the transmission of his name with honor to posterity , through the endowment of a public institution or the furtherance of some scheme of general utility . Besides , the previous habits of the rich have a great effect on their ability , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He who inherits an entailed estate inherits along with it a scale of expenditure which is quite equal to its income ; and if , as is frequently the case , the estate was mortgaged when it came to him , he is very likely to transmit it with all the additional encumbrances the law will allow to his successor . One great cause of the miseries with which unhappy Ireland is afflicted is the deeply encumbered condition of the landed property there ; the landlord is not able to assist his tenantry , even if he would . His creditors are more merciless to them than to himself , because the payment of the interest depends on the punctual collection of the rents , while the principal is secure as a permanent lien on the ground . Rich men in this country are more inclined to munificence from the very fact that they were not horn rich , but have achieved a fortune by their own exertions . A man begins poor , and therefore with frugal habits , and consequently hardly knows what to do with the income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has no ances* tral castle to maintain in due state , and no county to contest at each succeeding election . Nay , the custom of the country , the force of public opinion , is such , that he can not make his personal expenditure equal to his income , even if he wished . He must not keep a carriage and four , nor have a footman to stand behind his more modest equipage , nor // clothe his servants in livery , * nor adopt many other of the badges by which some persons try to convince the world that they are people of consequence . We are accused of being fond of titles , it is true ; but the epithets of Major , Colonel , and Honorable cost nothing but*civility , and so do not help a man to spend his fortune . W* do not tolerate gold lace , nor cocked hats , nor footmen with powdered heads and goldheaded canes . The effect of this limitation of one 's personal expenses is very salutary . The most natural and sensible way of deriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show of it in the eyes of the world , is to give largely to public charities . The sums which are contributed here by individuals for the support of schools , colleges , churches , missions , hospitals , and institutions of science and beneficence , put to shame the official liberality of the oldest and wealthiest governments in Europe . A New England button-maker , the architect of his own fortune , endows most munificently an academy , and founds two or three college professorships , during his lifetime , scorning to make only a tardy provision for them in his will out of wealth which can not be carried beyond the grave . The benefactions of the inhabitants of Boston alone , a city which had a population of only 25,000 in 1800 , though it is now nearly five times as large , have amounted during the present century to at least six millions of dollars . A single institution , Harvard College , as we learn from the excellent sketch of its history just published by its Treasurer , Mr. Samuel A. Eliot , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are payable at a future but not very distant day - more than $850,000 . So well established is this custom of liberality , that very wealthy people are in a manner constrained to make large bequests for public objects in their wills ; and if one occasionally fails to comply with the general expectation in this respect , his memory incurs so much ob * We must caution some of our readers in England not to believe that the Americans abstain from these things because they are afraid that they shall be " lynched , " if they adopt them ; they are deterred by a more salutary fear , - that of being laughed at even by the mob . It is necessary to say , also , that we write from Boston , and speak of what we are best acquainted with , the New England character . In New York , we are sorry to say , these fooleries have recently obtained some favor , though not among the respectable people of wealth . // loquy , that sometimes his heirs have been shamed into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid during the lifetime of the donors , if the object be one of generally acknowledged utility , the call to give assumes very much the aspect of*a demand . And it is a remark which can be very easil*verified , that the most numerous and magniflcent gifts and bequests are made , not by men who have inherited their fortunes , but by those who have amassed them by their own exertions . We comment upon these things in no boastful spirit , for it is not the character of our people , but of our social institutions , of our laws affecting the descent of property , that we wish to defend . We speak of the comparative effects , both moral and economical , of a republican and an aristocratic polity , of a system of laws which aims at the distribution , and one which favors the aggregation , of property , - acting upon two equally enlightened nations , who are mainly of the same blood , and speak the same language , and whose respective situations are as nearly alike as those of two great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed by English economists upon the advantage that we enjoy in our abundance of fertile territory . The immense colonial dominion and greater wealth of England go very far towards balancing this supposed advantage ; the way from Massachusetts to Wisconsin and Iowa is nearly as long , and quite as costly , as that from Liverpool to Nova Scotia and the Canadas . The present condition of Spanish America , with its thin and almost stationary population , and its vast uncultivated , though fertile , plains and valleys , is a further proof that the prosperity of our own people is not attributable merely to our favorable location , and that the inhabitants of a country do not necessarily tend to a rapid increase because they are abundantly supplied with the necessaries of life . Capital and land are not mere instruments for the production of wealth , in which character alone Mr. Mill is disposed to regard them , but necessary means for the support and happiness of the whole nation ; and in this capacity , like rain and other fertilizing agents for the soil , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed . One mode in which the broad diffusion of wealth operates for the encouragement of industry and the growth of capital seems to have almost escaped the notice of the English econ // omists . When the mass of the people are wretchedly poor , they consume little , and the field of employment for their own labor is therefore very limited . Poverty tends to generate poverty , for as the effectual demand for , or ability to purchase , commodities is dinini*ed , the commodities themselves cease to be produced , and capital remains stationary . If the nation is not rich enough to consume any thing but potatoes , they will have no employment except in raising potatoes , and as the labor of one in this field will produce enough for the subsistence of many , there will be a great surplus of unemployed labor , and the Malthusians , with their usual facility in jumping at conclusions , will cry out that there is a surplus of population , or what is the same thing in their theory , a deficiency of food . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , there is not a deficiency , but a superfluity , of potatoes , and therefore the land which might be applied to raising a larger stock of them is applied to cultivating other edible products which can be sent out of the country , to find elsewhere a people who are in need of them , and are able to buy them . This is the exact description of Ireland . Three fourths of the people are literally too poor to create a demand for any thing but 1 ) potatoes ; it is not the penuriousness of nature which is the source of the difficulty , not land which is wanting , but wealth . And there is no absolute lack even of wealth ; the nation , taken as a whole , is enormously rich , but all their wealth is in the hands of a very few persons , where the policy of the law has placed it by a very ingenious device to counteract the operation of nature , and to make sure , in every case , that all the power , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool in the family . " The native Irish are in truth very poor , for they do not own even Ireland ; a great part of the country is the property of a few English landlords , most of whom are absentees . It is little to say , under such circumstances , that Ireland affords hardly any market either for British or Irish manufactures . There is scarcely any field there for the mechanic arts , for the numberless small occupations which are created by a due regard for the comforts and conveniences of life . The tailor can not live there , because the people wear nothing but rags , which , like the great landed estates of the country , have been in the family for several generations . The shoemaker // is obliged to go beyond his last , because his countrymen are obliged to go barefoot . The blacksmith , the glazier , the house-painter , the carpenter , the mason , and a dozen other mechanics , can not obtain a livelihood , because the people live in rnud4cabins , or ditches covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench , some straw to lie upon , and an iron pot ; consequently , there is little employment for the small tradesmen who sell crockery , wooden and tin ware , cutlery , and the like . Of course , there is no demand for soap or candles ; and even the butcher and the baker are out of office , because the people eat neither meat nor bread . Potatoes are the only article in demand ; and the Irish are too poor to buy even these , so that , if their own crop of them is destroyed by the rot , they starve . Our readers may suspect that this picture is too highly colored ; but we refer them to the published evidence of such travellers as Inglis and Kohl , to the report of the " Times Commissioner , " reviewed in our last number , and to the accounts of the famine of the last year . Let them look , then , at the enormous incomes of the Irish Church and the great landed proprietors , and say if this extreme poverty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth in the country , or from the hideous inequality of its distribution . What effect would be produced , if those high mounds of riches , which tower over every district in Ireland , were dug down and scattered broadcast over the land ? And what prevents this from being accomplished but those laws of primogeniture and entail , which Mr. McCulloch thinks are necessary for the support of the British aristocracy ? The effects of a general diffusion of the stock of national wealth , and the consequent multiplication of these small arts and trades through the increased demand for their products , are very strikingly shown in this country . The United States afford a far better market for manufactured goods than any country of equal population on the globe , because the universal prosperity of the community enables them to consume more . A statistical survey of the domestic manufactures of Massachusetts , * taken by authority of the State in 1845 , shows , that , with a population of only 800,000 , more than * See Ilmerican dimanac and Repository of Useful Knowledge fo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots and shoes are manufactured here every year , employment being thus given to nearly fifty thousand persons . The manufactures of cabinet , tin , and wooden ware , of hats , caps , and bonnets , soap and candles , paper and leather , employ over *venty-two thousand hands , and the value of the annual product exceeds five millions of dollars . Of course , a large portion of these products is sent to the other States . We say nothing of the much larger manufactures of cotton , wool , and iron , because a part of these goods are exported , though the home market for them s more considerable than the foreign . The other commodities are better illustrations of the principle which we seek to illustrate , - namely , that the aggregate national product is greater when the national capital is widely distributed than when it is concentrated in a few hands , because the aggregate consumption is greater . The productive part of this consumption leads to the increase of the national wealth , the unproductive part is an index of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an endless one , and we can not pursue it further without trespassing unreasonably on the patience of our readers . In what we have written upon it , both now and on former occasions , our object has been , not merely to point out the peculiar causes of that frightful anomaly in the history of civilization , the present social condition of Great Britain and Ireland , but to show by contrast the working of our own institutions , and the reasons which all the inhabitants of this country have for being satisfied with their lot . Among the English writers who have recently discussed this theme , Messrs . Laing and Thornton have paid more attention to facts , and Mr. Mill to principles . Though we can not agree with the latter in all his speculations , and object particularly to his uncompromising defence and broad application of the theory of Malthus , we gladly acknowledge our obligations to him for much instruction on this particular subject , and for what is , on the whole , unquestionably the ablest , the most comprehensive , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has appeared since the days of Adam Smith . His book ought to take its place by the side of The Wealth of Nations in the library of every well-informed man , both in the Old and the New World.
