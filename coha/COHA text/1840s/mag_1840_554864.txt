txt When the editor of a periodical , or a reviewer , in the exercise of a sound discretion , finds occasion to question the conclusions of another writer , or even to doubt his facts , no one has a right to complain ; not even the man , whose facts or conclusions have been controverted . But , when a writer or revie*ver goes further than this , and imputes to his author that which implies bad motives , the case is altered . The accused has thea just cause of complaint ; and of right is entitled to be heard in self-defence . And it is because the writer of the article in the last numnber of the North American , ' entitled Politics of the Puritans , ' has done this , while speaking of the writer of an article in the New York Review , ' with a similar title , that the author of that article feels called upon to address you // this note . But he wishes it to be distinctly understood , that he does not consider himself entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the merits of the question in the North American . ' That has been done in part , and ( with permission of the editor of that valuable periodical ) will hereafter be continued , in the New York Review . ' His *only object now is , to correct certain misapprehensions of the author of the article in the North American ' ; and to show , that the charges made against the author of the article in the New York Review , ' are , to say the least , not well sustained . Nor will he allow himself to allude to certain would-be sharp speeches and witty sayings , uttered against him by the author in question as he has a single point in view , an answer to the inquiry , What is truth ? " But , lest your readers should not bear in mind those things to which I allude , allow me to refresh their memories with a few brief quotations . " For a disingenuous use of authorities , . . . . . on colonial history , this article has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - p. 460 . There is a contempt of facts about it that is positively overwhelming . ' - p. 443 . It is difficult to show an instance in which the facts of history have been more singularly perverted . ' - p. 439 . Now what is the evidence by which these weighty charges are sustained ? On page 53 of the New York Review , ' it was said ; Surveying in this manner the manner therein describedi the nature of the contest in Enb land , beti een Churchmen and Puritans , we shall find it merely a political , NOT , as it is usually represented , a religious one . This may be fairly inferred from what is said by both of our authors , ' &amp;c . This is the passage as printed in the New York Review , ' though not precisely as quoted by the author of the article in the North American ' ; and the position taken by one is of course denied by the other . The passages quoted from our authors , ' in the New York Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Their the Puritans ' opposition to the Church of England , was mainly political , and limited in a great measure to discipline . ' It is not pretended , that the Ne York Review ' is mistaken here , but that Professor Kingsley is mistaken , and that he goes too far . ' For our own part , we shall feel entirely safe , while Professor Kingsley is our file-leader . Nor is it pretended that Mr. Bacon is not correctly quoted . Nor is the position denied , that the ulterior object of any party , ' - the end sought , ' should be the criterion for judging of the nature of the controversy . ' Nor is the position denied , that the real contest between Churchmen and Puritans was for the political // ascendency ; Churchmen desiring to continue prelacy as the religion of State , while the Puritans were striving to elevate Presbyterianism to the same post . These not being denied , as indeed they can not be , where is our disingenuous use of , or contempt for authorities ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eulogi sts confrss , that the Puritans were a political , ' as well as religious party , ' and their opposition confined mainly ' to questions of discipline , ' we inferred , that , the end sought being political , the contest was also political . This seems to us to be a mere matter of opinion , and no more authorizes our reviewer to make the foregoing charges against the New York Review ' than they would authorize us to make them against him . Besides , we had taken into consideration a great variety of topics , not even alluded to in the North American . " Again , on pp. 441 - 443 , our author contrasts an extinct from Lord Clarendon , with one from the New York Review , ' for the purpose of contradicting the latter . Now we marvel that he forgot , that the language of one author , quoted for the purpose of contradicting another , should speak of the same things . Thus he should have seen , that as the time we spoke of covered the space from 1570 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly subsequent to 1633 , the time of Laud 's translation to Canterbury , the one does not speak of the same things , and therefore can not contradict the other . But our author says , It is by no means clear , ( as alleged in the New York Review , ' ) that the motive for granting these charters , was to get rid of a dangerous faction . ' - p. 443 . That the Puritans were regarded as a faction by the government , is not , and can not be denied ; and Hutchinson , ( 1 . 45 , ) suggests this very reason as a probable one why such charters were granted . Nor does the fact , that Bancroft and Laud procured orders for the detention of some or many , when they saw the tide of emigration swelling , and rolling on , disprove at all , as we can see , the idea that this policy originated in a particular way , or was acted upon in a particular manner . " Again , our author says , page 444 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing could be more arbitrary , nor more regardless of the principles of civil liberty , than the first organization of the corporation , as it was proposed to take place , under the natural and ordinary construction of that instrument , whilst it remiined in England . ' This may be the honest opinion of cur reviewer , but it contrasts strangely with the history , and with the charter itself . But it is not for us to go into a defence of that instrument ; certainly not in this place . Yet we may be allowed to inquire , *f the natural and ordina // ry construction of the charter , whilst it remained in England , ' was entirely regardless of the principles of civil liberty , ' how mere exportation should render it a model for free govern-* ments , as it was long considered ? Besides , is it not true , that the question of removing the charter to this country was made the subject of legal inquiry ? And is it not true , that it was removed by general consent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not that the groundwork of all their civil regulations ? And were not some of their measures objected to , after they came to this country , on the ground that they were contrary to the charter ? And were not some of the very first laws which they enacted after their arrival here , in direct opposition to the spirit of their charter ? We confess ourselves utterly at a loss to see , how the removal of an instrument , which was utterly regardless of the principles of civil liberty in one place , should render it fraught with freedom in another . Again , our reviewer professes great astonishment at the idea , that Charles the First should be called the protector of liberty in any shape . ' - p. 443 . The language quoted by the reviewer names no one , hut the time 51 ) spoken of in the quotation , covers part of the reign of James , and the whole of the reigns of Charles the First and Second . Now we can not properly occupy the pages of the North American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which our reviewer says shows such a contempt of facts ; but must content ourselves with a few plain and pertinent inquiries . Did not the settlers of Massachusetts , did not they , among one of their very first laws , enact one , that none but a church member should he admitted a freeman ? And was not this in opposition to the spirit of their charter ? And did not the King and Council object to this proceeding ? And did not the Colonial Assembly repeal it in appearance , though not in fact ? And was not this in reality , one of the reasons for taking away this charter ? In short , did not the colonists hold on to this and similar laws , as long as they had the power ? And did not the kings of England object to the exercise of such a power ? And did they not at length cause their charter to be taken away from them by a legal process , for these and similar causes ? And did not their subsequent charter confine them within narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fundamental basis of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ? And was not a similar charter the only Constitution of Connecticut , until within the present generation ? And was not the charter of Maine still more free than either that of Massachusetts or Connecticut ? In short , were not the *wo GREAT *RINCIPLL5 // of popular liberty , UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE , and THE RIGHT OF THE NAJORITY TO GOVERN , were not both of these , in point of fact , contained in those early charters ? And were not all the laws of the colonists in abridgment of those principles , in opposition to the spirit of their charters ? And were not these principles , as contained in these charters , for a time protected by the kings of England ? Some of these inquiries ny possibly be inconvenzent to the reviewer ; hut he will pardon one who has been accused of a contempt of facts , ' jogging his memory a little before he utters other charges of this character . " Now , if the facts are as these questions imply , did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been created for them ? Or did they act upon them ? Where was their love of freedom , when the Browns were sent hack to England for preferring the Book of Common Prayer ' to externpore effusions ? Where , when all the friends of Henry Vane were turned out of office , because Vane himself had become obnoxious to some of the ruling powers ? Where , when towns and individuals were fined ? 20 , ? 40 , and ? 100 , for entertaining any stranger above a given time , lest Vane 's friends should be increased , and he reinstated in office ? Where , when toleration was preached against as a sin ? Now what is the fundamental principle , which lies at the bottom of all our civil institutions ? Is it not the right of the people , not a part of the people , hut the whole people , to govern ? Now our reviewer says , ( p. 4.34 , ) that , in looking after the origin of their establishment that is , this and other similar p*incipIes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation in ascribing it to the agency of the Puritans , than in ascribing the doctrine of gravitation to Newton , or the overthrow of the infallibility of Rome to Luther . ' If by the agency of the Puritans , ' is only meant , that the Puritans were parties concerned , the position is not denied . But if any thing more is intended , we should be glad to hear some of his answers to the above questions . " The position of our reviewer , that the Pu tans did originate and perpetuate those principles , which form at once the basis and characteristic of our political institutions , ' p. 444 , intended to appear as the denial of a position in the New York Review , ' does not meet the point at which it seems to have been aimed . The question of the origin of these principles , has been carefully investigated in a former number of the New York Review ' ( January , 1838 ) ; and upon the accuracy of the history contained in that artcle , must depend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those // principles ' which have given rise to our present government . That article is the proof of the fundamental position taken in the one on the Politics of the Puritans . ' So long , therefore , as the history of that article remains untouched , it can not be necessary for us to spend any time in controverting opinions at variance with the conclusions there drawn . If our reviewer will take that article , and examine all the history of it in its connexion and bearing , and will study it as thoroughly as the author of it did , we presume he will not hesitate to conclude , that the creation of those institutions , which developed those principles of freedom , that form the chief characteristic of our government , was the naturat result of a series of events , reaching back centuries before the name of Puritan had an existence , - that circumstances at one time arrayed them in favor of those principles in England , as far as understood ; that circumstances afterwards arrayed them in opposition to some of them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances developed those principles more fully , and arrayed the colonies in their favor . In all this he will see a chain of events , which , under God , has reared the beautiful fabric of our republic , and in which circumstance , rather than design , had caused the Puritans to act a conspicuous part . But there is one other charge made by the reviewer in the North American , ' to which I have not alluded , but which I must not pass over ; and that is , falsification of authority . ' - p. 447 . Now what does the reviewer mean by falsification of authority ' ? One would suppose that it was misquoting , or the application of language used in reference to one point , to that used in reference to another , as is done by our reviewer on page 444 ( See New York Review , ' p. 62 ) or the garbling of a passage , so as to make it tell a different story from what the author intended . il3ut no charge of this kind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Review . ' The whole of the offence on which this very serious accusation is based , is the quotation of a passage from the Planter 's Plea , ' precisely as it stands in the book ; except , that some of the words not in itatics in the original work , were printed so in the copy ; and that the examples cited by the author of the Plea , ' in illustration of his principles , were not quoted by the reviewer . Now we are sorry to be obliged to turn upon the author , and accuse him of doing those very things , in t he very article in which he makes this charge against us . Thus , on page 437 , he quotes from the New York Review , ' page 53 , and professes to give it , with its emphatic words and small capitals ' ; and yet there are forty-one words italicized in the original article , not italivOL . LI. - NO . LOS . 33 // cized in the North American . ' And again , on page 443 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North American , ' when not a word of it is italicized in the New York Review . ' And yet , when the New York Review ' italicized a line and a half of a quotation , it is charged with quoting as it is not in the original , ' and the not ' is made emphatic , and the writer charged with falsification of authorities . ' " But the writer says , the passage is so prepared what does he mean by prepared ? j as to leave the impression on the mind of the reader , that it was intended by the writer to apply to the Puritan colonists . ' - p. 447 . If our reviewer had copied what precedes and follows the quotation in the New York Review , ' it would not have been necessary for us to have alluded to it at all . But as this preparation of the passage was made not in the New York Review , ' we will quote a few lines of the comment in the New York Review , ' that it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he replies . The Plea ' commences with an examination of the ground and warrant of colonies . ' The second chapter is an answer to the question , What ends may be proposed in planting colonies ? To this the author answers , first ; here follows the quotation . The author then proceeds to show , by various reasons , that the English nation is competent to undertake the task of colonizing , and that New England is a suitable place for planting a colony . Then follows what our author calls a series of partial quotations , ' but which , in point of fact , is the exact statement of the author 's arguments , in his own words , without any qualification or abridgment . Then follows a statement of some of the objections replied to in the Plea , ' in every imwtance , in the precise language of the author of the Plea , ' without any alteration , except that one word is printed in italics , that is not so in the original . Now it is utterly unpardonable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and we challenge him to disprove this statement , ) to accuse another of partial ' quotations , and falsification of authorities . ' " There are several other points in the article of our reviewer that do us quite as much injustice as this ; but , as we have trespassed so long upon your time , we will mention only one more . On page 448 , the reviewer accuses the New York Review of ungenerous perversion of the candor of the " Planter . " ' Now wherein consists this perversion ? The New York Review , ' in order to show that the advancetnent of the Gospel was not believed by their opponeuts to // be the sole , or chief object of their emigration , ' quoted the following language from the Plea . ' As it were absurd the italics are ours to conceive that they have all one mind , so it were more ridiculous to imagine they all have one scope . . N'ecessity may press some ; novelty draw others ; hopes of getin may prevail with a third sort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is here confessed by one of the party , that necessity , ' novelty , ' and hope of gain , ' . . . . . were among the causes that moved the colonists to come to this country . ' But our reviewer says , the Planter " does not confess this that he only argues that there might be a variety of motive , ' &amp;c . The language of the Planter ' is , that it is absurd to suppnse they have all one mind , ' and more ridiculous to imagine they all have one scope , ' or motive . We will not debate the question , whether this amounts to a confession or not . The other charge of falsification of authorities , ' which our polite reviewer urges as evidence , that the author of the article on which he was commenting , did not intend " to prove " anything , nor to hold fast to that which was otherwise than bad , ' is of the same stamp . The fact is simply this , that , when quoting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of MOTIVES by which the colonists were influenced , we did not also quote what he said about the number of men who were influenced by these motives . Besides , one was the confession by a witness , against himseW and the other a statement of another , and an entirely different fact , in his own favor . No*v we quoted all that was said on the subject under consideration , and that precisely as it was written ; and the only omission is that of something else , in no way connected with the point we were examining . " Allow me , Mr. Editor , to return my thanks to yourself for your politeness in receiving and publishing this correction and , through you , to give my respects to the author of the review we have been considering ; and , if it be not improper , to suggest the propriety of his hereafter rending the article he atteml ) ts to review , more thoroughly than he seems to have done in this case . But at the same time , while I entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their descendants , should it become necessary , the author of the review in question , will ever find me ready to meet him at Philippi . ' " So far the letter of the New York Reviewer . We reply If there is one quality , more than any other , absolutely indispensable to the right management of a journal professedly // devoted to criticism , we hold that to consist in its freedom . For without this , it is clearly impossible to furnish to the public such judgments upon the merits or defects of style , sentiment , and reasoning that may distinguish the most current literary performances of the time , as may he depended upon , and as they have a right to expect from the nature of the promises that are held out to induce them to support it . Yet , that freedom can be exercised without occasionally inflicting a little pain upon sensitive authors , and perhaps arousing a spirit of retort in them , is not to be expected . XVe can easily understand why it is that writers find no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited to indignation by an exposure of their defects . Nor is it any cause of wonder , that they should regard even the most moderate castigation as a breach of the canons of politeness . No quantity of sugar can entirely overcome the had taste of a medicine . Neither ought it to be hoped or wished , that the salutary operation of truth should ever be in any degree neutralized by the deceptive medium in which it is conveyed . We never seek to give offence unnecessarily . The twenty-five years ' record of our proceedings stands before the world in proof of our assertion . But when , an occasion arises , in which it may be taken through the simple performance of our duty , we should hold ourselves false to the trust we have assumed , if we were deterred from it by a fear of that consequence . It is with no surprise we find , that our article in the last Number , upon the " Politics of the Puritans , " has given some offence . We could hardly have weighed the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the " New York Review , " whose article was the subject of comment , without understanding the nature of the operation they would probably have upon him . We therefore expected , that he would endeavour to explain , or at any rate to reply . But we did not expect , we confess , that he would desire to make our own journal the medium of communication with the public , or follow any other course than that plainly before him of rejoinder in the pages of the Review which he first occupied . It is true , that he claims of us simply the right of correcting what he is pleased to call our " misapprehensions , " and of refuting our " charges , " and reserves to himself the other measure as a subsequent and more effective resource ; but as , in the exercise of that right , he in point of fact uses it only to repeat his argument , we conceive that the distinction attempted to be drawn , is hardly marked enough to entitle him to the uncommon privilege he craves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open our pages to papers , purporting to be the explanations of au // thors , whose pride and self-love may be wounded by our candor , it is very probable , that the " North American Revie*v " would become a mere catalogue of personal grievances , instead of ; what we wish it to be , an independent and unfaltering expression of the truth . It has been , therefore , with great hesitation , that we have come to the decision to publish the letter which precedes these observations . We have come to it , not because we think the author has a particle of foundation in justice for his complaint of us , or that he has succeeded , in any degree , in rectifying his position in those points wherein we took the liberty to censure it , but solely because we were unwilling that he should , as a brother reviewer , have it to say , that even a most unusual degree of courtesy had not been extended by us to his request . When , in the performance of our ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are disposed to make every allowance for them , and perhaps even to stretch a point rather than expose ourselves to a charge of illiberality or unkindness . At the same time , whilst in this particular instance we depart from the only rule known to critical magazines like ours , that of adhering to criticism , and rejecting controversy , we wish it to be distinctly understood by all authors who may hereafter be disturbed by our censure , that this must not be regarded as a precedent , and that these pages must not the more be made , by the present example , a scene for any petulance of theirs . There can be no necessity why we should be burdened with complaints , whilst so many different modes of exhaling them lie open in every quarter of the United States . If we ever commit injustice , the means of appealing to the public against us are always at hand . And that public will always be disposed to lean to the merciful side , whenever the circumstances of the case will allow it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most likely to pay the penalty for it . The only justification to be made for it , will be in its admitted justice ; and by that test we are willing to abide . Having premised thus much regarding the terms upon which we consent , for this time , to admit an author 's explanation , we will now proceed to the examination of what that explanation is in this instance worth . And , first , in respect to motives . Our author complains of us , not for imputing to him bad motives , since this he can not pretend , but for imputing to him " that which implies bad motives . " To which we must reply , that we are wholly unconscious of having imputed any motives , bad or good , directly or indirectly . We knew nothing of the writer of the particular article in the " New York Review , ** upon which we commented , and sought not to go beyond what // he had shown of himself in it . Our design in taking it up was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair ; but whether he was doing it for some purpose of his own , or for amusement , or from mere caprice , we did not seek to investigate , nor care to know . With motives , we conceive that reviewers have nothing to do . Their province is not to go beyond the record immediately before them ; and to that , it will be found , we strictly limited our examination . But , even if we had departed from what we held to be the proper course , and had entered into a discussion of the possible inducements , in the mind of our author , to the unusual and extraordinary tenor of argument adopted by him , we might have put ourselves in the wrong towards the public , but we could hardly have done the same towards him . It does not lie with an author to complain of an insinuation made of bad motives in himseW who does that very thing to others , and who rather goes out of his way to do it too . We did not perceive , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he took for the subject of his remarks , any particular cause for believing that they had other motives in writing them , than those which were apparent to everybody . Yet mark how they are spoken og in the article in which he treats of them . " Rather would we go hackward , like the dutiful sons of Noah , and cover up the nakedness of those , whose memories we love and cherish . But when those , who claim to be the only legitimate descendants of the pilgrim fhthers , ' show a disposition , on every possible occasion , to treat these panegyrics as facts , by which they themselves are to be exclusively benefited , and seek every occasion that will permit their helug turned to a sectarian advantage , it becomes a different case . Under this aspect of the stibject , it will be seen , that many of the Puritan eulogists may have another , perhaps , with them , a weightier motive to induce them to laud and magnify their fathers ' virtues , than mere reverence for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , or sectarian interests to he advanced by it . By thus eulogizing and elevating the character of the pilgrim fathers , ' they may hope to justify their sel ) aratien from , and subsequent hostility to , the Episcopal Church ; and , at the same time , to excuse and palliate , if not justify , the rigorous laws enacted by those Puritan separatists against others , who carried out theirown principles , and seI ) arated from them in like manner . In short , they may hope to sanctify so much of the prejmtdice or bigotry , so much of the intolerance arid persecution , of the Puritans , as may , by possibility , work to their own present advantage . " Now considering the character of this passage , we took great credit to ourselves for smothering the natural indignation which we felt upon reading it . We considered the insinuations with which it abounds utterly unjustifiable , and as uncalled for as // they were disreputable to the maker . We thought , and still think , that a writer , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought not to receive , great consideration at our hands . Yet , in comparison with his fault , we treated him gently . We resolved calmly to correct his errors , and to expose his disingenuousness , without a very nice regard to those rules of politeness which he had so grossly violated , yet with a due sense of the decorum becoming our position . We , therefore , abstained from any , even the remotest implication of motives , being desirous in his case , as in all others , whatever might be the nature of his transgress ion , not to justify it by following the example , so far as to ascribe to him any motives which he expressly disclaimed , or which we could not , by his own admission , distinctly prove . Our author next specifies what he supposes to be the grounds upon which we bring the charges of disingenuousness and falsification of authorities ; and having in this manner assumed such as suit himself he appeals to us to say whether we have made our accusation good . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has involved himseW but we fear it will not avail him . We advanced a charge of general perversion of historical facts to the purpose of his theory , upon the character of his argument , and the use made of them in it ; but this is a wholly distinct affair from the other and more serious one , of misusing authorities , which we confined to the particular book he pretended to quote . In the first of the two cases we endeavoured to show the fallacy of his reasoning , by a statement of the facts , in the order which appears to us to be the natural one . In the other we went further , and exposed the precise instances in which he had committed a fault . But as he does not appear fully to have comprehended the force of either of the accusations we made , or their weight relative to each other , we will endeavour , as briefly as possible , again to set them in their strength before him . And first , in regard to the passage of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surveying , in this manner , the nature of the contest , in England , between &amp;urchinen and Puritans , we shall find it merely a political , NOT , as is usually represented , a religiou8 one . rrllis may fairly he inferred , from what is said by both of our authors . Professor Kingsley tells us ( Disc . p. 55 ) , Their ( the Puritans ' ) opposition to the Church of England was mainly political , and limited in a great measm:sre to discipline . ' And Mr. Bacon tells us ( Disc . p. 14 ) , that , of the many Puritans who came to New England at its first planting , none , save the pilgrims of Plymouth , had denounced the Church of England , or had separated themselves from its communion . And , in another place , he asks , - // What were the Puritans ? Let sober history answer . They were a great religious and POLITICAL party , in a coi.iutry and in an age in which every man 's religion was a matter of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforming party in the church and state of England . ' ( p. 34. ) " - p. 53 . We did not intend to be understood as affirming , that these extracts were not genuine , or that Professor Kingsley and Mr. Bacon did not mean what they here say . But we did intend to deny , that from them could be inferred any thing like what was inferred from them by our author . We deny , that Professor Kingsley is or can be made the file-leader , that he desires . In our former article we stated it as our opinion , that the Professor had gone too far in his assertion ; but , upon a reconsideration of the spirit of his whole Discourse , and especially that sentence in which he affirms , " that the great object of the establishment of the colony was religion , " we are convinced that we misinterpreted his language , and gave greater latitude to it than he himself intended . In no case , however , will the words quoted justify the argument that is made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposition was " mainly political , and limited , " he adds , " in a great measure to discipline ; " and , taking the last clauses in connexion with the first , we are , on a revision , much inclined to think that Professor Kingsley used the word political with reference to the polity of the church . But , waving this , by a reference to the great Dictionary of Dr. Johnson , we find " mainly " to be rendered by the terms , " chiefly , " " principally , " " greatly , " " powerfully , " each of which implies a relation to some other object as a matter of comparison , and none of which , consequently , is exclusive in its signification . It is obvious , therefore , that the Professor , even with the utmost latitude of construction that can be taken of his meaning , designed to couple some other motive with that which he states to be the leading one . Mr. Bacon does so in terms so distinct , that one would suppose there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet what is the position assumed upon these authorities ? Is it not , that " the nature of the contest in England between Ohurchmen and Puritans , we shall find merely a political , NOT , as is usually represented , a religious one . " Who would not suppose from this , that Professor Kingsley and Mr. Bacon had affirmed that religion had nothing to do with the matter ? What does Dr. Johnson tell us of the word " merely " ? He explains it to mean simply , " only , " - this and no other way , " for this and no other end , " - that is , a term of exclusive character , which bears no relation to any other . And our author , therefore , would have us infer with him this term of exclusion of all // motives but the one assigned , out of a term which implies relation of one motive with another . And out of such a forced inference he would extract from the reading of the letter of the text , the direct opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of his studies in philology , we opine that they must be put in the same category with his discoveries in politics . Yet we do not assert this perversion to be more than a mistake in argument , grounded upon a misconception of the true force of language . It is not disingenuous quotation . We shall give our reasons for making that charge upon different authority hereafter . At this time we will direct our attention to the attempt made by the author to turn off the edge of a certain very significant quotation made by us from Lord Clarendon , touching the question now at issue . The defence is , that the historian and the review do not treat of the same point of time . How just this is , may easily he understood , by a reference to the reviewer 's general position , which was , that " the nature of the contest in England , between Churchmen and Puritans , was merely a political one . " Hence he maintains , that the persecution which the Puritans suffered , was solely for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political ascendency in the mother country , by attempting which , they incurred that persecution , led to their emigration . To establish these points , it is true our author goes over the whole period of time , from 1570 to 1630 , and it is equally true , that Lord Clarendon , in the passage quoted , speaks only of the years 1630 - 1635 ; yet in doing so the latter describes a state of feeling then prevalent in England , so utterly at variance with that which must have arisen upon the hypothesis assumed by the former , that , if once admitted to he true , it exposes the absurdity of it in a moment . And this is what we meant to do . There was , in fact , nothing that could be called a struggle for the political ascendency , in England , between Puritans and Churchmen , until after the last of these dates . And how that struggle was brought on , by the wanton violence of Laud , which drove the Puritans to the alternative of resistance or of unconditional submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resolves itself into this , that if we believe in the statement of Clarendon , respecting the causes of the rupture , we can not put any faith in the entire theory of our author . If , on the other hand , we choose to follow the latter , then we must suppose that a contemporary did not know any thing of the events he was writing about . As there is no method of reconciling the two doctrines with each other , and we must take one or the other , we have no hesitation in pronouncing our opinion , which of them it is proper for us to adopt , and which to reject . // Again , our author expresses much surprise at our refusal of the desired homage to Charles the First , as a patron of liberty , for the concession of the Massachusetts charter ; and xvhile doing so , claims for his father and his son almost an equal share . That he may the more effectually overwhelm us with his argument , he adopts the Socratic form of reasoning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is pleased to ask . Without appearing to reflect , that the public would be exceedingly fatigued by the length to which the discussion would , in this manner , be drawn out , he winds up with a note of triumph , in anticipation , at the inconvenience to which he could put us . We are perfectly free to confess , that it would be highly inconvenient to our readers and to ourselves to do what he would have us . It would be , moreover , a mere waste of time to repeat again and again what we have already said . But this would make the only sort of inconvenience which we should feel . For , in the whole range of his questions , our author advances nothing new , - nothing extraordinary , - nothing that we have not , in substance , refuted already , - nothing , in short , that makes his case a whit stronger than it was before . Yet , inasmuch as our author does not appear to seize the whole extent of our position respecting the charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We maintain , that the charter was a grant of power to certain persons in England , without any regard to the principles of liberty , civil or religious . If it is taken up and examined with no reference to the construction put upon it by the Puritans , which we maintain to be their own cect , we think it impossible not to he struck at once with the fact , that it was designed to constitute a Mercantile Corporation in Great Britain , ( very much like the still existing East India Company , ) who were by it empowered to send to Massachusetts as many settlers as they could induce to go , and to govern them , after they arrived , either directly or by deputy , exactly as they should think proper . To those settlers , if not l ) reviously admitted as stockholders into the company , no participation in the management was assured , and no security of their rights of any kind given , excepting the negative and superfluous reservation of citizenship at home , which by common law they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sooner think of associating principles of freedom , than with the miserable ryols of Patna and Benares , who are made the servile instruments of an English commercial company , to the demoralization of another nation , as a previous step to their gaining the dominion over it . We desire our author to understand , that we deny // the existence in the charter , as it was originally granted , of any manifestation of intention to secure either of the two great principles of popular liberty which he mentions . We deny , that there is any thing that looks like universal suffrage in it . We deny , that there is any right admitted of a majority to govern , if by majority is meant more than a majority of stockholders in England . To this majority , every thing was originally designed to be subject . And in this view of the charter , we are happy to find ourselves , to some extent , supported by an authority we little anticipated the pleasure of quoting . It is no other than that of our author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his letter a preceding article of his in the " New York Review , " which we had accidentally overlooked . In this article , which appears to have been written at least two years before the one we have been considering , it is distinctly admitted , that a colonist , as such , had r*o civil rights under the charter , but derived them only as a freeman of the company ; and that what he is pleased to call the Jacobin doctrine of universal suffrage , was never dreamed of at the time of granting it . We will not , however , let this rest merely upon our own assertion . These are his words . " In accordance with the principles of En*lish common law , every freeman of the corporation was entitled to vote in the cboice of Governor and Assistants , and in the enactment of all laws . We find , therefore , in the cbarter of Massacbusetis Bay , all the great principles of liberty ; but , at the same time , it is to be noted , that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technical sense of the word , that is , entitled to vote . The men of those times understooti , too well , tbe nuture of sound government and rational freedom , -i .1 : to su* ) pose that it necessarily in*plied universal snffr*we Certait quailfications are certainly to be required for the exercise of such important rights . The tests of those qualifications , as settled by the colonists , may have been arbitrary , absurd , unjust ; that is not the question now ; we only think it important to note the fhct , that certain qualifications were thought requisite . They never dreamed of the Jacobin doctrine of modern French theorists , that every human being , as such , has a natural right to vote . " - ew York Review , Vol . IL p. 94 . Now we have always supposed that the common law of England secured to every citizen certain rights by prescription ; yet it would seem by the statement of our author , that unless he was also a freeman , that is , a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Massachusetts . According to him , the charter was the source of the privileges of common law , and the common law was not the source of the charter . It is not our province to re // concile any of his inconsistencies . The fact is enough for us , that the charter , so far as it went , was restrictive , and in defiance of the principles of common law ; and that the pretence , he now makes , of finding universal suffrage in its contents , is set at nought by his former affirmation to the contrary . The point which we maintain on behalf of the Puritans is , that out of this very unpromising commercial charter which had nothing originally to recommend it but its grant of power , they , by their own act , for the merits and defects of which they , and they alone , must be held responsible , made a republican form of government . Upon this rough stock , they engrafted the principle of suffrage , necessarily limited in the first instance , - not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole plan should be subverted by cunning and powerful enemies , - hut susceptible of easy extension whenever the favorable moment was at hand . And they also engrafted the princil ) le of representation , and of a legislative body divided into two branches , which , though necessary to all free governments , were nowhere provided for in the charter . Indeed , the original grant contemplated nothing of the kind , - nothing beyond the four courts held annually , in Leadenhall Street in London , by the present East India Company of Great Britain . It was the extraordinary construction put upon this instrument by the Puritans , through which they first transferred the seat of government to Boston , and then set to work to raise an active , efficient , and an almost independent national power , out of a trading speculation , - it was this that awakened the attention of the sovereign and his advisers in the mother country . They saw at once that their intentions had not been adhered to . they understood the necessity of immediately taking measures of effectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first design appears to have been to gain the control of the colony through the agency of some of the company , and by the means furnished in the charter itself ; but , this failing by reason of the requisition of church membership as a qualification to constitute freemen , at which our author has taken so great offence , the next step was the dissolution of the instrument . And this would certainly have followed , if the rising of that tremendous storm at home had not diverted the attention of the parties in power to efforts for their own defence , yet all in vain . And thus it happened , that the colony of Massachusetts continued to bask in that sunshine of divine Providence , which its infancy required . // Having thus given our view of the proceedings under the charter , it will be at once visible , that we persist in maintaining the position heretofore assumed , " that the principles , which form at once the basis and characteristic of our political institutions , were established in New England by the agency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " agency , " we mean something more than that they were " parties concerned in bringing about measures they did not themselves understand . " This may be our author 's definition of the word . It is not ours . According to him , they would have been mere instruments . We regard them as responsible moral agents . This distinction is not without its importance in the present discussion . For we will now take the occasion of drawing it , to enter a general protest against the whole theory of history which has been broached by our author in both of his articles . We regard it as utterly subversive of all right judgment upon human action , as well as of the ordinary and only sound rules of moral discrimination . We shall never assent to the doctrine , that the principles of popular liberty now universally recognised among us to be true , have been the offspring of circumstances only , nor that the most arbitrary monarchs known in history are the most meritorious promoters of their spread . We desire to look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give to mankind for the future . If they have to tell us only of lucky accidents , then let the books be shut up for ever ; " Si fors ista dedit nobis , fors ipsa gubemnet . " Men need not trouble their heads with the stream of time , if they have nothing to do but to float upon it . Surely , we owe no gratitude to King John or Edward the First of England , merely because they raised the popular feature of the government a little , that they might the better secure their own power against the assaults of the aristocracy . We give James the Second no credit for advocating toleration against the preponderating system of the Church of England . We do not consider Sylla a patriot , though he abdicated his ill-gotten dictatorship ; or Napoleon a friend of freedom , because he was made Emperor by the adoption of a form of popular suffrage . The great element for all judgment of actions is the intent . We do not mean to deny , that highly beneficial results to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent moral conduct ; but it is one thing to assign to the simple fact its weight , and another thing to attach merit to its cause ; - one thing to analyze the elements of action , and // another to undermine the whole edifice of moral responsibility , by arbitrarily confounding the motives of good with the actions of bad men . Having now completed all that we think necessary to be said respecting the argument of our author , we will proceed at once to the objections made by us to his use of the quotations from " The Planter 's Plea . " It is aot without surprise , that we perceive he attempts to misunderstand the nature of those objections . He asks us , " what wc mean by falsification of authority . One would suppose , " he adds , " that it was misquoting , or the application of language used in reference to one point to that used in reference to another , &amp;c. , or the garbling of a passage , so as to make it tell a different story from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made against the author of the article in the New York Review . ' " If this is so , then we have greatly misconceived the force of our own language . Perhaps Shakspeare will be more intelligible to our author when he says , - " men may construe things after their fashion , Clean frame the purpose of the things themselves . " We certainly meant to bring the charge , that the reviewer did make his quotation tell a different story from what its author intended , and we thought that we had brought th eproof ; but , as it does not appear to have been stated with satisfactorv distinctness in the former instance , we beg leave to submit it to the public over again , though we must at the same time apologize for troubling them again with it , on the plea that it is strictly in self-justification . In the " New York Review " for January , 1840 , ( No. 11 , ) we find the following passage . " We have now arrived at a point where it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the motives , which induced the colonists to leave home and settle in the wilderness . Arid that our readers may have an opportunity of hearing the testimony of one who lived at the time , we shall give them a sketch of time Planter 's Plea , ' and a few extracts from its pages . The Plea commences with an examninalion of the ground and warrant of colonies . ' The second chapter is an answer to the question , What ends may be proposed in planting colonies ? ' To this the author answers , first ; " Some and the worst , and the least warrantable , are such as are only swayed by private respects ; as when men shift themselves , and draw others with them , out of their countries , oiet of undutiful affection to 0overnors , to excerpt themsclres from subjection to loufel power , or aim at a great name to themoselves , and to raise their own glory . ' " The author then proceeds , " &amp;c. - pp . G ' 2 , 63. // of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , they did it , not because they could not worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences , but becaise they could not obtain the political asccndency which they sought . " The marking in italic letters , the words of the citation which are so marked , has therefore a hearing upon the proposition that bad been advanced . And the general reader , who knows nothing of " The Planter 's Plea , " exzepting what he sees of it here , is unavoidably left with the impression , that the Planter himself intended to insinuate , that " undutiful affection to governors , " &amp;c. , was the motive for the plantation of the Puritans , and that he is here cited for the sole purpose of introducing " the authority of one who lived at the time , " in order to the better determination of what these motives really were . All this would have been very well for the reviewer to have himself maintained ; but , when he puts his own position into the mouth of his authority , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact contrary of what it means . To show this conclusively , we have only to add the remainder of the passage , as it stands in the original . " As for the enlargement of trade , which drew on the Spanish and Dutch colonies in the East Indies , or securing of conquered countries , which occasioned many colonies of the Romanes in Italy and other lands , they may bee so far warranted as the grounds of the conquests or trades were warrantable ; ( if they were carried without injury or wrong to the natives ; ) seeing natural commerce between nations , anti conquests upon just warres , have been alwayes approved by the lawcs of God aud man . " As for those colonies , that have been undertaken upon the desire either of disburtheniug of full states of unnecessary multitudes , or of replenishing vast and voyd countries , they have a cleare and sufficient warrant from the mouth of God , ns immediately concurring with one special end that God aimed at in the first institution thereof " But seeing God 's honour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own priucipall scope in this and all his xvayes ; it must withall hee necessarily acknowledged , that the desire nod respect onto the J ) tlblishiur of ' his name where it is not kuowne , and reducing men that live withotit God in this present world , unto a forum of f ) iety and godlinesse , by how much the more immediately it suites with the mind of God , and is fhrthest carried from private respects , by so ranch the more it advanceth this xvorke of planting colonies above all civill and humane ends , an ( l deserves honour and approbation aliove the most glorious conquests or successfull enterl ) ri5C5 that ever were ondci to ken by the most renowned mcmi that the sun bath scene , and that by how touch the subduing of Satan is a more glorious act than a victory over men , and the enlargement of Christ 's kingdoune than the addio* unto men 's dominion and the saving of mcmi 's soules than the a provisions for their lives and bodies . // " It seemes this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the world , " &amp;c. - pp. 9 , 10 . The passage is rather long , but we could not shorten it and clearly establish our point , which is , that the Planter intended to affirm religion to have been the motive for the plantation then in hand , and to show how low and contemptible all other motives , however good in themselves , were in comparison with it . Now we do maintain , that , when considering those motives , if the author in the " New York Review " professed to give from the Planter what he thought they were , he should not have selected the worst and most derogatory to the human character , that were mentioned only for the sake of contrast , without stating even that fact , and have entirely suppressed all notice of those better ones which were positively assigned . We know not what our author may think , but we call this garbling . Something is however said about the use of italic letters to make sentences emphatic , and a feeble attempt is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words quoted from others in a passage of our author quoted by us , the charge which we origintdly brought against him of giving no notice when the use of italic letters changes the sense of an author cited . To this a very brief answer is enough . We understand a broad line to lie between the making of a sentence emphatic merely for the purpose of putting in bolder relief its manifest and simple application , and the so laying emphasis upon one part of a passage at the expense of the remainder , as to give to the whole a particular meaning , which , if read in the ordinary way , it would not bear . The first course may be adopted , with or without notice , by any writer , without incurring any censure . It was resorted to by our author in many instances , and we made it the subject of no remark . But when he practised the other , as he did , we think , in the case in hand , it is our opinion that he should have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to do this gave to his citation an application to a particular point of his own making , which it never could otherwise have been made to bear . Neither is it enough , in our estimation , that an author , when he quotes a passage , should confine himself to the " prectsc words , " if he stops short of giving the whole sense of it . We did not charge the writer in the " New York Review " with forging , or inserting extraneous matter in his quotations . We charged him with a suppression of certain important words , which were essential to the full meaning of the author he quoted . In the oath ordinarily administered in our courts of // law , as much consequence attaches to the words , " the whole truth , " as to the other terms , " the truth , " and " nothing but the truth . " And so it is in the rules for quotation . We consider our author as having overlooked this in the following instance . Page 63 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more at large of the motives which induced them to come . He says , As it were absurd to conceive they have all one mind , so it were more ridiculous to imagine they all have one scope . Necessity may press some , novelty draw others , hopes of gain may prevail with a third sort , ' but he is persuaded , that the most sincere and godly part have the advancement of the Gospel for their main scope . ' " These facts , and abundance of others of a similar nature , contained in the work , authorize the inference that the colonists were regarded as factious persons , and that their opponents did not credit the pretension that the advancement of the Gospel was the sole or chief object of their emigration . It is here also confessed , by one of the party , that necessity , ' novelty , ' and hope of gain , ' as well as love of the Gospel , were among the causes that moved the colonists to come to this country " - p. 64 . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be authorized , they ought to be very sure that they state the facts correctly upon which they rest . It will not do to affirm , that one of a party confesses that " necessity , " " novelty , " and " hope of gain , " were causes for their colonizing , when he tells us , " he shall make bold to manifest not only what he knows , but what he guesses , concerning their purpose . " He accordingly proceeds to " guess , " that among many men there may be many motives , and among these motives , such as he mentions may prevail with a few ; but this is surely a very different thing from saying that he knew they did prevail . Moreover , in the extract as made , it does not appear , that any idea is given of the proportion in which these motives would he supposed to predominate . For " the most sincere and godly part " might , notwithstanding , have been , as it generally is , a very small part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so understood . ft expressly affirms , that " the most , " or in other words , the greatest number , as well as " the most sincere and godly part , have the advancement of the Gospel for their main scope . " We therefore insist , that the omission of these two little words makes a very great difference in the sense of the passage cited ; a difference which , considering the sinister inferences that were designed to be drawn against the characters of the individuals concerned in the settlement , can in no way be reconciled to the principles of justice and fair dealing . // If therefore , in our review , we used the words " falsification of authority , " as applicable to the course of our author , it will be seen , that we did so , not without what we hold to be abundant justification . We consider the true sense of " The Planter 's Plea " to have been perverted , in the passages which we have quoted , so far as he is relied upon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had quite as much influence in the settlement of New England as religion , when he distinctly and repeatedly declares , that , as far as the diversities of human nature will ever allow , religion was the great and only motive ; and , further , that those lower motives operated upon many of the settlers , when he asserts , that , if they operated at all , they were confined to few . Nor , in justification of these perversions , will it do to say , that it is taking the evidence of a witness against himself ; for there is no confession , other than what his enemy arbitrarily thrusts into his mouth . His meaning , when gathered , as it should be , from the whole of the context , is plain , and can only be avoided by torturing and maiming his language . That our author has , in our opinion , attempted to do this , is the reason , and the only reason , why we have felt it necessary to treat his argument with a degree of unwonted severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every writer , who voluntarily ventures to come before the public , does so under some degree of responsibility . If he has appeared to us to have overlooked or violated his trust , we , who profess to notice such things , have a high duty to perform to that public in warning them of his errors . And if , after a due setting forth of his offence , he insists upon making us follow him out into other expositions of it , we regret the necessity , but see no alternative . We now drop the subject , conscious that it may not be of so much interest to general readers as to ourselves . We hope , that our author will be too wise to continue in the menacing tone of the conclusion of his present letter ; and that he will cease to play the ghost for the future , or warn us of " Philippi . " To say nothing of the taste of this , it is not so alarming as it sounds . We acquit ourselves of any wish to turn him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have dealt at him a few rather sharp passes . But , if the worst should come to the worst , and the fate of the younger Brutus be meted out to us , we shall hope , at least , to enjoy the credit , with the world , of enduring it like him , though in a far more humble walk , in the defence of the same general principles of liberty.
