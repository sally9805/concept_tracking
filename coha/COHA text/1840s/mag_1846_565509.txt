txt DID the worthy publishers think of the significance of the above title , which they tacked to a cheap form of this work ? CARLYLE 'S Cromwell : exactly so ! Not the Cromwell who has lived in the fancies of most men , since , two centuries ago , one of that name was dug up from Westminster Abbey , and hung upon Tyburn gallows ; not that quintessence of cant , falsity and the devil ; that red-nosed Noll , who was a mere savage fighter , snorting death-fl re upon St. Charles I. and his canonized host of cavaliers all the way from Edgehill to Naseby ,  --  a usurper , murderer , hypocrite and prince of liars ; not that man at all ! Carlyle can find no such Cromwell after the utmost search in all the truthful history of England in the middle of the seventeenth century . It is Oliver ( the son of Robert Cromwell ) who was an active country gentleman , a member of Parliament in his younger years , and understood to have been a wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man who was once somewhat emphatically acknowledged by the civilized world , as England 's Protector and ablest man . Till past forty , this Oliver was a Huntington farmer ; a quiet , just man , fearing God and studying the Bible-of the class called Puritans . He talked and prayed in conference meetings , in common with others of this sect . Being known , as a man who would set well at the mark , his fellow citizens deemed him fit to represent them in Parliament . lie went ; and for long years , he manfully did the work which his country and Parliament called upon him to do . The task set him was not an easy one : it demanded the highest qualities of a hero ; and Cromwell performed it to the perfect satisfaction of his employers , and to the admiration of the world . After this was done , he set himself*a still harder task , viz , to see that England , Scotland and Ireland , were righteously governed . And , in spite of obstacles , the like of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this confessedly better than it had ever been done before . This is Carlyle 's Cromwell . A real hero ; a deep , earnest , sincere , godly man ; a reality and not a sham ; veracious , not lying ,  --  truly religious , and as far from cant and hypocrisy as any other . Truly this is not the Cromwell we read of in most histories . The two have nothing in common with each other , except-neither of them could ever be beaten in battle , outwitted in council , circumvented in diplomacy , or frightened from his purpose . Perhaps also we should grant that the two men bore a personal resemblance to each other : the unbeautiful face , the negligent toilet , the awkward manners , are recognized in both . But here the resemblance ceases . The characters of the two differ toto ccelo ,  - -  the whole distance of heaven from hell ! In mental ability also the contrast is great ; and even their earlier occupations differ ,  --  the one being a brewer of malt , the other a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Change the names of these two men , and the names of the battles they fought , and it is doubtful whether the one would ever suggest the other . But how comes it to pass that Carlyle 's Cromwell is so different from the Cromwell of Clarendon , Hume , and nearly every historian since he lived ? The reader of this * Oliver Cromwell 's Letters and Speeches : with elucidations . By Thomas Carlyle . In two volumes . Wiley &amp; Putnam , 161 Broadway , New York . // book will not want for an answer to this question . The period of England 's history which comes in review , is of the most absorbing interest , and , beyond any other , important to be studied , as it was then that the great principles of Church and State were discussed and battles for freedom fought . Special attention , of late , has been paid to the men and events of that era . Macaulay 's articles upon Milton and Ilallam 's Constitutional History , awakened new interest upon the subject , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first of these articles , Macaulay placed the Puritans upon a moral eminence where Rector Coit 's crow-peckings will not much disturb them ; and in the last , he did something to unchain Cromwell from the gallows and replace him in Westminster Abbey . He says- " But for the weakness of that foolish Ishbosheth , Richard , the form of the great founder of the new ' dynasty , on horseback , as when he led the charge at Naseby , or on foot , as when he took the mace from the table of the Commons , would adorn all our squares , and overlook our public offices from Charing Cross ; and sermons in his praise would he duly preached on his lucky day , the third of September , by court chaplains , guiltless of the abominations of the surplice . " We could wish Carlyle had been fuller upon the history of this period ; but he has done what he undertook . Cromwell was canonized among his Heroes , and he appears there the same man as he does in the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the letters and speeches of Cromwell , the means by which we can better form our own opinion . We heartily thank him for his labor ; and . as admirers of the Puritan character generally , and also as their descendants-though having , as he would tell us , little more than a sham resemblance to their characters-we thank him for his handsome tribute to their memory . Our object is to look at this Puritan Protector in the glass here placed before us-running off occasionally into such trains of thought as the subject suggests . Cromwell 's character stood a poor chance of having justice done it from the moment his lazy son Richard abdicated the Protectorship , and the son of the beheaded king , amid shouts ofdrunken joy , entered London ; and it is principally from writers of those days , directly or indirectly , that men have gathered their knowledge of his character . Carlyle says Heath 's hook-Flagellum , or the Life and Death of 0 . Cromwell , late Usurper , is the chief fountain of all the foolish lies about Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this Flagellum has been called " Flagitium , " and Heath himself , " Carrion Heath , and a lying dolt . " Carlyle , after the most thorough examination into the subject , dismisses him and others like him as false and unworthy of the least credit . At a time when it was written of Milton : " His fame is gone out like a candle in a snuff , and his memory will always stink , which mght have ever lived in honorable repute , had he not been a notorious traitor , and most impiously and villainously helied that blessed martyr , Charles I ; " at a time when this same St. Charles I. was always at the theatre , if a play specially obscene was to be acted by lewd women , and allowed little to be going on in his palace but revelry and unmentionable intrigues ; at a time when every vestige of seriousness , of common morality even , was matter of ridicule ; at a time when clergymen , once sequestered for scandal and now restored to their former livings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the city watch-what kind of justice would these men , with Cromwell at their head , who had burnt the Book // of Sports , and for games and drunken frolics had substituted the Catechism and a Gospel ministry , be likely to receive from the favorites of royalty ? And it was into such hands that the keeping of Cromwell 's character fell . The vulture seized its prey , now that it was dead , and , according to its nature , devoured it . Cromwell was a favorite of no great party during the Protectorate . Cavaliers and Presbyterians generally , many of the Commonwealth 's men , and ultimately all the minor sects and anarchists , feared and hated him . Many of them , while they bore testimony to the justice of his administration , would take his life because he was Protector ; and many who served under him , and were trusted and promoted by him , gave testimony against him , after the iRestoration , " on the principle that the ox knoweth his owner , and the ass his master 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this time or since , have written with bitterness or prejudice against Cromwell , our author applies quite uncourteous epithets ; and particularly to those little men that can see in him and the great enterprise of his day nothing but ambition and hypocrisy . Lie found , after years of search into authentic records of this man , that most of those who have written about him , like his " friend Ludlow , " were timber-headed , flunkey-souled , and merely digestive . It was Cromwell 's fortune , as it has been the fortune of most men who have taken a prominent part in a great national crisis , to have enemies for his first historians . Long ago , we noticed a reaction taking place in the public sentiment of England resp*cting the Protector , and the prophecy is quite credible that he will yet be universally esteemed as a truly wise and good man , as he has ever been acknowledged a right valiant conqueror and able ruler . Whoever would understand Crom 213 well must throw himself back into the scenes , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as difficult for a New Englander as for Englishmen . From Henry VIII , the religious element had been most prominent in all the excitement and struggles of the kingdom . The nation had made some half dozen complete religious somersets . And for those whose pliable natures favored a change of their religion with every change of the royal head of the church , it became necessary to keep a watchful eye upon the religious weathercock at the palace . But it was next to impossible for such men as Cranmer , for men of conscience , to shape their course with safety . Elizabeth succeeded in suppressing the spirit of liberty ; yet before her death those who were called Puritans were ill at ease under her semipopish ceremonials . When James came to the throne they had high hopes of " relief . " They were disappointed . Submission or banishment was the stern alternative the royal pedant offered them . But authority could not stop discussion . A general canvassing of theology and church polity went briskly on throughout the kingdom-his majesty leading the van . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with or without permission , Were reading for themselves . In spite of imprisonment and exile , dissent was gaining ground . Puritanism , like a genuine healthy sprout in the right soil , sent its roots deep and its branches wide , and , rocked by the tempests , became a tree too strong to be uprooted . Charles and his bishops , when comparatively weak , attempted to destroy the giant tree , although Elizabeth at the bight of her power could not extirpate the tender shoot . Arbitrary and illegal measures on the part of the court threw the weight of power decidedly into the dissenting scale . The king and his bigoted Carlyle* Cromwell . ' // counsellors , in their madness , went their way , and England went her way . An open rupture ensued , which was not healed till civil war with its nameless crimes and cruelties , for ten years , had coursed through the kingdom not healed indeed till the revolution of 1688 , when England , hopeless of any good in the government of the Stuarts , hanished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of this struggle . It was a desire for liberty to worship God as they believed his word required , and for the enjoyment of what they believed to be a Gospel ministry free from the garnitures of Babylon , that fired the souls of those men whom Cromwell led to victory . Questions relating to taxes , free parliament , constitutions and the like , were proximate causes of an appeal to arms . Questions of this character were doubtless the primary questions with many who sided with the Long Parliament in the beginning of the contest . They hoped a fair show of resistance to unjust exactions would teach his majesty to keep within constitutional limits . But in the hearts of the genuine Puritans lay the strength of the struggle . When it commenced , they had an invincible determination not to lay down their arms till their " Gospel object " was realized . Herein , as Carlyle thinks , consists the heroism of that age . He throws himself back into their circumstances , lie sees throu 0h their spiritual vision , and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest soul in these men , and at the bottom of their enterprise . lie continually warns us against the prevalent idea , that " these seventeenth-century Puritans were superstitious , crack-brained fanatics . Their enthusiasms , if well seen into , were not foolish but wise . They meant and felt what they said . They believed in God , an Eternal Justice ruling over this world ; and that man owed to him a duty of infinite import , high as heaven , deep as hell . And it became him , above all things else , to strive that God 's will be done on earth as in heaven . They believed that Christ 's church should be presided over not by sham-priests , but by those men whose hearts the Most High had touched and hallowed with his fire ; this was the prayer of many , it was the godlike hope and effort of some . The Cromwells , Pyms , Hampdens , who were understood on the royalist side to be firebrands of the devil , have had hard measure . They really did resemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through spectacles of a certain color . For fire is always fire . But only by woodeneyed spectacles can the flame-girt heaven 's messenger pass for a pedant and hypocrite . Ah ! we find the hypocrisy , cant , Machiavelisrn , in the opposite direction . " There is much in this strain in the book before us . Carlyle believes these men were sincerely intent upon the establishment of truth and right . And in the contrasts he often draws between them and their opponents , in belief and practice as Christians or citizens , they always appear to advantage . But let us advance to the narrative . Since the monkey did not let him fall from the roof , nor curate Johnson permit him to drown , and the steeple of Huntington did not crush him , Oliver Cromwell lived to do a notable work for England . Before his deeds and words in a public capacity developed his character , little need be said of him . Nothing peculiar which is now known , marked his childhood and youth . Carlyle allows that he fell into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finds no positive evidence of the fact . But it is certain that at twenty he was reformed . He repented of his sins , // and made restitution of money taken at the gambling table . His was a genuine , gospel conversion-a change from wrong doing to right doing ; " a ceasing to do evil and learning to do well . " In two letters written while be was a staid Puritan farmer , little dreaming of the " births of Providence " he was to witness , we find him interested in sustaining " lecturers " - preachers of the Puritan faith , and also speaking of his religious experience ; in which experience-told in Bible phrase as the custom then was , and has been in many places since-historians have found evidence of enormous wickedness in his past life , and the germ of his future hypocrisy . It doubtless did sound odd to Christians of certain names , to hear him speaking of the dealings of God with his soul . In one of those letters Cromwell alludes to his former spiritual darkness and hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the sight of God , and how great is the mercy that could save one like him . The i*emarks Carlyle makes upon the inferences drawn from these letters , are too characteristic and illustrative for us to omit . To Rev. Mark Noble Yes , my reverend imbecile friend , he ( Cromwell ) is clearly one of those singular Christian enthusiasts , who believe they have a soul to be saved , even as you believe you have a stomach to be satisfied  --  and who likewise , astonishing to say , actually take some trouble about that ! ' " Hadst thou never any moral life , but only a sensitive and digestive ? Thy soul never longed towards the serene hights , all hidden from thee and thirsted as the hart in dry places wherein no waters be ? It was never a sorrow for thee that the eternal pole-star had gone out , veiled itself in dark clouds ;  --  a sorrow only that this or the other noble patron forgot thee when a living fell vacant ? I have known Christians , Moslems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asses by the Dead Sea ! " 0 modern reader , dark as this letter may seem , I will advise thee to make an attempt to understand it . It makes it certain that man once had a soul ; that he once walked with God-his little life a sacred island girdled with eternities and godhoods . Was it not a time for heroes ? They were then possible . Yes , there is a tone in the soul of this Oliver that holds of the perennial . He longs towards the mark of the prize of the high calling . Let the world and its tumults go its way , only let him alone ! Yet he , too , will do and suffer for God 's cause , if the call come . ' In 1628 , we find Cromwell , now in his 29th year , a member of Parliament for Huntington . He cuts no graceful figures in Parliament . He was not of the Beau Brummell species , " who have their being in cloth , " but was known rather as a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears that he was somewhat awkward as a speaker in such a place , having had more practice in praying and exhorting than in turningsm both periods to the edification of dignified public bodies . Yet he must have had the essential quality of a speaker , for " he was full of fervor and much listened to . " This is Warwick 's testimony of him in 1641 , who " professes his reverence for that great council was much lessened when he saw itgive such attention to a man in a plain cloth suit . " Mr. Hyde had to call him to order , and reprove him on one occasion in committee , for his passionate and offensive language . And when , as Lord Clarendon says , this Mr. Hyde became his historian , the bad blood which Cromwell at this time stirred up had not quite settled . This Parliament , of which Cromwell was first a member , " was more Puritanic , more intent on rigorous law and divine gospel than any other // had ever been . " Many of the nobility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary measures of Charles and his ministers . The Parliament was refractory , and would grant the king no subsidies till he would listen to their grievances . The king threatened it with immediate dissolution . The members knew not what to do . For a while they sat dumb with astonishment and fear at the high measures of the Court : until seeing it was life or death to England 's freedom , Sir Edward Coke , now eighty years old , broke silence ; and with tears and amidst general weeping for grief and passion , charged the Duke of Buckingharn with being the cause of their miseries . " Yea , yea ! " was the spontaneous , loud response of the House . Bells and bonfires announced the general joy of all men . Carlyle calls special attention to this scene in 1628 . There was no rebellion here , but the most patient endurance . He asks , " How came tough old Coke upon Littleton to melt into tears and sit down unable to speak ? Let the modern honorable gentleman tell ! Let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put on some Bibledoctrine , some earnest God 's truth or other , try if he can discover why he can not tell ! " The session of this Parliament , in 1629 , proved brief ; yet it still more clearly indicated the spirit of English Puritanism and English men . Charles still continued to levy custom- house duties ( tonnage and poundage ) without the consent of Parliament . Merchants were imprisoned for refusing to pay them ; and , in religion , matters looked even worse . " Bishops Neile and Laud were more and more pressing the church towards Papistry and the old clothes of Babylon . Parliament resolves upon a new remonstrance , in which these bishops are to be named . The speaker , instructed by the king , refuses to put certain questions when ordered by the House . In the midst of excitement and confusion , Holles seizes the speaker , holds him to his seat , while others lock the doors , hastily redact emphatic resolutions against Arminianism , Papistry , illegal tonnage and poundage , pass the same with acclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers ! " Some of the leaders in this business were fined and imprisoned . Parliament was dissolved , and the members went to their respective places of abode-Cromwell to his farming at Huntington . The Court have their own way yet for twelve years . For twelve years , and the sore so ripe for the lancet now ! Will not the patient be restive after it has gone on for this length of time festering , absorbing all the baneful humors of the body social , politic and religious ? It would seem the operator will need have a care ! Between the dissolution of this and the meeting of the Long Parliament , one or two incidents occurred which indicate the spirit of the times . In the summer of 1633 , the king goes to Scotland , ostensibly to be crowned-really to get his pretended bishops set on foot there ; Laud 's Tulchans converted into real calves , for the Presbyterian cow proves refractory. * 4*** Did the reader ever see , or fancy in his mind , a Tuichan ? Tulchan is , or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solete , a calf-skin stuffed into the rude similitude of a calf-similarenough todeceive the imperfect perceptive organs of a cow . At milking time , the Tulchan , with head duly hent , was set as if to suck ; the fond cow looking round fancied that her calf was husy , and that all was right , and so gave her milk freely , which the cunning maid was straining in white abundance into her pail all the while ! The Scotch milkmaids in those days cried , where is the Tulchan ? - is the Tulchan ready ? ' So of the bishops . Scotch lairds were eager enough to milk the church lands and tithes , to get rents out of them freely , which was nut always easy . They were glad to construct a form of bishops to please the king and church , and make the milk ' come without disturbance . The reader now knows // " Laud attended him , as he did king James in 1617 . The Bishop still finds no religion at all ' in Scotland ; no surplices , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not the smallest regularity of fuglernanship and devotional drillexercise , which grieved him much . ' But he purposed at this time to set the Tulehan apparatus in full play . Small success attended the enterprise . The cow saw it was but a stuffed calf , and dealt somewhat sharply with it . Yet , for the time the chapel at Holyrood-house was fitted up with all necessary equipments , and the little bishops gave a stroke of service , ' to show the natives how an artist could do it ! " " But in 1638 , at Edinburgh , on a July Sabbath , a strange spectacle is seen . The Archbishop , having now , with much manipulation , got his liturgy and bishops ready , brought them out there to actionand lo ! Jenny Geddes hurled her stool at their head ! Thou foul thief , wilt thou say mass at my lug ? ' A Pope ! a Pope ! stane him ! cried others . It is clear there can be no service that day . For thirty years , Scotland , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been as silent as possible , while she bitterly felt much . This flight of Jenny 's stool was a signal at which Scotland , and , behind that , all England and Ireland , rose into unappeasable commotion . Jenny becomes more famous than the Trojan Helen . " In London , in these days , other exciting scenes are visible . Men put in pillories , branded with hot irons , and having their ears cut off - all for their sin against Laud and his surplices at AlIhallow-tide-and what a Tuichan bishop was . A piece of mechanism constructed , not without difficulty , in Parliament and king 's council , among the Scots ; and torn asunder afterwards with dreadful clamor , and scattered to the four winds , so soon as the cow became awake to it ! " ( Vol.1 , p.42. ) for sin against no other man or thing . Prynne 's ears had been cropped before , and now being sewed on , were sheared specially close . Also Hamp. den 's trial , for refusing to pay ship . money , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by it he becomes the most famous man in England . " Bearing in mind that the Puritan leaven had been fermenting till the greater portion of the middle class of the nation-merchants , farmers , mechanics-was thoroughly leavened ; and that the popish bigotry of the king and bishops , together with the arbitrary measures of the Court party , in all matters , now for twelve years and more , had led all men to tremble for their country , we come to the meeting of the Long Parliament . The occasion and absolute necessity for calling another Parliament was the want of money to chastise the Scots . " The Presbyterians had rent their Tulchan apparatus so roughly , and otherwise so ill comported themselves towards his Majesty 's government , that he deemed it important to punish them . " The year before , ( 1639 ) he had made the attempt and shamefully failedthe Scots making much the more formidable show of fight . The unconstitutional methods of raising money began to fail , and there was no farther hope but in summoning a Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had despaired of ever seeing another Parliament . But in three weeks it is dissolved , and nothing done-not being in a humor to grant supplies with which to fight the Scots . Strafford , the ablest man the king had , and the most rigorous in arbitrary exactions , advises the king to raise money by other methods and subscribes liberally himself . An army is again collected and on its march towards Scotland ; yet with no better success . The king 's own . soldiers call it a bishop 's war , and // every where on their march showed more disposition to make war upon the surplice than the covenant . They shot some of their own officers ; they hooted the Church clergy and cheered the Puritan . The Scotch army is also again in the field , and determined this time to march into England and present their " grievances " to his Majesty . " There they are in hodden gray , with blue caps , and each man with a haversack of oatmeal on his back , wading the Tweed . The king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Strafford , in a fine frenzy ' at this turn of affairs , are waiting . " What can be done ? - Make a treaty with the Scots till we can gain strength , and instantly summon a new Parliament , for otherwise London City xviii positively lend no more money . The other was called the Short Parliament ; this which meets now , the 3d of November of the same year , the Long Parliament . Oliver Cromwell sat in both as member for Cambridge . Such is a brief outline of some of the incidents of this history up to the time when the struggle commenced between Charles and his Parliament . Strafford and Laud are soon impeached , and safely lodged in the Tower ; and it immediately comes to " push of pike " and fiery death " charges . " The battle of Edge* hill was fought in October , 1642 . So ripe was the nation for settling their grievances by this method , since it was plain no other would avail ! Two standards are erected , and to every county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which will you follow ? " The Scottish army wait upon the northern frontier , paid ? 850 per day , according to treaty , to see what may turn up . The king is under the necessity of seeking foreign aid , while the requisitions of the Parliament for men and money are promptly met . Thousands enlist in * day ; the rich lay their money and plate , women their very thimbles , upon the altar of their country . All of which facts , in the significant phrase of our author , tell loudlywhat o'clock it is ! Not that , at this early stage of the business , the Parliament , or any of the leading Puritans or Presbyterians , thought of getting rid of king Charles . Not till attempts , an hundred times repeated , had proved that no trust could be placed in him , did any party , in Parliament or out , propose to do without the king . Charles 's own party cursed him bitterly for his duplicity and faithlessness ! Strafford had to cry in his agony- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall repeat the history of this war no farther than it is necessary to exhibit the character of Cromwell . Carlyle calls him the soul of the Puritan revolt ; without whom it had never been a revolt transcendently memorable , and an epoch in the world 's history . ' But he does not mean that Cromwell was , as he has been called , the prince of rebels . His idea is , that Cromwell , after years of hard fighting , victory , negociation , treaty and remonstrance with the king , with prelacy , with Presbyterian league and covenant , clearly saw that the thing fought for could not be secured , with either Charles or his son at the head of the nation ; that he saw what all England in 1688 felt to be true ; what the world now grants was true , viz. that one man ought not to be suffered to ruin a whole nation ; that peaceable citizens ought not to be pilloried and imprisoned for a conscientious worship of God . Hence he was not for " taking a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an exclusive Presbyterianism was no more just , than an exclusive Laudism . He wanted for himself and his ironsides , who had hazarded all in the struggle , and done the principal work from Edgehill to Worcester , simply , that so long as they were // peaceable citizens , they might enjoy liberty of conscience in religious things . And , as his whole after life proved , he was more than willing that others should have the same privilege . World 's conventions are called in 1846 , to see if that can not be done , which , two centuries ago , Cromwell clearly saw should be done , and which to a good degree he did . We have known men not a little praised for being ahead of their age ! " But Cromwell was a rebel , a hypocrite , a monster of cruelty . " To give the right name to a man 's character , placed in Cromwell 's circumstances , is not an easy matter . Most men are held to be bad men when they think or act contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to be such in the books we read or in the remarks we hear about him . We believe it is now a conceded point that very good and great men may go by all manner of opprobrious names , for at least two centuries . But we shall leave these heavy charges to be cleared up by the narrative . Cromwell was sent by the Parliament , at a time when the Parliament was in the highest favor with the nation generally , to raise forces in his own county . The king had set up his standard of rebellion against the constitution and the laws of England , and was determined to do with the sword , what he could not do by mere authority . Parliament , with slavery or death thus staring them in the face , urged on by the general voice of the nation , determined to resist . They sent out in all directions to gather forces to meet the crisis . Cromwell , without ever having seen a battle , without the least instruction at this time in military affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of course , he became distinguished . He was always victorious , while others suffered defeat . This , in our fighting world , has not been deemed pecu liarly criminal . 1-Je was rapidly promoted ; for in all great emergencies people take care to place able men in stations of responsibility . He soon understood the enemy he had to deal with , and the kind of fighting material which was needed ; . and he remodeled his army accordingly . He turned out the city tapsters ' and selected substantial , honest , God-fearing men . ' As colonel of his regiment , as commander in chief , or as lord protector , he showed all the sagacity of Napoleon in selecting men for the work that was to be done . Another thing to be noted as characteristic of him , is that since he was sent to fight Charles and his cavaliers , he did it in right good earnest ! It had come to war , and he was not the fool to fight gently . I would shoot the king himself , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Horrible ! " Well all the horror lies in fighting at all . Possibly the horror of this war belongs to Charles Stuart . Or if to Cromwell , then only in common with the English Parliament and nation . Sent to subdue Ireland , he places himself before Kedah , and sends a summons of surrender on penalty of universal massacre . He does as he says . Every man in the garrison is put to death . His name became a terror ; every body knew what to expect , and Ireland was speedily subdued , and with much less blood and suffering , as Cromwell knew would be the fact , than doing it gently would have cost . Napoleon did not shoot paper wads at that Paris mob ; and all men say with him , it would have cost too many lives ! ' The truth is , Cromwell was cruel only as war itself is cruel . He did not allow his soldiers to plunder , or in any way injure man , woman or child . It was death for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was in Scotland with his army , the people soon learned that they were far safer near Cromwell 's army than in the vicinity of their // own . But on the battie-*ield , when veritable fighting was the order of the day , Cromwell and his Ironsides with Scripture on their standards , with psalms of praise on their tongues , did that work in the only way it ever should be done-with their might . They fought with their might , for the appeal was made to the mig/as of men . ' But these men fought also with prayer , believaug that God would bring the cause to a righteous decision ,  --  a confidence , which , as our author intimates , we moderns can poorly understand . They did practically lay - it to heart , that a just God presided ever that land , and that lie would favor the right .

Yet it was at this time that a division was commenced among the friends of Parliament , which ultimately led to a purgation and dissolution of Parliament , to military sway - ud Oh -- ver 's protectorship . After Charles I. and his cavaliers were completely subdued , at the close of 1645 , and no farther hope remained of subduing Parliament and the nation , all parties began to play very sh*gular games . Presbyterianism was in the ascendant , strongly backed by London City . A large portion of the army and many citizens of England were Independents . Yet they were as yet willing to have the Presbyterian platform of church government stand for a limited time . Cromwell voted for this in Oct. 1647 , when a proposition of the kind to be offered to the king was under discussion ; yet he then req ested that there - might be latitude for conscience .

In this attitude of the several parties , the one great question isWhat will tb-c king do ? ' There he is , conquered , not a soldier on foot , yet all eyes are upon him . The Presbyterians most passionately entreat him to sign their propositions and become a good Presbyterian king of England . They warn him of the worst consequences from the sectarian parties ' if he refuses . But they find it more difficult to treat with him than they did to conquer him . No dependence could be placed upon what he said . There were several bidd-ers at the same time , and all understood he would strike himself off at the highest offer , if he found he could not deceive the whole , and be king again on his own terms . But after months spent in negotiation , his final answer to the Presbyterian propositions comes a decided , no ! He hopes the parties will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair chance ; also that help may soon come from other quarters . A part of his hope , though much the smallest part , is realized . The struggle now , during 1646-7 , is between the city and the Presbyterian majority of Parliament on one side , the army and the Independents on the other . Of the numberless petitions , remonstrances , army manifestoes , insurrections , negotiations- , &amp;c. , during these years , we have not space to say any thing . Cromwell is con - stant in his attendance at Parlia - ment , yet watching and occasionally visiting the army near by . Carlyle denies that there is any evidence of his exciting commotions , that by hypocrisy and master strokes of duplicity ' he might worm his way to power . He says , history has // treated this matter in a very sad way . Mistakes , exaggerations , falsehoods abound . How many grave historical statements still circulate , accredited by Bishop Burnet and the like , which on exartilnation you will find melt away into after-dinner rumors , gathered from ancient rednosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not Cromwell that raised these discontents , but the elemental powers . Nor was it by duplicity that Cromwell steered himself victoriously across such a devouring chaos ; but by continuances of noble manful simplicity ,  --  by meaning one thing before God and meaning the same before men as a strong man does . ' Both parties profess a desire for the settlement of the nation , with Charles at the head , and to have the army , except that portion of it needed for Ireland , disbanded . Bu they could not agree upon the conditions . The army want all arrears paid and Parliament offers to pay down only a small part . In their manifesto , written by Cromwell , the army also demand justice to themselves respecting the abuse which they had received from certain members of Parliament . And one other demand , much the deepest in their hearts , is thus stated in the manifesto : - " We desire a settlement of the peace of the kingdom and of the liberties of the subject , according to the votes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , by the Parliament used as arguments and inducements to invite us , and divers of our dead friends out ; some of whom have lost their lives in this war , which , being now , by God 's blessing , finished , we think we have as much right to demand , and desire to see a happy settlement , as we have to our money and to the other common interest of soldiers which we have insisted upon . We find also the ingenuous and honest people , in al most all parts of the kingdom where we come , full of the sense of rule and misery if the army should be disbanded before the peace of the kingdom , and those other things before mentioned , have a full and perfect settlement . We have said before , and profess it now , we desire no alteration of the civil government . As little do we desire to interrupt , or in the least to intermeddle with the settling of the Presbyterial government . Nor did we seek to open a way for licentious liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We profess , as ever , in these things , when once the state has made a settlement , we have nothing to say , but to submit or suffer . Only we could wish that every goad citizen , and every man who walks peaceably in a blameless conversation , and is beneficial to the commonwealth , might have liberty and encouragement ; this being according to the true policy of all states , and even to justice itself . " At the close of this manifesto , signed by Fairfax , Cromwell and other officers , they say they are drawing near the city ; yet if their just demands are met no harm shall come . They and their soldiers will then be ready to go to Ireland or disband as Parliament directs . But rather than be unrighted ' in these things , they will lose all . ' This was directed to the mayor , aldermen , and common council of the city , with the request that they would lay the matter before Parliament . Here begins the army rebellion against its employer . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were ordered not to quarter within twenty five miles of the city , and they now approach it for the object specified . While Cromwell was absent on duty to the North , the Parliament is purged of members most offensive to the army , and the terror of the sword henceforth rules . // The elucidation ' of Carlyle upon this turning point of settling the government after the king was conquered , is this- " Cromwell and those who sympathized with him upon the chief matter in dispute from the beginning , loved order as much as other men , and hated anarchy . But they more clearly than others discerned what order and disorder really were . The forest trees are not in order ' because they are all clipt into the same shape of Dutch dragons , and forced to die or grow in this way ; but because in each of them there is the same genuiue unity of life , from the inmost pith to the . utmost leaf , and they do grow according to that . Cromwell , in the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party-intent to grow , not as Dutch dragons , but as real trees . The Presbyterians of both kingdoms rebelled when , in 1639-40 , the court party attempted to apply the shears ' to them ; Cromwell and those for the voluntary principle ' in religion rebel when the Presbyterians attempt to shear them in 1647-8 . " At this time , " the general English mind , which , loving good order in all things , loves regularity even at a high price , could be content with this Presbyterian scheme which we call the Dutch dragon one ; but a deeper portion of the English mind inclines decisively to growing in the forest-tree way ,  --  and indeed will shoot out into very singular excrescences , Quakerisms and what not , in coming years . " But leaving the king carefully watched in the Isle of Wight , and the various powers and factions in and around London , stormfully working out their several destinies , we turn our attention to some things which belong to the essence of this Puritan revolt : in which we can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every one who has read the history of these stormy times , has noticed the frequency of days of fasting and prayer . One regular weekly fast was observed for years on the Parliament side . The interposition of God was invoked by both parties , from the first appeal to arms . But on the Puritan side , particularly with Cromwell and the army , this aspect of the enterprise is constantly in sight . As we have intimated , it was no new thing for this class of men to pray and prophesy . ' They were essentially of the same religious belief and practice as the first settlers of New England , and we know what they were in these particulars . The circumstances in which they were placed in England , led to somewhat different manifestations of their faith ; but the prominence of the religious element in their daily life , in their families , in their frequent m6etings , upon all occasions and in all places , was common to them all . Where others have found nothing but mad enthusiasm or sheer hypocrisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carlyle finds their noblest quality . He believes them to have been most sincere in their religion . And it is in the depth of their sincerity and their earnestness , that he finds the noblest heroism our world has witnessed for nearly two thousand years . God 's Bible was believed by them as by no other people . Its promises were for them , and they layed hold ' of the hope there set before them . They lived in a day when war in a righteous cause was deemed a sacred duty , and they believed their cause righteous ,  --  ' God 's cause which He would not desert . ' They went forth nothing doubting . God 's gospel had long been resisted , and His people trodden in the dust . Yet believers had been multiplying until they were now strong enough to vindicate the cause of truth and religious freedom . And the same zeal , the same trust and hope in God , with which they had met in conventicles , characterized them on the battle-field . The success which attended their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers , and , if possible , confirmed them the more in the justice of their course . At the beginning of 1648 , when , as we have seen , the parties could not agree about the settlement of the kingdom ; when it appeared that the free worship of God must still , after so many struggles and victories , be a penal offense , either under an exclusive Presbyterianism or an exclusive Prelacy , there was held at Windsor a special prayer-meeting of the leading men in the army . Cromwell 's army was at this time threatened by all the other parties . The royalists were rallying anew , encouraged by the Pres. byterians both of England and Scotland . Forty thousand men were already on foot in the North , to conquer Cromwell and restore the king . There was also some disaffection in Cromwell 's army . What should be done ? Disband and give up the cause , or should something farther be attempted ? Some are of one mind and some of another . They meet to inquire of the Lord , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , that they might find the cause of their afflictions and be led to the right course . ' This was a three-days ' meeting ' of fasting and prayer . On the second day , among others who spoke , Lieutenant-General Cromwell pressed very earnestly on all present , a thorough consideration of our actions as an army , and of our ways particularly as private Christians ; to see if any iniquity could be found in them ; and what was the cause of such sad rebukes , that they might remove it . Upon the third day , they include among their sins most offensive to God , and for which He now frowned upon them , the following : their carnal conferences with the king and his party which they held the year before ; fear of man and departure from that path of simplicity they had formerly walked in ; reliance too much upon their own wisdom and strength . The good people of the nation began to turn their affections from them for their politic course and backslidings in general , and God was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goffe spoke upon the wordsTurn you at my reproof ; behold I will pour out my spirit upon you , I will make known my words unto you . The effect was good upon their hearts ; begetting in them a sense of shame and loathing of themselves for their iniquities , and a justifying of the Lord in His proceedings against them . They were all melted in tears , yet rejoiced in the Lord . Their duty now seemed plain ,  --  take what forces they had , and depending on God , go out and meet the enemy . And also this-that if the Lord gave them success , to call Charles Stuart to account for the blood he had shed and the mischief he had done to the Lord 's cause and people . ' Carlyle gives this account of the prayermeeting much more fully , and by his elucidations shows clearly that he believes the leaders of the army honest and earnest in the transaction . Not mad hut sane ; not hypocritical but true . And he would have us conceive of the scene as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimates . For his readers will be fancying how such a scene would appear at the present day . How , for example , would it look if Sir Robert Peel , the Duke of Wellington , and Bishop Buckland with geological hammers in his pockets , and others of their party , should have a prayer-meeting , to inq3lire into the real cause of the present distress ; and to acknowledge it to be their fault , their self seekincr ' their worldly wisdom , their own politic ' ways , rather than following the simplicity ' of right and justice . See them become so affected with a sense of their shame and guilt , that they determine to meet another day to consider the matter farther . When they reassemble , his Grace expounds // some passage of Scripture-not the geological length of a Mosaic daybut some confessional Psalm . Light breaks in upon their minds ; they see wherein they have erred and determine , come what will , henceforth tO- do their duty ! We would ask Mr. Carlyle how it is possible for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it looks so in 1846 ? But he will tell us : men do the same thing in form now . He will ask : Do not men in surplice every Sabbath , as by law required , read confessions of sins , pray for pardon , and promise the Lord that they will mend their wicked ways ? ' But then he calls all this , cant and heartless formalism , because the worshipers do not really believe that they are exposed to destruction for their sins , lie will not allow that there is any repentance in it , or any purpose of amendment ; but the whole is a mere grimace and chattering of Dead-Sea asses ' ! But in these seventeenth-century Puritans he finds a faith and depth of soul , accompanied with a bold doing of what they felt to be their duty , which should put us to shame for our mere stomach-qualities , ' our greediness for riches and popuJarity . Not to Cromwell and his men , but to their historians and modern slanderers , belong cant , duplicity and hypocrisy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abiding . Duty with them had an import high as heaven , deep as hell . When for his sin against Laud 's surplices , the executioner was cutting off Prynne 's ears , he said , " cut me , tear me ; I fear not thee ; I fear the fire of hell ! " They had been educated in a school of suffering . Hunted , imprisoned , maimed , banished , put in pillories , they now had little fear of death . They could die , but they would not bow to despotism . And when the sword was put into their hands , with an able leader , they would not part with it , without a fair trial to establish God 's jus tice ' in the nation . This our author considered heroic and praiseworthy ; particularly in cont*ast with the character of the court party and their sympathizers at this day . Those Puritans saw into the realities of things . Man 's being and destiny they felt to be great ; he was placed here by God , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out with fear and trembling . They went directly to God 's Word , to find what there was to be feared or hoped for in this world or the next ; what God did specially require in them , that they might be prepared for His kingdom . And strange as it may appear to some , they found those terms to be conversion , ' born of the Spirit , ' led and sanctified by the Spirit , ' filled with the fullness of God , ' - they found these and other conditions to have reference to the inner and not to the outer man ! The Popish rites and formalism which still remained in the hierarchy ; converting men by making them bow down to images , as Cortes converted whole acres of Mexicans ; the substitution , for God 's work of grace in the heart , of certain dumb Tulehan manipulations upon the body ; and the close shearing of the flock of God in place of spiritual food ,  --  how could men who saw and felt realities , away with such shams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not keep within the embankments of liturgies and respectable ' ceremonials . Enter , in imagination , one of their law-forbidden assemblies ; that in Huntington , before the archbishops suppressed it . Listen to their interpretations and applications of Paul 's epistles ; hear them tell their experience-what God had done for their souls-their struggles against sin , their temptations , their light and darkness , their joys and sorrows : each one exercising the gift that was in him to prophesy , ' to pray , to exhort : abasing themselves in the // dust before God , and feeling strong only in His strength . See the strong , rugged Cromwell among them on an evening after his day 's farming , and think , would such men do this year after year , in the woods , in byplaces , on cold mornings before spies were out of bed to report them to the Star-chamber , would they do this as a merefarce ? For their practices they thought they had found good warrant in the gospel of Christ and the practice of early Christians . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , ' speaking often one to another , ' exhorting one another to faith and good works , ' giving a reason of the hope within them , ' &amp;c . They found him actually telling his own experience ; his struggle with sin , his trials , strivings , joys , sorrows ; - in short , his con*ersion , and the deep interest he took in getting himself and others safely through this wicked world ! They felt in their hearts those emotions and exercises which were recorded of good men in the Bible , and from the abundance of the heart , uttered the same sentiments in similar phraseology . One century after these prayer-meetings of Cromwell , midway between his time and ourssuch men as Edwards of Northampton sanctioned the same practices . And we do not hear them called , canting hypocrites . They are acknowledged to have been sincere and true men . And had not the pikes of the Puritans been felt , we should have heard nothing of them to the contrary in England . As to the outward things , ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , redolent as they were of popery , no wonder they were discarded by men whose only authority was the Bible . They could find no shadow of evidence in support of ceremonial bowings , signs of the cross , altars in the east , wearing surplices , &amp;c . Laymen prayed and exhorted in meetings ; and , scandalous as it appeared to Laud , they brought examples from the Scriptures to sanction the practice . They were willing that others should cast out devils in their own way . They wanted only to enjoy the same privilege . Cromwell 's character had become fixed before he entered the public service : and when in the army his religion manifested itself in the same way as it had always done , only as it was modified by his new employment . His first letters , his last speeches and his dying words , are in perfect unison . It was not irreverent , impious , fanatical in him and his Lronside* , to hold meetings in camp for prayer and exhortation . This was their meat and drink before war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times of trial ; and in this time of special trial , if sincere , they were not likely to dispense with it . Diligent in the use of means , and strong in the conviction that a just God would favor the right , they fought with an energy which was always victorious . Take one example . In the cold , drizzly night previous to the battle of Dunbar-that dark hour when Cromwell told his soldiers " to trust God and keep their powder dry , " - Cromwell , with his sick and wornout army , hemmed in between the ocean and a force much superior in numbers , relied upon God . They were heard praying all night . And as day dawned upon them  --  the last many of them could expect to seeevery soldier is ready , and shouting The Lord of Hosts ! ' they rush devoutly to the fight ! And in one hour the " Drove of Dunbar " attested the powers of these men ! Even so . The Scotch army is shivered to utter ruin ; rushes in tumultuous wreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their distraction even to Dunbar ; the chase goes as far as Lladdington , led by Hacker . After the first onset , the Lord General made a halt , and sang the hundred // and seventeenth Psalm , at the foot of the Doon Hill ; there we uplift it to the tune of Bangor , or some still higher score , and roll it strong and great against the sky ; - 0 give praise unto the Lord , All nations that be ; Likewise ye people all , accord His name to magnify ! ' The great question with them was - " Shall God 's or Satan 's kingdom be established in this land ? Shall the gospel of Christ , its liberty , its simple preaching , its practical truth and justice , its renovating power upon the heart , have free course among the people ; or shall it be restricted , buried . from sight , its power impaired by human authority and Popish forms ? " The answer they gave is known . The world has acknowledged the many private virtues of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrained , virtue more prevalent , freedom more enjoyed , England better governed , more prosperous , and more triumphant over foreign foes , than under their sway ! How bitterly did all classes feel the contrast under the second Charles and James ! From his first entering Parliament , Cromwell was known as an earnest , passionate man , who drove directly at the heart of his subject . There was always a meaning in what he said . His cousin Hampden remarked of him then- " If it comes to a rupture , that man will be the Ilrst man in England . " His whole life shows a consistent Calvinistic Puritan of that day and in his position , unless the word rebel , which belongs in common to nearly all England in 1640 and 1688 , is to brand him and all who ever take arms against oppression with infamy . View him as a father-the interest he took in having his children married to those of good character ; as a citizen-among his neighbors who applied to him for assistance in their troubles ; then5 after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the necessity of the case , ( unless he would abandon the cause for which he fought , and give himself and friends up as traitors , to be hung and quartered , ) he was placed at the head of the nation , hear nearly all parties acknowledging the justice and ability of his administration ; and finally enter the chamber of the dying man , and listen to his appeals to God there , and decide ,  --  was Cromwell , on the whole , a true or false man ? The men he gathered round him to assist in administering the government , chosen from different parties for their moral and intellectual worthMilton , Hale , Blake ; the ministers of the Gospel , whom his bitterest enemies pronounced good and faithful men , appointed to instruct the people-all saw good in this Protector ! And must their testimony go for naught against the spleen of his detractors ? No ruler was ever so intent on having the pure Gospel taught , and pure justice in all things done in England , as he was . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and life , no sect or party , except the Catholic , ( that then were but subjects of the Pope , ) would have had ground to complain . In the work before us , Cromwell 's speeches are made intelligible . They are given as the reporters left them , except the orthography and punctuation . One is astonished after hearing so much about the fog and cant of Cromwell 's public addresses , that they are in fact quite clear and readable . Carlyle says of them , they are good of their kind . Not eloquent , not elegant , not always clear to us , though they were well understood by his hearers . They flow in the same strain as the man 's soul had been accustomed to utter itself in religious exercises . Cromwell never claimed to be a speaker , he despised oratory as an art . Yet there lie in these speeches // a silence greater tha a speech . They reveal the soul of the man ; valor and belief without adequate words . - noble in comparison to eloquent words without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have space to give will convey any adequate idea of the manner or matter of their author . The explanation of the circumstances in which they were delivered , must be read in the connection . And we promise any one , who has not read them , that he will find the sentences in brackets by a modern hand , ' sufficiently spicy to keep his appetite keen . Certainly Cromwell was original in addressing Parliaments ; and his hearers who could sit listening two or three hours in a hot day to such addresses , must have been quite a unique body of men . Verily men and the ages do differ somewhat . ' As examples , not so much of the speeches as of the annotations , ' take the following . The words in brackets are by Mr. Carlyle . in 1653 . " Truly the judgment of truth , ' it will teach you to be as just towards an unbeliever as towards a believer ; and it 's our duty to do so . I confess I have said sometimes , foolishly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an unbeliever . This may seem a paradox ; but let 's take heed of doing that which is evil to either ! Oh , if God fill your hearts with such a spirit as Moses had , and as Paul had-which was not a spirit for believers only but for the whole people ! Moses could die for them ; wish himself blotted out of God 's Book . ' Paul could wish himself accursed for his countrymen after the flesh . ' Let us never forget that , in 2Vlioses and Paid . Are not these amazing sentiments , on their part , my estimable timberheaded , leaden-hearted friend ? So full of affection were their spirits unto all . And truly this would help you to execute the judgment of truth and mercy also . " Parliament in 1658 . " And then in what sense it is our land ; - through this grace and favor of God , that he has vouchsafed unto us and bestowed upon us , with the Gospel , peace and rest , out of ten years ' war ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have forethought , when we were plunged into the midst of our troubles , that ever the people of God should have had liberty to worship*God without fear of enemies ? Strange ; this liberty ' is to Oliver Cromwell a blessing almost too great for belief ; to us it has become as common as the liberty to breathe atmospheric air ,  --  a liberty not once worth thinking of . It is the way with all attainments and conquests in this u'orld . Do I think of Cadmus , or the old unknown Orientals , while I write with letters ? The world is built upon the mere dust of heroes ; once earnest-wrestling , death-defying , prodigal of their blood ; who now sleep well , forgotten by all their heirs . - Without fear of enemies , ' he says . Which is the very acknowledgment of the promise of Christ that He would deliver his from the fear of enemies , that they might worship Him in holiness and in righteousness all the days of their life . ' " Carlyle in this work has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrasted with its days of heroism . But most of them are but the reiteration of what he advanced in his Past and Present . He thinks England must and will come back to realities . After saying that the history of Oliver is the noblest thing England has had , and the basis from which she will have to start again if she ever struggle God-ward , instead of Mammon. ward , in her religious and political cant , he adds , " England now finds himself on the point of choking // there ( in the atmosphere of cant ) : large masses of her people no longer able to find even potatoes on that principle . England will have to come out of that ; England , too terribly awakened at last , is every where preparing to come out of that . England , her Amazon-eyes once more flashing strange Heaven 's light , like Phcebus Apollo 's fatal to the Pythian mud-serpents , will lift her hand , I think , and her heart , and swear by the Eternal , I will not die in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! ' " He does not mean that it is desirable to come back to the same manifestations of belief , earnestness and justice . He has no regrets that the dialect of Cromwell and his Puritan age has become obsolete : not at all . The vesture , as he would call it , of the Puritans ' religion , while he finds no fault with it inasmuch as it fitted them at that day , has no attractions for him . His ways of thinking upon religious subjects differ as widely from theirs-at least his form of religious expressions , as any antipuritan could wish. * But their insight into the realities of things , the deep , earnest tone of their pietyleading them to struggle with their lives for the right , and true and good , both in the church and in the state ,  --  this he loves . In itself and in its results he deems it the best thing England has had .

Readers who are not familiar with other writings of Mr. Carlyle , may receive the impression that rebellion and bloodshed go for little with him if great existing wrongs can be removed . This is not so . No man has uttered stronger things against war than he has . But when those who are placed on high to govern and guide men , so far forget their duties as to fail of at least some approximation to right and justice , let them beware ! Men , nations , are patient of much but not of all which bigots and tyrants in church and state affairs will sometimes lay upon them .

The eruption will come . Unless God change human nature , it must come . Then woe to those who oppose the fiery torrent ! Then the highest honor to him who , at the peril of his life , turns it into the safest and best channel possible . In every nation , in this English nation now , there are many silent , heroic men . Were it not so , like a forest with blossoms and leaves but no roots , all would soon die . But silence must sometimes get a voice , heroism must act as well as endure . Let rulers and spiritual guides understand this and act upon it , and it shall be well with all.
