txt WE gladly return to the task left unfinished in our last Number , of giving such an account of the Lectures referred to at the foot of the p*age , together with the most liberal quotations from them permitted by our limits , as to constitute the best substitute in our power to afford to those of our readers to whom their comparatively limited circulation must deny access to them . We have no fear that this will supersede the purchase of a single copy , on the part of any who may have the opportunity . To such our limited extracts can only serve to whet the appetite they will not satisfy ; while we trust that they will have the effect of inducing many readers to seek to possess the original-of which , indeed , we could most fervently wish to see a // copy in the hands of every one of the mighty mass of millions to whom , as indicated by their title , Dr. Channing has addressed these Lectures . In the first Lecture the question was considered , in what consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of toil . It was shown not to consist in exemption from the necessity of manual labor  --  the beneficial effects of which , on the mental and moral education as well as on the physical developement , when not carried to an exhausting excess , were finely pointed out , as its native dignity was nobly vindicated from the senseless prejudice which an imperfect and unhealthy civilization has heretofore attached to it . Nor was that elevation to be sought in a participation in the luxurious refinements and splendors of those classes of society which are actustomed to pride themselves in the poor title of its " fashionable circles . " And equally vain would it be to expect to find it in mere political power , sought and exercised in a monopolizing spirit as a distinct class with presumed interests antagonist to those of other classes . But it was shown to consist in that which can alone raise man from a level not far removed from that of the brute creation , whatever may be his position in our conventional classifications , namely , in elevation of soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition of Truth-secondly , through Force of Pure and Generous Feeling . - *- thirdly , through Force of Moral Purpose . " Without this , " says Dr. Channing , " it matters nothing where a man stands , or what he possesses ; and with it , he towers , he is one of God 's nobility , no matter what place he holds in the social scale . There is but one elevation for a laborer and for all other men . There are not different kinds of dignity for different orders of men , but one and the same to all . The only elevation of a human being consists in the exercise , growth , energy of the higher principles and powers of his soul . A bird may be shot upward to the skies by a foreign force ; but it rises , in the true sense of the word , only when it spreads its own wings and soars by its own living power . So a man may be thrust upward into a conspicuous place by outward accidents ; but he rises , only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best faculties , and ascends by a free effort to a nobler region of thought and action . Such is the elevation I desire for the laborer , and I desire no other . This elevation is indeed to be aided by an improvement of his outward condition , and in turn it greatly improves his outward lot ; and thus connected , outward good is real and great ; but supposing it to exist in separation from inward growth and life , it would be nothing worth , nor would I raise a finger to promote it . " The second Lecture considers the objections which are apt to sug* gest themselves when such views are given of the laborer 's destiny , together with some of the circumstances of the . times which encourage hopes of its approaching attainment . // The objection that will generally first occur to the mind of the laborer himself , is the fact that he can neither command a variety of books , nor spend much time in reading . Dr. Channing does not undervalue the worth of books . " Truly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mines to those who can understand them . They are the breathings of the great souls of past times . Genius is not embalmed in them , as is sometimes said , but lives in them perpetually . " But he proceeds with equal truth " We need not many books to answer the great ends of reading . A few are better than many , and a little time given to a faithful study of the few will be enough to quicken thought and enrich the mind . The greatest men have not been bookmen . Washington , it has often been said , was no great reader . The learning commonly gathered from books is of less worth than the truths we gain from experience and reflection . Indeed , most of the knowledge from reading in these days , being acquired with little mental action , and seldom or never reflected on and turned to use , is very much a vain show . Events stirring the mind to earnest thought and vigorous application of its resources , do vastly more to elevate the mind , than moat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * " The great use of books is to rouse us to thought ; to turn us to questions which great men have been working on for ages ; to furnish us with materials for the exercise of judgment , imagination , and moral feeling ; to breathe into us a moral life from higher spirits than our own ; and this benefit of books may be enjoyed by those who have not much time for retired study . " It must not be forgotten by those who despair of the laboring classes because they can not live in libraries , that the highest sources of truth , light , and elevation of mind are not libraries , but our inward and outward experience . Human life , with its joys and sorrows , its burdens and alleviations , its crimes and virtues , its deep wants , its solemn changes , and its retributiQns always pressing on us-what a library is this l and who may not study it Every human being is a volume , worthy to be studied . The books which circulate most freely through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . 1kw much more improving is the original , did we know how to read it ! The laborer has this page always open before him ; and , still more , the laborer is every day writing a volume more full of instruction than all human productions ; I mean , his own life . No work of the most exalted genius can teach us so much as the revelation of human nature in the secrets of our own souls , in the workings of our own passions , in the operaLions of our own intelligence , in the retributions which follow our own good and evil deeds , in the dissatisfaction with the present , in the spontaneous thoughts and aspirations , which form part of every man 's biography . The study of our own history from childhood , of all the stages of our developement , of the good and bad influences which have beset us , of our mutations of feeling and purpose , and of the great current which is setting us toward future happiness or wo ; this is a study to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to this fountain of eternal truth 1 May not the laborer study and understand the pages which he is writing in his own breast V ' Against the objection that there exists in the order of Providence a natural aristocracy of intellect designed to monopolize the function of thinking , to the exclusion of the Many whose office in the great social division of labor is manual toil , Dr. Channing thus indignantly protests // " I deny to any individual or class this monopely of thought . Who among men can show God 's commission to think for his brethren , to shape passively the intellect of the mass , to stamp his own image on them as if they were wax ! As well might a few clai* a monopoly of light and air , of seeing and breathing , as of thought . is not the intellect as universal a gift as the organs of sight and respiration ! Is not truth as freely spread abroad as the atmosphere or the sun 's rays ! Can we imagine that God 's highest gifts of intelligence , imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for animal wants ! to be denied the natural means of growth , which is action ! to be starved by drudgery ! Were the mass of men made to be monsters ! to grow only in a few organs and faculties , and to pine away and shrivel in others ! or were they made to put forth all the powers of men , espedaily the best and most distinguishing ! No man , not the lowest , is all hands , all bones and muscles . The mind is more essential to human nature , and more enduring , than the limbs , and was this made to lie dead ! Is not thought the right and duty of all ! Is not truth alike precious to all ! Is not truth the natural aliment of the mind as plainly as the wholesome grain is of the body ! Is not the mind adapted to thought , as plainly as the eye to light , the ear to sound ! Who dares to withhold it from its natural action , its natural element and joy ! Undoubtedly some men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more studious lives . But the work of such men is not to do others ' thinking for them , but to help them te think more vigorously and effectually . Great minds are to make others great . Their superiority is to be used , not to break the multitude to intellectual vassalage , not to estalAish over them a spiritual tyranny , but to rouse them from lethargy and to aid them to judge for themselves . The light and life which spring up in one soul are to be spread far and wide . Of all treasons against humanity , there is no one worse than his who employs great intellectual force to keep down the intellec : of his less favored brother . " The commonplace objection of complacent pedantry , that " A little learning is a dangerous thing " - that the mass of the people can not see to the bottom of anything , and that the result of stimulating them to thought will be the formation of a dangerous set of half-thinkers-is summarily disposed of . Whose learning ' is not little ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who of us has fathomed the depths of a single product of nature , or a single event in history ? Who of us is not baffled by the mysteries in a grain of sand ? How contracted is the range of the widest intellect ! The argument , therefore , proves nothing by proving too much , for if valid it shows that none of any class ought to think . " I will only add , " he concludes , " that the laboring class are not now condemned to draughts of knowledge so shallow as to merit scorn . Many of . them know more of the outward world than all the philosophers of antiquity ; and Christianity has opened to them mysteries of the spiritual world , which kings and prophets were not privileged to understand . And are they , then , to be doomed to spiritual inaction , as incapable of useful thought ? " From Dr. Channing 's remarks upon the objection which he next considers , we are unwilling to omit any portion : " I proceed to another prejudice . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to social order , and that this will be swept away by calling forth energy of thought in aU men . This objection , indeed , though exceedingly insisted on in // Europe , has nearly died out here ; but still enough of it lingers among us to deserve consideration . I reply , then , that it is a libel on social order to suppose , that it requires for its support the reduction of the multitude of hum an beings to ignorance and servility ; and that it is a libel on the Creator to suppose , that he requires , as the foundation of communities , the systematic depression of the majority of his intelligent offspring . The supposition is too grossly unreasonable , too monstrous , to require labored refutation . I see no need of ranks , either for social order or for any other purpose . A great variety of pursuits and conditions is indeed to be desired . Men ought to follow their genius , and to put forth their powers in every useful and lawful way . I do not ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vassalage of fashion , which is a part of rank , prevents continually the free expansion of men 's powers . Let us have the greatest diversity of occupations . But this does not imply that there is a need of splitting society into castes or ranks , or that a certain number should arrogate superiority , and stand apart from the rest of men as a separate race . Men may work in different departments of life , and yet recugnise their brotherly relation . and honor one another , and hold friendly communion with one another . Undoubtedly , men will prefer as friends and common associates those with whom they sympathize most . But this is not to form a rank or caste . For example , the intelligent seek out the intelligent ; the pious , those who reverence God . But suppose the intellectual and the religious to cut themselves off by some broad , visible distinction from the rest of society , to form a clan of their own , to refuse admission into their houses to people of inferior knowledge and virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intercourse with them ; would not society rise up , as one man , against his arrogant exclusiveness And if intelligence and piety may not be the foundations of a caste , on what ground shall they , who have no distinction but wealth , superior costume , richer equipages , finer houses , draw lines around themselves and constitute themselves a higher class . That some should be richer than others is natural , and is necessary , and could only be prevented by gross vioktions of right . Leave men to the free use of their powers , and some will accumulate more than their neighbors . But , to be prosperous is not to be superior , and should form no barrier between men . Wealth ought not to secure to the prosperous the slightest consideration . The only distinctions which should be recognised are those of the soul , of strong principle , and of incorruptible integrity , of usefulness , of cultivated intellect , of fidelity in * seeking for truth . A man , in proportion as he has these claims , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , however coarsely if neatly dressed , should not be a respected guest in the most splendid mansions , and at the most brilliant meetings . A man is worth infinitely more than the saloons , and the costumes , and the show of the universe . He was made to tread all these beneath his feet . What an insult to humanity is the present deference to dress and upholstery , as if silkworms , and looms , and scissors , and needles could produce something nobler than a man . Every good man should protest against a caste founded on outward prosperity , because it exalts the outward above the inward , the material above the spiritual ; because it springs from and cherishes a contemptible pride in superficial and transitory distinctions ; because it alienates man from his brother , breaks the tie of common humanity , and breeds jealousy , scorn , and mutual ill will . Can this be needed to social order " It is true that in countries where the mass of the people are ignorant and servile , the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from outrage . It infuses a sentiment of awe , which prevents more or less the need of force and punishment . But it is worthy of remark , that the means of keeping order in one state of society may become the chief excitement of discontent and disorder in another , and this is pecullaily true of aristocracy or high rank . In rude ages , this keeps the people down ; but when the peeple by degrees have risen to some consciousness of their rights and essential equality with the rest of the race , the awe // of rank naturally subsides , and passes into suspicion , jealonsy , and sense of injury , and a disposition to resist . The very institution which once restrained now provokes . Through this process the old world is now passing . The strange illusion , that a man , because he wears a garter or riband , or was born to a title , belongs to another race , is fading away ; and society must pass through a series of revolutions , silent or bloody , until a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of force . Thus aristocracy , instead of giving order to society , now convulses it . So impossible is it for arbitrary human ordinations peimanently to degrade human nature , or subvert the principles of justice and freedom . " I am aware , that it will be said , that the want of refinement of manners and taste in the lower classes will necessarily keep them an inferior cas* , even though all political inequalities be removed . ' I acknowledge this defect of manners in the multitude , and grant that it is an obstacle to intercourse with the more improved , though often exaggerated . But this is a barrier which must and will yield to the means of culture spread through our community . This evil is not necessarily associated with any condition of human life . An intelligent traveller , * tells us , that in Norway , a country wanting many of our advantages , good manners and politeness are spread through all conditions ; and that the rough way of talking to and living with each other , characteristic of the lower classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many centuries ago , the intercourse of the highest orders in Europe was sullied by indelicacy and fierceness ; but time has worn out these stains , and the same cause is now removing what is repulsive among those who toil with their hands . I can not believe , that coarse manners , boisterous conversation , slovenly negligences , filthy customs , surliness , indecency , are to descend by necessity from generation to generation in any portion of the *ommunity . I do not see why neatness , courtesy , delicacy , ease , and deference to other 's feelings , may not be made the habits of the laboring multitude . A change is certainly going on among them in respect to manners . Let us hope that it will be a change for the better ; that they will not adopt false notions of refinement ; that they will escape the serviie imitation of what is hollow and insincere , and the substitution of outward shows for genuine natural courtesy . Unhappily they have but imperfect models on which to form themselves . It is not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a new social intercourse , which shall breathe genuine refinement ; which shall unite the two great elements of politeness , self-respect and a delicate regard to the rights and feelings of others ; which shall be free without rudeness , and earnest without positiveness ; which shall be graceful yet warm-hearted ; and in which communication shall be frank , unlabored , overflowing , through the absence of all assumption and pretence , and through the consciousness of being safe from heartless ridicule . This grand reform , which I trust is to come , will bring with it a happiness little known in social life ; and whence shall it come The wise and disinterested of all conditions must contribute to it ; and I see not why the laboring clabses may not take part in the work . Indeed , when I consider the greater simplicity of their lives , and their greater openness to the spirit of Christianity , I am not sure but that the golden age ' of manners is to begin among those who are now despaired of for their want of refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of prejudices ' to the old opinions respecting rank , and respecting the need of keeping the people from much thought . But allow these opinions to have a foundation in truth ; suppose high fences of rank to be necessary to refinement of manners ; suppose that the happiest of all ages were the feudal , when aristocracy was in its flower and glory ; when the noble , superior to the laws , committed more murders in one year , than the multitude in twenty . Suppose it best for the laborer to live and die in thoughtless ignorance . Allow all this , and that we have reason to look with envy on the past ; one thing is // plain ; the past is gone , the feudal castle is dismantled , the distance between class*s greatly reduced . Unfortunate as it may be , the people have begun to think , to ask reasons for what they do and suffer and believe , and to call the past to account . Old spells are broken , old4eliances gone . Men can no longer be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Allowing it to be best , that society should rest on the depression of the multitude , the multitude will no longer be quiet when they are trodden under foot , but ask impatiently for a reason why they too may not have a share in social blessings . Such is the state of things , and we must make the best of what we can not prevent . Right or wrong , the people will think ; and is it not important that they should think justly that they should be inspired with the love of truth , and instructed how to seek it that they should be established by wise culture in the great principles on which religion and society rest , and be protected from scepticism and wild speculation by intercourse with enlightened and virtuous men ! It is plain that , in the actual state of the world , nothing can avail us , but a real improvement of the mass of the people . No stable foundation can be laid for us but in men 's minds . Alarming as the truth is , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure us . Mightier powers than institutions have come into play among us , the judgment , the opinions , the feelings of the many ; and all hopes of stability , which do not rest on the progress of the many , must perish . " The lastand most serious objection to the possibility of the elevation proposed for the laboring class , by that school of democrated philanthropy of which we recognise Dr. Channing as one of the wisest and purest teachers , is , that the laborer can not give the requisite time and strength to intellectual , social , and moral culture , without starving his family , and impoverishing the community . " Political Economy , ' say those who urge this objection , by showing that population outstrips the means of improvement , passes an irrepealable sentence of ignorance and degradation on the laborer . Nature has laid this heavy ban on the mass of the people , and it is idle to set up our theories and dreams of improvement against nature . ' But this objection generally comes from a suspicious source- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; who think more of property than of any other human interest ; who have little concern for the mass of their fellow-creatures ; who are willing that others shouhi bear all the burdens of life , and that any social order should continue which secures to themselves personal comfort or gratification . " The objection is but a repetition of the old doctrine , that what has been must be ; that the future is always to repeat the past , and society to tread for ever the same beaten path  --  a doctrine exploded not only by the broad fact of general progress , in greater or less degree observable throughout all the civilized world , but especially by the experience of our own country . - " The working classes here have risen and are still rising intellectually , and yet there are no signs of starvation , nor are we becoming the poorest people on earth . By far the most interesting view of this country is the condition of the working multitude . Nothing among us deserves the attention of the traveller so much as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our history and institutions in the mass of the people . Our prosperous classes are much like the same classes abroad , though , as we hope , of purer morals ; but the great workir*g multitude leave far behind them the laborers of other countries . No h*an of D2 // observation and benevolence can converse with them , without being struck and de .. lighted with the signs they give of strong and sound intellect and manly principle . And who is authorized to set bounds to this progress In improvement the first steps are the hardest . The difficulty is to wake up men 's souls , not to continue their action . Every accession of light and strength is a help to new acquisitions . " The absurdity of the idea that the intellectual cultivation of the mass of the people could have the effect of diminishing their productive energy and efficiency , so as to starve and impoverish the country , scarcely needed the refutation which Dr. Channing gives to it at some length . It is indeed to lie frightened by a shadow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow from the suppression of Intemperance , of Wastefulness , of Sloth , of ignorance on the all-important subject of Health-apart , too , from the truth that the happiness of a community depends vastly more on the distribution than on the amount of its wealth-apart from these considerations , who can doubt that with the growth of intellectual and moral power in the community , its productive power will increase , that indus$ry will become more efficient , that a wiser economy will accumulate wealth , that unimagined resources of art and nature will be discovered ? " Bodily or material force , " says the author , " can be measured , but not the forces of the soul , nor can the results of increased mental energy be foretold . Such a community will ' tread down obstacles now deemed invincible , and turn them into helps . The Inward mnoulds the Outward . The power of a people lies in its mind ; and this mind , if fortified and enlarged , will bring external things into harmony with itself . It will create a new world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage Dr. Channing touches upon a great ideaor rather upon two which associate themselves closely together : " Another consideration in reply to the objection is , that as yet no community has *erionsl* set itself to the work of improving all its members , so that what is possible remains to be ascertained . No experiment has been made to determine how far liberal provision can be made at once for the body and mind of the laborer . The highest social art is yet in its infancy . Great minds have nowhere solemnly , earnestly undertaken to resolve the problem , how the multitude of men may be elevated . The trial is to come . Still more , the multitude have nowhere comprehended distinctly the true idea of progress , and resolved deliberately and solemnly to reduce it to reality . This great thought , however , is gradually opening on them , and it is destined to work wonders . From themselves , their salvation must chiefly come . Little can be done for them by others , till a spring is touched in their own breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The people , as history shows us , can accomplish miracles under the power of a great idea . How much have they often done and suffered in critical moments for country , for religion The great idea of their own elevation is only beginning to unfold itself within them , and its energy is not to be foretold . A lofty conception of this kind , were it once distinctly seized , would be a new life breathed into them . Under this impulse they would create time and strength for their high calling , and would not only regenerate themselves but the community . " // pensable before any material progress can be made toward the great object of the moral improvement and elevation of the mass of menhow far liberal provision can be made at once for the body and mind of the laborer . ' The former must be the necessary antecedent , before attention can be yielded to the latter . And so long as society is governed by any system of which the tendency is to embarrass the productive industry of the mass by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or discouragement of any kind , so long is the moral elevation of that mass proportionately depressed and retarded . Fearful is the responsibility assumed by those who place themselves at the centre of the social system , to work those springs of legislation which create and direct the motion of the whole machinery . How criminal the folly of those who deal rashly and ignorantly with the solemn duties of the task-how grievous the guilt of those who bring to them unholy motives of selfishness or ambition , to the base gratification of which may be sacrificed perhaps the highest human rights and interests of countless thousands of fellow-beings ! A bad measure of legislation , adopted for the promotion of partial interests , what imagination can ' form a faint conception of the amount of evi*I and suffering , multiplied out into infinite ramifications of consequences , of which it is often the origin and cause , and of which the framer of the measure becomes the responsible author ! Let it not be supposed that it stops short at its mere immediate apparent effects , in simply involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a part of the community , causing a certain diminution in the aggregate of the national wealth . It invariably acts , in its eventual effect , as a tax and burthen upon the industry of the laboring mass ; it adds so much to the length and severity of the poor man 's toil ; it subtracts so much from his means of comfortable sustenance , and his opportunities of mental improvement and moral elevation . It depresses him by so much in the scale of being , reacting with an unerring effect upon even the healthy perfection of his physical constitution , and often prolongs and multiplies itself through his offspring in an indefinite progress of degeneration . And here are we able to perceive the immeasurable importance of the science of Political Economy , in that moral influence upon the condition and progress of society , which affords the point of view from which it presents its highest and most solemn interest to the student of its grandly simple and harmonious principles In connexion with this point , of the possibility of combining a liberal provision at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may allude to an idea which , though not a novel one , has as yet received but a very impeifect developement ; and in which the attempts at a practical application of it that have been made , have always heretofore been united with such fatal errors , honest or corrupt , that a prejudice has been created against it in the minds of many which it may be difficult to*combat . We refer to the principle of Combination of which we // see an imperfect use made in certain industrial associations which have been formed or attempted , with various success , in different countries , as also in that Socialism ' which has recently been made a subject of serious agitation in England . It is very certain that this principle is capable of producing immense results , so far as regards the simple consideration of external prosperity and abundance . How far it may with safety be carried-liable as it obviously is to fatal abuse  --  and in what modes it may be possible to combine it with that opposite principle , of Individuality which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental law of our nature , as it is the essential principle of our modern civilization , and seems an indispensable stimulus to exertion-constitutes a problem of profound difficulty ; and every attempt at its solution , however defective , however abortive , deserves our most anxious observation . At any rate , whether or not this principle , according to the theory of Socialism , ' contains the germ of a new system which shall realize for the laboring mass of mankind the important object in view , of securing a vastly increased amount of the necessaries and comforts of life at a great economy of toil and time , there can be no doubt that even without it , the elevation of the standard of popular intelligence and morals would not only prevent an immense amount of waste , through a countless variety of modes of vice and ignorance , but would also directly cause a still greater increhse of efficiency in every branch of productive industry . The former may afford a great alleviation to the condition of the wretched mass of the working population of Eng1*nd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is not to be denied that it finds no slight support , not only in the precedent of a community of goods bequeathed to us from the earliest and purest days of Christianity , but also in the consideration of the incalculable amount of moral evil which ap*-pears directly assignable to the selfish principle of individuality of property . This may be true , and by a stretch of concession the supposition may even be granted , of the possibility of substituting for the latter principle , , in any human community on a large scale , the law of love with the practice of the primitive Christianity above referred to . That which can refer to such a sanction , as well as to the spirit of the religion of which that practice was but an application-however impossible it may now seem , and foreign to all the habits and modes of thinking of our present civilization-is at least entitled to our respect , as possibly not so total an impracticability , not so radically inconsistent with the fundamental laws of man 's nature , as we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears manifest that this is not to be the condition of the laboring mass in this country . The democratic civilization which we are engaged in slowly and painfully working out , is animated by a different spirit , that of diffusiveness , is organized on an opposite principle , that of individuality . Whether // the perfect freedom of the latter may not eventually lead , by the natural tendency of untrammeled human nature , toward the former , so as to produce an harmonious blending of the two , and thus to realize the whole grand conception of the pure theory of Christianity , the union of Perfect Liberty with Perfect Love-when " thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self " - we may not foretell ; though we feel cheered by a deep , though dim , faith that such is the result toward which our present harsh and selfish transition state is slowly tending , such the sublime order which an unseen hand is gradually elaborating out of the wild moral chaos of our present civilization . But at any rate , it is the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to rule it with undivided sway ; nor must we distract our attention with vain and impracticable efforts to combat it , or to supersede it by any other . Nor , indeed , should we wish to do so . Let us leave human nature to itself , and see what it will do . Let us make every man free , materially and spiritually , embarrassing the completeness of his Liberty as little as possible by the pressure of Law and Government . The result of the freedom we now enjoy  --  a very imperfect one indeedis , we must concede , an universal and intense selfishness  --  a passion for property , the indulgence of which , stimulated by conspiring circumstances , has exerted much pernicious and demoralizing effect upon our national characte*r . But such will not be always the case ; nor should we be discouraged , by the evils attendant upon a transition state , from pursuing fearlessly the developement of great principles of the truth of which-springing out of , and necessarily therefore not inconsistent with , the essential laws and attributes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have called that of Individuality , this necessary first consequence of that of perfect freedom , has already produced immense results of general prosperity and abundance , as a stimulus to exertion and enterprise ; and when relieved from the incubus of bad legislation , will undoubtedly act with vastly increased efficiency in the same direction . To this , then , , we must look as our reliance , though we may still watch with anxious interest the experiments of Socialism , ' or any other efforts of a similar kind toward a better state of things , that may be made in other countries . And our chief object , so far as it is to be affected by the influence of government- ( and that influence is unquestionably strong and pervading ) - should be to promote to the utmost extent possible , the efficiency of its action for the creation of national wealth and individual prosperity . And in this point of view will appear all the moral importance of the great struggle for Currency Reform in which our party is now engaged . The currency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole system of national industry . A healthy and natural condition of this is the first requisite to national // prosperity . And it is because profoundly convinced , as well by the teachings of experience as by the theoretic demonstrations of political economy , that the irremediable instability of our present papermoney currency is the most fatal disease that can poison the whole constitution of the social body , operating as the most depressing incubus upon the industrious energies of the people , that we are so solicitous to carry out to the farthest extent possible that radical reformation of it , of which the great measure of the Independent Treasury is but the first step . But to return to Dr. Channing , from whom the foregoing train of reflection has led us farther and longer than we had designed , our present object being chiefly to furnish an analysis , with liberal quotations ? of his recent admirable Lectures before the Mechanics of Boston . He proceeds , in the last place , to consider a few of the circumstances of the times which encourage hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the mass of the people . The first is thus stated , and its truth will be readily admitted . Would only that it could be stated with still greater strength , as more universally and completely true ; but we must be content that this , like every other of the social influences of democracy , should work its way but slowly through the great body of a society formed and educated , through past centuries , on a different theory , and still strongly swayed by the literature , opinion , and example of a country whose political system is one of the most complete aristocracies that have ever existed : " It is an encouraging circumstance , that the respect for labor is increasing , or rather that the old prejudices against manual toil as degrading a man , or putting him in a lower sphere , are wearing away ; and the cause of this change is full of promise ; for it is to be found in the progress of intelligence , Christianity , and freedom , all of which cry aloud against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge especial sympathy and regard for those who bear the heaviest burdens , and create most of the comforts of social life . The contempt of labor of which I have spoken , is a relic of the old aristocratic prejudices , which formerly proscribed trade as unworthy of a gentleman , and must die out with other prejudices of the same low origin . And the results must be happy . It is hard for a class of men to r*spect themselves , who are denied respect by all around them . A vocation , looked on as degrading , will have a tendency to degrade those who follow it . Away , then , with the idea of something low in manual labor . There is something shocking to a religious man in the thought , that the employment which God has ordained for the vast majority of the human race should be unworthy of any man , even of the highest . If indeed there were an employment which could not be dispensed with , and which yet tended to degrade such as might be devoted to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the whole race and thus neutralized by extreme division , instead of being laid , as the sole vocation , on one man or a few . Let no human being be broken in spirit , or trodden under foot , for the outward prosperity of the State . So far is manual labor from meriting contempt or slight , that it will probably be found , when united with true means of spiritual culture , to foster a sounder judgment , a keener observation , a more creative imagination , and a purer taste than any other vocation . Man thinks of the few , God of the many ; and the many will be found at length . to have within their reach the roost effectual means of progress " // Dr. Channing next adverts to the fact of the creation of a popular literature , which puts within the reach of the laboring class , at very cheap cost , the means of knowledge in whatever branch they wish to cultivate-books of great value in all departments , mines of inestimable truth open to all who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of the mass of readers , amid all the countless volumes of trash which are issued for the mere purpose of frivolous amusement . He anticipates , too , that literature will continue more and more to adapt itself to this class of readers , as the demand shall increase for the gratification of their intellectual wants . Another circumstance to which he refers is to be found in the juster views the laboring class are beginning to adopt in regard to the education of their children . From his remarks on this point we make the following extracts : " Vastly snore , I believe , is hereafter to be done for children , than ever before , by the gradual spread of a simple truth , almost too simple , one would think , to need exposition , yet up to this day wilfully neglected , namely , that education is a sham , a cheat , unless carried on by able , accomplished teachers . The dignity of the vocation of a teacher is beginning to be understood . The idea is dawning on us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of training the child ; that skill to form the young to energy , truth , and virtue is worth more than the knowledge of all other arts and sciences ; and that of consequence the encouragement of excellent teachers is the first duty which a community owes to itself . I say the truth is dawning ; and it must make its way . The instruction of the children of all classes , especially of the laboring class , has as yet been too generally committed to unprepared , unskilful hands , and of course the school is in general little more than a name . The whole worth of a school lies in the teacher . * * * * " The object of education is not so much to give a certain amount of knowledge , as to awaken the faculties , and give the pupil the use of his own mind ; and one book , taught by a man who knows how to accomplish these ends , is worth more than libraries as usually read . It is not necessary that much should be taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophically , profoundly , livingly . For example , it is not necessary that the pupil be carried over the history of the world from the deluge to the present day . Let him be helped to read a single history wisely , to apply the principles of historical evidence to its statements , to trace the causes and effects of events , to penetrate into the motives of actions , to observe the workings of human nature in what is done and suffered , to judge impartially of action and character , to sympathize with what is noble , to detect the spirit of an age in different forms from our own , to seize the great truths which are wrapped up in details , and to discern a moral Providence , a retribution , amid all corruptions and changes ; let him learn to read a single history thus , and he has learned to read all histories ; he is prepared to study , as he may have time in future life , the whole course of human events : he is better educated by this one book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages as commonly taught . The education of the laborer 's children need never stop for want of books and apparatus . More of them would do good , but enough may be easily obtained . What we want is , a race of teachers acquainted with the philosophy of the mind , gifted men and women , who shall respect human nature in the child , and strive to touch and gently bring out his best powers and sympathies ; and who shall devote themselves to this as the great end of life . This good , I trust , is to come , but it comes slowly . The // 64 On the Elevation of the establishment of normal schools , shows that the want of it begins to be felt . This good requires , that education shall be recognised by the community as its highest interest and duty . It requires , that the instructors of youth shall take precedence of the money-getting classes , and that the woman of fashion shall fall behind the female teacher . It requires , that parents shall sacrifice show and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guides for their children . Not that a great pecuniary compensation is to create good teachers ; these must be formed by individual impulse , by a genuine interst in education ; but good impulse must be seconded by outward circumstances ; and the means of education will always bear a proportion to the respect in which the office of a teacher is held in the community . Happily in this country the true idea of education , of its nature and supreme importance , is silently working and gains ground . Those of us who look back on half a century , see a real , great improvement in schools and in the standard of instruction . What should encourage this movement in this country is , that nothing is wanting here to the intellectual elevation of the laboring class , but that a spring should be given to the child , and that the art of thinking justly and strongly should be formed in early life ; for , this preparation being made , the circumstances of future life will almost of themselves carry on the work of improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , that they are constant stimulants to the intellect ; that they furnish , in rapid succession , quickening subjects of thought and discussion . A whole people at the same moment are moved to reflect , reason , judge , and act on matters of deep and universal concern : and where the capacity of thought has received wise culture , the intellect unconsciously , by an almost irresistible sympathy , is kept perpetually alive . The mind , like the body , depends on the climate it lives in , on the air it breathes ; and the air of freedom is bracing , exhilarating , expanding , to a degree not dreamed of under a despotism . This stimulus of liberty , however , avails little , except where the mind has been trained to think for the acquisition of truth . The unthinking and passionate are hurried by it into ruinous excess . ' * The following is the last of the circumstances to which Dr. Channing adverts . Painful and disheartening as it may appear , the correctness of the picture which he presents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be denied  --  a civilization , as he remarks in another plac&amp; , selfish , mercenary , sensual - standing in direct hostility to the great ideas of Christianity-a civilization which can not , must not , endure for ever . " The last ground of hope for the elevation of the laborer , and the chief and the most sustaining , is the clearer developement of the principles of Christianity . The future influences of this religion are not to be judged from the past . Up to this time it has been made a political engine , and in other ways perverted . But its true spirit , the spirit of brotherhood and freedom , is beginning to be understood , and this will undo the work which opposite principles have been carrying on for ages . Christianity is the only effectual remedy for the fearful evils of modern civilization ; a system which teaches its members to grasp at everything , and to rise above everybody , as the great aims of life . Of such a civilization , the natural fruits are , contempt of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trade , reckless adventure , and commercial convulsions , all tending to impoverish the laborer and to render every condition insecure . Relief is to come , and can only come from the new application of Christian principles , of universal justice , and universal love , to social institutions , to commerce , to business , to active life . This application has begun , and the laborer , above all men , is to feel its happy and exalting influxencgs. " // Such , then , our wise , pure , and eloquent author proceeds " Such are some of the circumstances which inspire hopes of the elevation of the laboring classes . To these might be added other strong grounds of encouragement , to be found in the principles of human nature , in the perfections and providence of God , and in the prophetic intimations of his word . But these I pass over . From all , I derive strong hopes for the mass of men . I do not , can not , see why manual toil and self-improvement may not go on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not attain to refined habits and manners as truly as other men . I do not see why conversation under his humble roof may not be cheered by wit and exalted by intelligence . I do not see why amid his toils he may not cast his eye around him on God 's glorious creation , and be strengthened and refreshed by the sight . I do not see why the great ideas which exalt humanity , those of the Infinite Father , of Perfection , of our nearness to God , and of the purpose of our being , may not grow bright and strong in the laborer 's mind . Society , I trust , is tending toward a condition , in which it will look back with astonishment at the present neglect or perversion of human powers . In the developement of a more enlarged philanthropy , in the diffusion of the Christian spirit of brotherhood , in the recognition of the equal rights of every human being , we have the dawn and promise of a better age , when no man will be deprived of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the evil doctrine , worthy of the arch-fiend , that social order demands the depression of the mass of men , will be rejected with horror and scorn ; when the great object of the community will be to accumulate means and influences for awakening and expanding the best power of all classes ; when far less will be expended on the body and far m.ore on the mind when men of uncommon gifts for the instruction of their race , will be sent forth to carry light and strength into their sphere of human life ; when spacious libraries , collections of the fine arts , cabinets of natural history , and all the institutions by which the people may be refined and ennobled , will be formed and thrown open to all ; and when the toils of life , by a wise intermixture of these higher influences , will be made the instruments of human elevation . " But while expressing these high hopes of the intellectual , moral , religious , social elevation of the laboring class , Dr. Channing does not leave the subject without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which human imperfection casts upon the future-. *. the fearful character of some of the elements which society , like the natural world , holds in its bosom . " It is possible , " he says , " that the laboring classes , by their recklessness , their passionateness , their jealousies of the more prosperous , and their subserviency to parties and political leaders , may turn all their bright prospects into darkness , may blight the hopes which philanthropy now cherishes of a happier and holier social state . " But well assured are we of the groundlessness of this alarm . The direction of flame is upward , when left free to mount ; nor can we doubt the upward tendency of depressed and degraded humanity , in proportion as it is relieved from the weight of the adverse influences beneath which it has been crushed , and as it is left free to the healthy developement of its own native energies . Nor is it by any means to be admitted that the defects here alluded to , as endangering the prospect of their progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , another danger of a more real and serious VOL . VIII . NO . XXXI. - 3ULY , I 840 . E // nature to which our author briefly alludes . " It is also possible , " he remarks , " in this mysterious state of things , that evil may come to them from causes which are thought to promise them nothing but good . The present anxiety and universal desire is to make the country rich , and it is taken for granted that its growing wealth is necessarily to benefit all conditions . But is this consequence sure ? May not a country be rich , and yet great numbers of the people wofully depressed ? In England , the richest nation under heaven , how sad , how degraded the state of agricultural and manufacturing clashes ! It is thought that the institutions of this country give an assurance that growing wealth will here equally benefit and carry forward all portions of the community . I hope so ; but I am not sure . " In this remark Dr. Channing approaches a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great issue now pending between our political parties . Well may he express himself " not sure , " whether the republican freedom of our institutions will enable us to avoid the lamentable state of things to which he alludes as the result of the financial polity which has governed England during the last century , if we shall persevere in an infatuate imitation of the poisonous principles of that fatal system . But even from this most insidious of national dangers , to which the profound sagacity of Pitt looked as an ample antidote against the theoretic democracy of our form of government , even from this we have now no great apprehension . True , the poison is still in our system , vitiating the life-blood of our currency ; and it must take many a year of struggle and agony before the fatal disease of our paper-money banking system can be eradicated , and a state of natural and healthy circulation can be restored . But we are at least fully aware of the disease . The attentio*n of the Democracy has become , and is daily more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and magnitude ; and if an immediate and total cure is not possible , we are at least assured , not only that the disease will not be allowed to proceed farther , but that the course of gradual reform-of recurrence to sound principles of currency and banking-which has now been begun , under the auspices of the Democratic party , will be resolutely persisted in , till it shall result in a radical and permanent cure . The establishment of the policy of the Independent Treasury , so far as relates to the affairs of the Federal Government , is an important step in the direction of this great reform-important not merely in its own value and operation , but also as an index of such a maturity of opinion on the subject as can not stop short at that point of progress . The snake is scotched , if it is not killed ; and with a continuance of the same blessing of God which has thus far crowned with success the high mission of democratic reform in which our party is engaged , it shall ere long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its head to pollute our atmosphere with the foul and fatal poison of its breath . This great object once accomplished , and all is well !
