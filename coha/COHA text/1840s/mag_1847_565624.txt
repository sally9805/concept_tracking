txt IT is one of the auspicious signs of the times that Christian union is so prominently occupying the thoughts , the prayers , and the efforts of God 's children . Never , till our day , has the church awaked , not merely to lament sectarianism , but to put forth a deliberate and general effort to remove its evils . And important progress has been made toward correct views . It has come to be understood that union is not to be based on the neglect or abandonment of conscientious opinions , however peculiar ; that secession from the churches for the sake of union is only increasing the number of sects ; that no sect may reasonably expect that its peculiar tenets will be universally adopted ; that an organization for merging all sects in one , is impracticable , and , even if practicable , dangerous , as a terrific engine of crushing liberty of opinion ; that the abandonment of all creeds , and the disowning of responsibility as to recognizing or denying the Christian character of others , result , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all distinction between the church and the world , Christianity and infidelity ; that , in a // 79 word , we are to seek union without uniformity . But , notwithstanding this advance , our views still remain confused , and our plans crude . This is what might naturally be expected in the beginning of efforts in earnest , to remove an evil which for ages has torn the church . It is certainly no reason for looking coldly on the enlerprize . Rather our only hope is that the energies of Christians , their thoughts , their prayers , their efforts will be expended on the subject , till , by blows , if need be on every side , the crude mass is hammered into shape . It will be taken , then , as the language , not of an enemy , but of a friend to the enterprize , if we express our apprehension that some important elements of success are still overlooked ; and our consequent fears that the present movement , like the minor and local attempts which have preceded it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which already borders on despair of accomplishing any thing for the removal of sectarianism . It seems to us that the plan , which at present interests the Christian community so much , of producing union , while all the denominations retain their peculiarities of creed and organization , and are expected to be conscientious in valuing and defending them , necessarily involves , as human nature is , the continuance of some of the worst evils of sectarianism . A few momeats of consideration will make this evident . If the sects retain their distinct organizations and peculiarities of belief , they will be zealous to propagate them . The language of each will be , " What ! shall not we be in earnest to propagate this great truth , of which our church has for ages been the sole depositary ? * For illustration , take the following resolution copied from the printed minutes of the Franklin Baptist Association of ministers and churches , at their annual meeting at Shelburne Falls , Ms. , in Sept. , 1844 . " Whereas the world is now made almost entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sacred oracles , and whert*as the Am. and F. B. Soc. are engaged in preparing and circulating such versions , therefore , Resolved , that we approve the course pursued by the A. and F. 13 . Soc. , " &amp;c . Here we have the convictions of conscientious men , publicly and solemnly expressed and recorded . We mention it , not ad invidiam , but as the most striking specimel , which happens to occur to us now , of conscientious sectarianism . Will such men , with such convictions of the importance of their peculiarities , be slack in propagating them ? But if one sect propagate its peculiarities as important truths , they will be as conscientiously opposed by others as dangerous errors . The result must be controversy , and , as human nature is , it will be strange if there follow not jealousy , bitterness , and all the horrors of the odium theologicum , which , to the disgrace of religion , has become another name for the bitterest rancor . Another evil attending the existence of sects is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported in a population which might be better served by one , and thus the funds and efforts are consumed which might otherwise be employed among the destitute . Another evil is that attending the collision of sects in their attempts to gain new members . In country places , especially , where , through the almost infinite divisibility of sects , the loss or gain of a single member is a matter of pecuniary importance , every Christian can testify to the evils of proselyting and of sectarian strife . When both the conscience and the purse fall on the same side of the scales , no matter what is on the other , it will surely kick the beam . Again , the distinctive principles // 80 Cause and Cure of Sectarianism. of ' some sects are such as to compel them to unchurch all others . The Baptists can not recognize as churches those sects which do not practice immersion . Episcopalians recognize no church nor ministry but the Episcopal . It is a fact that , with all the love manifest in the late meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other different denominations , not a solitary " Dissenter " was admitted to an Episcopalian pulpit , nor did a single Episcopalian preach in a " Dissenter 's " pulpit . And we have not yet learned that a single Baptist among those who hold to close communion , partook of the Lord 's supper with any of his brethren belonging to other denominations represented in the Alliance . It is reasonable to ask , what sort of union it will be , which will leave peculiarities like these in existence and unrebuked . These and similar evils have always attended the existence of sects , and , if there is any conclusiveness in inductive reasoning , it may be expected they always will . Now there must be some causes , which so uniformly produce , and so steadily perpetuate these evils . Every scheme of union which overlooks these causes , is impracticable . Just here , we apprehend , is the point where the views of union , at present popular , are defective . The principle of union without uniformity , is unquestionably correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all God 's children together , we are not bestowing thought enough on the causes which keep them apart ; and thus are cherishing the chimerical expectation of putting an end to the evils of sectarianism , while the causes producing it are left in full operation . This is like the electrician 's attempting to unite his pithballs , while they remain all positively electrified . The great work , then , remains , to discover and remove the offense of division  --  the evil and unjustifiable causes out of which sectarianism grows . It is easy enough for true Christians of different sects to meet as individuals , expressly declaring that they do not act in behalf of their sect , to shake hands , to lament the evils of schism , and , as they talk together of the things of their common salvation , it is to be expected that their hearts will flow together in love , and their souls be refreshed . There is reason to bless God , that enough of real union remains to make this possible . But all these delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the eulogiums of it , and exhortations to it in the world will not effect it , unless the cause of division is definitely ascertained , distinctly pointed out , and some reasonable measures devised arid adopted for its removal . " Hie labor , hoc opus est . " It is of no use to spend our eloquence in showing how fine it would be to bell the cat , unless the cat be found , and some way of putting on the bell devised . We have had platform eulogiums of union ad nauseam , from men who leave the platform to plunge all over in sectarian strife . It is of no use to pass resolutions bewailing sectarianism , while acting on a principle which implies that there is operating among the sects no sinful cause of division , which needs to be removed before union can be effected . A moral influence for good may go out from the meeting of individuals of different sects in conference . Doubtless such meetings will do much in directing public attention to the subject , in removing prejudice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be removed . This preparation is indispensable , and we rejoice that it is begun . It is the right way to begin . But , then , it is only a work of preparation ; only marshaling the troops and marching them to the field . There remains the great // business afterwards , to " conquer peace . " There is an alternative as to the result of such efforts , regarded in any other light . Either the resuit will he an occasional happy meeting of Christians , in a glow of love , to " stay " each other " with flagons , and comfort " each other " with apples , " while the fires of sectarian controversy remain in full blast ; or it will be , that all the errors of sects will be winked at , and the rule , " first pure , then peaceable , " will , for the sake of union , be in effect blotted out of the Bible . The great work , then , remains ; it is now fairly before the churches ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes of sectarianism . We can not but regard it as one of the most important enterprises claiming the attention of this age of great things . Our Savior prayed that his disciples might be one , that the world might know that God had sent him . Here we are taught the momentous truth , that the oneness of the church is the grand proof of Christ 's divine mission . No wonder that infidelity thrives , and that , under various names , it has well nigh eaten out the piety of some whole states , usurping the name and place of Protestant Christianity . It should be expected , since the dissensions of the church have taken away what Christ considered the grand proof of his divine mission . Let Christian union be restored , union in heart rather than in appearance , and it would go farther to destroy infidelity , than a whole library of evidences of Christianity . And it would remove the greatest obstacle to the conversion of the world . XVho does not fear that it will be the dying hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on heathen ground ? It is a remarkable fact , that the most prominent petition in our Savior 's prayer ( John 17 ) is , that all his disciples may be one showing that in leaving them he felt that here was their greatest danger , here the point most essential to the advancement of his cause . It would seem , then , that we should be more nearly of the same mind with Christ , if we should say , not that Christian union is one of the most important , but that it is preeminently the grand subject which now demands the thoughts , the prayers , and efforts of God 's children . What , then , are the causes of sectarianism and its evils ? We shall not find them in aught that is peculiar to any one sect . This error has blinded us long enough , that we have supposed the causes of division to lie entirely without our own sect . We must learn to search our own tent for the accursed thing which puts Israel to shame . And it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the denominations to-day would not remove it . When two denominations unite to build a meeting-house , or to sustain religious meetings together , the result is usually worse dissension than ever . And if all denominational organizations were abolished to-day , the predisposing causes remaintag ac tive , it would be like the union of confusion at Babel , from which a separation to the four winds must inevitably result . Such a cure of sectarianism would be like curing the patients by tearing down the hospital , and bidding the sick go about their business , as those in health ought to do . We name , in general , as a cause of sectarianism , a departure from the Scriptures , as the only ultimate standard of faith and practice . It is the glory of Protestants that they recognize the Bible as such . Yet we believe it is far from being in fact what it is in theory , and that every sect has departed more or less from the simplicity that is in Christ . It is one of the greatest marvels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the meaning of a book so plain as the word of God . Such // contradictory doctrines are drawn from no other book . We must either yield to the taunt that the Bible is a confused jumble of contradictions , out of which we can make any creed that we please  --  a taunt to which sectarian twisting of the Scriptures has given too much foundation  --  or we must admit that we have perverted or neglected the Bible , or drawn our peculiarities from other sources , and so failed to use it as the only ultimate standard of appeal . We will mention a few particular causes of disunion , more or less closely connected with this general one . 1 . We have put the deductions of philosophy and metaphysics on a level with the teachings of inspiration . All know that a large proportion of the controversies among evangelical Christians , are on points respecting which the Bible gives no explicit decision . There is one class of controversies arising from attempts to explain the modus or rationale of scriptural facts , or to reconcile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaches that God determines all things according to the counsel of his will , yet that men are free and accountable agents ; that it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do , and yet that we work out our own salvation ; that the Word was God , yet became man . The at . tempt to reconcile or explain such facts has occasioned innumerable controversies . One party sinks almost out of sight one side of truth ; another the other . And sects spring up , not perfect bodies " fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , " but overgrown embodiments , each of some one member of the truth . But the only philosophical course is to learn by induction what facts are taught in God 's word , and to believe , though we can not explain them . This is the course pursued by the natural philosopher . There are a hundred facts in natural science , as inexplicable and irreconcilable as any in God 's word . When once we have learned the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in looking at a crystal of quartz , that any other principle is concerned . But when we come to discover the repulsive agency of heat acting on the same atoms , and then discover the action of affinity , and the still more curious phenomena which we refer to the molecular forces , or the different polarities of atoms , all concerned about the same particles and in producing one beautiful crystal , we receive the facts , neither rejecting them nor entering into controversy about them , because we can not explain how these diverse operations are related and harmonized . Every philosopher understands that his province is to learn facts , not to speculate as to how they can be facts . On the same principle , he has no dispute about the fact that the harmony of the solar system results from two opposing tendencies , the centripetal and centrifugal forces . It would be as reasonable that there should be furious controversy on these points , that there should be sects of Cohesionists , Repulsionists , and Molecularists , of Gravitationists and Centrifugalists-names by the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of dogmaticsas that analogous events should take place respecting the teaching of the Bible , that the beauty and harmony of the spiritual world result from facts which we can not reconcile or explain . In the vast school of the universe , mankind are but the infant class , therefore , both in the volume of nature and of revelation . God takes the same course with us , and puts us to learning simple , though often sublime and stupendous facts . We must wait for the growth and instruction , it may be , of ages , before we can take in a circle of knowledge // wide enough to qualify us to see the relations of these facts , or to begin to learn how they come to be facts . As the scientific philosopher goes straight forwards with his facts , though thronged with questions which he can not answer , it is time we had learned in theology , also , our incapacity for these deeper speculations , and the propriety of conducting our inquiries according to the laws of induction , applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been . Theologians have not aimed at a simple induction and classification of scriptural truths . Surrounding the plain doctrines of God 's word with a bristling chevaux-de-frize of their own speculations , they have made religion repulsive , and well nigh inaccessible . They have laid down dogmatic propositions respecting the unknowable , and uttered oracular decrees respecting mysteries into which angels desire to look . Consider , for example , the decrees respecting the eternal generation of the Son of God , concerning which the Fathers laid down that which is to be believed , with a precision , as some one with more wit than godliness has remarked , " quasi ipsi obstetricaverant . " Speculations concerning the mode of the divine existence gave birth to Sabellians , Praxeans , Paulianists . Speculations as to the mode of Christ 's existence gave rise to Docetme ; and so on , through the long list of hard names , which designate the ancient sects . The habits of theological speculation formed before the Baconian era still enslave the church . Aristotle still preaches on Paul 's texts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seems yet to find in theology a Gordian knot . We forget , when we become theologians , that our province here , as in natural science , is to learn facts , not to speculate as to how they can be facts . Therefore controversy abounds . With briars and brambles we hedge around every sweet doctrine of the gospel . Thus has been given no slight occasion for the sneer , that " divinity is the science of the incomprehensible , the revelation of the unrevealable ; this is the field in which dignified divines are great , deep , profound , because here nobody can contradict them . " And , as another result , infidels , seeing the church so full of strife about dogmas , have seized the enterprizes of philanthropy which Christianity has originated , and driving Jehu-like , are crying , " See our zeal for good , " while they sneer at the church , for splitting hairs over a groaning world ;  --  a most crafty and dangerous assault ; for while they turn the enterprizes of Christianity against the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , they are setting the world on fire , and , if the church seize not again the reins , are likely to blot the light of piety from the earth . It is time theology had made clean riddance of such unphilosophical philosophizing , and returned to the pure milk of the word . Before the Baconian philosophy had become predominant , natural science was the arena of interminable controversy . There were the Ptolemaics and the Braheans , the Cartesian vortices , the Aristotelian plenum , and the Epicurean atoms . But after the philosophy of induction was thoroughly established , these controversies vanished , like cobwebs before a broom , and the whole scientific world rests in a substantial agreement as to facts . Let scientific men return to their former speculations , and how long before the inane controversies of the dark ages would return ? And , on the other hand , let theologians return to a simple induction of truths from the Bible , and how long before some of our worst controversies would cease ? Again : we have deptirted from God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachings the deductions of metaphysics . Here belong a large part of the controversies respecting the will , the law of motives , whether the influences of the Spirit are mediate or immediate , respecting the moral condition of infants , the theories of moral philosophy , and the like . Controversialists are , indeed , in the habit of arraying particular texts as arguments on these points . But it is plain that these texts , extracted from letters , poems , narratives , were never uttered with any reference to a metaphysical theory . We may cite , as a distinguished illustration , the text in Psalm 110 : " Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power , " which has been a hundred times quoted in support of some metaphysical theory of the will . It were about as conclusive to quote some of the prophecies respecting the heavens being fire and vapor of smoke , in proof of the nebular hypothesis of Laplace . From the days when the Gnostics and New Platonists began to interweave their philosophical dogmas with the Bible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how large a portion of religious dissensions have turned on the pure deductions of metaphysics . We deny not the importance of metaphysics . We value mental and moral philosophy . We are willing that men should study this science and discuss its truths . What we protest against is , that the conclusions of human philosophy should be put on a level with the teachings of the Bible , and debated as part and parcel of Christianity . There may be truth , important truth , on one side of these discussions , and error on the other . But we wrong our brother if we compel him to receive that truth as a truth of Christianity . We wrong Christianity , if we lay this truth on her , and make her responsible for its safe-keeping . For example , what a melee of contradictory theories is found among the writers on moral philosophy . Must Christianity be made responsible for all the opinions of doctors of morals ? Must she wait till the true theory of man 's moral nature is settled ? No . Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions ; her progress need not be delayed a moment for their settlement . And we affirm the same of every opinion which is based on metaphysics and not on the Bible . Christianity is not responsible for such opinions , nor interested in such discussions , otherwise than in the discussion , could it be revived , between the Copernicans and the Ptolemaics , or in any theory of natural science . The one belongs to the science of matter , the other to the science of mind ; neither to Christianity . To make Christianity responsible for such opinions , to rest her credit on them , is simply acting over the bigotry of the Pope , when be imprisoned Galileo for his astronomical tenets . Scientific discoveries , either in the material or the mental world , may be successfully used as handmaids to religion , in refuting objections , in illustrating and confirming its doctrines . But it is downright bigotry to make our opinions in either one science or the other , the measure of Christian belief , or the symbol of ecclesiastical parties . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make the Bible , the whole Bible , and nothing but the Bible , the measure of Christianity , all the large class of controversies of which we have been speaking , while they may continue as important matters in science , will cease to interrupt the peaceful union of the church . 2 . Unscriptural tests of church membership are a fruitful cause of sectarianism . The common practice of evangelical churches , in admitting to membership only such as they consider regenerate persons , is approved by God in his word . The // 18th chap . of Matt. , and various passages in the epistles , * confer on the church the right , and impose on them the duty , of withdrawing fellowship from those who walk disorderly . This implies a church organization , and a responsibility as to admitting members to fellowship . They who would throw this responsibility on every individual , to act his own pleasure , adopt a system incompatible with these inspired directions . It is a method of destroying dissensions by destroying the church ; and reminds us of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill the fly that rested on his sleeping master 's face , struck a blow which destroyed the fly and the man together . The Bible lays down this rule to guide us in receiving others to our fellowship : " Receive ye one another as Christ hath received us . " Accordingly , the reason given for the command , " Him that is weak in the faith receive ye , but not to doubtful disputations , " is , " For God hath received him . " The principle of church fellowship is , therefore , to receive every true disciple of Christ , and no others . Imperfect as every thing is on earth , we can not expect that this principle will be exactly carried out . Still it should guide us ; it should be our aim to have in the visible church all that belong to the spiritual church , and no others . Christian union can be nothing else but the union of Christians . It can not be denied that the sects have set up other tests than this . Here we speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the like , by which whole classes of the community are shut out from the Lord 's table . Every individual must he judged on his own merits . If he bears fruit , be it slaveholding or aught else , which convinces us that he is not a disciple of Christ , we Titus3 : 10. 2Thess.3 : 6,14. 2 John , 10 , &amp;c. have no alternative ; we must reject him . If we believe that he is a new creature in Christ , however imperfect , we must not exclude him , " for God hath received him . " We have no right to turn the Lord 's table into a guillotine , and point to it in terrorem to compel those whom we acknowledge as brethren to adopt our views , But tests like these are a small part of the evil . We fear there are more or less of unscriptural tests in every creed in Christendom . The fact that we adopt at all the doctrinal basis of fellowship , instead of the simple basis of Christian character , is an innovation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years have felt that , under the circumstances in which the church has been placed , doctrinal creeds have been necessary as a means of making the scriptural test effectual . We dispute not their judgment . But we allow such creeds only as a necessary evil , and rejoice in anticipating the time , when , in the progress of truth and Christian fellowship , they may wax old and vanish away . It is delightful to know that some of the most far-seeing minds in Europe and America are joyously anticipating this result . The church has existed in a state in which there was no occasion for doctrinal creeds . This was the state of the primitive church . It was the state of many of the New England churches in the first period of their history . This shows that it is not chimerical to hope for the like again . But while we admit the expediency of doctrinal creeds at present , we affirm that they have been used in an unscriptural way , and thus have been fruitful sources of division . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being made subordinate to the scriptural test , Christian character . They can properly be used only as helps in // determining the Christian character of those who seek fellowship with us . Prepared and used for this end , they are safe and desirable , and constitute no occasion for disunion among Christians . Again , we have unwarrantably inserted in our creeds scriptural doctrines , as we regard them , the belief of which is confessedly not a test of Christian character . The unity of Christians demands oneness of sentiment only so far as new creatures in Christ must he one in sentiment . Beyond this it leaves oneness of sentiment to be brought about by the kindly influences of fraternal intercourse and discussion , or diversity to remain perpetual as the necessary consequence of diverse education , temperament , and points of view . Far be it from us to represent any doctrine of the Bible as unimportant . If the distinguished botanist , Prof. Dewey , receives the thanks of the scientific for making a single genus , the Carex , the subject of study for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven years study to the microscopic cryptogamia , found in mould and the greenness of stagnant ponds , how much more must we admit the importance of examining with the most patient care , the minutest points in God 's word . But when deciding the question of fellowship , we must receive one another as Christ bath received us . If we crowd into our creed the minutfre of revelation , and compel our brother either to subscribe to it , or be shut out of the visible church , we do him wrong , and are guilty of causing schism in the church . Are we not all alike freemen of the Lord ? Are we not fello*v-citizens with the saints and of the household of God ? And shall we not be admitted to the rights of freemen and citizens in the king . dom of our common Lord ? Shall we be denied our household rights by other children in the family of our common Father ? We hold that Christian fellowship is one of the rights which every Christian is justified in demanding . No union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every sect , therefore , which unchurches the other sects by wholesale , or drives from its communion the acknowledged followers of Christ , is usurping authority in God 's kingdom and family , is trampling on the rights of Christ 's freemen , and is guilty of the sin of schism in the church . This is true in a measure , though we only exclude our brother from our particular church , leaving him free to join other sects , recognizing the body with which he unites as a church , conceding to them our fellowship , and thus leaving a basis for real Christian union . But emphatically is it true , if we refuse to recognize our brethren as belonging at all to the church of Christ . Whoever believes that the Episcopal or any other specific organization , that immersion or any other mode of administering the ordinances of the church , is essential to the being of a church , holds a principle which makes Christian union an impossibility . This principle has always been one of the most prominent causes of intolerance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant , in Episcopalian , Presbyterian , or Independent , it can be expected to result in nothing but bigoted sectarianism . Christians may differ as to what forms of organization and rites are most nearly conformed to the scriptural standard , and yet receive each other to fellowship . But we think Christian union is impossible , unless Christians will recognize as one branch of the visible church every body of true believers statedly united for the purposes of Christian communion and edification , in the use of the ordinances and means of grace , however erroneous their constitution may be regarded . Again , we depart from the scriptural standard , and make our creeds causes of division , when we insert // der which it seemed at first that they were buried out of sight forever . But they crawled out . And though the mountain stands , and no man can move it , it does not appear at present that any of his opponents are under it . They are as numerous and as busy as ever . Less notable victories of a similar kind may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , constrain us to say , that polemical theology has not established principles on one side or the other , has not reclaimed errorists , but has widened the breach and inflamed the animosity between the parties , and confirmed both in their respective opinions . is it said , " We must defend what we regard as important truths , and resist error . " True . But facts show , that controversy , as it has actually been conducted , fails to accomplish this end . Is it said , " controversy elicits light , though it fails to convince the errorist ? " So does a burning house ; but would one set his house on fire to show his neighbor the way home ? And shall we keep the church in a blaze simply to elicit light , which after all , the wanderer always uses to guide himself farther astray ? Verily there is a more excellent way . There has been that which is utterly unchristian and unjustifiable in past controversies among brethren . It is time we were removing the wrong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking , as certainly there is to be found , a more excellent way of proving all things and holding fast that which is good . As to a vast amount of the polemics which has found its way into the pulpit and the press , both laziness and ambition have perhaps had more influence than the authors suppose . If a man would prepare a sermon in them those articles of belief , which , as we have already remarked , are deductions , not from the Scriptures , but from philosophy and metaphysics . Great and good men , according to the wisdom of their day , have made creeds , embracing minutely the particulars of theological doctrine ; these have done , and , in their proper place , are still doing good ; and the names of their authors will be held in perpetual veneration . But if such creeds were intended as tests of church fellowship , we must wonder at the hardihood of their authors in attempting to bind in their own thoughts and language the religious sentiments of generations yet unborn , and petrify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us rather cling to God 's word . And as to the danger of error , if the eternal barriers of truth erected by God himself fail to keep out the enemy that cometh in like a flood , can we expect our frail ramparts to do it better ? Shall we build mud dikes , for fear that God 's rock-bound shore will not restrain the ocean ? 3 . Theological controversy is a cause which perpetuates disunion . We speak of controversy , not as it may be , but as it has been-appropri. ately styled polemics ,  --  and which is far enough from being the " excellent oil that shall not break the head . " Many topics , about which the church was once in a blaze of controversy , are now confessedly unimportant , and have sunk out of notice as much as the controversy once seriously and earnestly prosecuted in Papist seminaries , whether the devils understand Latin . Other questions come round in ceaseless revolution , and one generation carries through , with all the freshness of novelty the same controversy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suljects , with the same arguments qwq an opponent on some controverted point , than to preach on some plain principle of the Gospel so as to equally fix the attention . Controversy has been , therefore , to a great extent a gladiatorship , in which the combatants are exhilarated and stimulated by the shouts of the admiring amphitheatre . We must say , also , that both the spirit and the end of theological controversy have been too commonly wrong . The spirit has been that of enemies , not of brethren ; the end has been victory for a party , not , with childish simplicity , to discover the truth . Consequently controversialists seldom understand each other , they caricature each other 's sentiments , and charge each other with opinions at which each in turn shudders . The result is bitterness and enmity . We may exemplify this by referring to the controversy between Wesley and Toplady , and their coadjutors . It is hard to say which party most caricatured the other , or which exhibited the most unchristian and deplorable bitterness . On both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and misapprehension remains . Many a time have we exclaimed , and we are afraid not always with the proper temperature of Christian sorrow and love , " When did an Arminian ever represent correctly the Calvinistic creed ? " And we suppose , though our position does not qualify us to feel it as our opponents do , Arminians have probably often asked with equal sincerity , " When did a Calvinist ever correctly represent the Arminian creed ? " We select this controversy simply as an illustration of what is true of many others . We are aware that we touch on sore places here . But we choose to do so , that we may find out where the sore is , and may see in what unbrotherly misrepresentations , in what galling attacks we have reciprocally indulged . Another result of the sectarian spirit and ends in controversy , through which it becomes a cause of division , is , distorted and onesided views of scripture . Parts of the Bible are picked out and the changes rung on them through the pulpit and the press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach a sermon on any text , but election makes the body of it , and inability the inferences . Another , though he announces as his text , " Without me ye can do nothing , " fails not to make it his main object to show the free agency and ability of man . One class are almost offended if you read in their hearing the ninth chapter of Romans . Another seem to regard this as the quintessence of the Gospel , and show a peculiar sensitiveness when the text is announced , " Make you a new heart . " We all know that there are the Calvinistic texts , the Arminian texts , the Baptist texts . Thus the Bible is split to match the fissures in the church . Thus the tree of knowledge is chopped into kindling wood to feed the fires of strife . We have a memorable instance of this one-sided dependence on isolated texts , in the controversy at Marbury , between Luther and Zuingle , and their coadjutors . The controversy began with the declaration , " If the Swiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lost "  - -  an explicit avowal of the principle which has silently controlled a multitude of controversies , and which reminds us of the man who would not look through Galileo 's telescope , for fear he should be obliged to believe the astronomer 's statements . Luther 's whole mind was occupied , in the discussion , with a single text , " This is my body . " He chalked it on the velvet table-cloth . And when the most convincing arguments were urged against him , he had no retource but to hold up the cloth , with the text on it , before the eyes of his opponents . Thus fell that great man , // entangled in the meshes of sectarian controversy . It is a gloomy illustration of what such controversy has always been , showing how it preoccupies the mind with a dogma , dictates to the Bible its meaning , and cramps the thoughts to isolated and favorite texts . Once let it get the mastery , and it dooms the noblest intellect to go round and round , like a cider-mill horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweetest fruit of the tree of knowledge nothing but the bitter waters of strife  --  the very vinurn da*monum-at first exhilarating , then maddening , then deadly . The remark so often made of late , that the differences among Christians are trifling , com pared with the points in which they agree , is founded in truth . That sect in our country , whose peculiarity consists in wearing hooks and eyes instead of buttons , the Scotch covenanters in Vermont , who receive to fellowship none but such as retain the old Scotch version of the Psalms and sing them by lining , and subscribe to the league and covenant just as it was in Cromwell 's days , have peculiarities which seem to us sufficiently trifling . Yet it may be that the angels regard in a similar light all our peculiarities , when compared with the work of saving the world from sin . Though really important , yet , like the differentials in Calculus , they are of no account by the side of the infinite . Yet there are real differences . The attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shall we , then , supinely neglect to prevent the spread of what we regard as important error ? No . Discussion there must be . But let us , in the first place , abandon all questions about the unknowable , and dismiss to the sphere of scientific investigation all the points which belong to metaphysics , in distinction from revelation . Then , if a brother embrace what we regard as an erroneous interpretation of the scriptures , let us concede to him all the rights of a Christian brother . Let us then sit down , as it were , by his si de , and try to find out precisely what he believes , and what peculiar circumstances have led to his thus believing , so that we may look at the subject from his point of view .

If the parties still differ , let them continue side by side , each feeling his own liability to error , each anxious to learn the exact sense of the Bible , each , with the teachableness of a child , looking earnestly to God for light . Some differences respecting the meaning of God 's word , many differences on other points , might still remain ; yet we could differ in love . But let the course above indicated be pursued , and the time would soon come when our differences respecting the simple doctrines of the Bible would be few and microscopic , compared with what they now are .

If the spirit of true@@184069632.txt prayer should pervade all religious discussions , they would tend to union , not to strife . We have not professed , in the preceding remarks , to name all the causes of sectarianism . Especially we have said nothing of that causa causarum in this matter , the low state of piety . Yet we are convinced that the thoughts of Christians must be turned in the direction we have indicated , that the church must address herself in earnest to the work of discovering and removing the causes of disagreement , and must return to the simplicity that is in Christ , if our desires for Christian union are ever to be realized . S. II . THE IMPRESSIVENESS OF PREACHING . A WRITER in the Edinburgh Re . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulpit Eloquence , by observing , as a surprising fact , which was worthy of explanation , that so large a class of men as the clergy of Scotland , of average talent , and all regularly educated , having access to the people one day in seven under favorable circumstances , and dwelling on the most important and affecting topics of human thought and feeling , do yet produce comparatively few discourses that have any considerable permanent intet'est for the public mind . In this statement , the Scotch clergy were regarded as only examples of the clergy generally wherever their position is the most favorable to efficiency and success . The writer proceeded to account for the fact asserted , partly from the want of directness in the prevailing manner of presenting religious truth ; or of that quality which disting*Ashes addresses from essays and disquisitions , and of which he named Latimer , South and Baxter , as eminent examples . The supposed fact , with some of the reasons for it , will be the subject of consideration in the present article . That discourses from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjects , the occasion , and the qualifications of the preachers might lead one to expect , we are not disposed to deny . Leav ing out of view those persons to whom all religious doctrine , and even all sober thought are repulsive , whose indifference or dislike to preaching of course needs no other explanation ; it must be acknowledged that better disposed hearers often find but a sorry entertainment in discourses which yet are every way respectable . A sermon is too often expected to be dull , as having proved so on repeated trials . it is a kind of composition characterized , in the popular view , by excessive staidness and uniformity . In matter , language and delivery , it is supposed to be set apart from other public addresses as less exciting , if not less useful . It is expected to deserve or demand careful attention , rather than to exhibit or awaken spontaneous emotion . If an oration is heavy , " prosy " or tedious , it is sometimes compared to a sermon , as if the latter were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part , the contrast in one of Burns ' pieces , when he says : " Perhaps it may turn out a sang , Perhaps turn out a sermon . " The published discourses of able preachers are not , in general , favorite reading , except with the most disciplined and serious minds . All this may be admitted . Yet to us it seems by no means unaccountable nor does it raise any imputation // against the clergy , as if they were unjust to their vocation . That kind of interest which they fail to awaken , could not fairly be expected from their efforts , even if they were superior to other men in natural ability . Some of the very reasons given by the writer we have citcd , why such an effect should be produced , rather forbid than authorize the expectation . lie falls into the common error of demanding too much effect from an ordinary sermon ; not more than the importance of the subject presented may be supposed to warrant , but more than the known facts of human nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is true that the doctrines of the Bible are of the sublimest character , and of infinite moment to all who hear them ; yet the human mind is not commonly moved according to the intrinsic magnitude or importance of the objects contemplated , but on the contrary , is excited rather by the nearness or the novelty of inferior things . The preacher has frequent open access to the people , even one day in seven given up to his use but again , the human mind is not most intensely affected by those appeals to which it is most accustomed . Nor is the preacher , of course , in every respect aided by the sacredness of the time and place . nor by the hallowed associations of his office and work ; for these influences , however salutary on the whole , are favorable rather to solemnity and thoughtfulness , than to more lively and positive emotions . It is the natural effect of these circumstances , and the tendency of the truths inculcated , to soften and overawe , instead of vividly exciting the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise would stimulate their passions , is generally found to be modified in its resultsand legitimately , too-by a certain chastening or restraining influence which belongs to the sanctuary and the gospel . In fine , we apply to this subject some of the recognized laws of the human mind ,  --  that the objects with which we are familiar , presented in the manner to which we are accustomed , do not affect our feelings like an extraordinary exhibition ; that the frequent and regular inculcation of the same truths , while it strengthens their hold of our convictions and habits , at the same time irn pairs the vivacity of their immediate impression ; and that the element of sacredness in religious teaching , operates not so much on what are called sensible emotions , as on our deeper and more abiding sentiments . But another fact in human character must be brought into the account . The depiavity of mankind , besides making some hearers bitterly hostile , renders a greater number stupidly insensible to the truth . Their moral affections give their thoughts an undue bias toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that these last do not get that earnest attention which otherwise they could not fail to receive from rational creatures . The doctrines of the Bible may have all conceivable excellence , so as to be contemplated with the deepest interest by holy beings , and yet , when addressed by the preacher to sinful men , may be scarcely apprehended , arid ' may even be reckoned foolishness . ' Men do not listen to what is said of the character and government of God , as they would if they were his loyal subjects , nor gaze upon the beauty of holiness as if their own hearts reflected its image* They do riot show that truly rational curiosity which the angels are said to feel in the work of redemption . rphe mercy of God in the gift of his Son , is the most wonderful and moving of all themes , but it may seem only as a thrice told tale , to those who are dead in sins. * Even with such a message , th eservant of God can not of himself // create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are enough to show the mistake of those who demand too much from the preaching of the Gospel . They regard it abstractly , or apart from certain known facts in the nature and character of man ; and hence , they wonder that it does not produce effects commensurate with the intrinsic dignity of the Gospel itself . Certainly able and educated ministers may discourse judiciously and faithfully to the same people every Lord 's day , without inspiring that interest which the great doctrines they proclaim ought to awaken . The deficiency thus admitted and explained , lies in that kind of interest which we conceive to be not the most important . rPliere is another sort of interest which is awakened more generally , and in a higher degree , by the preaching of the Gospel . It is not the charm of novelty , nor the indulgence of curiosity , nor physical excitement , nor the lively play of fancy or passion ; hut rather a sober , thoughtful regard , comparatively calm or unimpassioned , habitual , abiding . In these respects it resembles the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are constantly conversant in common life , as in domestic intercourse , friendship , and business . This we conceive to be a legitimate effect of preaching , because it is itself among the affairs of common life-not an extraordinary occurrence , but something to which we are accustomed . The measure of such interest felt by the popular mind , may be learned from the deliberate estimate put upon the object , the attention and thought bestowed on it , the efforts made to obtain and preserve it , and the sense of loss occasioned by its absence . If now we consider the regular attendance in our churches , the amount of thought given to the subjects presented , the sums expended on houses of worship and in the support of ministers , and the unwillingness of almost every settled community to remain without such means of instruction , we find that the people at large do in fact set a high value on the preaching of the Gospel , though not all which it deserves ; that it holds a high place in the public mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We believe that in the long run , sermons are more interesting to the people generally , than any other exercises with which they can be properly compared . Common as they are , and notwithstanding their imperfections , they are more interestingoften even in that sense in which we have noted their deficiencythan other kinds of popular lectures , orations , or speeches . If we hear a church bell in a strange town , and ask what is to take place , we prefer to have it public worship and a sermon , ' rather than a conference , ' or a missionary , or temperance , or anti-slavery meeting ; and so far as we know , the people are generally of the same mind . It is easier to collect an audience for a sermon , than for statements and addresses even from returned missionaries . The Lord 's day is more refreshing and satisfactory to the mass of Christian people , though it returns fifty-two times every year , than the anniversary week ' in New York after it ceases to be new . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attempted except after long intervals , and mass-meetings are associated in the remembrance with din , fatigue , and headache , at least as much as with the thrilling eloquence ' of their harangues . The debates in Congress are generally listened to only by reporters and strangers . All these things , with occasional exceptions , depend on novelty or accident for their whole interest . Ordinarily they become flat by familiarity . Arguments at the bar obtain a more respectful attention , // but generally within a limited circle of official or occasional hearers , nor are they heard every week . Even the entertainments of the theater and the opera pall with repetition , requiring the aid of some rare performer or novel device to secure the attendance of their avowed patrons . It is evident that in comparison with these public occasions , the people at large feel more interest in the preaching of the Gospel . From week to week the greater part of them are found in some house of God , preferring to be there , and generally not inattentive to whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . He is so accustomed to see a calm intelligent regard prevading the face of the mixed assembly before him and answering to his appeals , that he notes its absence whenever it is wanting . Nor is that regard weakened but rather increased when they have heard a thousand discourses from the same lips . From youth to old age , the habit of attention is perpetuated and strengthened . All this is a common fact , at least in those parts of our own country with which we are best acquainted. * And it seems to us a fact well worthy of consideration . It shows that preaching is an institution adapted to the popular mind , in all stages of * The condition of things may be less favorable in this respect-we might reasonably expect it would be-in those countries where the people have no part in the selection of their religious teachers . The voluntary system ' probably makes more attentive congregations. - And the interest awakened by l ) reacllirlg may not answer to our description in those churches where a frigid morality is substituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of his Essays , draws a picture of a listless audience under a listless preacher , in a snow-storm , as a specitnen of congregati ens generally at this day ; but most evidently he found the original in the only religious assemblies with which he had been conversant as a Unitarian minister . His representation of the audience is glaringly untrue to common orthodox congregations . cultivation , and more particularly that it does not wear *out by use , like the means contrived anew from time to time for temporary effect . It shows the wisdom of the Author of Christianity , in making popular instruction the chief function of his ministers , which was never true to the same extent of any false religion . And it shows also the folly of those nominal ministers of Christ , who would dispense with the work of preaching , or reduce it to a secondary place , in order that the people may be attracted by scenic show , or overawed by mystic rites . As we do not charge it to the incapacity or negligence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression which some might expect from the importance of their topics , neither do we ascribe their impressiveness , in comparison with other forms of popular address , to any superior merit on the part of the clergy . We only maintain that sermons produce that effect , in kind and degree , which the nature of things justifies us in expecting , if we suppose the preachers to have the ability along with the imperfections of other men . Nor shall we be understood to say that the work of preaching is performed as well as it ought to be performed . On the contrary we hold that it may be rendered far more efficient , and , in every sense of the word , more interesting . As it has been said that every man is a debtor to his profession , so ministers owe it to their calling that with ripened experience and observation they should perfect themselves in the composition and delivery of sermons . We propose now to point out some of the less obvious faults which detract from the interest felt by intelligent hearers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general law of eloquence , that he who would affect others must himself be affected in like manner : according to the classical saying , " If // you wish me to weep , you must weep yourself . " The hearer 's interest naturally depends much upon the speaker 's . Nor is it enough that the preacher is intellectually excited by his subject , and by the action of his own mind : he must be religiously intent upon the truths he utters , or earnestly persuaded , as well as fully convinced . Hence the vital advantage of deep and fervent piety to the impressiveness of his discourses ; and hence the advantage , in preparing them , of those spiritual exercises by which his heart is brought into closer contact with the truths contemplated , and by which he may obtain divine aid suited to the occasion . Religious languor , betraying itself inevitably , detracts more , per . haps , than any other cause from efficiency in the pulpit . This point is often urged on the attention of young ministers , who are apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it is not urged too often , as every maturer judgment will allow . Yet , our design now is not to dwell on those gene . ral imperfections , whether of piety , learning , or discipline , which always suggest themselves in this connection ; but rather on some of those particular faults which are more likely to escape detection , and yet often interfere with the happiest irnmed iate effect of preaching . The want of directness , alledged by the reviewer we have referred to , is undoubtedly a frequent fault in sermons . But we do not mean what some appear to understand by this term . Directness ddes not consist in using the second person of the personal pronoun instead of the third - you for he , and ye for they . The text , " The way of transgressors is hard , " is not , of course , improved by saying , " Your way , ye transgressors , is hard . " This practice some preachers , under the notion of directness , have carried into affectation and a fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a whole discourse , and does not naturally prevail in the unimpassioned parts . By directness , we mean the evident bearing of what is said upon the hearers . it is that quality which , according to Lord Bacon 's phrase , comes home to men 's business and bosoms . It presents the truth in such a manner as to show its relation to their condition , interest , and conduct . It makes a doctrinal sermon practical , in the proper sense of this word ,  --  for practical sermons are such , not as distinguished from doctrinal , but as distinguished from abstruse or speculative , or dry disquisitions , which have no bearing on the practice of duty . There are sermons , which might as well be preached in the moon as on the earth , even if the moon is not inhabited . No hearer feels himself concerned in them . They are not for the audience ; and whom or what they are for , the preacher only knows . Doubtless , a proper sermon is not only about some truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not more formally , it is directed to them . So far as such a quality is wanting , they do not take the truth to themselves , nor can it make any considerable impression . It is this deficiency that renders many doctrinal sermons , as they are called , dry or uninteresting , however sublime or awful may be their subjects . Irreligious men have been known to hear unmoved the strongest propositions and reasonings on predestination and depravity , yet to stir themselves , as if parrying a blow , when the same preacher discoursed of paying debts . Every theme appropriate to the pulpit , is susceptible of such a use as shall engage the attention of the common people . Such a use will show its direct bearing on themselves , instead of leaving them to feel after an application often neither obvious nor desired . The impressiveness of preaching is often impaired by exaggerated or // unqual*fled statements and descriptions . Ministers are no more prone to such errors than any other public speakers , except as they are under a temptation not common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take advantage of the least inaccuracy . For this very reason , indeed , as well as from conscientious regard for the invisible Judge , many ministers require of themselves a more rigid fairness and exactness in the positions they take and the arguments they employnot venturing upon the liberty which might be safely used against a common opponent ; just as a man of singular uprightness is likely to do injustice to himself or to his friend , in determining a question which exposes his judgment to a selfish bins . Still , it is no wonder , if , with the advantage of their position , and being often required to discuss great subjects with little time for preparation , they do sometimes fall into habits of rhetorical extravagance . The danger is the greater , because this very quality of composition is found to excite and attract a certain class of minds , both among ministers and laymen . It affects them as a species of eloquence , and they reckon it a merit , not a fault . They delight in confusion rather than in discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to qualify a statement is to weaken its force . In descriptions of character and life , they would use only the most vivid colors , and bring every fig*ire into bold relief . Such a tendency is common , under the want of intellectual discipline , and education does not always subdue it . Even when it is not congenial with the taste of the preacher , he may , in a measure , adapt himself to it , under the notion of being " all things to all men . " If the only effect of exaggeration were to arouse attention , it might be overlooked , though it could not be justified . But besides repelling the more judicious , it produces in other minds more or less of reaction after the temporary excitement of fancy or of passion . It is one of those expedients , by which , however it may at first serve a purpose , more is ultimately lost than gained . It tends to sear the susceptibility of an audience , to lower their confidence in the l ) reacher 's sincerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might otherwise feel in his ministrations . Such an effect may be observed in the criticism sometimes passed even upon an eloquent preacher : " I have heard him too much to be affected by him ; " or , " I always have to make too much allowance for what he says . " Our readers may recognize the habit of which we complain , in the conversation of some persons who are not wanting in general ability or information ; and they can trace it for themselves in the various departments of the preacher 's work . It is felt in the unguarded interpretation of the scriptures ; as when disjointed fragments of inspired language are employed for purposes utterly foreign to their connection , till discerning hearers grow weary of " scripture proofs . " in like manner , Christian doctrines may be one after another detached from their mutual relations , and held forth independently , till the mind ceases to repose in their harmony , and wanders unsettled as through a s uccession of errors . We have heard a whole sermon on retributive justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any redemptive or gracious system ; and if , in order to make a more distinct impression , every truth were thus inculcated , we are sure it would affect us either as an error , or not at all. * So , when the * The death of believers is apt to be treated as if there remained no consummation oCtheir happiness in the resurrection of the body ; and then , again , the resurrection , as if it would awake their spirits from an unconscious sleep . // preacher appears to regard the par . ticular subject before him , whatever it may be , as if there were no other , and each in its turn is found to have the same exclusive importance , the hearers at length recoil with distrust , and are in danger of opposing an impartial indifference to partial zeal . In his representations of human depravity , he may seem to conceive only of sin in general , or of every sinner as only like every other , and yet too inhuman to be recognized by any man as like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description were not dull . In delineating Christian character , there may be the same want of discrimination . When the preacher would distinguish the marks of true piety , he may overlook all degrees of strength or maturity , unconsciously aiming to enhance its worth , till his hearers find nothing answering to his description , unless in favorite pieces of biography , or in their notion of angels . He is , of course , understood to regard himself and some of the people about him as Christians , yet others can not recognize either in him or in the church the original of the overcharged pictures presented in his sermons ; and hence , they think of Christian character as a beautiful conception , scarcely if ever realized ; an attainment too rare to be sought after-possibly chimerical . Thus , the representations by which he aims only to recommend piety , may indirectly abate the force of his appeals , for the want of discrimination between the reality and the strength of the principle. * On the * It has been made a question whether a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has no right , in his preaching , to set up qualifications which he does not possess as essentisi to the character of a Christian , while still he professes that character ; but certainly he may describe attainments higher than his own-for example , Paul 's , as learned from the scriptures . He is at liberty , and he ought to refer his hearers to a standard above himself . other hand , when it is remarked of a preacher , " He may be depended on ; " " he means just what he says ; " " we know where to find him " - we think it indicates high merit . He is one of whom his hearers do not tire ; whose discourses accumulate for themselves influence , and rather gain than lose , by time , the best kind of impressiveness . That preaching  - -  whether it be exposition , argument , description , or exhortationwhich is considerate rather than hasty , discriminating rather than hyperbolical , is for that reason the most likely to have a permanent interest for the public mind . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the want of freedom and variety in their structure . A sound mind will not work without method ; even the most eccentric genius has " method in its madness . " Every species of composition has its own laws , and we would not have preaching less methodical , or more desultory than it is . But there may be great diversity in the structure of sermons , as every homiletic treatise shows . They are legitimately of many kinds , generic and specific , each having a fit structure of its own . The same materials allow of endless variety in their combination . The principles of arrangement are as various as the laws of association and the relations of things . Every point in the whole sphere of Christian doctrine may be approached from every other , and in each succeeding instance , will appear in a different light . We see no reason why a sermon does not admit of as much freedom in the plan or arrangement , as any kind of oration , whether ancient or modern . It is , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every order and style of literary architecture that ought to be employed , whether in the Lyceum or in Congress , or at the bar or in popular assemblies // Yet ministers are themselves aware of the fact , that commonly they do not use this freedom . It must seem to them the more desirable , because they are compelled so often to renew the work of composition on the same or similar topics ; yet that very necessity tempts them to move in a narrower range of method . In all kinds of work , one easily falls into the habit of doing that which must be done , often in the same way . Hence , the preacher is exposed to a " fatal facility " in the customary arrangement of his thoughts . In a long series of discourses , it is not surprising if he imitates himself . But such a uniformity , though easily accounted for , can not be thought desirable ; nor is it necessary , for it is , in fact , avoided by those who take pains to avoid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformity often observed between different ministers of the same school , or in the same neighborhood , when they follow some leading mind , as well in the structure of their sermons as in the structure of their theology . At one time , if a preacher maintained that God is the immediate author of all human volitions , the last half of his sermon was usually a bundle of inferences from the first , under the name of " Improvement . " * We have heard of a district , where the preachers usually presented every subject under three heads . There has been a more general uniformity in the plan of ending every sermon with a series of paragraphs , entitled sometimes " Inferences , " sometimes " Brief Remarks ; " and when the first or second has just left an im * Dr. Emmons appears to have been as tenacious of the method as of the matter ofhis discourses , and in both had faithful disciples . But we understand that he usually occlpied the whole sabbath with one sermon , each part about half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at times " coming down like a smart shower . " Prof* . Park 's article , prefixed to his works , is an admirable sketch of a rare man . pression powerful enough for a conclusion , the hearers still find themselves called off by a " thirdly , " or " fourthly , " as if nothing must be left unsaid . Some preachers always reserve their " application " to the end , as if there could be no such thing as " a running application , " even in a practical discourse . And some will never draw instructions directly from a text , but only from a proposition first raised upon it , or drawn out of it . In these respects , the sermons of the same period or generation , are distinguished also by their own prevailing usages . In the structure of sermons , as in the building of churches , too much deference is had to the fashions of times and places , instead of the more permanent laws of taste and utility . We may know when or where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact , that it has one row of windows , or two and even three rows  --  a high basement for a bad lecture-room , or more properly , a mere foundahiona spire , or a cupola  --  a pulpit between the doors , or at the end where it belongs ; and we may often know as much about the origin of sermons by their textual or topical arrangement , their uses or inferences . Now in the instances we have noted , and others that will occur to our readers , we take no exception to this or that particular way of sermonizing , but only to the exclusive or excessive use of any one among all the modes that may be employed legitimately , each in its place . Nor would we complain of such a uniformity if it were only a habit indulged for the sake of facility in composition , like the fashion of one 's penmanship . But it has a positive effect on the popular mind . So far as it prevails , it gives sermons a professional and technical air , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearisome sameness just where , from the frequency and regularity of the occasion , variety is especially desirable . The effect // is increased moreover by the practice , which deserves to be noticed in this connection , of making the plan itself too prominent through a whole discourse . All the divisions and subdivisions are studiously separated and numbered as in a mere brief or analysis , and the chief points presented are announced in the beginning , and recapitulated at the end : such is the usual practice of some preachers , whatever may be their plan or subject . Now the analysis can not be drawn too accurately in the author 's mind , but it may stand out too nakedly in the composition . The frame of a discourse , like that of the human body , may be too sharply delineated , and the articulations left too bare for living effect if not for dissection . A single series of numbers may be convenient to aid the memories of the majority of hearers , but the preacher , in passing from one point to another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those natural and agreeable transitions which all critics have reckoned at once difficult and important parts of composition . The discourse should be so constructed if possible , as to hang together by the inherent connection of its members ,  --  ' a whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth . ' The effect of the more artificial method strikes every modern reader in the old English sermons , where the several subordinate topics , and almost the several thoughts , are drawn up and numbered , even by scores , in most formidable array ; and so far as it prevails now , it makes the style of sermonizing rigid and abrupt . Let there be all the minute accurate analysis which the earlier divines affected , yet softened and partially disguised by those just transitions to which we have alluded ; and then public discourse may have the ease and flow of the best conversation . We might refer to eminent exampIes of this particular advantnge in the most celebrated preachers of modern times , as well as in parliamentary orators of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard from time to time , we have felt the charm of the freer and less formal method , often enough to be mindful of its value ; when the matter presented was not new , yet had a form and pressure ' of its own , instead of being cast in a mould set apart as it were for sermons , and the preacher moved through his subject with all the aids and none of the incumbrances of scientific arrangement . Young ministers who will take pains in composition to avoid the stiffness and uniformity that would otherwise grow upon them incurably , will find themselves rewarded in the freshness thus given to their work on their own part and among their hearers . The impressiveness of preaching is often impaired by another fault , which however pertains to the delivery rather than the composition of sermons : what may be called false animation . We call it false , not as being hypocritical or insincere , but as untrue to nature and to the occasion . it is forced , instead of being spontaneous ; it is nuirde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from affectation in the worst sense , which all are ready to condemn , as when on a grave occasion a speaker has no feeling , yet pretends or represents it , in order to deceive his hearers . In the cases to which we refer , the speaker may be said to have feeling , but it is got up ' for ElatI , Chatmers and Metvitte should be earned among British preachers . It seems to us that Burke and *Vebster are as worthy to be studied for their method as for other reasons more frequently pointed out . We *emeinber a sermon on conscience , ' which we heard about twenty years ago with special interest in the arrangement as more natural and graceful than that of ordinary sermons . rjan. // the occasion ; and in this sense he affects emotion . It is not difficult to conceive of such a thing as possible , nor to see how it should exist in the pulpit . In the first place , the preacher very properly aims to be a faithful workman , and to engage the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . He is afraid lest his ministrations should degenerate into an unprofitable routine , and would fain make them in some way more effective . All this is well : but further , he may exaggerate the value of excitement in the delivery of a sermon . As a hearer he has occasionally felt the power of impassioned eloquence , and knows that the expression of deep emotion in the speaker naturally awakens corres* ) onding emotion in the hearers . He finds that whatever appears like vivacity or vehemence or pathos , is admired and sought after , and whether genuine or spurious is reckoned by many hearers indispensaide . Then he often hears it said , in a declamatory way , that of all orators the preacher ought to be the most deeply moved , that his themes are the most intensely exciti ngin their nature , and the end he purposes is momentous enough to call forth all his energies of thought , feeling and utterance . Under these impressions , we may suppose , he goes about his ordinary work in the pulpit , not spontaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant , or his hearers might desire , but convinced that he ought to be so , and anxious to become so . The transition is only natural if he endeavors now to bring himself into that state which seems to him appropriate 01 ' desirable , or in other words to excite himself for the occasion . On the principle that through reaction , or at least through association , emotion is itself raised through the outward expression of it , the effect becoming in turn a cause , he speaks *s if he were moved in order that he may be ; using the looks , tones and gestures , which express all that he would fain feel . That in some such way , by the aid of imagination and favorable circumstances , a speaker may produce in himself a real and even intense excitement , is shown from the case of eminent players who , in performing violent parts , have become dangerous to their associates by approaching too near to the life ; ' and much more is such an effect possible in the preacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This kind of animation may be so well wrought tip as to pass for natural feeling , but generally it has an aspect of its own . It carries a certain reflective or conscious air which , though entirely proper in the pulpit , yet does not comport with the excitement imitated ; and it is too long sustained , wanting the ease and almost accidental variations of a natural manner . Somehow it appears to be sought after , not inevitable . Observing persons can not fail to recognize it in an extreme case , which yet is not rnre ,  --  as when a preacher looks and moves as if the occasion were extraordinary , while in truth it is not ; seems determined to be impressive , cost what it may ; lashes himself to vehemence , as he proceeds ; pauses unexpectedly , or gazes intently into some part of the house ; now explodes the vowelsounds at the top of his voice , and now sinks in an awful cadence ; flings out his arms , even clenches his fists ; starts back , shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; -  --  and all this , not because he can not help it , nor yet for the sake of mere display , but because he honestly aims to feel as vehemently as he acts , in order to make his hen rers feel likewise . The same Ihult , of course in an inferior degree , is chargeable to many speakers who would shrink from this obtrusive e*at*ple . They cultivate , // perhaps unconsciously , the same kind of animation . Avoiding the parade we have described , they still practice the same method of exciting attention , as far as it may be done without defeating their purpose by arousing the prejudices or suspicions of their audience . They lack the ease which marks all natural expression . They evidently labor to make what they say impressive by their manner of saying it , and for this purpose to speak as if they were more impressed by it than they are . Through the greater part of a discourse thus delivered , there is more or less evident a strain " for effect . " An air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a morbid determination to emphasis . Typographically speaking , the manner is in italics . Now all practice of this kind rests , we believe , on a mistaken theory concerning animation in the pulpit . The habit is acquired under the notions which we have already described , in regard to the excitement warranted by the themes and objects of the Christian ministry . But such notions appear to us partial and unfair for the same reasons that we have before alledged against expect . ing too much effect from the preaching of the Gospel . They regard the Gospel itself abstractly , overlooking the circumstances of its presentation . If we think of the nature of mannot merely his moral imperfection , but the laws of his mind-we have no right to require of the preacher , that he shall produce in his hearers that species and degree of emotion which the truth he proclaims might of itself seem to warrant , nor that which it might in fact produce if it were new or were seldom exhibited and for the same reason we have no right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor should he exact it of himself . Religious truth is indeed of incalculable moment , but the effect it might be sup . posed to produce on the hearers , is naturally modified by the several causes to which we have before adverted ; and the same causes must operate on the preacher as on the Christian part of his congregation . Let it only be considered that his themes , however important and interesting in themselves , are yet even more familiar to him than to his hearers ; that the occasion on which he addresses them , however solemn , is yet as common as the Lord 's day , one of the most frequent and regular occasions on which he is called to speak or act ; and then " doth not nature itself teach " a certain moderation in the pulpit ? Yet it is this moderation which some preachers endeavor violently to shake off , as if it were an apathy or coldness unworthy of the place . Instead of it , they would fain feel and exhibit all the excitement of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come at their bidding ; and hence they labor without force , and fall below nature in attempting to rise above it . Notwithstanding the intrinsic worth of their message , and the results that must depend on its reception , though they speak of the soul , and eternity and God , yet it is unnatural for them to speak of the same things , to the same persons , every Lord 's day , just as they would if these things were new or were presented for the last time ; nor can they legitimately attempt to speak in that manner . The same error which misleads a preacher in such a case , misleads a class of hearers in their judgment ; and we take the more interest in exposing it , because we believe it also runs into the notions which many persons entertain of Christian experience , injuriously affecting their standard of piety , and their endeavors to promote it in their own hearts . Sure we are that it is no uncommon nor trivial error in the delivery of sermons , and that unnaturalness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of animation . // In conceiving , however , of a natural manner in the pulpit , we refer to man as he is generally constituted . We mean that the animation we have described , is generally unnatural to " a sound mind in a sound body . " Allowance must be made for the idiosyncrasies of preachers as of other men . There are those whose emotions are susceptible and intense even to morbidness , without control from a corresponding intellectual activity . They outrun the sympathy of their hearers , are affected always , even to tears , against their will , and kindle upon the slightest occasion by a sort of " spontaneous combustion . " Others again , with a more vigorous understanding and more fertile imagination , combine a quick mercurial temperament , which infuses life into every look and tone and gesture , without effort or consciousness on their part . Of this class have been many orators , whose eloquence was of the most impassioned quality . When such appear in the pulpit , the depth or fervor of their emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it should be , but to their supposed preeminence in piety ; and for this reason , as well as for the effects they produce , their manner is held up to a young preacher as a model to which he ought to conform his own . But the envied animation of these men was essentially different from any thing that can be acquired by the most studious imitation-essential ly different , because it was not acquired by any imitation ; nor can the young preacher be bound by any dictate of piety or prudence to exhibit or to feel the same thing . Their power of emotion and expression was a gift for them to use , not for others to acquire . For such men , it may be natural to speak on the commonest topic or occasion as if under all the excitement of novelty-though even they require , from time to time , the stimulus of a new audience . But for the great body of preachers , including men as useful in their place , and as eloquent in their way as any that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak with whatever tenderness or vehemence is in them , be it more or less , without attempting to generate more for the occasion . Whatever animation they may work themselves into , by special effort for that purpose , will be so far spurious . The habit we here complain of , in the delivery of sermons , we set down as impairing their impressiveness , because , like any other violation of natural laws , it must prove to be , on the whole , inexpedient , defeating its own purpose , and tending rather to mischief than good , notwithstanding temporary appearances of success ; and because the effect is often observed and felt to be the reverse of that which is desired . There is a class of persons , we know , in every congregation , who , either from a vitiated taste or from lack of discernment , prefer that manner which savors most of sheer excitement ; and the more unnatural it may be , the more it agrees with the unnatural appetite which it stimulates . Such persons are captivated , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beateth the air , " with the noise and violence of a man beside himself with animation . But even they grow weary of what they run after at first . And there is in every congregation a more judicious class of hearers , who are the proper assayers of the preacher 's work , and with whom the coin that obtains currency among others , must pass according to its weight and quality rather than its stamp . They demand simplicity , and after a while others prefer it also . A spurious animation , whatever may he its first effect , does not wear well in the long run ; it wears out . The very manner that was meant to be specially affecting , ceases to affect ; at length it wearies and repels . Insensibly , // it comes to be regarded by the people asa professional assumption , and engages their attention less than the naked truth presented only with simplicity . In general , utterance and gesticulation are fitted to impress the minds of hearers only as they are observed to express the mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what may be called his quasi emotion , or the manner that signifies what emotion he ought to feel , or would feel if he cou ! d . Hence , when a young man , possessing the piety and good sense required of an ordinary preacher , does not find in himself-springing up from his own mi**d , in contact with his subject and the occasionthat degree of animation which many of his hearers might relish , or which may seem necessary to the desired effect of his ministrations ; if he asks , What shall I do ? he may be answered , Do without it , rather than speak as if you felt it , or with a determination to excite it . The only remedy-so far as he needs oneis in the preparation of his heart for the work of the pulpit , by prayer and meditation on his theme : not in any endeavors , while doing that work , to stimulate himself or his hearers by outward appliances of voice and action . We would further remind him , that there is another manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , in their stated ministrations , than the animation which is so much coveted , or than even the impassioned delivery of Whitefleld . We mean a manner like that of Edwards and John Wesley , who were both remarkable for moving their hearers rather than for seeming to be moved themselves : the manner of a man who is for the most part calm , at home on his topic , and therefore in his way of treating it , yet soberly intent ; in earnest , yet self-possessed ; rising at times into fervor or pathos , which yet is subdued by the solemnity of his subject and the re* sponsibility of his station . There are living examples in men less eminent , indeed , than those we have named , but among the most acceptable and successful ministers of our day ; and if it were not invidious , we would name one in particular , who occupies a conspicuous pulpit in one of our large cities , and whose way of preaching is as remarkable for ease and naturalness as for salutary impression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior standard of pulpit eloquence prevails extensively , not only among the people , but among those ministers who , from their position , ought to rectify instead of humoring popular prejudices . And apart from our private judgment , we have heard so many intelligent persons , both ministers and laymen , express their dish satisfaction with what we have call ed false animation in the pulpit , that we believe the evil is more common than our readers might hastily suppose ; and we are sure it is one of the causes that generally impair the impressiveness of preaching.
