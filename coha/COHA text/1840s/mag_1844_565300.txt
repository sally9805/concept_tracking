txt Ir is sometimes a serious question whether we have a right to laugh ; and especially when some priestly foible , or consecrated absurdity provokes our mirth-as in the late charge of the Rt . Rev. Father in God , the Bishop of Connecticut . Ought we , for Christ 's sake , to be sober , when prelacy is acting Bottom in the play , because it is prelacy and not the real Bottom ? This great tragedian , our readers will remember , was specially ambitious to " play the lion too ; " he would " roar that it should do any man's heart good to hear him , " and with the further advantage , that he would not " frighten the ladies ; " for he would " aggravate his voice " and " roar you an ' t were any nightingale . " This famous nightingale of a lion , was roaring upon us all the way through in our first reading of the charge , and now that we are set down to our solemn office of review , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a certain respect for the worthy diocesan , which disposes us to treat his effusion with all due forbearance and gravity . We have even tried to bring ourselves to a serious and regular discussion of his argument ; which he has manifestly labored with prodigious effort and expectation . But we can not utterly suppress the comic feeling that haunts us , neither can we possibly muster so much of respect for the matter of his production , as to feel it altogether suitable to our ambition , to measure our strength against it in a deliberate and solemn * Errors of the Times . A charge dolivered to the clergy of the Diocese of Connecticut , at the annual convention , holden in Christ Church , in the city of Hartford , June 13 , Th43 . By the Rt . Rev. Thomas C. Brownell , D. D. , LL . D. , Bishop of the Diocese . answer . We fear too , lest in such an attempt we should part company with our readers , for the proscriptive grin they have suffered of six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed the austerity of their Puritanic faces , that they will scarcely be willing now to follow a regular deliberative argument . Still , we will endeavor to come as near sobriety as we can . And first of all , we will thank the Bishop for his charge , as the most serious and deliberate thing we can say . There is a point of view in which it has a real and sober importance . It is a flat , and , as far as a generally good spirited man is capable of malice , malignant attack upon the distinctive religion of New England . As such , it absolves our ministers from any chance of incurring unpleasant imputations , by going into a public defense of the Congregational polity . Many , we know , as Episcopacy has been growing rife among us , have been detained from taking ground , by their perhaps undue sensitiveness to such impressions . Now they have the Bishop 's official permission to put on strength and go to the work , clear of all restraint . A few perhaps , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than with its weakness , have suffered a salutary vexation . Others , we know , and they are the many , hailed its appearance as a deliverance , and with real exultation . It eased a perplexity which had long tried their patience . In this view , the Bishop 's charge is a thing of consequence , and he may certainly look for some important results to follow it . Heretofore too , it has been somewhat difficult to ascertain what Connecticut Episcopacy is . Here we have it on authority . Here // 144 Review of the Errors of the Times . it is revealed with a most fatal ingeauousness , and our churches and ministers may see it without mistake . The dry bones are uncovered , the dead flat of Pharisaism is spread out before them , the ghastly grin of spiritual death stares them in the face . Having offered this most serious tribute to the Bishop and his charge , we can not resist the temptation to set forth some inductive matters , which compelled us to receive it with lighter impressions . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never a church on earth more thoroughly leavened with fanaticism , than the Anglican church is at this moment . But the Bishop suffers a most amusing ignorance even of the possibility , that any such malignant phrensy can ever visit Episcopal bosoms . He speaks of " fanaticism , " ( p. 26-7 , and elsewhere , ) as the exclusive right of the sectaries  --  a thing quite impossible , either in or under a successor of the Apostles . Could he have endured with a little more patience the abhorrent discipline of metaphysics , " he might have been led to suspect , that it does not alter the essential nature of man , either to be under or to be a bishop . Possibly he might have discovered , that fanaticism is oftentimes only a sign of the activity of religious influences-that religion when it verily enters the soul , has to bear the company of evil there , and that when the holy fire is kindled , it may reasonably be expected ( such is human infirmity ) that some devilish heat will occasionally kindle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England fanaticism , he had not forgotten the history of the Apostles , he would have seen that these luckless preachers were doomed much ofiener than they wished , to stir up a blaze of fanaticismn . Nay , if he had stayed to form some deliberate estimate of St. Ignatius himself , who is to Episco pacy father of the Fathers , he would have found him an arrant fanatic , as carnally inflated , as mad with senseless zeal , as Davenpctt himself . Fanaticism does not , as he supposes , depend on given forms of outward demonstration , such as indicate an erratic or ecstatic phrensy ; but on the activity of absurd and malign emotions in the province of religion , and among religious bodies . Where the religious principle is most active therefore , the exposure to fanaticism is greatesL But alas ! even the inertness of formalism is no certain security against this truly human infirmityThe fury of the fane ( which is fanaticism ) may set even spiritual death on fire . Though the church care not a straw for the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , every manifestation of a true Christian experience , the question of a tallow candle , or of the real presence of Christ to the teeth of his disciples , may yet suffice to set on fire the course of nature , no thanks to grace . And exactly this is what we now see in the Anglican church . Laud is alive acrain at Oxford , and the dead body of high church formalism is seething once more , in the blaze of the rubrics . Mecca itself was never the seat of a more senseless fanaticism , than the great high church university is at this moment . The shirt of Mahomet never wrought a madness more absurd or malign , than the Oxford doctors now suffer in their shirt of penance , or their zeal for the dead letter of the rubrics . And if we regard the word , there is no other so true and proper fanaticism as this same fane-fury , this church-mad inspiration , which is now reigning in the Tract writers and their adherents ; nor only in their adherents , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , both in England and also here . And yet our Episcopal bishop is as ignorant // of the fact , as William Miller of the like in his determination to burn up the world . See how it goes in England . A literary honor is announced at Oxford in favor of a distinguished American scholar and statesman . Witness the hisses and yells of discontent by which the unfortunate stranger is insulted . This at Oxford ! a great and renowned university ! in the nineteenth century ! And what is the cause ? Why , that Mr. Everett has never been baptized in the church ! Or , what is not a whit better , that he is a Unitarian ! If the latter was the cause most ostensibly used , the former certainly was the most real and efficient ; for it is plain enough , according to the well known practice of the church , that if the holy sprinkling of priestly hands had fallen on the stranger 's head , the member thus regenerated , might have received the doctorate with applause , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this a mere casual ebullition of the church phrensy that rages at Oxford . Not only are the sacraments of the church proclaimed as the only vehicle of salvation , and they that refuse them unqualifiedly damned , but what is more really new and electrifying to the English nation , it is proved by penances and fasts and vigils , that the new teachers are certainly pious men ! The rumor of their sanctity goes abroad with their doctrines , and when they propose to regenerate the church , the ancient apostolic , but alas , sadly degenerate and dishonored church , the word is a fire in thousands of bosoms . When they advocate the right of persecution against the enemies of the church , the ear of the nation is not shocked , for they are men of sanctity , and sanctity is a thing so new and strange , that no one can tell what great things are to come of it ! When they maintain by the most learned process the authenticity of the popish miracles , no one stares at their credulity-they are sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle of reserve in religious knowledge , it is but a more imposing proof that great mysteries of wisdom are hid in their minds . If they undertake the philosophy of ethics and gravely propound the doctrine , that " morality is gravitation towards the church , " the discovery is received with silent awe . If they maintain by solemn argument , that no one is qualified to investigate the natural and mathematical sciences who is out of the church , and that the power of the keys extends to all the departments of human knowledge , who shall smile at the sanctimonious nonsense of a doctrine so honorable to the church ! The new zeal thus kindled in behalf of the church , spreads rapidly through the establishment , and so astonished are multitudes to see any thing in the shape of an earnest attention to religion , that they really hail the movement as one that promises to regenerate the land . The political aristocracy are not sure , that some new hope of strengthening their decayed and tottering eminence , is not here dawning upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to atone for what they do , by a more close and rigid adherence to the rubrics . Here the old cathedral bell , that had almost forgotten to ring on Sundays , announces a daily service . Here the humble chapel is filled with the smoke of incense , and hung about with pictures and crucifixes , which the gaping multitudes rush in to see . The younger clergy , for the young are specially susceptible to fanaticism , vie with each other in their spite against the dissenters , and their zeal for saints ' days , penances , and postures-for the straitbreasted coats , the " changeable suits of apparel , the mantles , the // wimples , and crisping pins " of the rubrics . The churches in the mean time are better attended . The tables of the fashionable drawingrooms are cleared of novels to make room for bishops ' charges , the Tracts for the Times , and the torrent of church pamphlets daily pouring from the press . The clergy of course are delighted with their new consequence , and the rising honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , the more cordially do they hate and oppress the dissenters . Such is the new era of Episcopal fanaticism kindled at Oxford . The tragic part is there , but the comic is reserved for us . Our Anglican clergy on this side the water begin to hear of the great day coming to Episcopacy at home , and forthwith kindle up their little tapers to emulate the great fire that is burning in England . Bishop Doane goes over to get the ancinting of Dr. Pusey , and returns pompous Lord George , to set up a cross ! Onderdonk is so fierce to become a lord that he makes himself a bear . And the good Bishop of Connecticut , whose misfortune it is to be hedged about by the stiff old pikes of Puritanism , amongst which it will not do so well either to be a lord or a bear , must nevertheless charge . Habitually cool and moderate , respectable and respected hitherto , for his official discretion and the general courtesy of his manners to Christians of other names , he has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must suffer what he can . His more combustible clergy gather round him breathing flame into the miter . The great hope awakened in England of some splendid triumph about to be nchieved by the church , takes him on the side of his prerogative and draws him into the field . Sed ut fanaticus castro Percuss , , s , Bellona , inn divinat , et , Ingens Omen , habes , inquit , magni clarique triumphi . Tracts for the Times , many and strong in England , Connecticut emulates in one little pamphlet with a green cover on the Errors of the Times ! The high church British lion roars , in good earnest , against any and every shape of private judgment . The Connecticut nightingale roars a response against private judgment , only observing to take away the meaning ! Oxford anathematizes every poor dissenter with a stout-voiced thunder , and justifies the rod that shall whip him into conformity ; " the dissenters , ** squeaks Connecticut in a soft mouselike tenor ! Dr. Pusey glories in reproducing the wounded body of Christ , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Brownell , like a certain other t*owned dignitary who had some reasonable fears of the ghost she was raising , says he intended to speak of the errors that prevail in regnrd to the Lord 's Supper , but had not time ! To complete the picture , we must go into the convention and hear " the charge " exploded . Our readers are informed of the profound sensation it produced in the assembled clergy and laity to hear the worthy Bishop " aggravate his voice "  --  the opinion universally expressed ( a surprise to themselves ) that it must place their Bishop among the most renowned prelates of the church !  --  and that all with one voice of gratulation said , " Let him roar again-let him roar again ! " But alas ! when the judgments of a respectable body of men are inflated by some petty gust of fanaticism , how little are they aware of the figure they make in the eyes of sober and judicious people , who are not sympathetically infected . To such " the charge " sounded more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the gun . And the profound sensation it moved in the convention was just far enough from sober reason to provoke a sense of the ludicrous. // When some flaring madness blazes out from a nest of ignorant and deluded people , it moves our pity . But when a grave and generally dignified body of men are heated into some gentle absurdity , and betray the infirmity of human nature in a way that is barely picturesque , the comic sense must needs be touched , and the muscles of laughter show that they were made for use . Now it must not be supposed that we intend or wish to excite any feeling of contempt towards the person of our diocesan . The difficulty with him is , that he is too respectable a man to make a respectable fanatic . He has too much good feeling to excel , in a work , which demands unqualified impudence and malignity ; too much good sense and discretion to act the fool vigorously . If he had made a bolder onset we should have respected him less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of fearful exposure , and the wonder ( most creditable to himself ) is , that he has made so poor a figure in trying to quit his discretion . The church ought to understand , that if they want a thorough genuine fanatic to lead their cause , they must have a young man in the bishopric . It is impossible to make the fane-fury blaze out fierce and strong , in a mind that has been tamed by long experience , and has settled into habits of tranquillity and moderation . And if such an one will fire his gravity by a forced combustion , the manifestation can not be less than ridiculous . At the same time it must be granted , that the gratuitous insult the Bishop has seen fit to offer our churches , renders any expression of respect on our part , however qualified , an act of mercy rather than of justice . He well understood that we must receive as an intended insult the epithet " dissenters , " which he bestows upon us , on almost every page of his charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malignant pleasure in the insult . In so doing , by the universal judgment of mankind , he puts himself beyond the terms of civilized warfare , and sacrifices every claim to personal courtesy or official respect . And if we were not too much amused by his absurdity to be nettled by his impudence , we should be obliged to treat him with merited severity . But when we figure the Bishop at the head of a church , which scarcely differed from a tory clan in that day when ours was bearing the nation on its shoulders and giving it existence and a name  --  a church , afterwards increased by the accession of " certificators , " who went over to escape their taxes in the days of our establishment ; * by malcontents who wanted ease to their consciences under some more quiet doctrine ; and by refugees of yesterday who fled thither to shelter their appetites and gains against that noble reform , which is now so nearly triumphant in our country , and promises to be throughout the world ,  - -  when we consider that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this day has no baptism but ours on his consecrated head , and that now in a solemn convention of clergy and laity from his churches , which originally were only little gatherings of factioa scattered here and there under the names of so many saints , and are now for the most part scarcely strong enough to save the poor saints from ironythat here he takes his ecclesiastical tripod and gravely calls us " dis * Formerly every person was required to pay taxes to the Congregational churches , unless he signified by a " ce'rt*ficcte " lodged with the clerk , ( when will the lord bishops of England allow such a privilege to the poor tythe-paying dissenters * ) that he preferred some other church ; a provision , of which , those who cared much for their money and naught for religion , were ready enough to avail themselves by a nominal connection any where . These were called " certificators. " // senters " - there is something so exquisitely picturesque in the figure , that resentment is impossible . And the picture is seasoned yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretofore courteous Bishop , now trying to be even with the times in his church , has yet so little capacity for the high church madness he emulates , that he can possibly screw himself up to nothing more wicked than a petty effrontery or a piece of ill manners . We wonder that the Oxford doctors have nowhere discovered in the rubrics a Dervish dance prescribed for the bodily exercise of these old judicious prelates , that they may be able , somehow , to lash themselves up to the requisite pitch of church phrensy . But the " Errors of the Times " - what are they ? Principally threeprivate judgment , non-episcopal ordination , and a lack of baptismal regene ration ; - all errors which , if they are errors at all , are as old certainly as the Reformation , and in our opinion as old as the world . How then " errors of the times ? " Assuredly it was of some consequence to find a title that should sound as congruently as possible to Episcopal ears ; and since the Tracts for the Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Errors of the Times ! " And the Bishop in his zeal to bear a title so eminently impressive , did not observe the hardship put upon a little preposition , which stands as mere laity between its terms . " Tracts for the Times " is very well , though designed to remove old abuses ; but " Errors of the Times , " for errors as old as Adam , is not so well . " Errors for the Times " would have been better , and withal just so much nearer the Oxford title . Besides , if we are Anglicising , it is important to write English . When we heard that the Bishop had made an onset on the right of private judgment , we were not a little astonished at his boldness . Can it be , we said , in this nineteenth century-in this nation where thought is free as air , and not a man conceives the possibility of any law upon his opinions save the law of God himself-in the state of Connecticut , where every mental habit and every social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , himself a son of the Puritans , a mild and reasonable man , has really had the audacity thus to insult every habit , prejudice and principle in our bosoms ? Has he dared to pollute the atmosphere we breathe , by offering to our approbation the foul old dogma of the Papacy , which now reveals its last stage of putrition in the activity of the Oxford ferment ? There is something impressive and , so far , respectable in great moral audacity . The flagrancy of an outrage sometimes endues it with power and sublimity . And we really began to fancy , in our recreant ears of our Puritan apostasy . But lo ! how sweetly are they laid in a moment , and with such marvelous facility , that the stare which protruded our eyes gives place , at once , to another sort of contortion , the most pleasant and comfortable that can be imagined . For the worthy Bishop , we discover , only sets himself on private judgment to " aggravate his voice ! " How else could he play the lion at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean of course the Puritan ladies who " might have no more discretion but to hang him " - he very kindly tells them that he only gives what is set down in the play , and that he means nothing really bad or terrible in it ! Now in these days of Episcopal fanaticism , it must be remembered that every thing in the church , low or high , goes up higher ; and if not every one can be highest , he must // yet be as high as he can . The Oxford faction , who are soul and spirit of the whole movement , lead off in a bold , unqualified denial of the right of private judgment , maintain . ing the authority of the church in all ages as binding and conclusive . Then the bishops and clergy follow in a " Song of Degrees , ' ' according to the warmth of their emulation , the extent to which their judgments are infected by the new fanaticism , and the degree of propinquity to Rome they choose to suffer . Some declare that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries is law , some of the first " six , " others " five , " others " four . " Very few are so far behind as to say the first " three . " The Bishop of Connecticut could not be expected to soar as high as the Bishop of New York or Maryland ; and considering the mental atmosphere of New England , it was certainly very respectable to put himself down for the first " two " centuries. - " The Holy Scriptures ( p. 5 ) as they were interpreted by the church during the first two centuries , not as they may chance to be interpreted by the wayward fancies of individuals , constitute the only sure basis for us to rest upon . " Brave ! brave enough . Some of our Puritan folk we have heard were really astounded by the declaration . But the ludicrous thing , which somewhat flats down our impression of the worthy Bishop 's altitude , is , that his discretion has backed him up to a point when church authority had not begun to run  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment ! Every advocate of church authority carefully distinguishes between the opinions held by individuals and opinions held by the church . We can scarcely read ten pages , in any writer on the subject , without meeting the distinction . But there is not one opinion of the first two centuries which can , with any propriety , be considered an opinion of the church ; for the church was not so organized as to have a joint action , or unite in a common expression of any kind . The churches were isolated , or at least not organically united . No convention , council or synod was held previous to the year A. D. 170 , nor , in the thirty years following , was any held more extensive than mere provincial synods , and these as it happened arrayed against each other in their determinations . No general or cecumenical council was held prior to the council of Nice , A. D. 325 . Now church authority is defined by Palmer and others to be the authority of " universal judgment , " and , within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be called " universal judgment . Some guess may possibly be made in regard to the opinions and practices most prevalent , by comparing one writer with another , one principal church with another , i. e. by tracing the history and free workings of private judgment . And so there can at any time . If the Bishop will bring together all the writings , practices and synodical expressions of the Christian denominations now at work in the field of private judgment , he will ascertain what their mind is much more easily than he can ascertain the mind of the church in the second century . There is quite as much of agreement now as then , notwithstanding the affliction he suffers at the spectacle of sects and schisms and quibbles tearing the bosom of Christian unity in our churches , and none more bitterly than his own . And what is also to be remarked , there is no one opinion of the first two centuries , in which they can be shown to unite more uniformly than in maintaining the right of private judgment ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim is not positively absurd if we take a later position , when the church began to // collect her judgments and give them a joint expression ,  --  when she was taking up the private judgments of the earlier times and certifying their validity . For , as Palmer says in regard to a partial judgment , the church ultimately judges whether that judgment is itself correct , and if the whole church affirms and acts on it , it becomes the judgment of the universal church . But our Bishop declares that the first two centuries are " the only sure basis , " which is a positive denial that the third century is a sure basis . And thus we have the pleasant spectacle of a Bishop charging against private judgment on the ground that private judgment is the only sure basis to rest upon ! But lest this should somehow frighten the public above measure , he is induced to soften its rugged front by one of those interlocutory paragraphs often used by strong writers to save their opinions from extravagance. - " The general exercise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of private judgment and of the freedom of the will , is indeed the natural and inalienable right of every man . But he is responsible to his God , and in a minor degree to his fellow men , for the manner in which he exercises these faculties . He may not rightly set them up in opposition to the word of God . He may not rightly exercise them in a spirit of perversity or of self-conceit . He may not rightly exercise them in a way injurious to the peace and order of society , nor without a due veneration for the judgment of the church and its ministry-so far as that judgment is supported by primitive tradition and usage , and is in conformity to the divine word . We deem him self-sufficient and conceited who pays no respect to public opinion , even though that opinion may perhaps be founded on the caprice of the day . Much less is he to be commended who sets at naught the opinion of the wise and the good-opinions which have stood the scrutiny of ages , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amen to the Bishop , as true as if it were a response of the liturgy . This is exactly our opinion , and the opinion too of all sensible Christians in the Protestant world . Again we say , let the Bishop quit his discretion ; for if discretion is the better part of valor , it is no part of the church madness he emulates . If he wishes to be even with the times , be must let his discretion go . It is not enough to hold a place among his peers , that he should charge against the mere phrase " private judgment , " and then assert the doctrine-they will require him to deny that too ! We also think that if he had been able really to assume the boldness he emulates , he might also have maintained a better show of ingenuousness . The Bishop of Connecticut knows perfectly well that we hold no such opinions on this subject as his phraseology intimates . We claim no right to " interpret by the wayward fancies of individuals , " or in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a spirit of vanity and self-conceit , " or to disrespect the judgment of the church and its ministry , " or to dispense with that " first rule of evidence requiring us in the investigation of a fact to examine it by the light of contemporary history . " Our principle is , and he well understands it-HEAR , THEN JUDGE-hear every thing-listen to every voice-follow every clue in the church and out of it ; then with a spiritual mind and a sense of accountability to God , judge . He knows that our commentators , and even the writings of the early Puritans , abound with references to the Fathers , and that so far from despising or setting at naught the first two centuries , we claim them on our side in every question between us , though without any such opinion of their infallibility as to bind ourselves // to an implicit submission to their authority . When he intimates with a sneer that we set up the Bible alone , " without note or comment , " as our " only standard of faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " without note or comment , " were never used by any one as having reference to a standard of faith at all-that we simply associate on this basis , associate with many of his own church , in a great and holy effort , than which nothing in this age is more truly catholic , to spread the gospel of life through the dying nations of mankind . We charge the Bishop with no jesuitical intention . But if these things result from no moral infirmity , they must from infirmity of some other kind-that perhaps of his position . He really holds no doctrine opposed to private judgment and has asserted none . But in this day , when all aspire to be champions of Episcopacy , he must needs be one among them . So he goes into the field hoisting the high church flag " NO PRIVATE JUDGMENT "  --  but yet with a courage so unequal to the war , if not with a discretion superior to it , that while he seems to be even with the times , he is actually , shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it is only a part of his mistake that having taken our opinion for his own , he should give us one that is nobody 's . Whether it is most deferential to acknowledge his sincerity or to deny it , we can not so easily judge , and therefore leave him to choose . Undoubtedly the mere expression by which he declares that " the interpretations of the church in the first two centuries constitute the only sure basis to rest upon , " may be taken in a sense to which we do not agree . But when he praises the English reformers ( p. 7 ) for having ascribed no " Popish infallibility to the early Fathers , " and for having used them only as a " most useful guide , " he declares , as plainly as he can , that he himself receives no teaching of the first two centuries with implicit submission , and reserves the right of private judgment against the " only sure basis of the church " - which is exactly our opinion . True , he intimates an opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , which we might choose to offset by some peculiar disadvantages resulting from the rawness of their experience , and the Judaizing or paganizing propensities of their mental habit , as well as by the fact that we of a later age have seen so many errors , Episcopacy among the rest , tried out and made to display their pernicious effects in actual history . He might cast the balance in favor of a father of the second century , and we of a father of the nineteenth century . Still we are both upon the common principle of private judgment-we only judge differently . If we are wrong in this , if the Bishop truly means to waive all private judgment , and bow to the first two centuries as conclusive authority , why does he not say it , and go to work like a hold-spirited man and a scholar to maintain his position . We are ready to meet him with volumes of patristic absurdities , and show to the satisfaction of reasonable men that " the wayward fancies of individuals " were never more rampant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prove the contrary , or if it is too much for a Bishop to prove his declarations , why does he not assert the contrary ? - that when Clement , the first and most sober of the Fathers offers his ridiculous argument for the resurrection drawn from the silly fable of the Phcenix , and interprets the scarlet rope which the harlot Rahab let down from the wall , as representing the gospel scheme of salvation , it is good infallible truth-that the fanatical and anti-Christian sentiments that strew // the epistles of Ignatius are the very doctrine of Christ-that the silly vagaries of Barnabas are to be received as sound exegesis of the Old Testament-that the vituperations of Tertullian are the spirit of Jesus , and his declarations against early baptism , and against the morality of second marriages , a sure basis for the canons of the church-that when Bishop Papias declares a millennium to come so fruitful that every single grape will yield more than two hundred gallons of wine , he is better authority than Bishop Miller . It is barely possible that the Bishop may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The early Puritans took strong ground , we know , in behalf of the Scriptures as the only and conclusive authority in matters of faith . We do the same , though not excluding any collateral evidences or subsequent explanations which are aids to the discovery of their meaning . And does not the Bishop himself declare , ( p. 6 , ) that " the English reformers maintained the supreme authority and sufficiency of the Scriptures ? " Possibly the early Puritans may have used stronger language than this , though we know not the instance . And as to the church forms- " those catholic and primitive usages which were in accord ance zeith Scripture , " ( p. 6 , ) and which the English reformers are said to have reverently sifted out by this test and retained , if the Bishop will tell us how they ascertained what usages were in accordance with Scripture , we will tell him how the Puritans rejected them , viz , because they were not in accordance with Scripture , violations of its spirituality , pomps hostile to its power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformers stoutly rejected private judgment , in words , they did not altogether renounce their wits , and under that form took it back again . In which respect they somewhat differ from the Bishop , who renounces his wits , at the beginning , in a futile endeavor both to retain his private judgment and to let it go . But while we require of the Bishop , with all due reverence , that he will give us back our opinion and dare to take one with the church champions he emulates , we have no disposition either to claim his facts or his arguments . After laying down his " only sure basis** in the interpretations of the first two centuries , he vindicates the English reformation as coinciding in sentiment by the following exquisite proof , ( p. 7 ) - In the " Necessary Doctrine of a Christian Man , " agreed upon by the whole church of England , in the year 1543 , it is declared that " All those things which were taught by the apostles and have been , by an whole universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , taught continually ought to be received , " &amp;c . Now if the reader will suffer a little amusement , let him turn to Palmer on the Church , ( Vol . I , p. 456 , ) and there also he will readthe " Necessary Doctrine of a Christian Man , " agreed on by the whole church of England , in 1543 , says , &amp;c. giving the same extract above recited . But Palmer gives it to prove that the stout old Romish doctrine of church authority was the doctrine of the English reformers , where it has a reasonable application . But the Bishop of Connecticut thinks that if it will do for Oxford , it will certainly do for any true Bishop , and so he puts it down by the side of his little " only sure basis " in the first two centuries . The English reformers boldly said " ever sith that time , " stretching their only sure basis down through the Roman apostasy and through all the filth of church history . The Bishop looks out from his skulkingplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmation of his valor against private judgmenthe and the reformers are one ! Now if this be a somewhat ridiculous figure , it is not our fault , for if any one will suffer the ambition to use Oxford arguments , without courage to hold Oxford opinions , it may naturally be expected that some fault of dignity will appear . Again ; immediately after the Bishop 's interlocutory paragraph above quoted , in which he declares our doctrine of private judgment , with as much clearness as will do in these flagrant times of Episcopacy , he goes on directly to say , ( p. 8 ) - " It was under these views of PRIVATE JUDGMENT , that the reformation of the church of England was conducted . The result is embodied in our book of co**o* PRAYER . " What ! a general exercise of private judgment- ( we do not stop here to ask what a " general exercise may be which excludes particular exercises under it , for the Bishop is averse to " metaphysics " )  --  a general exercise of private judgment acknowledged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English reformation ! And that in a time , when men were going to the flames every month for their opinions ! when it was a decree of the church that " whosoever through his pric ate judgment doth openly break the traditions and ceremonies of the church , ought to be rebuked openly , " when the convocation of the church was solemnly enjoining it on the clergy , " above all things , to be careful never to teach aught in a sermon to he religiously believed , except that which is agreeable to the doctrine of the Old and New Testament , and which the catholic fathers and bishops have collected from that very doctrine I ' , ( A magnificent and brilliant work to preach in that day ! ) Yes ! this is that " general inalienable right of private judgment " which prevailed in the English reformation ! And Vol . II . 20 the book of common prayer is " the embodied result , " says the Bishop . Well does he call it the " monument " of the Reformation . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery would have been equally appropriate . The truth is , that the English church , in what is called its reformation , was and continued to be a Romish church , in every thing but the accident of a monarch 's lusts and a leaven of Puritanism , ( the thing existed long before the name , ) which made itself felt , till it could be endured no longer . And Palmer , who knows how to make his arguments meet his conclusions somewhat better than the Bishop of Connecticut , has shown by a full investigation of facts , that the English reformation made no infringement on the doctrine of church authority , as it stood under the Romish rule . It is now , he maintains , the true doctrine of the English episcopate . Let our countrymen understand , where the sympathies of this Anglican religion lie . Is this the faith for Americans ? Above all , men of New England ! is it the faith for you ? Having settled his doctrine by these inimitable arguments-our doctrine by the arguments of Oxford-the Bishop proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , as contrastedwith the manifold desolations of Protestantism , in other forms and families . " The communions , " he says , ( p. 8 , ) " planted by Calvin and Zuinglius have become deeply imbued with Socinianisin and infidelity . Those founded by Luther and Melancthon have been corrupted by rationalism and every species of vain philosophy . The stern church of John Knox has shared , to a great degree , a similar fate , and is moreover rent by internal divisions . Has Puritanism enjoyed a happier destiny , either in Europe or in this country ? Let the schisms , the heresies , // the infidelity , the fanaticism , which have every where sprung up from its distractions , answer the question . " Then behold the contrast ! " Surrounded by all this desolation , the Protestant Episcopal church in this country appears as an oasis in the desert ! ' " - ( p. 9 . ) Our unclassical readers may not understand , how beautifully primitive the Bishop is , in this allusion . He refers to that famous oasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecrated as a poetic symbol , long before the only sure basis was laid . There was the more than primitive church of Jupiter Ammon , bowered in verdure in the midst of an ocean of sand . Alexander caught the rumor of its gorgeous rites , turned aside from the conquest of the world , and marched his sweltering legions thither to see so great a sight . There the priests had it according to their will , and a most saintly place it was . Being a sacred c*ste by themselves , having the people to be servants of their will , and one of their number set on high to preside in " exact conforniity with ancient rules , " ( so says the book , ) nothing could excel the condition of elysian splendor in which they moved , the order and priestly pomp of their forms , or , if report be true , the xvondrous effect of their magic rites . It was in fact the paradise of ecelesiastics ! But if we can not praise the acuteness of the Bishop 's argument , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descend then from his poetry to his argument . And what if the churches of the German and Swiss reformations have become a prey to rank and dismal errors ? To bring the matter home at a stroke , we affirm without scruple , that with all their heresies and frigid neologisms , their state is yet greatly to be preferred to that of the Anglican Episcopal church . And if we were this day to import a religion , we should not hesitate , a moment , to make out an order on Germany in preference to the English episcopate . This , we suppose , is not the general opinion of our friends , but we have our reasons . As far as we can discover , the sense of religion is much stronger in Germany , and the attendance on Christian worship more general , than it is in England . We verily believe that there is more of the power of Christian truth in Germany , than there is under the twice dead formalism , which reigns in most of the English churches . The German religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds , at least , a friendly relation towards them . Anglican E piscopacy , on the other hand , has ever been a jealous enemy of popular education and of every effort to elevate the masses , and has thus made the very name of religion odious to them-justly odious . The German ministry retains more of the true Christian simplicity ; it is not so corrupt and secular-certainly not so rapacious as the ravening wolf hood miscalled by the epithet clergy in England  --  the lord bishops acting Dives in their fine linen at the rate of three hundred thousand a yearthe younger sons of noblemen parceled off to their riotous " livings , " acting the prodigal without either acting or teaching his repentance , and escaping the husks by tithing the corn  --  a race of priestly extortioners in the name of Christ Jesus , hunting , drinking , gaming and swearing under cover of the apostolic succession-not novices in doctrine , because they have not advanced so far-stealing their sermons to supply the want of their head , and plundering the poor to fill the want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , not by their arguments , but by their extortions-examples to their flocks , only as they show them , by example , how to wear the fleece . The picture holds with many honorable // exceptions-it nevertheless holds . There is not such another spectacle on earth-no , nor ever has been , whether in the Rornish church or any other-of a priesthood in total opposition to the simplicity and spirituality of the gospel ; for the Pope of Rome has this reasonable apology for his princely estate , that he unites the office of a temporal ruler . And this too , it will be observed , in a church where the ministry is every thing ; for when you have named prelacy , sut**ssion , ordination , orders , tithes , you have made an inventory of the topics which alone are treated , by the English clergy , as a body with real earnest . To prop up the system which feeds so much of pride and rapacity , is of course a prime object , and the priestly prerogatives are valued for what they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the worst estimate we can make of their faith , a spirit of freedom and intellectual activity , which will soon be moved to seek some corrective for their errors , because of the spiritual poverty they suffer under them . But a church bound up in formalism , having the whole interest of its priesthood arrayed against its purity-a church which has made itself strong by making religion itself contemptible-the reformation of such a church must be a slow and possibly a hopeless work . And we are of opinion , much as we love sound doctrine , that it is better to suffer a bad heresy for a few years , than a Pharisaism equally bad for as many centuries . What then does it signify for the Bishop and clergy of Connecticut to shed their tears over Germany ? Let them go back and pour them into the polluted lap of their mother . She that conceived them bath done shamefully ; for she said I will go after my lovers that give me my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflicted also by the miserable distractions and schisms of Puritanism , particularly in this country , while his own church , compacted into unity under " the standard of faith " in the book of common prayer , is a beautiful oasis , in the moral desert , created by others round it . Had we said as much , it would most assuredly have been set down for a specimen of that cruel irony and sarcasm in which we are supposed to abound . A standard of faith in the book of common prayer ! Doubtless the Episcopal churches and bishops agree in receiving the book as a standard , and so do all the families of Puritanism agree in receiving the Bible for a standard . And what is more , these families , if we include the greater divisions , the Congregational , the Presbyterian , the Dutch Reformed , the Baptist , and ( if they will suffer the classification ) the Methodist , hold a real and substantial agreement of opinion , as a generous and philosophic criticism would amply show . Nay , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the book of common prayer more substantially , uniformly and consistently than the churches and bishops of the Anglican episcopate , whether in England or in the United States . Every person of only tolerable information , in respect to church matters , will recognize a true picture in the following passage from Hill 's " Sale of the Curates , " a satire in which he lays open the rottenness of his church , in regard to the articles and other matters most faithfully. - " Some suppose that though the reformers in the articles wrote in one sense , the Calvinistic , it might be taken in another , the Arminian ; others , that they were meant in two senses , the direct opposite to each other , i. e. to unite the Calvinists and Arminians ; others , that the sense of them is but one , Arminian , but the direct opposite to their obvious Calvinistic meaning ; and a fourth set have made it out that they mean every // thing or nothing , as all may like best . " Now whether this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of no consequence to our present purpose to inquire ; - that it is an exact and literal account of the manner in which they are and have beea treated in the church , no Episcopalian can deny . It is the testimony of whole libraries of debate and controversy . Equally clear it is that the book of common prayer is a shell of sects and schisms in its own composition-articles and homilies from Geneva-rubrics and forms from Rome-Calvin and the Popea patchwork of discord and moral confusion . Or if this be denied , it can not be denied that the church has so received it , and has in every age been divided into parties , between those who have followed the articles and those who have clung to the rabrics . These parties and clans have ever been contending against each other ,  --  ns opposite , in their spirit and in all their practical views of religion , as Christ and the Pharisees , and the more cordially hating each other because of their proximity . The church has been and now is but a band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands - Calvinistic ministers , priestly drones and nothingarians-Arminian bishops , who have not so much as learned from Arminius the notion of a spiritual religion-sentimental formalists , formalists without senti. - ment , ( save the love of money and good living , ) Oxfordizing and Romanizing doctors-all kenneled together under " the standard of faith and worship in the book of common prayer ! " Whether it is better for so many creatures of so diverse instincts to be forced into a common receptacle , we will not stay to discuss , though we think the example and law of nature , forbidding that lambs and doves should live together with wolves and vultures , has clearly enough decided . It certainly realizes to the full , and a little more fully than Christ ever imagined , the declaration of his parable , that the net should gather of every kind . We have also to say that in all that sweet peace and unity , in which the American episcopate has blessed itself in years past , while it has been hushing itself and saying , " Behold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have known by many private facts , and by others not private , that a large and truly pious body of ministers have been groaning , in secret bitterness , for the contempt and spiritual oppression continually heaped upon them , and listening to the hymn of peace , as impatiently as the roasting cockles did upon their embers . And when the Bishop of Connecticut wrote his charge , he well knew that there were other bishops in the American church giving forth opinions to the public , between which there is an opposition as fiat as between a Romish cardinal and a Presbyterian elder ! Possibly he had seen a large pamphlet , made up of extracts from the written opinions of two living American bishops , side by side in twin columns , in which they are at issue on almost every head in the index of Christian doctrine-agreeing in nothing , but to hold their prerogative and bless the book of common prayer . And this , the Bishop of Connecticut probably thought , was unity enough , because it was as good as there ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheets of his charge are scarcely dry , before an outburst of war is heard , and the rumor of Episcopal strife fills the land . The priests have turned their back on their bishop in the very act of reading " common prayer "  --  the poor laity wake up astounded to find that their bishop is a Pope and their semmary a school of Jesuits-one diocese denounces the proceedings of another-one bishop traverses the breadth of the land , to see if some leaven of the true gospel may not // possibly be saved in the diocese of another  --  and it is proved to the satisfaction of every body , what every body ought to have known before , that the Episcopal peace and unity is only a solemn imposition ! To sum up all , there are as many " heresies and schisms , " and those every way as bad-as many types of " fanaticism , " and those as malignant , ranging from church-mad bishops down to public praying women and exhorters , ( these latter we need scarcely cross the borders of Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those as much more flat as they are more scholastic and opposite to common sense-as many " impostors , " if it makes an impostor to pretend to magic powers and functions that are not possessed-as many of all these , in the bosom of Episcopacy itself , as in all the Puritan churches in the world , with the advantage of more profligacy by several thousand times . It is in fact a true Lybian oasis , whatever we may say of the desert round it . But we have yet another thing to say , which the Bishop omitted . If private judgment , as held by the Lutheran , Calvinistic , and Puritan churches , has refuted itself by its disastrous results , let the argument be carried through impartially . How began , whence came the great Roman apostasy ? What does the Bishop himself tell us , but that Episcopacy preceded Romanism , and is it not the universal doctrine of his church , that Romanism is now Episcopal , and within the true catholic Episcopal church of Christ ? And what was the Romish apostasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with it , but a natural and proper development of Episcopacy ? What was the Pope but a metropolitan bishop , and how did he secure his bad eminence but by the assistance of his Episcopal prerogatives ? Doubtless there was much of wicked ambition , usurpation , sycophancy , mendacity , and rapacity , concerned in the transition , and so it may be said that the papacy was a perversion of Episcopacy . Very truebut Episcopacy was the thing to suffer such a perversion . Had the original equality of pastors been preserved , or if not original , hadit existed , no such perversion had been possible . It was also by and through Episcopacy , that the church became admixed with the civil state , and so the doctrine of persecution was born . Bad bishops ( and none are too bad to carry the succession ) having lost the character of ministers of Christ , and become ecclesiastical lords over their flocks and their minor clergy , attracted the attention of the civil power by their importance , and were at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which flattered their vanity and strengthened their prerogative . They , on the one hand , engaged to farm the civil obedience , by wielding the superstitions of the people ; and the civil power on the other , gave them stakes and fires and thumbscrews , and , if necessary , armed men , to enforce their dogmas and keep safe their ghostly prerogatives . Thus entered the doctrine of Christian persecution  --  a doctrine which wove itself into the religious opinions of the world so ingeniously , that even Puritanism itself was slow to unlearn it . Nothing could have been more totally opposite to persecution , than the peaceful , forgiving , and brotherly gospel of Christ . The lamb and his butcher are not so unlike . Had the original equality of pastors remained , no such result could ever have been reached . And now , if this same equality of pastors were introduced into the Romish church , how much of the Roman apostasy would remain , five days after the event ? We do charge it then upon Episcopacy , that Romanism exists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of the Christian church . This foulest and most dreadful scourge that ever visited mankind , the desolater of kingdoms , the corrupter of virtue , the destroyer of the true doctrine of Christ , the extinguisher of light , the enemy of freedom , filling the earth , age upon age , with scenes of woe and degradation which we shudder to remember-iRomanism with the sword of church authority reeking in blood - this we say is the result of Episcopacy . SATe say this not in declamation , not to retort an argument , not to fill a period in controversy , but as the sober philosophic truth of history . Why , if our doctrine of private judgment has made all the " heresies , " " schisms , " and " sects , " so industriously imputed to it , Episcopacy has only to cast one glance at what it has done , and now is , to behold a sweep of desolation revealed , which a thousand centuries of such like petty evils could not match ! Will the American people look at this ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge beyond what we intended , but the exquisite absurdity of the matter was a temptation we could not resist . What he says in his next head , on the " nature of the Christian church , " or the " apostolic succession of Episcopal bishops , " ( for in his view the church and the bishops are scarcely different one from the other , ) we shall dispatch more briefly , not because the temptation aforesaid is discontinued , but because we must . " lYe are surrounded , " says the Bishop , ( p. 9 , ) " by a multitude of distinct associations professing to be Christian ; a great portion of them refusing all communion with others , and each claiming to be more pure , more scriptural , and more holy than the rest . " And this to open an argument , the very object of which is to set forth the Episcopal association as the only true church ! And what is more , only fifteen lines before , he was boasting his church as an oasis in the desert ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly be opposed to private judg* ment ourselves . Could any one believe it possible , that a human being , gifted with the ordinary attributes of discernment and intellectual harmony , could weave such a patchwork together , and suffer no sense of absurdity , even though its terms were two full pages asunder ! And yet the Bishop is a man of understanding . He only nives us here an amusing illustration of that total incapacity of self-understanding , which is the affliction of Episcopacy , and especially of Episcopal bishops . The natural inflation of official consequence , aggravated by the casual inflation , at this time , of rising hope and a certain inspiration of fanatical extravagance , induces a degree of self-ignorance truly inimitable . " Refusing all communion ! " Could the Bishop possibly understand us if we should say , that every body , out of the Episcopal church , really supposes that exclusive assumptions and a refusal of communion is the distinguishing feature of Episcopacy ? Not one of all the other leading denominations in the country , refuses communion in the sacraments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they only in the former respect , which they are willing to atone for by a more free communication in the latter . And there is not one of them that would not sooner go to the stake , than to hold the high church dogma now asserted in the dominant school of Episcopacy , ( and only not distinctly asserted by the Bishop of Connecticut , ) denying , unqualifiedly denying , the possibility of salvation to all who are out of the church ! We unite as brethren in a great many important enterprises for the // spread of our common faith , and the propagation of that same experimental , practical religion held by us all . We agree in some sense to differ , and differ only within the circle of Christian agreement , that there may be no schism in the body . We look for our Episcopal brethren in this great circle of agreement . A few who are willing to endure hatred and persecution from " the church , " for the sake of the love they bear toward us as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partial co-operation with us in the gospel . But not even these can suffer any communion with us in the sacraments , or the ministry of the word . " The holy church " itself , is in fact a close corporation , farming the Holy Spirit as rigidly as if it were a stock subscription  --  a miser 's box , into which the money of the world may drop , but not a cent may ever go out to mingle in the common circulation of Christian activity and communion . We do therefore agree in regarding it as a most arrant and preposterous schism , offensive to God , and to every principle of the gospel . And yet our good natured schismatic , in the diocese of Connecticut , is so happy in the complacency of his prerogative , suffers such a sweet incapacity of selfunderstanding , as really to suppose , in the very moment when he is boasting his church as " an oasis in the desert , " that it is the peculiar weakness of Christians under other names , to think their church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more beautiful than this , when he is in the very act of maintaining the exclusive right of Episcopacy , of thinking that other churches are distinguished by refusing all com-munion ! And he is not less happy in the central position of his church , than he is in its modesty and its fraternal spirit . It is always a central figure - an oasis-surrounded in his im agination by clouds of dust and waves of sand . Twice on a page he tells how it is " surrounded . " " Surrounded by all this desolation . " are surrounded by a multitude of distinct associations . " But he is not so happy in his grammar , for he undertakes again to tell his clergy , only three pages after , ( p. 13 , ) how the church is surrounded , and flats down , in the infirmity of his English , into the humblest concession any true bishop ever made . " Of all the multitude of religious denominations which surround us , ( with the single exception of the Romanists , ) we alone lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the bishop has become one of us who surround him , we are half persuaded to take back all we said of the schism ; for if he is not converted to charity by his Bible , we may certainly hope that he will be by his grammar . Jn the mean time let all bishops beware , lest by not observing the canons of their mother tongue , they break all the canons of the church . But the Bishop goes on to show , that the Christian church was designed to be perpetual as a bond of catholic unity , and a vehicle of grace to all future ages , which we could prove , we think , quite as strongly ourselves . We certainly should not use the old proof-text of persecution to establish the point , even if we had to let it go . " If any man abide not in Christ , i. e. the church , he is cast forth as a branch and is withered , and men gather them and cast them into the fire , and they are burned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It will be news to many of our readers , that Christ in this passage means the church . Old news however ; for this construction has been dreadfully proved . Standing doctrine has it been that Christ is the church , and " men , " called bishops and inquisitors , have faithfully fulfilled their office in gathering and casting // 160 Review of the Errors of the Times . into the fire , and burning ! To argue here against the shocking perversion , by which the Bishop has stripped this beautiful passage , in the fifteenth chapter of John , of its high spiritual meaning , is only to protest , in a single instance , against a wrong , which the whole Scripture must needs suffer , when the idea of a spiritual piety is lost . But , while we agree with the Bishop , that " the church is the great instrument devised by infinite wisdom for the extension of God 's mercies to mankind "  --  a perpetual or permanent instrument-we must yet ask , how an instrument ? He seems after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diffusion-a contrivance to limit grace rather than to extend it . The " revelation of God , " he says , in connection with the reasonings we are noticing , " offers salvation only through the church , and in the name of Christ . " This too he declares , was the doctrine of " all the early reformers , " quoting Calvin as proof when he says , " Beyond the bosom of the church no remission of sins is to be hoped for , nor any salvation . " And now as we write , a paper is thrown upon our table , fresh from the metropolis of American Episcopacy , declaring , that " a ministry of the apostolic succession is the divinely appointed limitation of the blessings of salvation and the gifts of the Holy Spirit ! " A most adequate limit we agree . If God were devising a plan , to make the measure of grace to man as narrow as possible , lie could hardly do it more effectually . But we Congregationalists have a way of thinking , that God in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life . And that when he dies the just for the unjust , it is that he may draw all men unto the Father . We believe that there was in the heart of our Redeemer , when he left the glory of the Father , a volume of grace and love more bountiful than heaven could hold , and we shall not easily be convinced that He has now shut up his grace within the stringent limits of Episcopacy . We think we have seen some indications that the Holy Spirit dispenses grace in many bosoms in the United States , and blesses the ministry of many teachers , who are not impounded in these limits . And the very first man whom the Savior of the world took up to his heavenly glory  --  the man to whom he said , this day thou shalt be with me in paradise , we discover was an unbaptized believer , and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception must a man have of the spirit of Jesus Christ and the measure of his gracious designs , who can suppose that he accepts Episcopacy as the boundary of his mercies to this lost world ! To suffer a personal offense , where Christ and his gospel are offended by a crime so shocking , and , if we look at the subjects themselves , so pitiable , would be scarcely less pitiable in us . We are glad to see by various expressions in the charge , that the Bishop of Connecticut has some sense of the narrowness and absurdity of this impious doctrine of limitation . He ought to have had enough to open his eyes to its fallacy and wickedness , and send him forth unshackled in the boundless fullness and freedom of the gospel , to call his church to repentance . It is not enough that he will not undertake to say , " how far any particular association may depart from the organization established by the apostles , before it shall cease to be a true church , " ( p. 12 , ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that there is no true church out of the apostolic succession . Let him have courage // enough to hold what he proves , or principle enough to repent of it . Neither is it enough to say , ( p. 11 , ) " it is not for us to know , " what will become of those who are out of the church , and then approve the declaration , that " beyond the bosom of the church there is no remission of sins to be hoped for , nor any salvation . " Calvin means no such thing as he thinks to prove by this declaration , and it is a cruel perversion thus to offer him to the world . In the very same discussion , a little farther on , he says , according to the secret predestination of God therefore , as Augustine observes , there are many sheep out of the pale of the church and many wolves within . " And when the Westminster divines declare , that there is " no ordinary possibility of salvation " out of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they assert no absolute limit of grace , within the bosom of the church . How easy is it , if a man will descend to gather scraps and patches from the writings of past ages , and will totally neglect their meaning and connection , to prove upon their authors the most pernicious and wicked dogmas ever conceived . Little does such an one understand what is a decent reverence to the past , even though he should renounce the attribute of private judgment , a hundred times an hour . Doubtless it is true that God appoints the church , and requires of those who will be saved that they give heed to His appointment . This we preach ourselves as earnestly as the Bishop-not however because there is no grace out of the church , but because they who refuse to meet God 's appointment give evidence , in that fact , as far as it goes , that they have it not . They claim with the heart to believe unto righteousness , and excuse themselves from conf*ssing with the mouth , which latter , we tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not really believe unto salvation . There is no such " ordinary possibility " as they rest in , no highway that men may open in contempt of God 's appointment . But if they doubt concerning their fitness to enter the church of God , or concerning what is requisite , or can not decide in a moment what and where it is , we believe that there is grace for them where they are-that God will cherish and love them , and help them to see the path of duty before they come under the hands of an Episcopal bishop , or enter the church in any of its forms . In such an article as this , we have not room to go over the whole argument of Christian ordination and of church order . It is an easy thing , our readers will see , within the limits of a very few pages , to assert as many false positions and advance as many groundless arguments as may require a volume to remove them . It is taken for granted , in the charge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession or derivation from the apostles of the ordaining power , which we deny . It is inferred from the fact that the church was designed to be permanent , that its mode of organization must continue unchanged ; which no more follows , than that the permanence of any civil government forbids a modification of its structure . It is argued that because a ministry is necessary to the being of the church , there must be a continuation of the same ministry , else the church ceases to be which no more follows than , if we should grant the necessity of breathing to the maintenance of life , it would follow that we can not live , without breathing over the breath of the apostles , and the line of popes , in regular succession . Opinions are imputed ' which are not held , facts stated which are not true , interpretations of Scripture given which have so many times been refuted // 162 Review of the Errors of the Times . that we are almost tired of the truth itself , authorities arrayed to establish what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signify no such thing as they are cited to prove . On pages 15 and 16 , a series of extracts from Calvin , Luther , Melancthon , and other reformers , is advanced , to show their preference for Episcopacy , and their commendation of the English episcopate . We began to test these extracts , with a view to expose their significance , not doubting that some of them , at least , were wrested from their true meaning . So we had proved . But we find that these quotations are a kind of Episcopal coin , circulating in Bishop 's charges and other like effusions , and that they have already been sifted over , as many times as the public will desire . Besides , if they are allowed to pass , what wonder is it that men who were loosening all the old fabrics of opinion and prescriptive order , and scarcely knew whether to be frightened by the confusion they had wrought , should have expressed the opinions so industriously raked together . What wonder is it that Luther should declare his willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persecute the gospel , " or even that he could " find their authority supported by the word of God ? " How many times did he offer to submit to the Pope himself on the same conditions , and how many opinions , offered in the transition state of his mind , did he afterwards reverse ? And so we may say of Melanethon , Calvin , and all the others . The transition period of the IReforrnation is now passed , and we have seen a great deal more of Anglican Episcopacy than they had , to say nothing of the riper state of the question of church order , as developed by the investigations of three centuries . Nor is it any strange thing for God to show , that men were wiser and nearer the truth , than they knew themselves . We have done little more , it will be seen , on this second head of the charge , than to sketch an outline . Happily nothing more is necessary . It is one of those ecclesiastical jumbles of scrap reasoning , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it substance enough to sustain an argument-to arrange , describe , or define it , so as to bring it within the range of any logical function . As with the s*veepings of the streets , the only fit instrument of removal is one that may be used with the hands . The only thing in this head which we can distinctly see , is the figure of a Bishop asserting his prerogatives , and proving to the world that there is a virtue in him , which goes out neither from the sanctity of his character , nor from the power of his doctrine , nor from the wisdom of his rule , nor from the hem of his garment ,  - -  hut the magic potency of which , discharged , at will , from his fingers , can make the only true priest , and impart the requisite power to Christian sacraments . If it were not the perpetual custom and prescriptive right of all bishops , to expend the force of their office in glorifying the same-if they did not seem to think it an essential element of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would venture to suggest , whether it might not be more consistent with Christian modesty to yield to the common law of decency , in this respect , and suffer others to sound the trumpet for them . Or if the Christian Pharisees must emulate the Jewish , let them sound a trumpet before their charities and not before their prerogatives . Or a little better still , and withal a little more apostolic , if they must needs glory , let them glory of the things which concern their infirmities . The pedlers of quack nostrums and drug-magic may well enough boast the potency of their spells , but ecclesiastical nostrums and incantations ought to * proclaimed // with at least some feint of modesty . Before . we pass to the head on baptism , we have a grave question to propound for the consideration of *ll sober Episcopalians . The Bishop , in this head on the succession , has shown to his own satisfaction , and we understand to the universal satisfaction of his clergy , that his is the only true church . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction , that baptism is that rite which introduces to the church . But it happens , that the Bishop himself was baptized as a Puritan , and therefore , unless we are in the church , neither is he ; and the sad consequence follows , that this unhappy diocese is ruled by a Bishop who is himself out of the church ! If it be replied , that he was confirmed by a true Bishop , and thus introduced into the church , then it is because the confirmation of nothing makes it a sound and potent reality-a feat of magic , which surpasses all others yet heard of under the succession ! And if there be nothing in this argument , if , simple and strait to the mark as it is , it must yet pass for " metaphysics , " will our Episcopal friends answer the following question , predicated on the fact that we , who take the singular plural in our office of review , were baptized by Episcopal handsis it more likely that we , with our Episcopal baptism and Puritan ordination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Episcopal ordination , is in the true church and a true officer in the same ? Are we not at least in the church ? And is it not as clear as the Bishop 's own doctrine that he is not even that ? We come now to matters of more gravity , even to the practical views of Christian piety itself . And here first of all , we desire to gather from the charge and offer to our readers , if possible , a clear and definite conception of what it is , in the view of Connecticut Episcopacy , to be a true Christian and an heir of eternal life in Christ Jesus  --  the means and requisites of salvation , and the grounds of Christian hope . " The true economy of the Christian religion , " he says , ( p.2l , ) " regards men as by nature children of wrath . " Very well-here we begin together . How do they become any better than children of wrath ? " It " the Christian religion says the Bishop , ( p. 21 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in Scripture the kin*dorn of Satan , and transfers them , by baptism , into the family , household and kingdom of the Savior-where they are called children of God , ' members of Christ , ' and heirs of the kingdom of heaven . ' From adults , repentance and faith are required as qualifications for baptism , and from infants there is required a subsequent repentance and faith , which stands in the nature of a debt , and which they are bound to discharge when they come to years ofdiscretion . Afler baptism , the person is regarded as in a state of covenant relationship with God ; becomes entitled to the aids of his Holy Spirit ; and through the instrumentalities provided in his church , is daily set forward in the nurture and admonition of the Lord . This change of state effected in baptism is called in Scripture and in the language of the baptismal office re , , generation . " Again , ( p. 31-2 , ) showing his clergy how to preach the true doctrine , he says " Let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost , become by that act , ( not in name only , but in deed and in truth , ) members of Christ , ' children of God , ' and heirs of the kingdom of heaven ' - that , by the renunciation of the dominion of Satan and their adoption into the kingdom of Christ , they are restored to a state of favor with God , and brought within the sphere of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit . And this is not to be regarded as a mere temporary act , but as the initiation into an abiding state . * * * It is on this sure ground too that parents may be encouraged to bring up their children , in the nurture and admonition of the Lord . They should raise their own minds to the high and gracious relationship in which their children are placed and the first sentiment impressed upon their youthful hearts should be , that they // are in very deed children of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and become capable of com1 ) rehending so high a mystery , they should be made to understand that in the sacrament of baptism they received the spirit of ' adoption , ' by which they are enabled to address God as their Father , to regard Christ as their brother as well as Redeemer , and the Holy Ghost as their indwelling companion and sanctifier . They should be taught to regard their bodies as temples of God-that the Spirit of God dwehheth in them , and is ever ready to guide , quicken , and assist them in their duties ; unless through their own depravity and perseverance in sin , they obstinately resist or quench , or grieve away the heavenly Guest . " This language seems to have a meaning , and some would say a strong one . It seems even to assert the fact of a spiritual change , in all baptized persons , answering to that which we call regeneration . If they are " not tn name only , but in deed and in truth members of Christ , and heirs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adoption , " what more , in kind , can they have till they enter heaven itself ? But we must know that all these terms which , to us , have so high spiritual significance and power , lose every thing but a mere formal import in the uses of Episcopacy . The church is Christ  --  the church is the kingdom of heaven . To be members of Christ , therefore , is only to be a member of the church by haptisni ; to be an heir of the kingdom of heaven , is only the same thing . And what is yet more flat if possible to us , to have " the Sprtt of adoption " is only to be in the church , where the subject is entitled , as by covenant , to the adopting mercy of the Spirit , if be will only suffer it . For the reader will observe , that the person who has received the Spirit of adoption is likely not to know it , unless lie is informed of the fact . " They should he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A kind of adoption , it will be perceived , after all , which makes them bastards only , not sons . And that we are right in this conclusion , is further evident from the fact that the Bishop sneers ( p. 20 ) at our notion of a " sudden change of heart , wrought by the operation of the Divine Spirit ; " which would be too absurd even for a bishop , if he must substitute a change of heart equally sudden wrought under the hands of a priest . He also speaks with contempt ( p. 30 ) of such a change as wrought in a " passive " subject ; and it is scarcely to be believed that a writer as loose as the Bishop himself , would still maintain that a mere passive infant undergoes an internal or spiritual change , and passes from death to life , under the manipulating agency of a priest . The true meaning of the Bishop , in regard to the efficacy of baptism , will be seen in expressions like these in the passages just quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aids of the Holy Spirit , and through the instrumentalities provided is daily set forward , " &amp;c . " J'his change of state not of internal state but of personal condition effected in baptism . " " Brought within the sphere of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit . " " Ready to guide and assist , unless through their own depravity and perseverance tn ssn , they grieve away the heavenly Guest . " He also quotes a passage from Augustine , in which he distinguishes between the moral change as gradual , and the change of state effected in baptism as instantaneous. - " I'he renovation after the image of God is not effected in a moment like regeneration in baptism , which is done in a moment , by the remission of sins . " So far then we have arrived in tracing the Bishop 's scheme of salvation . The subject is brought into a new state where his sins are remitted , we suppose ; where the Holy Spirit is a covenanted mercy ; where the warm bosom of church nurture is offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a good opportunity for salvation . He is still the same man , but in a different case-no more a child of wrath , but still , if we look at his heart , a child of the devil . Is he now safe ? Will the Holy Spirit certainly renovate his nature and bring him unto everlasting life , now that he is in the church ? No , that is not affirmed . For the Bishop says , ( p. 22 , ) " After all this , it is to ' be feared that there will be but too many who will have received the grace of God in vain . " And again , ( p. 23 , ) " The sacrament of baptism will always prove efficacious , unless hindered by the unworthiness of the receiver . " He also anticipates the danger , in a passage already quoted , that some " through their own depravity and perseverance in sin will grieve away the heavenly Guest . " What then ? The man is regenerated , he is a child of God , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The answer is , that he is now " daily set forward in the nurture of the Lord " - that being " within the sphere of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit , " he must " pray to be renewed day by day in the spirit of his mind , through the covenanted aids of the 1-loly Spirit . " In a word , he must grow holy . Then and thus he shall be saved . But how holy must he be ? This is a very important question-a question still of life and death . He must undergo no sudden radical change of motive and principle , which shall make him a new man in Christ Jesus-this is New Light theology ; but he must begin and grow better , continually better and more holy , till he is holy enough . There must of course be some point where he passes over the equinoctial line into a state of salvation , and if he should fall short of it but a hair 's breadth , it will of course damn him forever . But let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal life is his . A most sudden , momentous and blessed change ! only it is wrought by a hair 's breadth of human worthiness , instead of a great spiritual revolution from darkness to light by the Spirit of God ! But suppose a man is dying-for the gospeL is given to bless even the dying . If not baptized , that must of course be done . The patient will then ask , whether that is enough ? and he will have a serious meaning in the question . No , he must he told . He is only brought into the " sphere of the Holy Spirit " - " set forward in the nurture of the Lord ; " and that he may not " receive the grace of God in vain , " lie must " pray to be renewed day by day " - he must grow in grace . But alas ! he has not much time to grow , and is dismally afraid that he can not grow enough ! " Is there nothing better that you can tell me ? Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will answer for a dying mana sinner who is all guilt and has no worthiness ' at all . Did I not read of a certain thief whom the Savior pardoned on the cross ? - is there not some possibility of a great and momentous change , whereby a sinner like me , without merit or the possibility of merit , may truly become a new creature in Christ Jesus , and pass at once from death unto life ? * is the reply ; we do not believe in sudden changesthis is the New Light theology . You must GROW ! " Now it may he true enough , as the Bishop intimates , that many are entering the Episcopal church to find " repose , " but there is , alas ! no repose there for a dying sinner ! Or if a man is sorely pressed by a sense of his sins-for such there often are , whether it be an infirmity or not-if he cries with David , " Mine iniquities have gone over mine head , as an heavy burden they are too heavy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? // He was baptized in infancy , but as yet has never found the " Spirit of adoption " in him-never prayeddoes not know how to pray . Of course he is reminded that he was " regenerated " long ago , and made to be , " not in name only but in deed and in truth an heir of the kingdom of heaven . " But he asks what he shall do to be saved , and , fool that he is , can not be convinced that his regeneration has done him any good . " But you have not persevered in grace , " the Bishop tells him . " Well , can you give me the grace again ? " " No ; but you must grow-grow in grace ; this will ease your burden ! " " I could if there were any principle of growth in me , but I am dead - my mind is dark-my way is hedged up-what I do brings me no peace-I do it in the spirit of a slave . Can you not show me some provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - will not God somehow begin a good work in me ? Is there no distinct operation of God , which grafts men into Christ and makes them live in him as branches in a vine ? " " Yes , this was done in your baptism . Remember your baptism-read your prayers-we have many excellent prayers in our holy liturgy-read these and grow ! " The poor man retires doubly lost and confounded , and with eyes too full of tears to read , tries vainly after a Savior in his Prayer-book , which the Bible would give him free as the air and powerful as omnipotence . But if this Episcopal faith is not good for the dying or the serious , it is yet , for the proud and the thoughtless , for those who have too little sense of religion to suffer any critical attention to its fearful requirements , the best that can be devised . Are they not " regenerate , " are they not " children of God ? " The stiff requisition of a new spiritual birth , and a sudden renunciation of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . Abrupt changes are mortifying and odious . They wish to quit sin gradually . They prefer to grow . As to the fear that they may not grow quite enough , this to them is a matter of no concern , for practically and really , they do not believe that any thing depends upon it . These will love the Bishop 's religion , and flock to his church as flies to the ointment in which they perish . Some will love its imposing foriiialities , and praise it as a tasteful religion ; for the dress which the wearer is ever admiring himself must needs be tasteful . Some will wish to figure in the official pomps that others are willing to look at . All , as the Bishop very frankly admits , will come seeking " repose . " Repose from the din of an active and serious religion-repose from the disgusts that are incident to a faith which has power enough to stir a ferment in the baseness of human nature-repose , especially , from thought and the rugged teachings of a system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pars magna Ita1ia* est , si verum admittimus , in qua , Nemo togam sumit , NISI MORTUUS . We do not say that spiritual death must of course reign universally under such a faith . There are some good men in a faith that is much nearer to Italy than the Bishop 's . And we know that there are many , who truly love God and walk by faith , in the church over which he presides . We only say , that the Bishop 's gospel is as good a one to quiet sin , and satisfy the gay , and guard the empire of spiritual death , as a Swiss regiment to keep the peace of another Bishop 's diocese on the Tiber . The vice of this schcme , and it is about as great a vice as it can have , is that it sets up no distinct ground of salvation . It blurs over // all the energetic and piercing demands of the gospel , and hides them from the sight . It tells the subject distinctly enough , that he must come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not say that he will be if he comes . And yet it does not tell him any precise thing he must do , or change he must suffer , in order to be . To the dying sinner it can offer no definite direction , only to tell him that no sudden change can prepare him for heaven . Upon the thoughtless and gay , it enforces no such stiff demand as may arrest them in the ways of folly . But it trusts to the gradual and sentimental effect of forms  --  to bows , genuflections , respouses and Christmas pomps , mingled with homilies , as indefinite and pointless as the scheme requires them to be , and interspersed with sacraments of a mystic power-for whatever something of some kind is necessary to fit a soul for heaven . We do not say that it artfully hides the gospel . No art could do it so effectually . It is the more to he reprobated , because it unites so much of the letter of the gospel , with so little of its power . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done the Bishop 's doctrine injustice . If so , we should rejoice to know it . We doubted ourselves , whether he did not possibly mean that something more than a change of state or condition , is accomplished in baptism-some change in the subject himself-some incipient grace in the temper-some beginning of a good work . We took up this conclusion three or four times , and were obliged as often to dismiss it because of its insignificance . If by such a beginning he would intend a quickening unto life eternal , the introduction of a new aim and principle reversing the aim of nature , that is all we mean by conversion or spiritual regeneration . It is , in our view , the beginning , only the beginning of a new law in the heart  --  the law of the spirit of life . But this he can not mean , as we just now said , because he would then hold to a change of heart as sudden , " and much more " passive , " than any that was ever inculcated by us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the subject of baptism , it would come to nothing , because he has no confidence in any " persevering grace " or permanent effect , which differs the subject radically from the unregenerate . The only permanent thing he believes in , is church membership and the church . The subject he declares is initiated into an abiding state , i. e. into the church , the " sphere of the Holy Spirit , " but " perseverance in sin** is yet the only moral perseverance he recognizes . Possibly the Bishop would endeavor to make out , that baptism is the beginning , in every subject , of some moral and internal change , which is gradually begun , and yet involves no radical and sweeping change of principle  --  a kind of seed implanted which is afterwards to grow . But such a beginning , if it has any meaning , is the beginning of something instead of nothing , and a gradual transition from nothing to something , it will somewhat puzzle his ingenuity to conceive . And if the seed implanted is truly vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we mean by conversion . If it is a dead seed , or is killed a day afterwards , as he seems to suppose it will be , then it may rot in the soul , but it will never grow . The subject may be still in the " sphere of the Holy Spirit , " in the church  --  but he is there as dead in trespasses and sins , and the seed , the quickening of spiritual life , is yet to be imparted again , that is , he must experience a second time all that we mean by conversion ; and as the transition from nothing to something must be sudden , it must be a sudden conversion . The dif // 168 Review of the Errors of the Times . ference then will be , that he maintains a hundred or less , sudden changes from death unto life , instead of the one maintained by us . That he ever pushed his mind so far into the import of his own scheme , we , of course , do not suppose . This he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion who is too impatient of thinking , to ascertain what he means by his own doctrine , has this short answer . With the sick child he cries , my head my head ! to every argument which thoroughly sifts his meaning . But if we allow the Bishop his gradual beginning , of something or any thing , just as he or any other will have it , still our description of his scheme will remain practieaUy true as already given  --  a mere change of state without a change of character . Practically , the church will consist of persons who are distinguished , not in kind but in degree only . Being a net which gathers of every kind , no line of doctrine will be drawn to separate the kinds , for they are not distinguishable in kind but only in degree . But the great net will drag them on toward the shore , in a promiscuous haul , to be sorted there as they may . Some in the church will be grown a little more than others , as they make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they are all " regenerate , ** all " set forward , " all " heirs of the kingdom of heaven . " They will be addressed as persons that differ in degree , but never in kind . Salvation will be hung on no broad intelligible distinction of principle , as between death and life , but on the question of more or less . They will be saved or damned , as more or lessmore church-wise or more wicked - more upright or more profligate - more punctilious in observing the sacranients and saints ' days , or more backward and careless . In the mean time , no effort will be expended in this question of degrees , to show how much is necessary , or how little will do . In the nature of the case , no human penetration can solve such a question . In this view , the Bishop 's faith is a most cruel one , and its teachers , who thus blur over the great distinction of life and death in the gospel , and blind their people to what is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer for . But the Bishop undertakes to show , that his doctrine of baptismal regeneration is one that has been held , substantially , by all the Protestant families in the church . He brings together ( p. 25 ) four distinct passages from Calvin , which , taken apart from their connection and the subject matter he was discussing , give him a show of countenance . Whereas it will be found , that Calvin is only discussing baptism and its advantages , in bringing us into a covenant relation to God . That Calvin means no such thing as he is made to affirm , in this disingenuous and garbled compilation , is clear enough from other passages . When discussing the force of sacraments , he says , ( book IV , chap . 14 , ) " There are others who attribute to the sacraments I know not what latent virtues , which are nowhere represented as communicated to them by the word of God . For the sophistical schools have maintained , with one consent , that the sacraments of the new law , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confer grace , provided we do not obstruct their operation by any mortal sin . It is impossible to express the pestilent and fatal nature of this opinion . Indeed it is cvidentl y diabolical . " Now the Bishop ( p. 23 ) gives it as the opinion of his church , that " God 's sacraments have their effects where the receiver doth not put any bar against them , " and that they will always prove efticacious , unless hindered by // the unworthiness of the receiver . The very thing that Calvin calls a " pestilent , fatal , diabolical " error ! Besides , Calvin , on the third of John , defines regeneration to be a pure work of the Spirit , and does not even allow , as we certainly think he ought , that the water mentioned in connection with the Spirit , has any reference to baptism . " To he horn of water and of the Spirit , is no other than to receive that influence of the Spirit , which does in the soul what water does on the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " horn of water and of the Spirit , " he declares is equivalent to saying , " By the Spirit , who in the ablution of the souls of the faithful performs the office of water . " ( Book IV , chap . 16 . ) Nor does Calvin any where suffer himself to call baptism regeneration , unless possibly he may do it in the sense , that it signifies or symbolizes regeneration as a work of the Holy Spirit . Luther is also quoted in a passage , which , taken in the mere words , seems to assert the Bishop 's doctrine of baptismal regeneration . And yet he means no such thing , nor any thing like it . He is commenting on Gal . iii , 27 . For all ye that are baptized into Christ , have put on Christ . The language is addressed to believers as such , in the second person . As such he explains it . And as baptism is the formality of Christian experience , he so speaks of it as one or identical with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man therefore is made a Christian by hearing " - " the hearing of faith . " And when upon the text-For , in Christ Jesus , neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision , but a new creature-lie speaks of regeneration as a spiritual change wrought by the Holy Spirit , without any reference to baptism , and in terms every way coincident with what the Bishop calls New Light theology . Is it possible for the Bishop of Connecticut , or any other bishop on the face of the earth , to be so ignorant of Martin Luther 's doctrine , as not to know that he held the absolute bondage of the human will , and a doctrine of decrees and election , stiff enough to satisfy a Mohammedan ? And yet he expects to find Martin Luther asserting his doctrine of baptismal regeneration , by which every subject of baptism is declared to be introduced into a salvable state , nay , a state of salvation , if he does not hinder the blessing by his " unworthiness " ! And when Luther goes on to say- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there arise new and holy affections , fear , trust in God , hope , there ariseth a new will , " language that he would not dare apply to the subjects of baptism himself , the Bishop is nowise startled by the terms , but still thinks that Luther is saying this of all the baptized nations of pollution , the ungodly priests , and the legions of enmity hunting for his life-these all have " righteousness , peace , consolation , joy in the Holy Ghost , salvation , and Christ himself " The Bishop goes on ( p. 26 ) citing from the standards of the Dutch Reformed and Presbyterian churches , and from our own Saybrook Platform , to the same effect , viz , that baptism is regeneration . But it is manifest to any theological reader , nay , to any reader of merely common intelligence , that the extracts , on their face , assert no such thing , but simply that baptism is a sign or symbol of regeneration , which , so far as we know , no Christian has ever denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and only five sentences distant from the passage quoted by the Bishop , says expressly- " Although it be a great sin to contemn or neglect this ordinance , yet grace and salvation are not so inseparably annexed to it , as that no person can be regenerate or saved without it , or that all // that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated . " And if they are not undoubtedly regenerated , can any thing be more certain than that something else than baptism was necessary , in their opinion , to regeneration ? But the marvelous thing is , that the Bishop of Connecticut , before opening these confessions of faith , should expect , that so many churches holding , as they certainly did , whatever they may do now , the doctrine of special grace , absolute election , and even limited atonement , and known to all history by these distinctions , should yet assert a doctrine of baptismal regeneration , which brings every subject into a state , where , " if he puts no bar " to the covenanted grace , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes , as a theologian , here , we should not envy him . And now , if the public will believe it , this marvelous chapter of theological criticism is introduced by a preface , not less modest than the following : ( p. 24 . ) " It is not a little remarkable , that the doctrine of baptismal regeneration is the authoritative teaching the italics are not ours of the chief Protestant denominations of the world . This fact demonstrates the little regard , that is paid to their standards of faith . It may well be questioned , whether the great mass of dissenters know much about their authoritative standards ! " Truly we thank him ! What an extreme pity it is , that we could not have a successor of the apostles to expound our standards to us ! We are not sure , that he would not be able to extract the doctrine of baptismal regeneration , from Calvin 5 dogma of unconditional repro-bation ! But the Bishop has made other discoveries equally remarkableand especially that our New England churches , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , that " their religious views seem not to have greatly differed , from those of the church of England . " ( p. 27 . ) And this relapse towards the church of England , according to the Bishop 's own showing , ( see the note , ) begun fifty years earlier , in " a sensible decline as to the life and power of godliness , " in a decline " in their zeal and strictness of morals , " in a general inattentiveness " to their spiritual concerns " - language that he quotes from Trumbull , to prove , according to his own construction , that " their Calvinism had lost its asperity , and their fanaticism had moderated its extravagances . " We accept the authority but not the construction . There was just such a decline . And the synod convened in Massachusetts , in 1679 , to consider the mournful state into which the cause of virtue and religion had fallen , specify , among others , the following significant particulars " a decay of godliness and secret apostasy among professors , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " a common practice of traveling on the Sabbath day , " " a neglect of family prayer , " " inordinate passions , " " intemperance , " " unlawful gaming , light behavior , and breaches of the seventh commandment , " " a want of truth , and promise breaking . " A most excellent preparative , doubtless , for Episcopacy . Or if it be taken only as a proof , that " Calvinism had lost much of its asperity , and that fanaticism had greatly moderated its extravagances , " as the Bishop declares , no very bad compliment is it to their Calvinism , or their fanaticism . Another proof of this relapse towards Episcopacy , is found in the fact , that a synod holden in Massachusetts , in 1662 , decided , that persons baptized in infancy , " understanding the doctrine of faith and publicly professing their assent thereunto ; not scandalous in life , and solemnly owning the covenant // 171 before the church-their children are to be baptized . " And yet the synod which made this decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recede " from the Platform of Church Discipline established in 1648 , and only designed to give " a more particular explication of principles " included therein , which " needed yet a more explicit stating and reducing unto practice . " And only eighteen years after , in 1680 , in another synod , they adopted a confession of faith , which asserted , among other things , that the baptized are " not of course regenerate , " and is the original , in almost every respect , of the Say . brook Confession , flow much this looks like a relapse towards Episcopacy , the public will judge . A third proof of this relapse is found in the fact , that in 1664 , it was declared , " that the children of the church be accepted as real meml3ers of the church ; and that , when they are grown up , being examined by the officer , if it appear that they be duly qualified to participate in the Lord 's Supper , such persons be admitted to full communion . " The very doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who " received their membership in infancy , " coming " to their trial and examination before they are received to the Lord 's Supper " - the very doctrine of our churches at this moment Last of all it is given as proof of our Episcopal tendencies , at that time , that the Saybrook Platform , adopted in 1708 , accounted it sufficient to hold " the doctrinal articles of the church of England ; " when it is a well known fact that our churches never dissented from those articles , hut always , on every occasion , expressed their hearty satisfaction with them as we do now ! With the exception of the Plymouth ministers , all who came over , came as non-conformists of the church of England , not as separatists from it ; and their language ever was- " We , who are by nature Englishmen , do desire to hold forth the same doctrine of religion which we know to be held by the churches of England . " But now , alas ! after we had come so nearly back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " morals declining , " and Christians " growing inattentive to their spiritual concerns , " and it really seemed as if we were just about to fall into the lap of Episcopacy , the New Light theology came into the field , and the fair promise was blasted . Since that time , things have been growing worse and worse . Sects have multiplied , and baptism declined , and " practical religion , " so says the Bishop , has been nothing but a " change of heart wrought by the operation of the Holy Ghost ! " ( pp. 20 and 29 . ) Now this " New Light theology , " according to the Bishop , was " introduced by Wesley , Whitefield and Edwards . " But Wesley and Whitefield were both presbyters of the church of England , one from the Arminian side of that church , and the other from the Calvinistic ; both illustrations of that rank combustion which must ever be expected , when a fire is once kindled in the body of spiritual death , and when legions of enmity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , combine to exasperate the warmth of the occasion . Wesley , however , never came to New England , and Whitefield , when he caine , was so carefully admonished by Edwards , in regard to his censorious and fanatical tendencies  --  the church of England man by the wise and sober teacher of New England-that a degree of coldness ensued between them . Nor is there any doubt that , if he had taken the advice which Edwards and a great many of our wisest men gave him , the wretched scenes of fanaticism enacted under Davenport and others who took his lead , would never have been heard of . The // 172 Review of the Errors of the Times . truly dreadful storm that swept through our churches , in that day , actually began in the bosom of the Anglican church itself . A presbyter ordained by the Bishop of Gloucester , and warmly commended by him , was the moving cause of all this fury and disorder ! But what is the New Light theology ? " It appears , " says the Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the subtleties of Calvinism. " ( p. 20 . ) A compound of feeling and Calvinism ! - and this for a theology !  --  and this , yet again , for a description of Jonathan Edwards ! Is it necessary for us to inform the Bishop of Connecticut , that New England theologians have another way of making theology , or , if it please , New theology , than by stirring up mixtures and compounds ? The witch-broth style of Episcopacy-patches and scraps  --  a lock of St. Ignatius , and a fin. ger of St. Cyprian , and a tooth of Laud , and dead men 's bones from every region , simmered and stirred by the anointed wisdom and magic authority of a successor of the apostles-this is not our way of making theology . Least of all is it the way of Jonathan Edwards , a man renowned all over the world , and among all rigid thinkers , and in chairs of philosophy , for his analytic keenness , his cool and demonstrative logic , and the intense vigor with which he grasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human thought . And yet the Bishop of Connecticut verily believes that the theology of Jonathan Edwards is made up of a compound of excited feeling and some of the subtleties of Calvinism ! We profess no implicit assent to the speculations of Edwards ; but that any intelligent person should thus conceive the man , exceeds our understanding . But wherein is this theology new ? According to the Bishop 's own conception , it is nothing but Calvinism , with a little excited feeling stirred in , to give it action . And as Calvinism is older than the thirtv.nine articles , and as the feeling stirred in is not doctrine or theology at all , it follows that our New Light theology is a little older than the theology of the church of England . And so it verily is ; for the doctrine of a great spiritual change , wrought in the heart by the Spirit of God , developed by Edwards in his own way , and by other New England theologians before and after him in theirs , is still in radical agreement with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of this theology . " According to the popular apprehension of this scheme , ( p. 20 , ) the essence of religion consists in a sudden change , wrought by the Holy Ghost , without the instrumentality of means ; - perceptible to the mind , but independent of the co-operation of those who are the subjects of it . Connecting this experimental change with the Calvinistic doctrine of joerseeerance ire grace , the work of salvation is completed . There seems no further need of the aids of divine grace , nor of any of the instrumentalities which God has appointed for the salvation of men ; - no need of a church ; no need of a ministry ; no need of sacraments . The work is finished ! " To the eloquence of this ecclesiastical sneer we are duly sensible . But the utter dereliction of truth , in every sentence of the passage quoted , is but a fit accompaniment . If it were said that our hearers do misconstrue our doctrine through their perversity , and do many of them practically hold , that nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied of their conversion , we agree it may be so . And do none , in the Episcopal church , stay content with their baptism in the same way-resting in it and deeming it enough thus to be " regenerated " and made " heirs of the kingdom of heaven ? " Man is a creature all perversity , and he will try for a resting place in sloth and self-indulgence under any and every doctrine . But if the Bishop means to say , that our hearers have a right to any such impres // sions under our preaching , or that they are not guarded against them most earnestly and by reiterated expostulations , it is unqualifiedly false . Nor again do we teach , that the change of heart , which is wrought by the Holy Ghost , is " without the instrumentality of means . " Such language can be found most abundantly used , but always in reference to the change most analytically and immediately considered as a work of the divine agency-always in connection with means more remotely insisted on-hearing the word , prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we say that this change is " perceptible to the mind . " That is a Methodist doctrine , regarded by us as a superstition . We only say , that if so great a change is wrought in the dispositions of the soul , the subject is likely to discover it by appropriate evidences ; though he may be so confused , or so distrustful of himself , as to go through life in doubt of his good estate . No recent school among us declares that man is " the *fllcient agent in the work , " ( see note , p. 20 . ) On the contrary , the school alluded to expressly and uniformly denies it . We do not say that there is now " no further need of the aids of divine grace-no need of a church , no need of a ministry , no need of sacraments ,  --  the work is finished . " On the contrary , it is expressly taught , and solemnly insisted on , by every teacher in New England , that regeneration is only the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new life ; and that if they do not go on to make their calling sure , by lives of obedience towards God and charity towards their fellow men , their confidence is the hope of a hypocrite . We have a church , and , what is of some consequence in our estimation , we have discipline in it . We have a ministry , which is not a priesthood , which also we think of some consequence-no people ever loved their ministry more , or followed their ministrations with more avidity . We have sacraments  --  and that too , clear of all priestly magic and incantation ; and in these sacraments we seek our edification . And if we do not think it essential to an affectionate and persuasive remembrance of our Savior 's death , that we should eat him , perhaps the intelligent Christians of some future age may not the less respect our piety or our understanding . In regard to the disuse , or the little improvement that is made of infant baptism , charged upon us by the Bishop , under cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( p. 19 , ) we have yet to say , that there is more truth in the charge than there should be . Though if we were called to choose between our own deficient improvement of the rite , and the rank papal delusion , by which the Bishop and his church make it nearly the whole matter of practical religion , we could not long hesitate . We have no wish to parry the Bishop 's strictures on this head . Here , for once , ( and it is the only instance in his charge , ) he has hit his mark , and we are willing that our churches should see it . At the same time , what conception of practical religion has the man who can say , upon the simple discovery that we make too little of infant baptism- " This is a pitiable account of the state of practical religion among one of the largest bodies of Christians in New England ! " ( p. 19 . ) How could he say more significantly that , with him , baptism and practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our jealousy of this most unevangelical and monstrous error , which has induced the neglect of which the Bishop complains-not any new views in theology . In our own little diocese , we have always aimed to make this rite significant , and secure its legitimate effects ; and many others , we know , // are endeavoring to do the same . We hold that baptized children are members of the church , confided to its watch , and entitled , when they evince the necessary qualifications , to the Lord 's Supper . We collect them in a body , with the whole church , for familiar counsel , instruction and prayer , as often as we go to the table of Christ ourselves . We consider them in this rite as presumptively included in the faith of their parents ; and the rite is permitted , we believe , on the ground of a presumption suffered that they are to grow up as spiritually regenerate persons , and have therefore a right a to baptism as regenerate persons , even before they have the discretion to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine life may not be imparted in infancy , as well as after sin has hardened the sensibilities and bronzed the soul in guilt . If it be not true , if they can be brought to newness of life only after they begin to press the confines of manhood , then are they , in the interval , the most unprivileged of all beings . Whether this presumption , which God beautifully offers in the rite of baptism , shall be realized , will depend on parental and church faithfulness , ( coincidently with a divine influence , ) where it ought ; not on some official magic in the rite itself . And therefore , as the gospel clearly teaches , we baptize only the household of believers , and do not sufl*r the rite to be made as insignificant as it can be , by interposing the absurd fiction of sponsors , to thrust them out of their place and make their faith of none effect . Whether they become really regenerate persons , is to be decided afterwards , by the same tests which discriminate the faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular exercise , mental or bodily , through which they have passed , but by the evidence they give of love to God , and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ , their repentance of sin , and their desire to fulfill God 's holy will in acts of communion , prayer , self-denial , and charity . They are to be distinguished in kind , not in degree only . In this view , we make no breach upon the great doctrine of regeneration as a spiritual change , necessary to all men as a quickening of the dead . But we do give a real significance to household baptism , as a beautiful rite of the church , and one in the due improvement of which-never without  --  the church may expect to receive the promise made to her , and to her children , and become the organ of power which God designed her to be . And now , as we have spoken somewhat severely of the Bishop 's charge , which we regard as a tissue of errors , at once feeble and pernicious , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are moved , in our criticism , by mere words . Our opinion of the third of John does not correspond with that of Calvin . We believe that by water , in connection with the Spirit , he does intend baptism . Baptism was in use before Christ 's day , as a rite of political regeneration , in which the Gentile proselyte and his household were accounted to be cleansed of their pollutions and born over , so as to become the descendants of Abraham . We mean the same by our ceremony of naturalization , accounting the subject therein to become a natural born American . Having a kingdom to establish both visible and spiritual , Christ takes up the current rite and applies it over , as a seal of initiation , we may suppose , into his twofold kingdom ; - saying , except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , be can not see the kingdom of heaven . Art thou a master in Israel and knowest not these things ? He is thus brought , we may suppose , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true import fulfilled , is also // 175 inducted , as one spiritually regenerated , into that higher kingdom of which the other is only the husk or sign . If , therefore , our Episcopal brethren will call baptism regeneration , in the sense that it introduces into the church , we shall not quarrel about the word , provided they will also speak of a higher and spiritual regeneration distinct from this and shadowed by it . Whether Christ intended to use the term in this double sense , is a question not easily decided . But this at least is plain , that he did intend to discourse of spiritual regeneration as the MAIN THiNG  --  a thing of as much higher consequence , as the quickening of a divine life is of more consequence than a formal introduction to the visible church . This was his subject at the time , about which all his argum eats and illustrations spent their force . As flesh is born of the flesh , he was urging , so there is a spirit which is born of the Spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the water of baptism falls where it is sprinkled , he says-The wind-that lively symbol of God 's unseen agency  --  the wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth ; so is every one that is born of the Spirit . This is THE regeneration , on which the Savior 's mind was specially if not exclusively fixed . And now , if our Episcopal friends will not deny this great and marvelous change ; if they will hold it up as the summit of Christian truth , and the beginning of Christian experience ; if they will speak of it as often as fifty times , where they name the other once ; if they will expend the stress of their ministry in the inculcation of this great doctrine of spiritual regeneration , as a distinct matter , and give to the husk what value a husk is worth ; - we will utter no word of complaint . Here we leave the subject , expressing our profound regret , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the truth of Christ exhibited in a manner so pointless , unintelligent and frigid , as this charge of their Bishop indicates . Woe unto such among them , as can be saved only so as by fire ; for there is no fire here . Were we doomed to preach this kind of doctrine , we should feel that we were dulling the wits , and blinding the consciences , and , if they have any , starving the gracesof those whom Christ sent us to feed . There is no quickening vigor here -- no divine energy . Such doctrine pierces to no dividing asunder -- pushes the lost man to no determinate result . No light shines through it , save what is refracted through the water of baptism . It is a paralytic gospel , waiting by the pool , to which , if Christ could stretch his compassion so far , he would say , Rise , take up thy bed and walk.
