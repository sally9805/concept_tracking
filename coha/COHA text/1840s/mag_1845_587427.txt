txt WE took leave of Boston , under a bright sun , with a favorable breeze , amid the blessings of the multitude assembled to witness our departure . Our noble steamer bounded over the waves as if instinct with life , and the dark line of American coast grew fainter at every revolution of the wheel . But pleasure and pain are always near enough to shake hands . On the third morning , we encountered the last struggles of a gale that still lingered on the seas . The passengers grew pale and sick at the heaving of the ship , and terrified at the masses of water that broke against her sides . They silently withdrew to their berths , where nothing was heard , save the uproar of the storm , the trampling of feet , and the shrill notes of the sailor 's song , as they rose upon the blast . On the fifth day the scene had entirely changed . The clouds were chased away by the western winds , and the glad passengers crowded the deck to taste of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here as in the hills and valleys of the earth . Around lay the deep unquiet sea , concealing in its unfathomed stream so many mysteries unrevealed to man . The sky stretched its blue mantle , without spot or stain , down to the very horizon , while the great king of day dispersed , as he climbed the steep heavens , light and life to the subjugated world that revolved about his throne . But to the moon belongs the sceptre of the seas . She is a queen , and storms and tides are the ministers of power that move at her command . There is no peace in her watery domain ; she is a capricious sovereign , most to be dreaded when most she smiles . The experienced mariner regards her with awe , her uprisings and down-sittings , her growth and decay , and upon the changes of her countenance hangs the good or ill that is to come . Yet , oh moon ! boast not of thyself ! Thou , too , art the vassal of another greater than thee . Nightly dost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto the earth , and in all thy wanderings thou art bound by fetters thou canst not break . Thou , too , like the earth , hast had thy throes , and the history of thy misfortunes is read in the astronomer 's glass . Whole seas have dried up from thy bosom , and thou hast been rent by inner convulsions , until light is made visible through thy entire orb . The saloon of the steamer resembles a coffee-house , where the guests spend their time in reading , playing at dice or dominoes , or descanting upon the pleasures of travelling by sea , while their brains are rocked as in a cradle . I did not believe them ; it is against nature . A ship is a prison-house , filled with a subtle , loathsome vapor , that poisons the blood , and cuts short the mariner* s life at a period when other men are in the vigor of their years . Early on the fourteenth day we saw the snowy heights of Wales ; and at 10 o'clock I put my foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries of cab and hack-drivers , quite as obstreporous as in our own New York . I entered a carriage , with my head still giddy from sickness , which gave me no respite until I reached the quiet waters of the Mersey . I was conducted to an hotel , frequented mostly by the English . Though it was noon , gas-lights were visible in the interior chambers of the houses . The city was overshadowed by a curtain of smoke that almost shut out the oblique rays of the sun , whose feeble lamp hung low and dim in the distant south . In the evening I saw the principal market , always in full operation on Saturday night . It is more imposing , because more concentrated and better lighted , than that of Philadelphia ; though the provisions are , with some exceptions , inferior , dearer , and less varied , than in the Quaker city . I walked through several alleys , occasionally tasting an apple that attracted the attention of some half-naked children , who snatched up the masticated pulp , rejected from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful // commentary upon those institutions under which those little sufferers were born . I was told that the vegetables I saw grew on tenanted lands , loaded with church and poor rates , independently of the landlords ' heavy exactions ; that the gardeners were generally destitute and often driven away because of their inability to pay the rent . In Philadelphia , the butchers , clad in white linen and aprons no less white , sell the flesh of animals fed on their own pasture lands , while their wives , mistresses of the dairy , measure out milk from crock and jar , as temptingly neat as their own comely persons . The sellers , too , of fruits , gather from their own orchards , and every article of food and cookery , strewed along a line of four thousand feet in High-stree t , comes pure and unadulterated from the homes of the owners of the soil . Next morning I partook of an English breakfast , of which travellers have not a little to say . In the hotel is a quadrangular apartment , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tables are arranged , intended each for the accommodation of one or two persons only . I took my seat at half-past nine . Before me stood a tea-pot of mock silver , a small porcelain cup on each side , containing the one an allowance of green and the other of black tea , a plate with two circular bits of butter , embossed with the name of the hotel , a three-penny wheaten loaf , and a small bowl containing a scanty portion of loaf sugar . These , with an accompaniment of three knives , a plated French fork and two spoons , displayed on a neat white cloth , constituted the furniture of the table . They who make tea-trays and send them to us do not always put them on their own tables . I followed the example of others , and prepared my own tea , by helping myself to boiling water from a kettle that stood on the shoulder of the chimney . This is a breakfast in its simplest form ; any increase of quantity brings with it an increase of price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helped themselves to a slice of cold ham , beef , or tongue , from a side-table , in a distant part of the room . Opposite to me sat a stout gentleman whose abstraction announced that silence was not to be broken . He readthe newspapers , taking tea only by way of parenthesis . He seemed unconscious of my presence ; nevertheless I resolved to unlock his frozen speech . But how ? I knew he hated the French , and if I mentioned the Americans , he might say they did not pay their debts . It was therefore unsafe to speak of either . Yet there was one topic to which no man was ever indifferent-his country . I studied my part , and throwing down my knife exclaimed , " At last I have seen that beautiful , that unspeakably beautiful England ! " His features began to relent as he fixed his eyes upon meI continued- " I studied its geography when a boy , its history when a man , and the half had not been told me " - " Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Halifax steamer . " " We were uneasy about you-you overstaid your time ? " A spark was now struck from the flint : the words flowed warm from his heart . The other guests put in their contributions , and the conversation became general . They were gentlemen of manners and education , prompt to communicate , and not unwilling to hear what I had to say of the new-born Republic in the west . They had read Sam Slick and Mrs. Trollope ; had heard of tarring and feathering , the abolitionists , Judge Lynch and his code . They insisted our laws had no binding force-that everything bent under the will of the people-that the whole machinery of government was running wild and must soon tumble to pieces . I replied , that on closer inspection , its movements , however complex , would appear to be held in constant balance , and that its laws of motion , like those of the planets , corrected its own anomalies-that the onthreakings of the mob in England had more than once overturned the government ; that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a useless waste of life-that the case was wholly different in America : there the soil belonged to the people , and the government was of their own creation-that they would not pull down and burn their own houses , or destroy institutions which they could alter or abolish at pleasure . They insisted that the Americans were too fond of change-that they had twenty-six legislatures besides a general congress in session every yearthat they did little else than enact and rescind , build up and pull down , and // had of late commenced their mad assaults upon the judiciary , the last prop in the yielding fabric . I replied , that the Americans were in a new position having no lights to guide them in forming their constitutions , they were thrown upon their own inventions . They have contrived to give every man the same interest in legislation he has in his own household-that their rapid growth , the progress of the arts , the mutations of commerce , required frequent changes and new enactments , to keep pace with their ever-varying and increasing wants-that the judiciary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of all men , were most liable to abuse their power-that once upon the Bench , they seemed to grow to it , and no means had been discovered to bring them to account , but by shortening the duration of office-that in England it was well they should be independent of the Crown ; hut in America , no one should be independent of the people-that an office for life was above human responsibility , and utterly repugnant to the spirit of their institutions . One of the gentlemen who had hitherto been silent , said he had travelled in the United States ; that they were , indeed , a free people , but none the happier on that account-that they were ever complaining , discontented , restless , never standing still long enough to define their own position-that they might love their country , hut had no love of place , for nobody stayed at home , or lived where he was born-that he had seen entire families mount a steamer in New Orleans , struggle under high pressure two thousand miles against the current , dart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steam over the lakes ; visit Montreal , Quebec , and all the watering-places in their interminable empire , in a single season . That they transacted business with the same headlong celerity ; not satisfied with growing rich by patient industry , they strive to leap into fortune at a single hound-they live only in anticipationwould stake their fortunes upon events then taking place in the most distant parts of the world . That their politics were as unstable as the moveable sands - they would vote a man in office one day , and the next begin to pull down their idol to put up another in its stead . That their religion rested upon no settled interpretation of the Scripturestoo many were free-thinkers , and what was worse , free from thinking-that their ministers could not raise their congregations to their creed , but the creed must be lowered to their congregations , or they would be driven , one and all , from the pulpit , by the same allabsorbing power , the will of the people . That they were equally hot in the pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if on a foot-race , and in the same spirit would swallow their food with a rapidity that deprived them of speech . In matters of love , they were equally hasty and reckless ; a young man is shot dead at the first glance ; takes a wife of fifteen , who at twenty-five is loaded with the cares of maternity , and becomes a grandmother at thirty . This exaggerated strain was cut short by the appearance of a servant , who delivered a letter to the speaker , and the party withdrew . In the evening the conversation became still more controversial . They insisted that the English language had been corrupted by the pronunciation and style of the best educated Americans . Here I took the field with Webster 's two ponderous quartos . They admitted , with much candor and good sense , that Johnson 's etymologies were not just , and that pronunciation was , in its nature , too variant and subtle to he fixed by any standard . The fame of the great American lexicographer was not unknown to them ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undergo a second edition in their native capital . I insisted that he had traced the language up to its simplest elements , the Saxon tongue , which Johnson did not understand-that in the preface to his work , he had condensed all the learning of his predecessors , illustrated by his own deeper and more comprehensive researches-that a work of such Inagnitude , inspired , by genius , reared by the industry of thirty years , would outlive all the assaults of rival writers , and that its republication was a sure guaranty of its final adoption in England-that no language could be fixed until the extinction of the people that spoke it-that the progress of the English for the last two centuries , was precisely the period in which the boundaries of science were most enlarged-that the varied signifi // cation of words among the Americans , and adoption of new terms , proved the rapid development of mind-that language being the expression of thought , must keep pace with increase of knowledge . It might he compared to one of their own great rivers , that widened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountains were lost in the tributary streams that flowed into the common channel . Of the public edifices in Liverpool and other works of art , I have nothing to say : my subject is human life : and though Lady Montague has said , there are nobody in the world but men and women , yet they do most strangely differ in their character , institutions and modes of living , and these are the charms that draw the traveller from his home . Born where nature and nations are young , the American goes abroad for instr*ction as the Greeks travelled to the East . He hastens to England , and great are his emotions when he first beholds those shores where the " footsteps of his mighty ancestors fell ! " He had seen the English abroad ; now he is to see them at home ; their houses , furniture , features , dress , manners Are they proud , silent , repulsive , as he had read ? What are the topics of conversation among a people descended from Locke , Newton , Sbakspeare , Milton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings on their thrones , and fills the distant heathen with awe ? Above all , are the English as happy as they are great ? This is the problem he came to solve . On the third day I entered the streets to look upon the face of society , and draw my conclusions from things as they are . Near the hotel were several loaded wagons , whose drivers were from the country , not twenty miles distant from Liverpool . They spoke to each other in a rude , noisy dialect , which the population themselves understood with difficulty . In the United States , English is uniformly spoken almost without dialect , and a stranger easily understands the uneducated slaves . I advanced but a few paces , when I saw several women , gathering with their naked hand , the ordure that fell from the animals in the streets , and carrying it off in baskets on their heads . I approached one of them , hesitating whether I should speak . Is she a wo man ? thought I ; and has she the pas-* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate , feel resentment and pride ? or can hope , which forsakes not the human breast , lie at the bottom of the ills she endures ? I drew nearer , but we were both suddenly driven to the side-walk , at the approach of a long line of teams ; she returned and I followed to give her a penny . " What are you doing ? " " I picks up dung for Mr.- . " " And what then becomes of it ? " " He sells it to the market people when they goes home . " " Have you a mother ? " " No . " " A father ? " " Yes . " " Where is he ? " " He lives away two miles ; he fell in the dock and hurt his side ; he ca n't walk ; I comes to this street every morning . " " How much can yon make in the day ? " " Sometimes four pence and sometimes six pence . " " Who takes care of your father in your absence ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was , indeed , a woman of English flesh and blood , the same with Duke and Duchess , Lord and Lady , and ut** tered articulate sounds in a soft ferninine voice ; nay , had she been washed in the deep seas , her comely features might have restored her to her species , from whose rolls she had been struck by her loathsome trade . She was not more than seven years of age , with too slight a form for the load she continued to heap upon her basket . Her body was wrapped in a sort of frock , with a. string tied about her waist , so tattered and polluted that its color could not be known . She was barefoot ; wore about her temples the brim of a straw bonnet , stained with dirt and smoke , with which she continued to half conceal her face . In her bosom was a piece of white bread , which , with her unwashed hands , she occasionally applied to her mouth , without interruption to her business . Much as I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches in Parliament , books of travels , nor yet the reports of factory commissioners had prepared me for this appalling spectacle ! As I entered Lord street , the forms of misery began to vary and multiply . Whole families of men , women , and children , half naked , barefoot , in rags , shivering in the cold , lean and gaunt from hunger , without a hut to shelter them from the storm , or a pillow of straw whereon to lay their heads . // They emerge daily from the crooked alleys and putrid cellars on the frontiers of the town , into the principal streets , where they strive by all sorts of artifice and beseeching gestures , to excite attention and awaken compassion . The fathers and mothers held each one , and sometimes two infants in arms , with other children at their sides , all walking in the middle of the streets , singing in joint chorus some coarse ballad , descriptive of their sufferings . One of the men preached a sort of sermon , setting out his misfortunes-that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of employment and could find none-that his children were starving , and concluded with an exhortation to charity . This revolting scene so engrossed my attention , that I hardly saw edifice or equipage ; heeded not the array of shops or uproar of commerce . Nothing could I hear or see but these unhappy sufferers , disinherited and disowned by the very institutions under which they were horn ! When in the evening I spoke of their condition , I was told they deserved no pity ; that they dissipated their money and time in taverns and ginshops . Alas , poor wretches ! they do indeed drink that they may forget , and better for them could they hide themselves in their graves , where sorrow can not enter , and the wrath of man can not pursue . In the afternoon I made an excursion of sixteen miles to Chester , one of the oldest towns in the kingdom , and seat of power under the kings of the Heptarchy . It is surrounded by a wall , on whose broad undulating surface I made the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tortuous streets , and the distant hills and valleys of Wales beyond the Dee . One of the streets is cut out of a rock , whose sides are formed into shops , and serve as the basement stories of a double range of houses with covered poticos their entire length . The cathedral is an enormous mass of stone , fast crumbling into sand . Nothing can exceed the beauty of the choir and its exquisite carvings in wood . Here I first saw a cloister , and formed some notion of the architecture of the seventh century , when the church was said to he founded , under the patronage of St. Warburg . Beneath the pavement lie the remains of Smith the translator of Xenophon , and Parnell the poet . The ride to Chester is performed in a few minutes by railway , through a beautiful country sprinkled with cottages and hedges , the earth yet green , nothing indicating the presence of winter but the loftier leafless trees of the forest . On the fourth day I went by railroad to Manchester , whose population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleaching six hundred thousand bags of cotton , brought from three continents of the earth . At two o'clock I rambled along the streets , inhabited hy those who work in the manufactories , called operatives , to distinguish them from the laborers who cultivate the ground . I had not proceeded far , before I met a group composed , as in Liverpool , of father and mother with infants in their arms , leading two little girls by the hand . They also sung ballads , and asked for charity . A window flew up opposite to them , and a penny fell from the third story . One of the girls picked it up , while the father , perceiving he had caught my attention , approached to tell me he had eaten nothing that day ; that they had been at work in a cotton-mill , as he called it , but were turned out of employment . lie was barefoot , as were the children , though the keen winds were accompanied with rain that fell upon the half-melted snow . The wife wore shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one garment of dirty cloth that sat tight about her body , leaving her arms and legs exposed to the weather . The eldest girl appeared to be about ten , and the other six years of age . Both extended their hands in a beseeching posture , but said nothing . Their skins were visible through the greasy rags that hung about their stinted frames ; their hair was knotted and entangled by filth ; their features wore an impression of idiocy , and their inflamed eyes were too sensitive for the light of the already declining sun . The feet of the eldest were red and chapped by the cold , resting flat upon the pavement , the hollow or palm of the foot having wholly disappeared . I inquired the cause ; the father said , " she was obliged to stand all day in the factory where she worked , that she never wore shoes , and that many other childrei* // had feet as flat as her 's . " The limbs of the youngest were misshapen ; the stomach preternaturally distended , as *was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligible word from her . I gave them a trifle , whereupon they renewed their song and went their way . They were followed by a young man , apparently twenty years of age , almost naked , with his hands thrust in his trowsers , and a paper on the crown of his hat , on which was written , " I am starvino " I told him to goto work ; he replied he could get none ; that the mill in which he was employed had stopped . The number of sufferers soon became too great for detail . My attention was particularly arrested by a little girl five years old , who stood near a cellar door , with a box of matches in her hand , which she held constantly extended . Her naked feet were half buried in mud and snow ; her garments a tissue of rags blown aside by the winds , exposing her infantine limbs to the rain as it fell . Her features were stained with dirt , stiff with cold , and frightfully deformed by endurance too great for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not complain or shed a tear . " Have you a mother ? " She turned towards the cellar ; I entered , full of resentment against the unnatural parent - what a revolution came over me at the sight of this abode of misery ! I purchased my right of entrance with money , the St. Peter 's key that unlocks every door . The apartment was some fifteen feet square ; the filth heaped upon the floor concealed the material beneath ; the damp , decayed walls were of a dingy hue ; the chimney , the receptacle of every unclean thing , not of lire , for there seemed no means of cooking food . The sour , sickening vapor that loaded the air , drove me back to the first step of the door , where the mother sat mending a dirty coverlet , upon which she sewed patches of different colors . She was without shoes , *wore a tattered cloak about her shoulders , a black filthy handkerchief over her ears , which she tied under the chin . Finding that I shut out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again advanced into the interior . " Is that your child at the door ? " " Yes , your honor . " " She will perish with cold . " " I can not help it . " " Does she get anything by standing there ? " " Yes , people gives her sometimes a penny , that helps keep us alive . " " Have you other children ? " She pointed to a corner where were four lying on straw , covered with a new blanket , which she said was bought with money given to the poor . One of them was an infant six months of age , another eighteen ; a little girl eleven years old , and a boy thirteen . She said she made them lie in bed , as she had no fire ; besides , they could do " better without eating . " The eyes of the little girl were much inflamed : I asked the cause ; - she said the children that worked in the cotton mills always had sore eyes . That her son was sick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband was a stocking weaver , and had gone in search of work-thather family was fed at a soup kitchen , where she went every day for her share . In another part of the cellar , lay , stretched on a sort of litter , a man whose pale features and sunken jaws announced the near approach of death . On his body was a blanket , too short to cover his naked feet , that extended beyond the bed . His wife spoke of him with indifference ; said they had been married three weeks ; that he had taken a bad cold and could not live . Conjugal and parental affection have but feeble hold of the wretchedly poor . Want separates the husband from a wife whom he can not maintain , and the starving father snatches the bread from the mouths of his helpless , unresisting offspring : all distinctions of right and wrong , every affection of the heart , are swallowed up in the horrid struggle for life . It being now three o'clock , a dark hour for a December day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , whom I left with outstretched arms , as I had found her . I followed a different route to my lodgings , encountering an array of beggars quite as frantic with hunger as the first I had met . I have been in England only five days , yet have I seen whole streets radiant with bayonets , ready to tear the flesh of those who asked for bread . Though goaded by hunger , chilled by the wintry winds , they must be quiet , pray for the Lords spiritual and temporal , keep the peace , make no disturbance , // The Corn Laws were intended for the protection of agriculture . The manufactures , too , are protected by the exclusion of foreign fabrics , and their rich proprietors have taken care to fix the price of wages at the lowest point of endurance , while a few land-holders , who have taken the island to themselves ' have fixed the price of bread at the highest : so that there are six millions of operatives stripped to the skin , and five millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much has been said of the Dutch and Ttalian poor , yet I can imagine nothing more wretched than the ragged , shivering multitudes , that deform the face of society in England . They are put below Ibe beasts that crop the grass and know their stalls at night . Nay , the very dogs of their lordly masters are fed and lodged in state ; have keepers and pastimes assigned them ; their genealogies recorded in books ; more , their portraits are painted by the great masters in the art , at an expense that would feed an entire village of English poor . The United States is the only country on the globe where the poor are able to protect themselves . Every son of Adani , soldier , sailor , cobbler , peasant , mechanic , almost every man on the highways or in the streets , forms a part of his government : he has a vote , and votes constitute power . Secure in his personal rights , he soon becomes master of the soil by the fruits of his industry . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley , mountain and river , and given to Adam and the children to be born of him , to each share and share alike , and to Civsar no more than the rest . But in England , their constitution denies to the mass of the people any interest in the soil , or voice in the legislature . They have no hope of redress but in the revolution that is ever coming , but never comes . In the meantime , the rich become richer , and the poor poorer ; want drives to crime , and crime outstrips increase of numbers . Six millioi*s of men , women and children , pent up in work-shops , have become depraved beyond redemption . There is no healing power but in the cultivation of the lands . Vice flourishes in the crowd ; virtue inhabits the silent fields ; it grows with the seed the farmer sows , and when he reaps fills his heart with devotion . Blessings on his sweaty brow ! He will stand fast by his sacred home , the fields he has ploughed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of soil and suffl*age shall reside in him , so long will endure the liberties won by the sword of Washington and cemented by the genius of Marshall . In the evening I conversed with travellers from Stockport , who confirmed the account given by the mother of the causes of inflamed eyes among the children . They said their lungs and throats were affected also ; that the fibres of the cotton collected in the corners of their mouths and was taken in with the food , which they often eat from one hand , while they labored with the other . Jn some of the mills they were obliged to fall upon their faces , almost every instant , to avoid the ponderous beams that swept over their heads ; that their limbs were distorted and bodies deformed from over fatigue , and their countenances rendered hideous from continual anguish ; that they never played or prattled , as it became little children ; that they seemed a part of the machinery , moving by the same im* pulses ; that their understandings were almost blotted out ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had no sense of moral obligation or shame . It was not possible to educate them ; as soon as they ceased to labor , they fell asleep on the door , door-steps , side-walks ; even at their meals hunger often yielded to overpowering sleep ; that at the first change of price in the commodity , of every fluctuation of fashion or of commerce , they were turned away , men , women and children , to roam the streets and highways ; some enlisted in the armies for the distant Indies ; poverty drove others to violate the law , and when convicted they were sent to Botany Bay , while the greater part of them wandered through the country begging their bread , lodging at the poor-houses , called " Unions , " where they slept on straw , were fed on porridge at supper and breakfast , then compelled to pay their reckoning by breaking stone for the public roads , and sent their way . One of the gentlemen , who had been . long familiar with these scenes of distress , thought my compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggary were constituent elements of every community . He appealed to the Scriptures , " the poor ye have always with you , " and cited // the authority of Maithus , who affirmed that a portion of mankind in all countries must necessarily perish from want . That writer proposes to mitigate the evil by a law prohibiting marriages among the poor ; but poverty had anticipated the law , and yet the number of children had not diminished . They called for the London papers and showed me the proceedings of the factory commissioners , from which I made the following extracts . First the testimony of a little girl " I am thirteen years old ; began to work at Mr. Marshall 's mill when I was not quite eight ; we had forty minutes allowed for dinner ; no allowance for breakfast or afternoon drinking . As soon as I went home I fell asleep : we were not allowed to sit down at the mill the whole day ; if we did , we were beaten-it was a common thing to beat the children . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she got killed there . " " Mark Best , an overlooker , testified , that the regular hours for work are from six in the morning until seven at night , and when thronged , from five till nine , only allowing forty minutes at dinner : no time allowed for breakfast or drinking . The chi ? dren put the food by their side and ate as they could . Sometimes when the work is bad , they are prevented from getting it at all ; they have then to take it home again . Sometimes it is so dirtied , it is unfit to eat  --  the dust flies about until they can scarcely see each other . In the card rooms , the refuse hangs about their months while they are eating their food . The masters know very well the children are beaten and strapped ; they encourage the overlooker to do it . The straps are about a foot and a half long , and there is a stick at the end of some of them  --  and the end of the strap they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thongs : they are regularly made for that purpose . A Manchester machinery is not complete without a machine for thrashing children . " I set out the next morning for London by a devious route , the better to see this beautiful England , an universal garden filled with forbidden fruit , whereof to taste is transportation without hope of return . Part of my journey was performed by rail-road , with a velocity that outstripped the crows whose flight was more than once parallel with the cars . At Chesterfield , the rain compelled me to take an inside seat , where was one passenger only , a lady whom the conductor of the coach treated with profound respect . I said , as I entered , " I have not yet seen a fair day in JIngland . " She replied , " It is a rainy climate , but the healthiest in the world , " at the same time drawing aside a rich flowing veil , and lo ! a mulatress , but none the less beautiful for that . Her dark olive skin , crispy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony of her African blood , while her nose and lips were altogether European , and her chin the termination of a perfect oval . Her apparel was costly , and jewels , real or false , glistered on her fingers . " You are not of this country I presume . " " I am a native of Surinam . " " But your language is English . " " My father was an Englishman born , educated in Holland , then went to South America , where he found my mother . " She entered into many details concerning the climate , plants , agriculture and population of that country , alluding more than once to those of her own complexion , insisting that the mixed race were more highly gifted in understanding . " I know moreover , " she said , " a negro woman , black and beautiful , accomplished in music and the literature of three lettered languages . Mankind have all one common origin ; negroes are not inferior to the whites ; they who say so are infidels that do not believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good reason to believe that Adam was a black man , and that the different complexions among his descendants arose from the operation of moral and physical causes . All colors would be alike respected , were it not for the distinctions kept up by the silly pride of the Americans-I hate the Americans . " She spoke of the standard works in English literature ; lamented that Addison and Johnson were forgotten in the admiration bestowed on Scott , Bulwer , and other workers in fiction . She mentioned several Dutch authors of whom I was ashamed to be ignorant . She greatly extolled the " Praise of Folly , " by Erasmus , who she said was another Solomon- " Both of these sages agreed , that increase of knowledge was // riot increase of happiness-that according to Erasmus , the people of i3rabant were the happiest in Holland , because they were the silliest. " having heard her called Miss , I alluded to the probability of uniting her fortunes with those of some happy Englishman . She replied with great emphasis , " That man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then you are difficult to please and hard to persuade . " " Men , sir , are deceitful ; they are complaisant and courteous before marriage , hut the money once in their power , they throw off the mask and betake themselves to the coffee-house , or to some low and vile pleasures-I hate them ! During courtship , they call me angel . " " Then you have been courted ? " " I do not deny it , but I did not believe a word they said ; I knew they wanted my money . Oh ! they are such liars ! " Strong language thought I , for a " negro wench ! " " I perceive you never intend to marry : " here I quoted Socrates who said , " That they who marry will repent ; that they who do not marry , will repent . " She replied , " The first part of the proposition is true ; for if Bonaparte 's code were in force in England , there would not be a dozen marriages left to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socrates , though fame or wisdom , said many silly things . There are , indeed , old maids who render themselves ridiculous by their affectation and lap-dogs ; it is their own fault if they are not respected . If they have money , they can always command obedience ; and if they do not die as soon as their nephews and nieces wish , they are in that respect no worse off than other people . " " You have travelled in the different States of Europe ? " " Yes . in most of them . " " Delighted , no doubt , with Paris ? " " Not at all ; they who have once seen England , can live nowhere else . England is my country ; all my relations are here ; the English are first among the foremost-none so wise , so learned , so great , and Lavater says they are the handsomest people in the world . " " You must have met with some Americans on the continent , did you not think the women handsome ? " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with two of their beauties of eighteen or twenty years of age . They had indeed white skins , slender forms , small feet and hands flaxen hair and blue eyes ; but they talked and laughed so loud , and were so free with the men , that the Italians were ashamed of them . As for the men , they could not speak without stopping to spit , as children learn their pauses in grammar . I hate the Americans ; I believe every word Mrs. Trollope has said about them . " Having arrived at her place of destination , we bowed with mutual expressions of regret at parting so soon . I pursued my journey a few miles further to a Village Inn , so neat , so sweet-carpets , walls , chairs , tables , fire-place , window glass ; I could have kissed them all . No people on earth , French , German , Swiss , nor yet the Dutch of Boeck , are so neat as the English when not debased by poverty . Here I stayed a day to visit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I approached under a line of elms that balanced their horizontal arms across the road that led to the castle . It is the palace of a king rather than the mansion of a subject . His income is stated at one million three hundred thousaad dollars a year , yet is less than is received by the Duke of Northumberland , or Marquis of Westminster . His carpenters , painters , gardeners , physicians , attorneys , chaplains , stewards , butlers , osthers , park-keepers , dog-keepers , barbers , laundresses , laborers , farmers and other dependants , attached to his five different estates , would form a little republic , and if employed in tilling the ground , might feed many thousand human beings , instead of one . From the windows of the castle are seen the water-works , his Italian and English gardens and conservatory , *filled with whatever is valued for frui't or flower , from the five zones of the earth . The walls of the apartments are covered with Russian leather , embossed and illuminated with gilt . His orangerie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one , measure four hundred feet in length . The statues alone cost more than half a million . Among them I recognized a Letitia  --  a Queen of the Scots by Westmacott ; Hebe , Ceres , Venus of Medicis , Latona and two children ; Mars , Cupid , Endymion , and Achilles drawing the arrow from his foot , by Canova . A Venus by Thorwahdsena colossal figure of the Duke himself // and ten times as many more grouped in one vast apartment . But my mind was ill at ease . These proud trophies of art made less impression upon me , than the squalid forms I had just seen shivering in the cold . I could not drive them away ; they stood by the statues with uplifted hands ; they followed me along the costly halls and ornamented grounds . Miserable wretches ! All this gorgeous structure ; these accumulated riches , luxuries without name or number , are wrung from you ! Ye are the oxen that plough not for yourselves ; the bees that make not honey for yourselves ; nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are paid by the sweat of your brows , and if ye but taste of the fruit of that tree , or of the flesh in yonder park , ye are straightway sent in exile half round the globe ! I entered the first vehicle ready to depart , and in a short time found myself at Woodstock . Having rambled across the park of the Duke of Marlborough , 1 perceived at an exterior gate a beggar with his wife , crouched in the angle of a hedge , to catch the occasional sun that broke from the clouds . He advanced to ask alms . " No , you are a stout man , go to work . " " I ca n't get work . " " What is your trade ? " " Me and my wife makes gloves ; but everybody is running after them d-d French gloves , and the trade is done . " " But you can wash your clothes . " " I can , if you will give me others to put on while I am about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His wife followed me , and in a most beseeching manner , asked for . money to buy bread ; I gave it . She called me your honor , and sometimes bestowed a title . They said they had never seen an American before . When I spoke of the high wages and abundance that prevailed in America , he interrupted me , and in a manner bordering on insolence , asked , " Is there any parks in America like this ? His Grace keeps two thousand seven hundred deer ; did you see the lake his Grace had dug out ? the bridge over it cost his Grace ten thousand pounds ; Parliament gives his Grace money every year . I do n't like America ; I prefer England . " My philanthropy began to abate . I almost thought with that apologist for tyrants , who said that " a well fed horse , under tight rein and spur , was as proud and happy as his master . " But this slaving wretch was not as well fed as his Grace 's horse . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summit of happiness for the English poor , whose desires seldom stray be -- yond a quiet stomach . Nothing can reconcile an American to institutions that strip the multitude and give all to a few . He can understand how one man may be enriched by industry , and another impoverished by idleness , but that so many generations should live and die in want , is a riddle he can not solve . Why are they not fed from the abundance that commerce can bring ? In the capital of Ohio , there is an ordinance requiring butchers to throw their unsold meat into the river , that it may not decay on the commons . The great hotels are daily emptied by the refuse carts of provisions that can not be consumed , and all travellers in the Mississippi steamers can testify , that there is thrown into the water , from the excess of the very tables where they have dined , enough to feed whole families of the hungry poor . But , say the English , it is vulgar in the Americans so to overload their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vulgarity , then are they the most vulgar people on earth , and the English the most refined ; withthis difference , that in England the rule works inversely , beginning with the aristocracy , who live in vulgar abundance , and receding to the humble laborer , who is refined into a mere shadow by potatoes and salt . I passed the evening with an intelligent gentleman , who told me that Woodstock had been entitled to two members in Parliament , who bought their seats of the Duke of Marlborough , at three thousand five hundred pounds each : the bargain being struck , the Duke compelled his tenants to vote accordingly at the hazard of being expelled from their huts . The next morning my gentleman breakfasted with me , and I dined with him at six , having , in the meanwhile , rambled over the Duke 's possessions , attended a sale of cattle , and visited the neighboring peasantry . The following day I reached London by way of Oxford , which completed my First Eight Days in England.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
