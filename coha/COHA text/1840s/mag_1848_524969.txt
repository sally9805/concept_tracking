txt THE Whigs of the United States have a heavy responsibility resting on them in the approaching Presidential election . We hold that it does not admit of a reasonable doubt that they can elect ZACHARY TAYLOR to the Presidency if they will . It is equally clear to us , that if he be not elected , it will be because Whigs-some Whigs-. do not p*ssess that measure of disinterested patriotism to rise above mere party and personal , or sectional views and considerations . The trial of men 's virtue never comes but when they are called on to maintain their principles at some sacrifice , or under some discouragement . Many Whigs are now in this category , and it remains to be seen how they will come out of the trial . It is the tendency of party organization to contract the horizon of duty to the country ; at least , this is the effect on many minds . Party  --  the success of party  --  the exaltation of partybecome the absorbing objects of thought and desire . An ideal of what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoy , and under what particular auspices its success and glory should be achieved , takes possession of the imagination , and sometimes quite shuts out other and higher considerations . It is forgotten , for the time , that party is properly only a means to an end , and is really valuable-nay , is only justifiable-when it is employed as an instrumentality in behalf of the country , and of the whole country . When party becomes selfish-when it becomes ambitious-when it desires to rule for the sake of ruling , or for the profit of ruling , or because it wishes to set up its own idols in the high places of political worship , it must soon lose cast and character in the estimation of all good and wise men . A combination of men to take possession of power for purposes of their own , less com-* prehensive and catholic than the common good of the whole nation , is something very different from a great and patriotie party . It is a conspiracy , and not a politi. - cal party . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unite for the purpose of promoting and maintaining certain great and distinctim principles , as being essential to the prG .. servation of our form of government , and the advancement of the real interests and the true prosperity of the nation . When . an election is at hand , like that which is now approaching , the proper question for every Whig to ask himself is , whether these principles are likely to be preserved and vindicated by our success as a party in the VOL . II . // election . If they will , the way of duty , as well as of party obligation , is plain . There may be many things not quite up to our expectations or desires . We may have seen many things in the management of the affairs of the party organization not at all to our liking . The wrong persons*may , in our judgment , have taken the lead , to the discomfiture of wiser and honester men , and to the manifest disadvantage and discredit of the party . The candidate may not be the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have been chiefly instrumental in presenting him to us , and disappointing us of our preferences , have designed or hoped to promote some personal , selfish or sectional object or scheme of their own by his elevation . We may even entertain doubts whether the candidate we are to support agrees with us in all our notions about the particular means to be used  --  the particulax measures to be adopted-for advancing the common weal . And , finally , some of us may indulge a shrewd suspicion that once in office his allegiance to country will be suffered in many things to outweigh his allegiance to party . But after all , what concerns us to know is , whether , if our candidate shall be elected , the distinctive principles which belong to us as a party will be likely to be maintained , and the affairs of government conducted with ref*nce to them as a general basis of administration . If this is our faith and confidence upon a view of the whole ground , then we are guilty of a double desertion if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of our candidate ; we desert and betray at once both our party and our country . Intelligent Whigs do not need to be informed what their principles are ; but a summary statement of them can not do the best of us any harm . The great doctrine which gave us our party designation was that of opposition to Execut*ve usurpations . We hold it to be essential to the success of our free forr*i of government that the President should be kept strictly within the limits of his proper Constitutional authority . Events have shown what fatal mischiefs do and will follow if that high functionary , with the vast patronage which attaches to his office , is permitted to overstep the Constitutional boundary within which his duties lie . He may make himself at once despotic and irresponsible . We have actually seen a President , weak in everything except in the power of his office , involve the country in war , without and against its own will and judgment , for the purpose of conquest and the acquisition of foreign territory ; and all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of declaring war to Congress . Thus , for two years and more , a nation , loving justice and loving peace , is chained to the car of a President , having a petty ambition to figure as the head of a people wise and powerful , carrying death and desolation to the heart , and over the hearths and homes , of an unhappy and imbecile neighbor , for objects of territorial plunder . This is one example to illustrate the strides which Executive arrogance will take if allowed to escape from the Constitution , and to appeal for the sanction of his acts solely to the will of an unreasoning ochlocracy . Whigs set themselves , first of all , at open war against any and all assumptions and encroachments of Executive power , under any and all pretences . From the period of General Jackson 's accession to the Presidential office , under the machinations of the Democratic party , encroachment has followed encroachment in this office , with the full sanction and support of that party , until the Republic is on the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all forms of tyranny  --  the government of an irresponsible and proscriptive party , the dominant element of which is found in the lowest and worst classes of society , *ohering by the principle of plunder , and giving a fearful energy to their power by concentrating it in the hands of a monocratic chief , elective by their suffrages , serving for a limited time , and bound and pledged to make their pleasure , and the gratification of their will and wantonness , the principal end and aim of his administration . In such a government , Congress is nothing but a convenient , or inconvenient , sort of medium inter*posed between the nation and the ruling chief , through which his decrees are made known by a formal registration , and through which also his necessary supplies are furnished . We Whigs want no such government as this . We desire to see the Congress restored to its original 222 Sept. , // powers under the Constitution , and the President confined to the performance of the proper executive duties of his station . We want no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business which the Constitution has confided exclusively to that body . We wish to see the exercise of this high conservative power reserved forextraordinary occasions , and used only to correct some manifest and undoubted error , or to arrest some certain and imminent mischief to the Constitution or the country . We do not want to see it used as if the President held a portion of the ordinary legislative power , with a negative on all legislation which is practically absolute . If Congress passes a law to do an act of long-delayed justice to some of our citizens , as in the case of the law passed two years ago to pay moneys honestly due from the Government on account of French spoliations prior to 1800 , we do not want to see an Executive veto interposed without one plausible or even decent reason given for it . If Congress chooses to make appropriations for the improvement of rivers and harbors-a power exercised from the foundation of the Government-we want to see the will of Congress stand as the law of the land , in spite of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entertain . And if Congress , in providing a local government for any of our territories , should insist on preserving all territories now free from the intrusion of slavery , ( no new or unused power in this government , ) we want to see such legislation stand without any intermeddling or gainsaying on the part of the President . In short , we Whigs want to see the legislation of the country exactly in the hands where the Constitution has placed it . We want that the country should come back to the habit of looking to Congress , and not to the President , for the policy which shall prevail amongst us , under the legistive authority , on all questions touching our internal national affairs-touching the regulation of commerce , internal and commercial improvements , the finances , public credit , revenue and taxation , protection to home industry , war , the government of our territorial possessions , and the measures proper " for the common defence and the general welfare . " This , if we un derstand anything about it , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the government of the country , out and out , as the Constitution has confided to Congress , to be and remain in the hands of that body , free from the arbitrary interposition , and equally free from the corrupt blandishments , of the Executive . He who adopts and maintains this great and distinctive principle is a Whig , and all good Whigs will welcome him to their fellowship . It lies at the very foundation , it is of the very essence , of Whig faith , that-except in regard to our foreign relations confided to the President and Senate , in regard to nominations and appointments to office , in regard to the titular command of the army and navy , and in regard to other specified duties properly appertaining to the chief executive office of the Government  --  the whole policy and conduct of our public affairs have been confided by the Constitution to the control and direction of Congress . There the effective and efficient power ought to reside ; there it ought to be independently exercised . The President is required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the state of the nation , in order that that body may act understandingly in its affairs and interests . Placed as he is , at the centre and head of the administrative affairs of the Government , in the control of its foreign relations , its appointing power , and its executive authority , he is required also to recommend to Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . Beyond this , however , his power over the internal policy and the ordinary legislation of the country does not go . It is the express injunction of the Constitution that " ALL legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . " There is no third branchthe President is vested with no legislative power . The veto is an executive , and not a legislative power , the necessity and use of which were , and nre , perfectly well understood . His formal assent and signature to all laws are required as a proper act of authentication and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is called on personally to carry it into execution . By mistake , by oversight , by in ' 1848. 223 // consideration , possibly by passion , or by unreflective sympathy , the law may contemplate some action manifestly wrong and injurious to persons or to parties affected by it , or in violent conflict with the plain provisions of the Constitution . In tender regard of his conscience , and of his sense of personal dignity and propriety , and of right and wrong , it was not thought necessary or wise to compel him to put his name to such a law as if approving of it . He was , therefore , allowed to return it to Congress with his objections  --  to be passed , if Congress would and could do it , by a two-thirds vote , in spite of his objections . In the hands of an honest and conscientious man , one disposed to obey and abide by the Constitution , this is an innocent pow* it is dangerous only when it is clutched by unprinci.pled men , or by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it has been used , as if the President were a third branch of the legislative department of the Government , is a sheer usurpation of power . We say , again , that the control and direction of our whole national policy , so far a.s it may be affected by legislation , are , or ought to be , in the hands of Congress , and not in the hands of the Executive ; and this is the doctrine of the Whig party . It is in virtue of this principle , this leading article of their political faith , that they assumed the name by which they are desigaat*d , as separating them , by a broad mark of distinction , from those who practise on the Tory doctrine and policy of governing a much as possible by the one-man or monarchical power . It is the Democratic party , so calling itself , which exalts the Executive above all other departments and powers in the Government , and supports and defends the President of their choice in every pretension and assumption of power , however monstrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of the truth of this assertion . And " Democracy " proposes to perp*tuate this sort of rule and government ; and perpetuated it will be with a vengeance , if Gen. Cass shall be made the successor of Mr. Polk . No two things could be more diametrically opposed to each other , than the cardinal principle of the Whigs in opposing all Executive usurpation , and in insisting on the legislative supremacy of Congress , and the practice , the doctrines , and the policy to be pursued under the sway of " Democracy , " if successful in the coming election . Light that can not be endured for its intenseness , and darkness that may be felt , are not more opposite . We have dwelt at some length on this article of Whig faith , because it is both cardinal and fundamental in our creed . It lies at the bottom both of our faith and of our hopes . We are republicans , and this doctrine is the essence of republicanism . We do not want a monarchy disguised under republican forms . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time it is Ci*esar that rules . We believe both in conservatism and in progress ; and we can indulge no hope , either of stability on the one hand or of advancement on the other , without this doctrine . Our system is elective and representative , and Congress was so constituted , in its two branches , as to preserve the popular and representative principle in full vigor , and at the same time give the promise of something like stability to the Government and its policy . We think it indispensable , on all accounts , that Congress should be maintained in the full and free exercise of all its constitutional powers ; and without this , we see no ground of hope for that moderate and wise policy of administration , ahd for those just measures on which we rely to make us a prosperous and happy people . Events have clearly enough demonstrated that if the President is to override Congress and be himself the State-L'Etat , c'e*1 moi  --  the will of the nation is of very little account in the measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests will govern everything . Annexation was an Executive measure , and was carried by Executive dictation and intrigue against the better judgment of Congress , and against the will of the nation . The war with Mexico was an Executive measure exclusively , about which Congress was not even consulted . There were not twenty men in both houses of Congress who could have been brought to vote for a war at the time when hostilities were actually commenced by the President 's order ; and as for the people themselves , a vote for such a measure could not have been obtained in any one State , county , town , district , or precinct in the whole Union-at least out 224 Sept. , // of Texas . We may see , by this example , what it is , and what it must be , to have this Republic of ours converted into an elective monarchy . War , conquest , the lust of dominion-these things become the order of the day . The Whig party are against these things . We are for peace with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without sacrifices to which no nation can submit ; and we do not doubt that , in this age , perpetual peace may be preserved with all nations , with no other effort on our part , than to be strictly honest and strictly just in all our dealings with them , to mind our own business , and let them alone . As a security for peace , we want that Congress , and not the President or anybody else , should tell the nation when it is necessary we should go to war . We are against the extension of our territorial limits , and the adding of far-off countries and peoples to our Union and dominion . We do not desire to extend the area of slavery ; and we think the area of freedom may as well be extended by allowing our neighbors on all sides to establish and maintain free and independent governments for themselves , after our example , as by annexing them all to this Republic . We should have quite too much to do if we should undertake to embrace in this Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . The Whig party do not sympathize at all with that ambitioi* sentiment which prompted Gen. Cass , in his place as a Senator in Congress , to anticipate the time when " the whole of the vast country around us will form one of the most magnificent empires that the world has yet seen . " We want our own Republic and Union , with a homogeneous people , men of the same general race , blood , education , and habits , forming a consolidated nation , bo'nd together in national interests and national unity , and growing in wisdom and in moral greatness as we increase in our physical proportions . We do not want Canada , or Cuba , or the West Indi* , or Yucatan , or the projected republic of Sierra Madre to be annexed to the United States , whether without , or at fhe end of bloody wars . " Democracy , " with Gen. Cass for its monocrat , is on the look-out for these acquisitions . Gen. Cass would have gone to war with England for the line of Fifty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of our Executive war of conquest and spoliation against our imbecile neighbor and sister republic , and thought our digestive powers would carry us safely through , even if " we should swallow the whole of Mexico . " He seems to look upon the United States as if the country were some monster reptile , that must subsist and swell its huge , unsightly bulk , by gorging itself with every living thing , small and great , that comes in its way . This is his idea of progress and national glory . Nothing less than " the whole of the vast countri , around us , " continent and islands together , from the frozen regions of the North to the burning line , and God knows how much further , absorbed in this Union , or hitched to it and hanging upon it , and showing a monstrous , disjointed carcass of a country , " extended long and large , in bulk as huge as whom the fables name " - nothing less than this will satisfy Gex* . Cass . And the " Democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , allow him the rule and sway of the government , as if it had no department but his own , to prosecute his schemes of ambition and aggrandizement . The Whig party are opposed to all such profane madness . Our country was broad enough for all useful and wise purposes , and for the duties of our central government , even before our late acquisitions . We are utterly opposed to carrying this game any further . We think the fairest fabric of government ever framed is put in imminent jeopardy by this spirit of war , conquest , and forced aggrandizement , so industriously and zealously taught our people in the school of modern " Democracy " - the school of Allen , Cass , and Polk . It is the doctrine of these political schoolmasters that " the hearts of the people must be prepared for war ; " and for what sort of war , and with what unholy objects prosecuted , and with what defiance of all right , moral and constitutional , undertaken , let the war with Mexico tell . War , conquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these men for this country . " Democracy " is now engaged in earnest efforts to make Gen. Cass President , with undefined objects of war , conquest , and territorial extension floating before his eager vision . As President , if he can be made such , it is 1848. 225 // expected of him that he will know how to carry out this policy , and he has shown abundantly already , that no constitutional impediments will be allowed to stand in his way . He would not hesitate to make war on his own responsibility , as Mr. Polk has done , with his full sanction and support . All the blandishments of Executive patronage and power would be freely used by him , as they have been by Mr. Polk , with his full assent and approval , both with Congress and with the people , in furtherance of whatever schemes or enterprises he might see fit to undertake . We who are Whigs look with equal disgust and horror on such doctrines and practices . Opposed to war , conquest , and territorial extension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dangerous policy and practice is made to hang on the Executive will , is promoted by Executive usurpations , or by the corrupt and wicked appliances of Executive power , we are more and more confirmed and earnest in our advocacy and maintenance of the great fundamental principle of our political faith , which insists that the President must be reduced from the monstrous growth to which he has attained under " Democratic " dominancy , back again to the legitimate proportions assigned him by the Constitution . We want a Constitutional Executive , not a monocrat , at the head of this government . We want an honest and a modest man to fill the Executive office , one who shall reel that the weight of his proper constitutional duties is quite enough for him to bear , without seeking to take upon bis shoulders the added burthen of all other powers of government , legitimate or illegitimate . But it is not only in such important matters as annexation , war , and conquest , that the President has been known to take an improper lead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosecution of the recent war , nothing in the way of exercising unaccorded powers wfts too bold or flagrant for Mr. Polk to attempt . He assumed , and exercised , the right of establishing civil government over provinces and peoples conquered by the American arms . And he established , by his personal authority , a regular system of taxation and revenue in all places held under military subjection , for the independent use of his military chest . In all this , Gen. Cass was a privy counsellor , and a principal adviser and supporter of the President , and now stands , as far as he and his friends have the ability , as the lawful successor and inheritor of the powers of the Presidential office as wielded by Mr. Polk . Of the prerogatives belonging to this office , when once war has been begun , we have Gen. Cass 's opinion very explicitly propounded in the Senate chamber . " Congress , " he declared , " could neither give him the President the power to carry on the war , NOR CONTROL THAT WAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing , or next to nothing , in the government , and the President is everything . Nor is this a new or accidental doctrine with him . It is the faith in which he has lived from Gen. Jackson 's day to this . It was the doctrine of that stern , self-willed , and wrong-headed old man , that the President is to support the Constitution " AS HE UNDERSTANDS IT , and not as it is understood by others . " His doctrine was , that " the opinion of the Supreme Court , " though formally pronounced in a judicial case , " ought not to control the co-ordinate authorities of this government . " " The opinion of the Judges has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the Judges , and , on that point , THE PRESIDENT IS INDEPENDENT OF BOTH . " And this was not a mere theoretical opinion of the " old Roman . " He acted upon it officially . In 1832 , he based upon it a veto of an important law passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction of the Supreme Court as to its constitutionality . And he did more than this . He refused to carry the law into execution , as it had been pronounced by the Supreme Court , in the case of the missionaries , Butler and Worcester , who , for the exercise of their holy office in Georgia , had been sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary of that State at hard labor for a term of years , under an unconstitutional law ; and he left these innocent victims to their fate . It very properly fell to the part of Gen. Cass , then Secretary of War , to convey to those interested in the matter the final determination of the President . This he did in a letter dated Nov. 14 , 1831 , and in which the President 's refusal to execute the law 226 Sept. , // was placed expressly on his own opinion of the validity of the statute of Georgia , in opposition to the judicial opinion and judgment of the Supreme Court . The " Democratic " doctrine of the supremacy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government , has been illustrated in other cases and has been too uniformly held and acted on in the last twenty years to allow us to regard it as in any way casual or accidental . The country has not forgotten when Gen. Jackson " took the responsibility " of removing the public moneys in the treasury of the United States from the custody of the law to his own personal keeping , or a keeping under his personal orders . He challenged to himself the . right to seize and control the money in the treasury , where the law had placed it , on the ground that " the custody of the public property " was " AN APPROPRIATE FUNCTION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT in this and all other governments . " " Congress , " he said , " can not , therefore , take out of the hands of the Executive department the custody of the public property or money , without an assumption of Executive power , and a subversion of the first principles of the Constitution . " And it is precisely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not under the Constitution , but as " AN APPROPRIATE FUNCTION of the Executive department in this and all other governments , ' *that Mr. Polk has acted , and justified his action , in setting up governments and exercising the sovereign right of taxation in countries conquered by our arms . And this is " Democratic " doctrine . The " Democratic " Convention at Baltimore declared , the other day , " that the confidence of the Democracy of the Union in the principles , " &amp;c. , of Mr. Polk , had " been signally justified by the strictness of his adherence to sound Democratic doctrines . " And Gen. Cass , the nominee of the party for the succession to this high office , to which such " appropriate functions " l*elong , beyond and above the Constitution , announces that he had carefully read the resolutions of the Convention , and gave them his cordial approval . It is the first article in the Whig creed that the President is not to exercise power as " an appropriate function " of his office , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appropriate function " of his office but such as the Constitution makes appropriate . We think and believe , if the President shall be confined strictly to his constitutional powers and duties , that we shall have no executive wars , no wars of conquest , no gratified lust after foreign possessions and territories , no annexation , no burthensome debts and grinding taxation , no intermeddling or corrupt tampering with Congress , and no vetoes of acts of ordinary legislation . Congress will be left to its own independent action , and the Supreme Court to its integrity . With all this , however , " Democracy " is at odds and enmity . It belongs to the political faith of the Whig party , as a principle in their creed , that the powers given to the Government of the Union should be faithfully used for the advancement of the common good and the common prosperity of the nation . We hold that the power to lay duties and raise revenue , and the power over commerce , should be skilfully and beneficially employed . The employment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power over the territories and other property , and over the money of the United States . We think that the financial plans and fiscal system of the Government should be arranged and established by Congress , with proper reference to the interests and business affairs of the people , as well as to the convenience of the Government . We think the revenue system should be adjusted with some proper reference and regard to the industry and labor of the country of every kind , as affected by foreign importations and the state of trade . We think that navigation should be protected along with commerce , and commercial facilities increased on the sea-board , around the great lakes , and along the courses of the great rivers , by judicious expenditures of the public money for works of necessary improvement . These are measures of national benefit and advantage which the Whig party are glad to contemplate , and which they will feel it their duty to urge on the attention of the proper department of the Government , whenever the " Democracy , " with its pestilent doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . But , of course , it is to Congress , and not 1848. 227 // to the President , that we look for these measures . It is in Congress , and not in the President , that the power over these subjects resides . If the President to be elected for the next term should agree with us in regard to the importance of these measures , he may , as the Constitution directs , in his discretion , recommer*d the consideration of them to Congress ; or Congress may consider them without his recommendation . But we do not look to him , however favorably or strongly inclined towards these measures , for any influence in their behalf other than that which the Constitution contemplates and prescribes ; least of all do we expect him to undertake to force them on an unwilling Congress , by threats of displeasure or promises of favor or reward . As Whigs we shall be satisfied , and we are bound by our principles to be satisfied , first with his recommendation of them , if such shall be his opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own work in relation to these subjects , without the interposition of his veto on the results of their labors . X , *Te think it must , by this time , be apparent to the reader who has followed us thus far , what , in our estimation , are the distinctive principles of the Whig party , and also what sort of principles a candidate for the Presidency ought to hold in order to be acceptable , as such , to the Whig party . As we have said , we are a conser*itive party , as well as a party of progress . We want a President who knows his place when he is in it , who will take the Constitution for his guide and counsellor , and who will be content with the limited authority it clothes him with . We want a President who will leave it to Congress , under such official recommendation as he shall deem it necessary or expedient to give , to shape the policy of the government for the time , so far as it may depend on legislation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend , by the Constitution , on th' legislative department . We want an honest President , one who , with Whig sentiments and feelings in his heart , shall be the President of the nation , and not of a party . If he be not thus honest and patriotic , he is no Whig , be he who or what he may . If he do not rule by the Constitution , and in the fear of God , and with an anxious de sire to see this nation built up in virtue and moral greatness , as well as in wealth and physical grandeur , and enjoying Liberty , supported by Law , Order , Goodness , and Truth , he is no Whig . ZACHARY TAYLOR has been presented to the People of the United States as a candidate for the Presidency , by a National Convention assembled at Philadelphia . This was a party convention , composed of Whigs , and convened according to the approved usages of that party in such cases . Probably no party convention ever met in this country which combined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its deliberations and its recommendations ought , we think , to come to the Whigs of the United States with the force of some authority . General Taylor was nominated by a strong majority over all competitors on a fourth ballot . From the first , his vote was not confined to single States , or to any particular section . Well known and honored Whigs from New England , and from the Middle and Western States , voted , from the beginning , for his nomination . We have seen no evidence , nor heard of any , that the Convention was infected with any corruption , or acted under any delusion or deception . If party organization is a necessary or desirable thing , we do not see how its action in this instance can well be repudiated . Those who are Whigs and mean to continue such , and who believe that they can offer patriotic service to the country in no other party combination so well as in this , will feel bound , we suppose , to give the nomination of General Taylor a hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall appear that the Convention which presented his name , acted under some palpable mistake or error , in regard to the character of the man , and the principles entertained by him . If it had appeared , or should turn out , that a Whig National Convention , like that assembled at Philadelphia , had nominated a man who was not a Whig in sentiment at all , or who , for defects of character or fitness , was unworthy of the support of a great party , we should certainly hope to see character and consistency enough in the party to reject such a nomination . But we think , at the same time , that a strong array of facts would be required to convince candid Whig* 228 Sept. , // that a Whig Convention had really fallen into so strange a mistake . It is undoubtedly true that Gen. Taylor , up to the time of his nomination by the Philadelphia Convention , had not , by any prominent act or action , on his part , identified himself with any party combination whatever . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in camps , and serving his country in the field . For many years he had been stationed on service upon our remote Western frontier , or in the Indian countries . He had been in no manner mixed up with politics or politieal parties . He had not , however , been unobservant of civil affairs ; he was not unacquainted with the civil history of his country , or with current events , or with the character and objects of contending parties . He was a reading man , a reflecting man , and a man of close observation . He had been in no condition to take any active part in public affairs , beyond what appertained to . his profession of arms . But he was not without his opinions on politics and parties . In a letter dated August 3d , 1847 , after stating that he was , what he had been represented to be , " a Whig in principle , " he says " At the last Presidential canvass it was well known to all with whom I mixed , Whigs and Democrats-for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of Mr. Clay 's election , and I would now prefer seeing him in that office ? o any individual in the Union . " It can not surprise any reflecting person that General Taylor , in camp in the face of the public enemy , when first approached on the subject of the Presidency , should have replied to all suggestions and solicitations rather after the manner of an old soldier than a hackneyed politician . The very first letter , so far as we can find , ever written by him in reference to this subject , and which was in answer to a communication addressed to him from Ohio , was dated at Matamoras , July 21st , 1846 ; and in it he holds this language " I feel very grateful to you , *ir , and to my fellow-citizens who with you have expressed the very flattering desire to place my name in nomination for the Presidency ; but it becomes me sincerely and frankly to acknowledge to you that for that office I have no aspiration whatever . Although no politician , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am a Whig , and shall ever be devoted in individual opinion to the principles of that party . Even if the subject which you have in your letter opened to me were acceptable at any time , I have not the leisure to attend to it now ; the vigorous prosecution of the war with Mexico , so important to the interests of my country , demands every moment of my present time , and it is my great desire to bring it to a speedy and honorable termination . " He continued to be plied with communications on this subject , and he continued to answer , when he thought himself compelled to answer at all , after the same manner . After the letter just quoted , we have seen nothing from him on the subject of a date earlier than the 28th of April , 184 ' 7 , written from his camp , near Monterey . This letter was in reply to one which had proposed to tender him a nomination by the " Native American Convention , " and in it he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which is not the case , ) I could not , while the country is involved in war , and while my duty calls me to take part against the enemy , acknowledge any ambition beyond that of bestowing all my best exertions towards obtaining an adjustment of our difficulties with Mexico . " It is worth observing that , in all his correspondence touching this matter , so long as he was actually in the field and engaged in military operations , so far from manifesting any eagerness for such a movement , he was constantly disposed to discourage the use of his name for President , and especially by any party , lest the effect might be to lessen , in some quarters , public confidence in him as a military commander , and so result in injury to the public service in which he was engaged . " I regret , " said he , in June , 1847 , " the subject has been agitated at this early day , and that it had not been deferred until the close of this war , or until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I am to be mixed up with it , as it is possible it may lead to the injury of the public service in this quarter by my operations being embarrassed , " &amp;c . In another letter he said : " My own personal views on questions of public policy about which his opinions had been asked were better withheld till the end of the war , when my usefulness as a 1848. 229 // military chief serving in the field against the common enemy shall no longer be compromised by their expression or discussion in any matter . " In another letter still , he held this language : - " If I have been named by others , and considered a candidate for the Presidency , it has been by no agency of mine in the matter ; ar*1 if the good people think my services important in that station and elect me , I will feel bound to serve them ; and all the pledges and explanations I can enter into and make , as regards this or that policy , is that I will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strictly in compliance with the Constitution . Should I ever occupy the White House , it must be by the spontaneous move of the people , and by no act of mine , so that I could go into the office untrammelled , and be the chief magistrate of the nation and not of a party . " All who remember the correspondence between the Department of War and General Taylor  --  the want of support of which he had constantly to complain , and the manifest jealousy of the administration towards him on account of his successeswill be at no loss to understand what the General means , when he objects to the agitation of the subject of the Presidency by the use of his name , and especially by any party , so long as he had such high duties in the field to perform , and for the efficieift performance of which it was so necessary that he should have , as far as possible , the full confidence both of the country and of the administration . It was not for him , voluntarily , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself openly before the country in an attitude of political hostility to the President and his administration , under whose orders he was operating in the field against the public enemy . If the people in any quarter should spontaneously move in the matter , he could not help it . He would do nothing to encourage any movemen*of the sort whatever , and as for political parties , arrayed in opposition to the administration , he would not , whatever might be his private opinions , take such a Lime to identify himself with any of them . At home , and in civil life , he could say , " I am a Whig , and shall ever be devoted , in individual opinion , to the principles of that party ; " but here I am a soldier , serving my country and my * hole country ; and here , in the face of the public enemy , under the orders of my constitutional Commanderin-Chief , I am an American-I have no party . My time , my talents , my energies , shall all be devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of either will I give towards making myself a party to any movement-especially by any political combination-for my elevation to the Presidential office . It is also true , undoubtedly , aside from the consideration just stated , that Gen. Taylor was then , and has been all the while , averse to his being looked upon by his countrymen as a mere party man . He claimed to be something more and better than this , and in giving voice to this feeling , he has sometimes uttered strong expressions , which need to be taken in connection with the character and professional occupations of the man , in order to be rightly understood . As a soldier , on an exposed and responsible post of duty , it seemed to him proper that he should be an American , and nothing else . As a patriot , and one who , though " a Whig , and devoted in individual opinion to the principles of that party , " was also a soldier and " no politician , having always held himself aloof from the clamors of party politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing were possible , that once more since the case of Washington , not to mention that of Monroe , a President of these United States might be elected by the common voice of the people , and without their division into rancorous and hostile parties . At any rate , he seemed resolved from the first , so far as he was concerned , not to give encouragement to any mere party organization to make him their candidate . The manner in which he constantly repelled the repeated advances of the " Native American " party , is very significant . But his language was consistent towards all parties . He did not desire to be a mere party candidate , or elected to be the exponent of any mere party doctrines . If elected at all , he wished to be left at liberty , and he resolved he would be , to " look to the Constitution , and to the high interests of our common country , and not to the principles of a party , for his rules of action . " Where the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , and squared , at the same time , both with the Constitution and the high interests of the country , of course he would have no difficulty about them , or about his " rules of action ; " and this , as we shall see directly , is exactly the state of things , and exactly his position in regard to the principles of the Whig pai1ty . Gen. Taylor thought it more becoming the high dignity of such a position as that of President of the United States , or that of a candidate for the Presidency , to declare that " the Constitution , in a strict and honest interpretation , and in the spirit and mode in which it was acted upon by the earlier Presidents , would be his chief guide " in that high office , rather than promise to do the will and bidding of any party . And he thought also , no doubtand he adhered for a long time , with characteristic and honest pertinacity , to this idea and this hope-that a President , though known to entertain sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported as the nominee of that party , would be all the more fortunate and happy , and all the more likely to be useful to his country , if receiving at the same time a popular support , irrespective of party . They were strictly popular movements , or so they seemed to him , which first presented his name for President , and it was in response to such movements that his a*sent to the use of his name was first given . Having consented to occupy that position , it was not for him to withdraw from it , though others might withdraw him if they chose . It was not inconsistent with that position that he should receive and accept the nomination of a party , at least of the Whig party , with whose principles his own were in accordance ; but then it was necessary this should be done without exacting from him any mere party pledges . Such , according to our understanding of the matter , was the position of Gen. Taylor down to the time of the holding of the Philadelphia Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' quarters , as a popular candidate irrespective of party . The question now was , whether he should be made the candidate of the Whig party . To this he was willing to assent ; two things , however , being expressly understood . One was , that he could not himself ivithdraw his own name as a popular candidate , in order to stand in the list of candidates before the Convention ; but he agreed that those friends of his who came into this Convention with his name , did , by that act , so far as they were concerned , pledge themselves , and were bound , to sustain the nominee of the Convention , whoever he might be . Considering the attitude in which these friends stood towards him , this was virtually a withdrawal of his name wholly from the canvass , in the event of some other person receiving the nomination of the Convention . The other thing to be understood in his behalf was , that in no event should any pledges be exacted of him as the candidate of the Whig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already freely expressed by him . The question presents itself , whether the Convention had sufficient evidence of the political sentiments of Gen. Taylor , to justify them , as Whigs , in putting him in nomination , in the face of his declaration , that he would give them no pledges beyond the general avowal of his sentiments already before the public . What then was known of his political opinions at the sitting of the Convention ? We venture to say , as much was known as could be known of the opinions of any man not actually brought up in the din and strife of party politics . He had already in repeated instances declared that he was a Whig , though he took care uniformly to qualify the declaration with the remark , that he was not an ultra Whig . Still he was a Whig , and " should ever be devoted , in individual opinion , to the principles of that party. ** But he did not rest finally in this general declaration . After the war was virtually over , and he was withdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and full declaration of his opinions . And we propose now to place that document on record , at length , in this journal , received as it was-in our judgment properly received-as satisfactory to the Convention which nominated Gen. Taylor to the Presidency , and worthy to be received everywhere , by all true Whigs , as an exposition of his principles , highly creditable to him , and wholly satisfactory to them . The letter alluded to follows , and the best 1848. 231 // Whig in the land may study it with profit and advantage BATON ROUGE , April 22 , 1848 . DEAR SIR - My opinions have recently been so often misconceived and misrepresented , that I deem it due to myself , if not to my friends , to make a brief exposition of them upon the topics to which you have called i*iy attention . I have consented to the use of my name as a candidate for the Presidency . I have frankly avowed my own distrust of my fitness for that high station ; but having , at the solicitation of many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not feel at liberty to surrender that position until my friends manifest a wish that I should retire from it . I will then most gladly do so . I have no private purposes to accomplish , no party projects to build up , no enemies to punish-nothing to serve but my country . I have been very often addressed by letter , and my opinions have been asked upon almost every question that might occur to the writers as affecting the interests of their country or their party . I have not always responded to these inquiries , for various reasons . I confess , whilst I hare great cardinal principles which will regulate my political ljfe , I am not sufficiently familiar with all the minute details of political legislation to give solemn pledges to exert my influence , if I were President , to carry out this or defeat that measure ; I have no concealment . I hold no opinion which I would not readily proclaim to my assembled countrymen ; but crude impressions upon matters of policy , which may be right to-day *nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of fitness for office . One who can not be trusted without pledges can not be confided in merely on account of them . I will proceed , however , now to respond to your inquiries . First . 1 reiterate what I have often said-I am a Whig , but not an ultra Whig . If elected I would not be the mere President of a party . I would endeavor to act independent of party domination . I should feel bound to administer the government untrammelled byparty schemes . Second . The veto power . The power given by the Constitution to the executive to interpose his veto , is a high conservative power ; but in my opinion should never be exercised except in cases of clear violation of the Constitution , or manifest haste and want of consideration by Congress . Indeed , I have jthought that , for many years past , the known opinions and wishes of the Executive have exercised undue and injurious influence upon the legislative department of the Government ; and for this cause I have thought our system was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The personal opinions of the individual who may happen to occupy the Executive chajr , ought not to control the action of Congress upon questions of domestic policy ; nor ought his objections to be interposed where questions of constitutional power have been settled by the various departments of government and acquiesced in by the people . Third . Upon the subjects of the tariff , the currency , the improvement of our great highways , rivers , lakes , and harbors , the will of the people , as expressed through their Representatives in Congress , ought to be respected and carried out by the Executive . Fourth . The Mexican war . I sincerely rejoice at the prospect of peace . My life has been devoted to arms , yet I look upon war at all times and under all circumstances as a national calamity , to be avoided if compatible with national honor . The principles of our Government , as well as its true policy , are opposed to the subjugation of other nations and the dismemberment of other countries by conquest . In the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own to stand on foreign ground ? " In the Mexican w&amp;r our national honor has been vindicated , amply vindicated , and in dictating terms of peace , we may well afford to be forbearing and even magnanimous to our fallen foe . These are my opinions upon the subjects referred to by you ; and any reports or publications , written or verbal , from any source , differing in any essential particular from what is here written , are unauthorixed and untrue . I do not know that I shall again write upon the subject of national politics . I shall engage in no schemes , no combination* , no intrigues . If the American people have not confidence in me , they ought not to give me their suffrages . If they do not , you know me well enough to believe me when I declare I shall be content . I am too old a soldier to murmur against such high authority . Z. TAYLOR . To Capt . J. S. ALLiSON . If we have been at all fortunate in the brief exposition we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our judgment , the sum and essence of Whig principles , the reader who agrees to these principles can not fail to discern at once , on perusing this letter , that if there be a Whig in this land-his own word being taken for it-Zachary Taylor is one . Let it be remembered all the while , that Gen. Taylor is no partisan-has not been brought up in the school of party  --  and is taken from the camp and the field , to be our candidate for President . Agreeing with us fully in feeling and sentiment , what should we expect him to say more than he has said in this letter ? Do we want him to be the President of a party , and not the 232 Sept. , // President of the nation ? Do we want him to be less modest and distrustful of himself than he appears ? Do we want a vindictive party chief in the Presidential office , rather than one who has " no enemies to punish-nothing to serve but his country ? " Is it not enough that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political life , " and those principles held in exact accordance with our own ? Must we exact in the way of pledges from our candidate , be he who he may , " impressions upon matters of policy , which may be right today and wrong to-morrow ? " Do we want a President who will go into office armed with the imperial power of the veto , and resolved to exercise it as a part of the ordinary legislative authority of the Government ; or are we content to have one who regards the veto as " a high conservative power , " to be employed only on high and extraordinary occasions ? Can we not be satisfied with a President who proposes to allow Congress to do its own work , in its own way , without the exercise of any " undue and injurious influence " from him ? What can we ask more than that " the will of the people , as expressed through their representatives in Congress , " on the subjects of the Tariff , the Currency , and the improvement of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shall " be respected and carried out by the Executi*e ? " Can we ask for a better man of peace than Gen. Taylor , who , soldier though he be , " looks upon war , at all times , and under all circumstances , as a national calamity , to be avoided if compatible with national honor ? " And if we are " opposed to the subjugation of other nations , and the dismemberment of other countries by conquest , " if we are opposed to the policy which would teach us to " quit our own soil to stand on foreign ground , " can we have a better or safer man to stand at the helm of government than Gen. Taylor ? Beyond all reasonable doubt , either General Taylor or General Cass must be our next President . And those who have looked carefully over the whole field can not fail to see , that the proper Whig strength of the country is abundantly sufficient to secure General Taylor 's election over his " Democratic " competitor , at least since the irreconcilable division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic " party . Of this there does not remain a doubt . The only question is whether the proper Whig strength of the country is to be given to General Taylor , or whether a portion of it-any considerable portion of it -- is to be withheld from him , and carried over to what is called the " Free Soil party . " The Free Soil party of 1844 secured the election of Mr. Polk , the annexation of Texas , the war with Mexico , and the acquisition by conquest of other vast regions , much of which slavery i*ow claims for her own . The Free Soil party , under its new auspices , may render another like service to the country by the election of General Cass , if it can find Whigs enough to help them . We can understand and entertain some respect for those quondam " Democrats " who , professing to plant themselves on a new issue , in which Hunkerism is their strongest and worst enemy , make up a third party , and present a third candidate , with a present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the regular or Bunker candidate , not through their own success , ( of which they have not the most distant idea , ) but through the success of the Whigs . But what shall we say of Whigs who join themselves to this movement at this time , with the absolute certainty staring them in the face , that every vote given by them to this third party is just so much done towards securing the election , not of the third party candidate , but of General Cass ? We suppose we may say without offence , that Whigs who prefer General , Cass for President to General Taylor , for any reason whatever , are certainly no Whigs at all . Their associates in the third party , the " Barnburners , " and perhaps all the rest , prefer General Taylor , and go expressly for the defeat of Cass . And certainly they are right , if " Free Soil " is really what they are after . It is Congress that is to be looked to to keep slavery out of the new territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Territorial Government . General Cass will veto any law of Congress which provides for the authoritative exclusion of slavery from these territories . To this he is committed . General Taylor , by the express terms of his letter to Captain Allison , is pledged not to interpose objections-if he should 1848. 233 // have any  --  to deliberate acts of legislation , " where questions of constitutional power have been settled by the various departments of Government and acquiesced in by the people . " And precedents are scattered through the whole history of the Government , of legislation by Congress on the subject of slavery in the territories , with the acquiescence of every department of the Government and of the people . We may conclude , unless all present indications are delusive , that no enactment will be r*ade by the American Congress for establishing governments in the new territories , which are now free , without some express provision to keep them free . It is probable that these territories will be sooner left to take care of themselves , in their own way , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union as free States . Every indication shows this to be the resolution of the North . General Taylor as President can not and will not stand in the way of this policy . He will have nothing to do with it , because it is one of those subjects that belong exclusively to the legislative department , and he will exercise no " undue and injurious influence " on that department . Oregon has been taking care of itself , and we suppose that New Mexico and California may take care of themselves in like manner . At any rate , Congress will look after the territories if anybody , and not General Taylor , * he is President . What do Whigswhat do Northern Whigs want more than this ? What will they gain , those of them who are wedded to this one idea of Free Soil , by aiding to elect General Cass ? for that is the effect of their adherence to the Free Soil party , in preference to their own . On all this subject of slavery , and especially in reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand by the compromises of the Constitution , and stand on just national ground , and the Whigs of the South will meet them fairly and generously . Southern Whig 's in both houses of Congress , with a single exception in each , went with Northern Whigs to a man , against the policy of acquiring another inch of territory from Mexico . And whatever Whigs of the South may feel compelled to do , on their part , now that such territory has been acquired in spite of them , in regard to the admission of slavery into it , at least they will expect every Northern Whig to stand up stoutly against it , and they will honor him for doing so . Let the great national party of Whigs have the sway in this country , and the Nroth will have nothing to fear from the encroachments of slavery . North and South , it is a common sentiment with Whigs that slavery is a great evil , political and moral : they have never done , and never will do , anything to e*-tend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; but they do not nourish and nurse it as a benefit and a blessing . Zachary Taylor is a slaveholder , and so was Washington ; but Washington had no love for slavery , and Taylor has as little . And we believe religiously , that the powers of this Government are as little likely to be employed , or perverted , to extend or favor slavery in the hands of Gen. Taylor , as they were in the hands of the father of his country . We believe Gen. Taylor will do all things well in the presidential office . His character is that of a sensible , just , honest , and humane man . The elements of his composition are all good ; he has good instincts and a solid judgment . There is nothing in his nature or in his disposition to make him go wrong ; neither envy , nor malice , nor revenge , nor meanness , nor low cunning , nor a spirit of intrigue , nor a wicked ambition . He is a man very difficult to deceive or to mislead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *when he is right , and he is as iron-willed when he is right as Gen. Jackson was when he was wrong . Such are all accounts of his character . We look to see him supported , not by Whigs only , but by sober men on all sides , irrespective of party . We did not advise his nomination , but now that he is nominated , we advocate his election . We believe his election will prove a blessing to the country , and to the whole country ; and it will be a double blessing , for it will keep out Gen. Cass , whose policy is that of Spoils at home , and War , Conquest , and extended Dominion abroad . It will stanch the bleeding wounds , and heal the putrefying sores and bruises of this battered Republic , and bring back to us peace , repose , a good name , and an honest pros derity.
