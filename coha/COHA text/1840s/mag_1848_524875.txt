txt HERMAN BLENNERIIA5SETT , Esq. , was a descendant of a noble family of Ireland , in the county of Cork . He was born in Hampshire , England , in the year 1767 , while his parents were there on a visit . The family residence was Castle Conway , in the county of Kerry , to which they shortly after returned . He was educated with great care ; and when a boy , attended the Westminster school , celebrated for its classical excellence , completing his studies at Trinity College , Dublin , whose honors he . shared in company with his relative , the celebrated T. A. Emmett . They read law together at the King 's Inn Courts , Dublin ; were admitted to the bar on the same day , in the year 1790 ; and between them existed ever after the warmest friendship . Having spent some time travelling in France and the Netherlands , he returned and practiced at the bar in Ireland . Expecting , however , to fall heir to a large estate in a few years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivating his taste for the sciences , music , and general literature . At the death of his father in 1796 , he became possessed of a handsome fortune ; but on account of the troubles in Ireland , in which he became politically involved , he sold the estate to his cousin , Lord Ventry , and went to England , where he soon after married Miss Agnew , daughter of the LieutenantGovernor of the Isle of Man , and granddaughter of General Agnew , who fell at the battle of Germantown . Lord Kingsale , and Admiral De Courcey of the navy , both married sisters of Mr. Blennerhassett . The latter expressing rather freely his republican principles in opposition to his relations , finally concluded to visit the United States , and make that country his future home , where he could utter his sentiments and enjoy the benefits of freedom undisturbed by spies or informers . Before sailing for America , he visited London , and purchased a large library of classical and scientific books , with a philosophical apparatus , embracing various branches , and arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his letters , wealth , and his own personal and literary merit , he became acquainted with some of the first families in the city. * Among others of his newly acquired friends , was Mr. Joseph S. Lewis , a rich merchant of Philadelphia , who became his business agent , and for many years his firm friend . Mr. Blennerhassett named his youngest son Joseph Lewis , in token of his regard for that gentleman , who was finally a considerable loser by this connection , and after Mr. Blennerhassett 's failure , and the destruction of his house and property , became the owner of the Island . His stay in New York was of only a few months ' continuance ; when , hearing of the rich valleys and beautiful country on the Ohio river , he crossed the mountains , and after spending a few weeks in Pittsburgh , took passage for Marietta in the fall of the year 1797 . Here he passed the winter , examining the vicinity of that place for a spot on which to make his permanent residence . He finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio river , fourteen miles below the mouth of the Muskingum , and within the jurisdiction of the State of Virginia . The situation was wild , romantic , and beautiful ; and as it was chiefly in a state of nature , a few acres only being cleared , he could reclaim it from the forest , adorn and cultivate it to his own taste . Its location also gave him the privilege of 368 From a volume of Biographical Sketches of the First Settlers of Ohio , by S. P. HILDREDE , MD. , of Marietta , written for the Cincinnati Historicill Society . * See American Review , 1845 . Article by Mr. Wallace . // holding colored servants as his own property , which he could not do in the Northwest Territory . The island was , moreover , near the settlement of Beiprie , composed chiefly of very intelligent and welleducated men-disbanded officers of the American army-whose society would at any time relieve him of ennui . The island itself was a picture of beauty , as well as all of its kind , at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its shores . The drooping branches of the willow laved their graceful foliage in the water ; while the more lofty sycamore and elm , with their giant arms , protected them from the rude blasts of the storm , and gave a grandeur and dignity to these primitive landscapes , now only to be seen in the remoter regions of the West . The island at present known as " Blennerhassett 's , " was then called " Backus 's , " who had owned it since 1792 . It is said to have been located by General Washington , as he owned a large tract of land liii -- mediately below , called " Washington 's Bottom , ' * entered by him in the year 1770 . It was first surveyed in May , 1784 , on a land warrant issued in 1780 , and a pateht made out by Patrick Henry , Governor of Virginia , in 1786 , to Alexander Nelson of Richmond , Virginia , who was a member of a mercantile firm in Philadelphia . By a bill in chancery of the High Court of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears that Elijah Backus of Norwich , Connecticut , bought of James Herron of Norfolk , Va. , in the year 1792 , two islands in the Ohio river ; the principal one being the first below the mouth of the Little Kenawba , then in the county of Monongalia , containing two hundred and ninety-seven acres , for the sum of ? 250 , Virginia currency , or about $833 33 . This island is of a very peculiar form , narrow in the middle , and broad at both extremities . In March , 1798 , Mr. Blennerhassett purchased the upper portion , containing about 170 acres , for the sum of *4,500 ; and soon after moved with his wife and child on to his new purchase-living in a large old blockhouse , standing about half a mile below the upper end of the island , built in the time of the Indian war by Capt . James . Here he resided while conducting the improvements near the upper end of the island , and building his island mansion , which was completed in 1800 . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his buildings and gardens . It was covered at this spot with forest trees , which had to be removed and stumps eradicated , so as to leave a smooth level surface , with expensive landings up and down the banks on both sides of the river for convenient access to and from the island . Boats of various sizes were also to be procured , and a company of eight or ten black servants purchased as waiters , grooms , watermen , &amp;c . His outlays , when the improvements were completed , amounted to more than 40,000 dollars . This sum , expended chiefly amongst the mechanics , laborers , and farmers of the new region where money was scarce and hard to be obtained , was of very great advantage to their interests ; and Mr. Blennerbassett may be considered as the greatest benefactor , in this respect , that had ever settled west of the mountains . The island mansion was built with great taste and beauty ; no expense being spared in its construction that could add to its usefulness or splendor . It consisted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in width , and two stories high . Porticoes , forty feet in length , in the form of wings , projected in front , connected with offices , presenting each a face of twenty-six feet , and twenty feet in depth , uniting them with the main building , forming the half of an ellipse , and making in the whole a front of one hundred and four feet . The left-hand office was occupied for the servants ' hall , and the right for the library , philosophical apparatus , study , &amp;c . The appearance of the mansion indicated the fortune and the exquisite taste of its proprietor , the grounds being laid out with great care and elegance . A handsome lawn of several acres occupied the front ground , while an extended opening was made through the forest trees on the head of the island , affording a view of the river for several miles above , and bringing the mansion under the notice of descending boats . Well-graded walks , with a carriage-way , led from the house to the river , passing through an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of native hawthorns bordered the right side of the avenue to the house , while back of 369 // Herman Blennerhassett . April , it lay the flower garden of about two acres , inclosed with neat palings , to which were traced gooseberry bushes , peaches , and other varieties of fruit-bearing trees , in the manner of wall-fruits . The garden was planted with floxvering shrubs , both exotic and native , but especially abounding in the latter , which the good taste of the occupants had selected from the adjacent forests , and planted in thick masses ; through which wandered serpentine walks , bordered with flowers , imitating a labyrinth . Arbors and grottoes covered with honeysuckles nd eglantines were placed at convenient intervals , giving the whole a very romantic and beautiful appearance . On the opposite side of the house was a large kitchen garden , and back of these , orchards of peach and apple-trees of the choicest varieties , procured from abroad as well as from the Belprie nurseries . Lower down on the island was the farm , with about one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest crops of grain and grass . For the last three or four years of his residence , a large dairy was added to his other agricultural pursuits , under the management of Thomas Neal , who also superintended the labor of the farm . The garden was conducted by Peter Taylor , a native of Lancashire , England , who was bred to the pursuit ; but under the direction of Mr. Blennerha.ssett , whose fine taste in all that was beautiful , ordered the arranging and laying out of the grounds . The mansion and offices were frame buildings , painted with the purest white , contrasting tastefully with the green foliage of the ornamental shade trees which surrounded it . An abundance of fine stone for building could have been quarried from the adjacent Virginia shore , hut he preferred a structure of wood as less liable to be damaged by earthquakes . The finishing and furniture of the apartments was adapted to the use for which they were intended . " The hail was a spacious room ; its walls painted a sombre color , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moulding , running round the lofty ceiling ; while its furniture was rich , heavy and grand . The furniture of the drawingroom was in strong contrast with the hall ; light , airy , and elegant ; with splendid mirrors , gay-colored carpets , rich curtains , with ornaments to correspond , arranged by his lady with the nicest taste and harmonious effect . A large quantity of silver plate ornamented the side-boards , and decorated the tables ; yet they had not entirely completed their arrangements , when the destroyer appeared and frustrated all their designs for comfort and future happiness . The whole establishment was noble , chastened by the purest to ste , without that glare of tinsel finery too common among the wealthy . Their style of living was in unison with the house and furniture , elegant , easy and comfortable . " Mr. B. was a highly intellectual man , greatly devoted to scientific occupations , which his ample library and leisure time afforded every facility for pursuing . He was studious , and fond of experimenting in chemistry , electricity and galvanism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such experiments as an amateur would wish to make . Astronomy was also a favorite study : a fine telescope enabled him to examine the constell tions in their courses ; a solar microscope to inspect the minuter bodies of the earth . In music he possessed the nicest taste and an uncommon genius ; composing harmonious and beautiful airs , several pieces of which are now remembered and played by a gentleman who , when a youth , was intimate in his family . His favorite instrument was the violincello , on which he played with admirable skill : the spacious hall of the mansion being constructed so as to give effect to musical sounds , the tone of his viol vibrated through it with thrilling effect , calling forth the admiration of his guests . Electricity and galvanism received a share of his attention , and many experiments were made in these wonderful branches of modern science . Among his trials in chemical operations , was that of converting beef into " adipocere , " large pieces of which were submer0 ed in the beautiful little cove between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He fancied it might e used in place of spermaceti for lights ; but the cat-fish and perch interfered so much with his trials , that he could never bring the " adi pocere " to perfection . He was a good classical scholar ; and so highly was he enraptured with Homer 's Iliad , that it was said he 370 // could repeat the whole poem in the original Greek . His manners were gentlemanly , and disposition social , hospitable and kind , especially to those with whom he wished to associate , but rather haughty to others . In mind he could not be said to be masculine and strong , but was rather wavering and fickle ; easily duped and deceived by the designing and dishonest . He had quite a taste for medicine , and read many authors on that subject ; which , with his natural propensities , often led him to think himself attacked with imaginary diseases ; and it was sometimes difficult to convince him that they were merely ideal . To his sick neighbors and servants he was kind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely tendering his medicines , of which he always kept an ample supply . His own heart being perfectly honest and free from deceit , he was unsuspicious of others , and very credulous in regard to their statements , which often led him into pecuniary losses in bis business transactions . In bargaining with a notorious cheat for a quantity of the shells of the river clam , which , in the early settlements of the country , before quarries of limestone were opened , were calcined in log-heaps and used for plastering rooms , the fellow said it was a difficult matter to collect them , as he had to dive under the water where it was six or eight feet deep , and must charge fifty cents a bushel ; when , in fact , he could collect any quantity where it was only a few inches . Thinking the man told the truth , he paid him the price , which was at least five times as much as they were worth . He was very kind and charitable to the poor and unfortunate backwoodsmen . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was soon after invited with his wife to dine with him . This man owed him a considerable sum for lent money . After dinner , he told him he would either cancel the debt , or give him an order on his store at Marietta for an equal sum , and let the debt stand . The sufferer was a man of honorable mind and just feeling 's ; he therefore chose not to add to his present obligations , but accepted the cancelling of the debt , which was imrnediately done . This man still lives , and related the incident in 1846 . Many such incidents are known to have occurred while he lived on the island . His wife was still more charitable to the sick and poor in the vicinity , many of whom felt the benefit of her gifts . With all these kind acts fresh in their memories , several of these men were found among the banditti who ransacked his house and insulted his wife , after he h*td been forced to leave the island from the hue and cry of treason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley of the Ohio . In person , Mr. Blennerh'hssett was tall , about six feet , but slender , with a slight stoop in the shoulders . his motions were not very graceful , either as n equestrian or on foot . Forehead full and well formed , with a rather prominent nose and good J ) roportioned face . Eyes weak , and sight imperfect , seeing objects distinctly only when near , so that in reading , the surface of the page nearly touched his nose . They had a nervous , restless agitation , which probably arose from weakness in the optic nerves , requiring the constant use of glasses . Yet , with this permanent and continual annoyance , he was a great student and operator in experiments . He was iso much attached to hunting , shooting quails and other small game on the island . To enjoy this sport he had to call in the aid of other persons whose vision was more acute than his own , who pointed the gun for him at the game , and gave the word when to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the greatest kindness , attended him in his short excursions , and , with the tact of an experienced sportsman , pointed out the object , levelled the gun , and stood by with the most perfect coolness when he discharged the piece . His general habits were sedentary and studious , preferring the quiet of his library to the most brilliant assemblies . In conversation he was interesting and instructive , confining his remarks to the practical and useful more than to the amusing . As a lawyer , his wife , who had probably heard his forensic eloquence , has been heard to say that he was equal to Mr. Emmett , and freqtiently urged him to enter as *n advocate at the higher courts of Virginia and Ohio , instead of wasting his time in obscurity , at his philosophical pursuits on the island . His library contained an ample supply of law books . A list of thirty volumes , 371 // loaned to James Wilson , a lawyer of Virginia , a few days before he left the island , is now among his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Blennerhassett dressed in the old English style , with scarlet or buff-colored small clothes , and silk stockings , shoes with silver buckles , and coat *nerally of blue broadcloth . When at home , his dress was rather careless , often , in warm weather , in his shirt-sleeves , without coat or waistcoat ; and in winter , he wore a thick woollen roundabout or short jacket . In this quiet retreat , insulated and separated from the noise and tumult of the surrounding world , amidst his books , with the company of his accomplished wife and children , he possessed all that seemed necessary for the happiness of man . And yet , in common with many of the distinguished men of his time , he gave no evidence of that clear religious faith without which there can be no solid contentment in any condition of life . The works of the French skeptics and enthusiasts , which were his favorites , could not guide his intellect to the simple truths of Christianity . He laid out his plan of existence for the indulgence of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which inspire men with true firmness and dignity . Mrs. Blennerhassett was more aspiring and ambitious , with a temperament in strong contrast with that of her husband . Her maiden name was Margaret Agnew , the daughter of Captain Agnew , a brave officer in the British service , and at one time the Lieut . Governor of the Isle of Man . General Agnew , who fell at the battle of Germantown , in the American Revolution , was her grandfather ; and a monument was erected to his memory by his grand-daughter , after her arrival in America . She was educated and brought up by two maiden aunts , who took great care to instruct her in all the useful arts of housewifery , laundry , pastry , sewing , &amp;c. , which was of great use to her in after life , when at the head of a family . They were led to this , in part , from their own limited means , teaching them to be frugal , and the need there is for every woman , who expects to marry , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In person , Mrs. Blennerhassett was tall and commanding ; of the most perfect proportions , with dignified and graceful manners , finely moulded features , and very fair , transparent complexion ; eyes , dark blue , sparkling with life and intelligence ; hair , a rich , deep brown , profuse and glossy , dressed in the most elegant manner . When at her island home , she often wore a headdress of colored silk stuff , folded very full , something in the manner of an eastern turban , giving a noble and attractive appearance to the whole person . These were of various colors , but always composed of a single one , either of pink , yellow , or white , adjusted in the most becoming manner and nicest taste , in which particular few women could equal her . White was a favorite color for dress in the summer , and rich colored stuffs in the winter . Her motions were all graceful , and greatly heightened by the expression of her countenance . No one could be in hcr company , even a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A very intelligent lady , who was familiarly acquainted with her in her best days on the island , and has since visited and seen the most elegant and beautiful females in the courts of France and England , as well as Washington city , says that she has beheld no one who was equal to her in beauty of person , dignity of manners , elegance of dress , and in short , all that is lovely and finished in the female person , such as she was when " queen of the fairy isle . " When she rode on horseback , her dress was a fine scarlet broadcloth , ornamented with gold buttons , a white beaver hat , on which floated the graceful plumes of the ostrich , of the same color . This ' was sometimes changed for blue or yellow , with feathers to harmonize . She was a perfect equestrian , always riding a very spirited horse , with rich trappings , who seemed proud of his burthen , and accomplished the ride ' to Marietta , of fourteen miles , in about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the forest trees , whi4ih then covered the grenter part of the distance ; reminding one of the gay plumage and rapid flight of some tropical bird , winging its way through the woods . In these journeys she was generally accompanied by Ransom , a favorite black servant , who fol 372 April , // lowed on horseback in a neat showy dress , and had to apply both whip and spur to keep in sight of his mistress . She sometimes came to Marietta by water , in a light canoe , ( the roads not being yet opened for wheel carriages , ) navigated by Moses , another of the colored servants , who was the principal waterman , and *ad charge of the boats for the transport of passengers from the island to the main . Her " shopping visits " were made in this way , as she directed the purchase of groceries , &amp;c. , for the family use , as well as for the clothing . She possessed great personal activity , sometimes , in fine weather , choosing to walk that distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in riding and walking , she could vault with the ease of a young fawn over a five-rail fence , with the mere aid of one hand placed on the top rail , and was often seen to do so , when walking over the farm , and a fence came in the way of her progress . It was performed with such graceful movement , and so little effort , as to call forth the wonder and admiration of the beholder . She was passionately fond of dancing , and greatly excelled in this healthful and charming exercise , moving through the mazes and intricacies of the various figures with the grace and lightness of the " queen of the fairies . " Her tastes , in this respect , were often gratified in the numerous balls and assefablies given , at that day , in Marietta and Belprie , as well as at her own house , where the lofty hall frequently resounded to the cheerful music and lively steps of the dancers . With all this relish for social amusements , Mrs. Blennerhassett was very domestic in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts of housewifery , but was also an excellent seamstress ; cutting out and making up with her own hands , much of the clothing of her husband , as well as preparing that for the servants , which was then made by a colored female . At that period , when tailors and mantua-makers were rare in the western wilderness , this was an accomplishment of real value . That she was willing to practice these servile arts , when surrounded by all the wealth she could desire , is one of the finest and most remarkable traits in her character , indicating a noble mind , elevated above the inVOL . I .. NO . IV . NEW SERIES . 25 fluence of that false pride so often seen to attend the high-born and wealthy . She was a very early riser , and when not prevented by indisposition , visited the kitchen by early dawn , and often manipulated the pastry and cakes to be served up on the table for the day . When this service was completed , she laid aside her working dress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion . At table she presided with grace and dignity ; and by her cheerful conversation , and pleasant address , set every one at ease about her , however rustic their manners , or unaccustomed they might be to genteel society . Her mind was as highly cultivated as her person . She was an accomplished Italian and French scholar , and one of the finest readers imaginable ; especially excelling in the plays of Shakspeare , which she rehearsed with all the taste and spirit of a first rate actor . In history and the English classics , she was equ lly well read , and was often called upon to decide a disputed point in literature , under discussion by her husband and some learned guest . her decisions were generally satisfactory to both parties , because founded on correct reasoning , and delivered in so gracious a manner . Few women have ever lived , who combined so many accomplishments and personal attractions . They strongly impressed not only intellectual and cultivated minds , who could appreciate her merits , but also the uneducated and lower classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of Belprie , rented and cultivated a field of corn on the island , near the avenue leading from the house to the river , for the sole purpose of stealing a look at her beautiful person , as she passed by on her way to ride or walk , as she was wont to do every pleasant day . Wirt 's celebrated panegyrie on this lady , was in no way undeserved , although , in appearance , so much like romance . Eight years had passed rapidly and happily away , since they took possession of their island hoi*e . Two children , Herman and Dominic , had been added to their domestic blessings , whose lively prattle and cheerful smiles seemed to make life still more desirable . Parties of the young people from Marietta , Belprie , and Wood county , with occasional visitors from more // distant regions , whom the far-famed beauty of this western Eden had called to see and admire , often assembled at their hospitable mansion . Social parties of the older and more sedate portion of the community , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights on the island , especially females of the families where they visited themselves ; so that they were as abundantly provided with social intercourse , as if living on the main land . A large portion of their visitors came by water , in row-boats or canoes ; as the country was so new , and destitute of bridges across the numerous creeks , that carriages were but little used . If travellers came by land , it was on horseback . A gentleman of taste , who visited the island in 1806 , described it as " a scene of enchantment ; a western paradise ; where beauty , wealth , and happiness had found a home . " The wild condition of the surrounding wilderness , and the rude . log cabins in which the inhabitants generally lived , by their striking contrast , added greatly to the marvellous beauty of the improvements on this remote island . Steamboats were then unknown , and travelling on the western rivers was slow and painful . Each man , r family , provided their own vessel , usually fitted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one hundred miles was a long one , more formidable than five hundred or a thousand at this day . The settlement of Belprie was the only one from Marietta to Cincinnati , that showed marks of civilization , in its well-built houses , nicely cultivated farms , and blooming orchards ; indicating an intelligent and refined population , who could appreciate the worth of their accomplished neighbors . A gentleman , who once lived in Marietta , and was a great favorite in the family , from his many personal and mental attractions , says : " I was but a boy when they left the island , but I had been a favorite in the family for years , and had passed many of my happiest days in their *ciety . My intimacy in the family of Blennerhassett is like an oasis in the desert of life . It is one of those green spots in the memory 's waste , ' which death alone can obliterate ; but the verdure of the recollection is destroyed by the knowledge of their ruin and misfortunes . " In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron Burr , who , like Satan in the Eden of old , visited this earthly paradise , only to deceive and destroy . " Like some lost malignant spirit , he went to and fro upon the earth , to harass and sneer at poor humanity . He was always so courteous , so polite and decorous ; so interesting , nay , fascinating , when he strove to engage the attention , that it was impossible to resist his influence . It was the atmosphere of his presence , that poisoned all who came within its reach . " In the spring of the year 1806 , this intriguing and artful man first visited the valley of the Ohi&amp;-his mind restless and uneasy , a disappointed , vexed man , whose hands were still red with the blood of the great and noble-minded Hamilton . No ordinary occupation could satisfy the mind of such a being ; but some vast , difficult and grand scheme of ambition must be sought out , on which he could employ his exuberant faculties . Filled with his future project of founding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the valley of the Mississippi , then , as he had ascertained , ripe for revolution  --  but the plan chiefly confined , at that time , under a cloud of mystery , purporting to be a settlement of the lands he had bargained for on the Washita river- " he descended the Ohio in a boat , landing as a passing traveller , merely to see and admire the far-famed improvements of the island . Mr. Blennerhassett , hearing that a stranger was on his lawn , sent a servant to invite him to the house . The wily serpent sent his card with an apology ; but Mr. B. , with his usual hospitality , walked out and insisted on his remaining a day or two . " He , however , made a visit of only a few hours ; long enough to introduce the subject of a splendid land speculation on the Red river , and to allude to the prospect of a war of the United States with Spain , and the ease with which the Mexicans might , with a little aid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He then proceeded on his way . A large portion of the following winter was spent by Mr. Blennerhassett and his lady in Philadelphia and New York , on a visit to his old friend Emmett ; where , it is probable , he saw Burr again , and matured the plan 374 April , // 375 qwq expecting to receive one hundred acres of land for each private , and more for officers . As to their being required to furnish themselves with a good rifle and blanket , it was of itself no evidence of hostility ; *s it is customary in making all new settlements , for the men to be armed , as was the case with the forty-eight pioneers of the Ohio Company settlers in 1788 . In the mean time a rumor had gone abroad that Col. Burr and his associates were plotting treason on the Western waters , and assembling an army to take possession of New Orleans , rob the banks , seize the artillery , and set up a separate government , west of the Alleghany mountains , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the trial at Richmond , and other sources , it appears that Mr. Jefferson was-acquainted with the plan of invading Mexico , in the event of a war with Spain , and approved it , so that Burr had some ground for saying that the government favored the project . But when no war took place , and the parties had become deeply involved in building boats , collecting provisions , and levying men , to which the baseness and treachery of Wilkinson directly contributed , it was thought a fitting time to punish the archenemy of the President , who , by his chicanery , had well nigh ousted him from the Chair of State , and had since taken all opportunities to vilify and abuse him . Another evidence that the government was supposed to favor the enterprise , is the fact , that nearly all its abettors and supporters in the West , until the Proclamation appeared , were of the party called Republicans , or friends of Mr. Jefferson , who hated and despised Burr and all in which he was engaged , as from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . By the last of October , rumor with her thousand tongues , aided by hundreds of newspapers , had filled the minds of the people with strange alarms of coming danger , to which the mystery that overshadowed the actual object of these preparations greatly added ; and many threats were thrown out of personal violence to Mr. Blennerhassett and Colonel Burr . Alarmed at these rumors of coming danger , Mrs. Blennerhassett dispatched Peter Taylor to Kentucky , with a letter , requesting her husband immediately to return , where he had gone on a visit with Mr. Alston . The history of this journey , as related by Peter , in his evidence on the trial , is an amusing sketch of simplicity and truth . He was the gardener on the island for several years , and was a singlebearted* honest Englishman ; who , after his employer 's ruin , purchased a farm at Waterford , in Washington county , Ohio , where he lived many years , much respected for his industry and integrity . During the month of September and fore part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five in number , published in the Marietta Gazette , over the signature of " Querist , " in which the writer advocated a separation of the Western from the Eastern States ; setting forth the reasons for , and the advantages of such a division . These were answered in a series of numbers , condemning the project , over the signature of " Regulus . " They were well written , spirited articles , and both are now understood to have been furnished by Mr. Blennerhassett , to ascertain the public mind on this subject in the West . As one of these neutralized the other , no direct proof can be adduced from them of his designing such a measure . The result , h6wever , was unfavorable to his project , and roused the public mind in opposition , both to the man and the cause he had espoused . Some of the articles by " Regulus " were much applauded by the editor of the Aurora , a leading government paper of that day , who considered the writer a very able and patriotic man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Graham , a clerk in one of the public offices , as a spy or agent to watch the motions of the conspirators in the vicinity of the island , and to ask the aid of the Governor of Ohio in suppressing the insurrection , by seizing on the boats and preparations making on the Muskingum . While at Marietta , Mr. Blennerhassett called on the agent once or twice ; talked freely with him on the object of the expedition , and showed him a letter which he had recently received from Col. Burr , in relation to the settlement on the Washita , in which he says that the project of invading Mexico was abandoned , as the difficulties between the United States and Spain were adjusted . He also 376 April , // mentioned his arrest and trial before the Federal Court , on a charge of " treasonable practices " and " a design to attack the Spanish dominions , and thereby endanger the peace of the United States , " of which he was acquitted . But all this would not satisfy Mr. Graham . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surmises of Mr. Jefferson ; and the Legislature , then in session , on the second day of December , with closed doors , passed an act , authorizing the Governor to call out the militia , on his warrant to any sheriff or militia officer , with power to arrest boats on the Ohio river , or men supposed to be engaged in this expedition , who might be held to bail in a sum of 50,000 dollars or imprisoned , and the boats confiscated : 1000 were placed at the disposal of the Governor , to carry out the law . Under this act a company of militia was called out , with orders to capture and detain the boats and provisions on the Muskingum , with all others descending the Ohio under suspicious circumstances . They were placed under the command of Captam Timothy Buell . A six-pounder was planted in battery , on the bank of the Ohio at Marietta , and every descending boat examined . Regular sentries and guards were posted for several weeks , until the river was closed with ice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the military during this campaign , such as setting an empty tar barrel on fire and placing it on an old boat or raft of logs , to float by on some dark , rainy night . The sentries , after hailing and receiving no answer , fired several shots to enforce their order ; but finding the supposed boat escaping , sent out a file of men to board and take possession , who , approaching in great wrath , were still more vexed to find it all a hoax . On the 6th of December , just before the order of the government arrived , Comfort Tyler , a gentleman from the State of New York , landed at the island , with four boats , and about thirty men , fitted out at the towns above on the Ohio . On the ninth , a party of young men from Belprie went up the Muskingum to assist in navigating the batteaux and provisions of parched meal , from that place to the island . But the militia guard received notice of their movements , and waylaying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them all but one , which the superior management of the young men from Belprie enabled them to bring by all the guards , in the darkness of the night , and reach the island in safety . Had they all escaped , they would have been of little use , as the . young men engaged had generally given up the enterprise , on the news of the President 's Proclamation and the Act of the Ohio Legislature . Mr. Blennerhassett was at Marietta on the 6th of December , expecting to receive the boats , but they were not quite ready for delivery . On that day he heard of the Act of Assembly , and returned to the island , half resolved to abandon the cause ; but the arrival that night of Tyler , and the remonstrances of his wife , who had entered with great spirit into the enterprise , prevented him . Had he listened to the dictates of his own mind , and the suggestions of prudence , it would have saved him years of misfortune and final ruin . In the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had notice that the Wood county militia had volunteered their services , and would that night make an attack on the island , arrest him with the boats and men there assembled , and perhaps burn his house . This accelerated their departure , which took place on the following night . They had learned that the river was watched at several points below , and felt serious apprehensions for their future safety ; although the resolute young men on board , well armed with their rifles , would not have been captured by any moderate force . The Ohio river , from the Little to the Big Kenawha , is very crooked and tortuous , making the distance by water nearly double that by land . Col. Phelps , the commander of the Wood county volunteers , took possession of the island the following morning , and finding the objects of his search gone , determined not to be foiled , and started immediately on horseback across the country , for Point Pleasant , a village at the mouth of the Big Kenawha , and arrived there several hours before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch the river all night , and arrest the fugitives . It being quite cold , with some ice in the stream , large fires were kindled , for the double // purpose of warning the guard , and more easily discovering the boats . Just before daylight the men , being well filled with whiskey to keep out the cold , became drowsy with their long watch , and all lay down by the fire . During their short sleep , the four boats seeing the fires , and aware of their object , floated quickly by , without any noise , and were out of sight before the guard awoke . They thus escaped this well-laid plan for their capture - arriving at the mouth of the Cumberland , the place of rendezvous , unmolested . On the 13th , Mr. Morgan iNeville and Mr. Robinson , with a party of fourteen young men , arrived and landed at the island . They were immediately arrested by the militia before the return of Col. Phelps . A very amusing account of the adventure is given in the " Token @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keville , in which he describes their trial before Justices Wolf and Kincheloe , as aiders and abettors in the treason of Burr and Blennerhassett . So far was the spirit of lawless arrest carried , that one or two persons in Belprie were taken at night from their beds , and hurried over on to the island for trial , without any authority of law . This was a few days before the celebrated move in the Senate of the United States for the suspension of the act of Habeas Corpus , so alarmed had they become , which wa* prevented by the more considerate negative of the House of Representatives . After a detention of three days , these young men were discharged for want of proot . Mrs. Blennerhassett , who bad been left at the island , to look after the household goods , and follow her husband at a more convenient period , was absent at Marietta when they . landed for the purpose of procuring one of the large boats , that was fitted up for her use , and had been arrested at Marietta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the trial . The conduct of the militia , in the absence of their commander , was brutal and outrageous ; taking possession of the house and the family stores in the cellar , without any authority , as their orders only extended to the arrest of Mr. Blennerhassett and the boats . They tore up and burnt the fences for their watch fires , and forced the black servants to cook for them or be imprisoned . One of them discharged his rifle through the ceiling of the large hall , the bullet passing up through the chamber near where Mrs. B. and the children were sitting . The man said it was accidental ; but being half drunk , and made brutal by the whiskey they drank , they cared little for their actions . On the 17th of December , with the aid of the young men , and the kind assistance of Mr. A. W. Putnam of Belprie , one of their neighbors , and a highly esteemed friend , she with her children was enabled to depart , taking with her a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Putnam also furnished her with provisions for the voyage , her own being destroyed by the militia , in whose rude hands she was forced to leave her beautiful island home , which she was destined never again to visit . They kept possession for several days after her departure , living at free quarters , destroying the fences , letting in the cattle , which trampled down and ruined the beautiful shrubbery of the garden , barking and destroying the nice orchards of fruit trees , just coming into bearing ; and this too was done by men , . on many of whom Mr. Blen* nerhassett had bestowed numerous kindnesses . It is due to the commander , Col. Phelps , to say , that these excesses were moctly perpetrated in his absence , and that on his return , he did all he could to suppress them , and treated Mrs. Blennerhassett with respect and kindness . This spot , which , a short time before , was the abode of peace and happiness , adorned with all that could embellish or beautify its appearance , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hostile and savage foe , rather than the visitation of the civil law . Before leaving the island , Mr. Blennerhassett , not expecting to return , had rented it to Col. Cushing , one of his worthy Belprie friends , with all the stock of cattle , crops , &amp;c . He did all in his power to preserve what was left , and prevent further waste . Col. Cushing kept possession of the island one or two years , when it was taken out of his hands by the creditors , and rented to a man who raised a large crop of hemp . The porticoes and offices were stowed full of this combustible article , when the black servants , during one of their Christmas gambols in 1811 , accidentally set it on fire , and the whole mansion 378 // was consumed . The furniture and library , a portion of which only was removed with the family , was attached and sold at auction at a great sacrifice , to discharge some of the bills endorsed by him for Aaron Burr a few months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dominic , the one six , and the other about eight years old , she pursued her way down the Ohio to join her husband . The young men , her companions , afforded every aid in their power to make her situation comfortable , but the severity of the weather , the floating ice in the river , and the unfinished state of her cabin , hastily prepared for her reception , made the voyage a very painful one . Late in December , she passed the mouth of the Cumberland , where she had hoped to find her husband , but the flotilla had proceeded out of the Ohio into the rapid waters of the Mississippi , and landed at the mouth of the Bayou Piere , in the Mississippi territory . The Ohio was frozen over soon after the boat in which she was embarked left it , and was not again navigable until the last of February , the winter being one of great severity . Early in January she joined the boats of Col. Barr a few miles above Natchez , and was again restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who received them with joy and gratitude from the hands of their gallant conductors . The whole country being roused from Pittsburgh to New Orleans , and the hue and cry raised on all sides to arrest the traitors , Col. Burr abandoned the expedition as hopeless , and assembling his followers , now about one hundred and thirty in number , made them a spirited speech , thanked them for their faithful adherence amidst so much opposition , and closed by saying that unforeseen circumstances had occurred which frustrated his plans , and the expedition was at an end . All were now left , at a distance of 1000 or 1500 miles from their homes , to shift for themselves . Several of the young men from Belprie , six . or eight in number , returned in the course of the spring . Two brothers , Charles and John Dana , remained and settled near the Walnut Hills , purchased lands and entered into the cultivation of cotton . Some time in January , Col. Burr and Mr. Blennerhassett were arrested , and brought before the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and recognized to appear in February . Blennerhassett did appear , and was discharged in chief , no proof appearing to convict him of any treasonable design . Burr did not choose to appear , but soon after the recognizance , he requested John Dana , with two others , to take , him in a skiff , or row-boat , to a point about twenty miles above Bayou Piere , and land him in the night , intending to escape across the country by land . The better to conceal his person from detection , before starting , he exchanged his nice suit of broadcloth clothes and beaver hat with Mr. Dana , for his coarse boatman 's dress and old slouched white wool hat , which would effectually disguise him from recognition by his intimate acquaintance . He proceeded safely for some days , but was finally arrested on the Tombigbee river , and with many taunts and insults taken into Richmond , where he arrived the 26th of March , 1807 . No bill was found by the grand jury until the 25th of June , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other for a misdemeanor . After a long and tedious trial he was acquitted , on a verdict of " Not Guilt q . " Mr. Blenaerhassett , supposing himself discharged from further annoyance , some time in June , started on a journey to visit the island , and examine into the condition of his property , which , from various letters , he learned was going fast to waste and destruction . Passing through Lexington , Kentucky , where he had many friends and acquaintances , he was again arrested , on a charge of treason , and for some days confined in the jail , as an indictment had been found against him , as well as Burr , at Richmond . He employed Henry Clay as his council , who expressed deep indignation at the illegality of his client 's arrest . " He had been discharged already in chief , and why should he be again arrested on the same supposed offence ? * But the government was unrelenting , and nothing but the conviction of the offenders could appease their wrath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , to Richmond , where he again met Burr , the originator of all his troubles and misfortunes . The magnanimity of the man is well shown , in that he never recriminated , or accused his destroyer with deceiving him , 379 // inasmuch as he had entered voluntarily into his plans , and therefore did not choose to lay his troubles on the shoulders of another , although it is apparent , that if he had never seen Aaron Burr , he would have eseaped this sudden ruin to his prosperity and happiness . The following letter is from the pen of Mrs. Blennerhassett , addressed to her husband at Lexington , and displays her noble and elevated mind , as well as her deep conjugal affection . It is copied from the sketch of Mr. Blennerhassett by Win . Wallace , published in Vol . II . of the American Review , 1845 " Natchez , August 3d , 1807 . " Mi DEARE5T LOVE : - After having experienced the greatest disappointment in not hearing from you for two mails , I at length heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an arrest . I think that had you of your own accord gone to Richmond and solicited a trial , it would have accorded better with your pride , and you would have escaped the unhappiness of missing my letters , which I wrote every week to Marietta . God knows what you may feel and suffer on our accounts , before this reaches to inform you of our health and welfare in every particular ; and knowing this , I trust and feel your mind will rise superior to every inconvenience that your present situation may subject you to-despising as I do the paltry malice of the upstart agents of government . Let no solicitude whatever for us , damp your spirits . We have many friends here , who do the utmost in their power to counteract any disagreeable sensation occasioned me by your absence . I shall live in the hope of hearing from you by the next mail , and entreat you , by all that is dear to us , not to , let any disagreeable feelings on account of our separation , enervate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will read with great interest anything concerning you ; but still do not trust too much to yourself : consider your want of practice at the bar , and do not spare the fee of a lawyer . Apprise Col. Burr of my warmest acknowledgments for his own and Mrs. Alston 's kind remembrance , and tell him to assure her she has inspired me with a warmth of attachment which never can diminish . I wish him to urge her to write to me . " God bless you , prays your " M. BLENNERHASSETT " On Burr 's acquittal , Mr. Blennerhassett was never brought to trial , but discharged from the indictment for treason , and bound over in the sum of 3000 to appear at Chillicothe , Ohio , on a misdemeanor , " for that whereas he prepared an armed force , whose destination was the Spanish territory . " He did not appear , nor was he ever called upon again ; and thus ended this treasonable farce , which had kept the whole of the United States in a ferment for more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last brought forth a mouse . " After the trial at Richmond in l80*7 , he returned to Natchez , where he staid about a year , and then bought , with the remains of his fortune , a plantation of one thousand acres , in Claiborne county , Mississippi , seven miles distant from Gibson Port , at a place called St. Catharines , and cultivated it with a small stock of slaves . While here he continued his literary pursuits , leaving Mrs. Blennerhassett to superintend both indoors and out . The embargo destroyed all commerce , and the war which soon followed put a stop to the sale of cotton , and blasted his hopes of reinstating his fortune from that source . In a letter to his attorney at Marietta , in 1808 , wherein he proposes the sale of his island for slaves , he says , that with thirty hands on his plantation , he could in five years clear $60,000 : cotton was then in demand , and brought a high price . His lady , with her characteristic energy , rose at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds , examining each field , and giving directions to the overseer , as to the work to be done that day , or any alteration to be made in the plans , which circumstances required . They here had the society of a few choice friends in Natchez , and among the neighboring planters . On this plantation they passed ten years , in which time one son and a daughter were added to the number of their children . The daughter died when young . Retaining still a fond recollection of his Marietta and Belprie friends , he in the year 1818 sent one of his sons to the college in Athens , Ohio , under the care of W. P. Putnam , the son of his old friend , A. W. Putnam . Here he remained a year ; at the end of which time , finding his fortune still decreasing , and m&amp;ans much cramped by his endorsements for Col. Burr , amounting to thirty thousand dollars , ten thousand of which were repaid by Mr. Alston , he in 1819 sold his plantation and moved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old friend , having given him 380 // hopes to expect a post on the Bench , for which he was well qualified . Misfortune having marked him for her own , soon after his arrival , his friend was removed from office , and his expectations frustrated . He remained here until the year 1822 , when he removed his family to England , under an assurance of a post from the government , which was never realized , and resided in the town of Balb with a maiden sister . It was while at Montreal , with prospects of poverty and blighted hopes thickening around her , that Mrs. Blennerhassett wrote those beautiful and touching lines describing " the island , " and her once happy home , which are given below , as well worthy of preservation " THE DE5ERTED ISLE .

" 381 // In addition to the expectation of office in England , Mr. B. also had hopes of recovering an interest he held in an estate in Ireland ; both of these , however , failed . He ultimately resided in the Island of Guernsey , where he died in 1831 , aged sixtythree years . Eleven years after his death , in 1842 , when his widow and children were reduced to extreme want , she returned to New York with one of her sons , both of them in very poor health , with the purpose of petitioning Congress for remuneration for the destruction of the property on the island by the Wood county militia in December , 1806 . The petition is couched in very feeling and appropriate language , in which she sets forth the outrages done to the house and property on the island . " Your memorialist does not desire to exaggerate the conduct of the said armed men , or the injuries done by them ; *but she can truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family had been noted for its elegance and high state of improvement , and that they left it in a state of comparative ruin and *aste ; and as instances of the mischievous and destructive spirit which appeared to govern them , she would mention that while they occupied as a nuard room one of the best apartments in the house , ( the building of which had cost nearly forty thoy*sand dollars , ) a musket or rifle ball was deliberately fired into the ceiling , by which it was much defaced and injured ; and that they wantonly destroyed many pieces of valuable furniture . " She would also state , that being apparently under no subordination , they indulged in continual drunkenness and riot , offering many indignities to your memorialist , and treating her domestics with violence . " Your memorialist further represents , that these outrages were committed upon an unoffending and defenceless family in the absence of their natural protector , your memorialist 's husband being then away from his home ; and that in answer to such remonstrances as she ventured to make against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was told by those who assumed to have the command , that they held the property for the United States by order of the President , * and were privileged to use it , and should use it , as they pleased . It is with pain that your memoriahist reverts to events , which , in their consequences , have reduced a once happy family from affluence and comfort , to comparative want and wretchednesswhich blighted the prospects of her children , and made herself , in the decline of life , a wanderer on the face of the earth . " This memorial was directed to the care of Henry Clay , then in the Senate of the United States , enveloped in a letter from R. Emmett , a son of the celebrated man of that name . H* says , " She is now in this city residing in very humble circumstances , bestowing her cares upon a son , who , by long poverty and sickness , is reduced to utter imbecility both of mind and body , unable to assist her or provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destitute situation , the smallest amount of relief would be thankfully received by her . Her condition is one of absolute want , and she has but a short time left to enjoy any better fortune in this world . " Mr. Clay presented the memorial to the Senate , with some very feeling and appropriate remarks ; having been formerly well acquainted with the family , and employed as his attorney when arrested at lixington , Ky . It was taken up and referred to the Committee on Claims , of which the Hon. William Woodbridge was chairman . His report on the memorial is a very able and feeling document , in which he advocates the claim as just , and one which ought to be allowed , notwithstanding it had now been thirty-six years since the events transpired . He says , not to do so " would be unworthy of any wise or just nation , that is disposed to respect most of all its own honor . " The report sets forth all the circumstances attending the " Burr treason , " as described in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very interesting , especially the statement of Morgan Neville and William Robinson , Jr. , two of the young men who were arrested and tried on the island as partisans of Burr , in Dec. , 1806 , and written for the future use of Mr. Blennerbassett , a few days after these events transpired . It is given as a correct history of the outrages on the island 382 // " Statement of Messrs . Neville and Robinson . " On the 13th day of December , 1806 , the boat in which we were was driven ashore , by ice and winds , on Backus ' island , about one mile below Mr. Blennerhassett 's house . We landed in the forenoon , and the wind continuing unfavorable , did not afford us an opportunity of putting off until after three o'clock in the evening , at which time we were attacked by about twenty-five men , well armed , who rushed upon us suddenly , and we not being in a situation to resist the fury of a mob , surrendered . A strong guard was placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our party who remained in the boat from going off with her , while we were taken to the house of Mr. Blennerhassett . " " On our arrival at the house , we found it filled with militia . Another party of them were engaged in making fires ( around the , house ) of rails , dragged from the fences of Mr. Blennerhassett . At this time Mrs. Blennerhassett was from home . " When she returned , ( about an hour after , ) she remonstrated against this outrage on the property , but without effect . The officers declared that while they were on the island the property absolutely belonged to them . We were informed by themselves that their force consisted of forty men the first night , and the third day it was increased to eighty . The officers were constantly issuing the whisky and meal , which had been laid up for the use of the family ; and when any complaint was made by the friends of Mrs. Blennerhassett , they invariably asserted that everything on the farm was their own property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordination among the men ; the large room they occupied on the firht floor , presented a continued scene of riot and drunkenness ; the furniture appeared ruined by the bayonets , and one of the men fired his gun against the ceiling ; the ball made a large hole which completely spoiled the beauty of the room . They insisted that the servants should wait upon them before attending to their mistress ; when this was refused , they seized upon the kitchen and drove the negroes into the washhouse . " We were detained from Saturday evening until Tuesday morning ; during all which time , there were never less than thirty , and frequently from seventy to eighty men , living in this riotous manner , entirely on the provisions of Mrs. Blennerhassett . When we left the island , a cornfield near the house , in which the corn was still remaining , was filled with cattle , the fences having been pulled down to make fires . This we pledge ourselves to be a true statement of these transactions , as impression was made on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ja . " Charles Fenton Mercer , Esq. , also , in September , 1807 , soon after the trial at Richmond , made a full statement of his knowledge of the events on which the accusation against Mr. Blennerhassett was founded , as they transpired hetween the 20th of September and 6th of December , 1806 , having been himself at the island in November , with his opinion of the object of the expedition , in which he fully clears Mr. Blennerhassett of any design against the peace and quiet of the United States . Mr. D. Woodbridge , of Marietta , in a letter to the Chairman of the 2d April , 1842 , makes a statement of the loss of property from the attachment of the government , and the riotou conduct of the Wood county volunteers on the island . In August , 1842 , while the subject was under consideration , news arrived of the death of Mrs. Blennerhassett at New York , and nothing more was done in the matter . She who had lived in wealth and splendor , and imparted charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a grave . She died in the most destitute condition ; and her last days passed under the soothing care of a charitable society of Irish females in New York , by whom she was buried . The reverses in this accomplished woman 's fortune , and in that of her amiable husband , illustrate the uncertainties of human life , and unfold the mysterious doings of Providence with the children of men . More than forty years have passsd away since these events were transacted , and not a vestige now remains of the splendid and happy home of Herman and Margaret Blennerhassett . All has passed away like the vision of a pleasant dream ; while the thousands of passengers , who annually travel up and down the Ohio , in steamboats , still eagerly inquire after , and gaze upon , " the Island of Blennerhassott " with wonder rind delight.
