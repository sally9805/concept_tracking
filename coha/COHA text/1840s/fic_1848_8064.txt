Sargent , Epes , 1813-1880 : Song from Song ( 1848 ) The Winter chill has pleasures still , And Spring is fair to see , In Summer 's heat the groves are sweet , But Autumn bold for me ! With Vine-Leaves on his honest brow , And Harvests in his arms , He comes , with all of Winter 's cheer , And all of Summer 's charms ! Chorus  --  But there 's nae luck about the house , There 's nae luck at a ' , There 's little pleasure in the house , If Woman is awa ' . The Flowers and Fruits that deck our board To her a tribute owe ; From her the Rose steals all its bloom , From her the Peach its glow : The Lily , in HER purity , May see its own eclipse ; And where did Cherries take their red If not from Woman 's lips ? Chorus  --  So there 's nae luck , &c.; The purple bloom upon the Grape , The Violet 's modest hue ,  --  Who does not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue ? And if the Orange Flower is sweet , And if the Hyacinth fair , Will any one their lovely tints With those we sing , compare ? Chorus  --  O there 's nae luck , &c.; And there be men of high renown , Who ' re welcome here to-day , In church and state , who ' ve garlands won , That will not fade away ; And tillers of the soil have come To grace our Festival ; And Horticulture 's peaceful chiefs ; And they are welcome all ! Chorus  --  But there 's nae luck , &c.; Then while we show our Garden 's wealth , And boast our Plums and Pears , And while we welcome to our hall , Our Governors and Mayors ,  --  Let ' s not forget , of all the charms That grace our board , the crown ,  --  But eat a lusty Pippin each , To Mother Eve 's renown ! Chorus  --  There 's nae luck about the house , There 's nae luck at a ' , There ' s little pleasure in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
