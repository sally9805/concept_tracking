Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : " WEEP NOT . " from Poems 1841 " Weep not  --  he hath gone home that little one . " Mullner . Gone home ! Gone home !  --  how many a prayer of love , Breath 'd out its ardour , to detain thee here ,  --  And Fancy 's dream its spell of fondness wove To make thee happy , as thou wert most dear . Tho ' round thy lip the smile complacent play 'd , And joy enwrapp 'd thee in her robe of light ,  --  Yet was it not the thought of home , that made Thy brow so beautiful ?  --  thine eye so bright ? The thought of home ! they deem 'd it not , who knew Thy dear delight , among the garden flowers , Thy loving heart , to warm affection true , And all the gladness of thine infant hours . Weep not :  --  ' mid thornless flowers that never fade , In bowers of bliss where raptures never cloy Thou hast thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our angel boy . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : ON THE DEATH OF A FORMER PUPIL . from Poems 1841 Nor long is seems , since she with childish brow Pondered her lessons ,  --  in rich fields of thought A ripe and ready student . Her clear mind , Precocious , yet well-balanced ,  --  her delight In varied knowledge ,  --  her melodious tone Of elocution falling on the ear Like some rare harp , on which the soul doth play , Her sweet docility , ' t was mine to mark ,  --  And marking , love . Then came the higher grades Of woman 's duty :  --  and the pure resolve , The persevering goodness ,  --  the warm growth Of every household-charity ,  --  the ties That bind to earth , and yet prepare for heaven , Were gently wreath 'd amid the clustering fruits Of ripened intellect . But soon , alas ! In search of health , to distant scenes she turn 'd , A patient traveller , still , with wasted form , Led on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lov 'd home , where spread in fadeless , green , The Elm , which cheer 'd her sainted grandsire 's gaze , ( Like Mamre 's Oak , o'er Abraham 's honoured head ) Far from the chamber , where her cradle rack 'd , And where she hop 'd her couch of death might be The Spoiler found her . The long gasp was hers , But the meek smile was her Redeemer 's gift , His victor token . And the bosom-friend Took that bequest into his bursting heart , As in the sleepless ministry of love , He stood beside her , in that parting hour .  --  See'st thou the desolate , on his return ?  --  Know'st thou the sadness of his lonely way ?  --  Deep silence , where the tender word had been ,  --  And at the midnight watch or trembling dawn , The sullen echo of the hearse like wheel , Avoiding every haunt , and pleasant bower Where the dear invalid so late reclin 'd , Lest some light question of a stranger 's tongue Should harrow up the seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first met his mournful view ?  --  What brings he to his children ?  --  Yon fair boy Who at the casement stands and weeps ,  --  can tell ,  --  And he , who can not tell ,  --  that younger one , Whose boundless loss steals like some strange eclipse Over a joyous planet ,  --  and the babe Stretching its arms for her who comes no more . Oh ! if the blest in heaven , take note of earth , Will not the mother 's hovering spirit brood O'er those fair boys ? It is not ours to say ,  --  We only know that if a christian 's faith Hath changeless promise of the life to come , That heritage is hers . And so we lay Her body in the tomb ,  --  with praise to God For her example ,  --  and with prayer , to close Our time of trial , in such trust serene . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : THE SLEEPING INFANT . from Poems 1841 Sweet infant , beautiful as light , That on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from wrathful winter 's might , It trembles through incumbent snows , Amid thy cradle sleep we watch , The varying thought that faintly gleams , As tho ' we fondly hop 'd to catch The angel-whisper of thy dreams . The angel-whisper . Tell us what Is breath 'd from that celestial clime . Thou , nearer to its while-winged host Than we who tread the thorns of time . Thou canst not tell ,  --  no words are thine ,  --  But the pure smile that lights thy brow Is sure the language of the skies ,  --  Oh keep it still unchanged ,  --  as now . Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : THE ORPHAN 'S TRUST . from Poems 1841 " When my father and my mother forsake me , thou the Lord will take me up . "  --  David . He , who around my infant steps , A firm protection threw , Whose prayers upon my head distill 'd , Like summer 's holy dew ,  --  The staff hath fallen from his hand , The mantle from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet rest . And she , who at each cradle-moan , At every childish fear ,  --  At every fleeting trace of pain Stood , full of pity near ;  --  Who to her fondly-cherish 'd child Such deep affection bore , She too , hath given the parting kiss , And must return no more . And therefore , unto Thee I turn . The never-changing Friend , Whose years eternal can not fail , Whose mercies have no end ; Thro ' all my pilgrim path below , A Father deign to be , And show that mother 's tender love . Who hath forsaken me . Sigourney , L. H.

" By the few , who scoop 'd the wave Shall our God , his Israel save ,  --  On ,  --  ye chosen ,  --  en with me ,  --  Yours the toil ,  --  the victory . " Small the band , yet on they prest , Heaven 's own courage in their breast , And the strong and haughty foe , Covering all the vale below ,  --  At their onset hold and high , At their trumpet 's fearful cry , Prince , and chariot , turn 'd and fled , Helpless in that hour of dread . Soldiers of a glorious head , While this leagur 'd earth ye tread , Lightly taste of Pleasure 's wave ,  --  Bow not down like Passion 's slave , Lest , while others watchful stand , Ye forget the promis 'd land , Lest , thy Leader 's voice decree Icy to them and shame to thee .
