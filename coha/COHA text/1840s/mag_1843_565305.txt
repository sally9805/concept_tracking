txt WE are aware that in attempting to review the liturgy of the Protestant Episcopal church , we shall awaken some jealousies , and perhaps bring upon ourselves many denunciations . Inquiry concerning this work seems to have been long since laid asleep ; and it has been permitted to occupy its place undisturbed as the ritual of a respectable denomination which uncharitableness alone can call in question . It has so long been held forth as " our excellent liturgy " with no one to dispute the appellation , that many who are unacquainted with it are beginning to suppose that it is a summary of evangelical doctrine to which no reasonable objection can be made , except the use of a perpetual form . When therefore this objection is by any means surmounted , nothing remains to prevent their adopting the liturgy as a convenient vehicle of their public devotions . It is supposed by some that if they get under the shadow of this liturgy they can escape from all the agita // tions of the religious community , and enjoy the calm of repose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this " form of sound words , " falsely so called , as we shall show by and by , where no heresies and no angry discussions can reach them . The fact is , however , that no creeds or liturgies can hold men in the truth if they only have the disposition to depart from it , or prevent agitation if life enough remains to be conscious of error . There are among those who use this liturgy as a formula of devotion , men of all theological parties , from the strict and pious Calvinist and the pious Arminian down to the Socinian and the Universalist . And whatever the words of this formulary may be , each class find some method of interpretation , or some compromise with conscience , so as to use them without hesitation . Those whose early associations have been formed in veneration of this liturgy may be wounded in their feelings by seeing its merits disputed . But much as we should regret such a result of our labors , and far as we desire to be from speaking evil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak out the real convictions of our minds . In this age of liberty and of free discussion , we hope that no instrument of man 's device is too sacred to admit of examination . We feel called upon to speak freely , though we trust kindly , not so much for the benefit of our Episcopal brethren , for we are not such novices in human nature as to expect to convince men who are already committed , as for the benefit of some in our own communion . We have observed with pain a disposition in some to leave the beautiful , simple , and apostolical churches of our ancestors , to which all our free institutions owe their existence , for the more pompous forms of the British hierarchy , not knowing , as we think , whither they go . There is a ocrtam imposing effect which is mistaken for devotional feeling ; and the interest they may be induced to take in the ceremonial appears to them an interest in religioi* itself . Hence instead of worshiping the invisible God , they have been unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is surrounded . Many there doubtless are who , through the medium of these forms , worship the Lord God of our fathers in sincerity and truth , in consequence of early associations and long continued habit . But when they who have been accustomed to a simple mode of worship  --  a mode in which nothing but God is brought to the mind-become enamored of these forms , it should be a matter of serious examination whether they are not losing that love of God which is satisfied with approaching his gracious throne directly , without the assistance or intervention of an imposing ritual . We are persuaded that the imposing effect of the Episcopal liturgy upon some minds , results not so much from the liturgy itself , as from the circumstances by which it is usually surrounded . Let the robes of the clergy be dropped ; let the various ceremonies of pomp and show be dispensed with ; let the splendid church and the splendid congregation be absent ; and let the simple cave or upper chamber of the primitive Christian , or the barn of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked would the liturgy appear ! How inappropriate and how absurd ! We have seen this exemplified in a country church hardly capacious enough to hold two hundred persons , and that not well filled , the clergyman not deigning to change his dress , and the people not instructed in the mechanical part of the services . The entire absence of all the pomp and circumstance of a large congregation , the surplice , the organ , the multitudinous uproar of many voi // ces , and all the other regular wheels of the machine , struck the mind with a sense of vacuity altogether beyond description . We thought of the superiority of our own simple worship , whose essential requisites are present whether it is performed in a splendid church or in a log hut , whether it has a crowded assembly of fashionable people , or a small collection of plain men dressed in the garb of the western wilds . And this is precisely the effect of the primitive , apostolical worship . These are precisely the circumstances in which it was frequently performed . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clogging the free aspirations of the soul , and as ill suited to the varying exigencies of human life which constantly arise . In prosperity or adversity ; amid the ravages of desolating sickness ; after fire or sword may have laid waste the land , or an earthquake have swallowed up multitudes of the people ; or a tornado swept over their habitations ; or some great and signal deliverance from such evils may have been had ; in the excitement of fear , or sorrow , or joy ; - it is the same dead form . The great subject of absorbing interest which fills the public mind must have no place in the devotions of the sanctuary , unless the bishop vouchsafe to send a prayer , as Bishop Onderdonk of New York did during the prevalence of the cholera in 1832 . This may come too late . And when it comes it is laid up in one corner of the service as a mere appendix to the usual forms . The chilling circumstance of its origin not in the heart of the supplicant , but in foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well accords with the place to which it is assigned , but destroys the whole spirit with which a prayer should be offered . There is indeed a prayer in the book for " a time of great sickness and mortality , " but it oc cupies a small space ; and is so little in accordance with the overwhelming impressions of such a season , that it falls far short of the subject . It is manifest that the author drew it up in other circumstances than those to which he would apply it , and had no deep sense of the sympathies which would then be excited and the bleeding hearts which would appear before God . And this is the character , mutatis mutandis , of nearly all the short prayers-concluded too in such a uniform manner that no wave of feeling is suffered to break the even surface of the waters . It would seem as though the mere repetition of words , like the prescription in the IRomish manuals for so many paternosters and so many ave marias , were the intention ; for there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made , and a new prayer begun . The total blank which this liturgy presents , and which every liturgy must needs present in regard to every great and absorbing interest occasionally arising , which ought to be made a subject of prayer in the Christian assembly , creates a corresponding blank in the heart . It prevents the full flow of feeling which the devout worshiper would otherwise possess . While he muses on the subject which occupies his thoughts and those of the community , the fire burns ; but when he goes into the house of God he finds nothing to meet the peculiar state of things . It is all the same as if nothing had happened . We might object further , and say that a stereotyped form of prayer is contrary to inspired example ; all the prayers recorded in the Scriptures being such as arose out of the occasion , and the Lord 's prayer , the only form given , being a mere model in opposition to the vain repetitions of the heathen , and not a form which there is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary also to the usage of Christians in the earliest and purest ages of the church . And moreover , this liturgy is a form established in an age of comparative darkness , when the church had hardly begun to put on her beautiful garments . But none of these points do we intend to enlarge upon . Great as these objections are , other and weightier objections press upon our minds . Having been long familiar with the liturgy of the Episcopal church , we deem it our duty and our privilege to give our opinion . Before we proceed , however , we beg leave to state a few facts in regard to the origin of this liturgy . All the reformers came to the knowledge of the truth as might have been expected by degrees . During the reign of Henry VIII , when the Papal authority was first cast off in England , the Romish liturgy continued in use . In the reign of his successor , Edward VI , Cranmer and others made several important changes by which they intended to reject the idolatry of Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformed , but only in the progress of reformation . The clergy were extremely ignorant , very few of them being able to preach , and some of them hardly able to read . On this account , homilies were composed which they were commanded by the king 's authority to read in the churches , instead of bringing forth their own crude notions in the way of preaching . As they could not preach , they could not pray to the edification of the people ; and therefore a form of prayer was as necessary as a form of preaching . The sources from which Cranmer and his associates derived the liturgy , were certain Ro mish missals , such as Sarum , York , Hereford , Bangor , and Lincoln . A The liturgy thus composed , was sanctioned by act of Parliament Jan. 15 , 1548 , no less than eight bishops protesting , but no convocation of the clergy being had. * The reign of Edward was short , being only about six years . The five years following were occupied by the reign of Mary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cranmer . When Elizabeth came to the throne , though from policy or education favorable to the reformed religion , she was very desirous of conciliating her Popish subjects . Cranmer and Ridley , and the other devout men who had begun to reform the liturgy in the days of King Edward , had been offered up a sacrifice to the Moloch of Popery in the reign of Mary . The same zeal for perfecting the liturgy , therefore , no longer pervaded the councils of the church of England . Elizabeth ordered the liturgy of Edward to be used in the churches , carefully expunging some of the passages which she apprehended would be particularly offensive to the Papists.t The reformation was now to be stopped just where it was ; and the liturgy which was composed in the incipient stages of the Reformation , was now stereotyped for all future time . Fixed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth , * We constantly see in the writings of Episcopal divines the sayings of the Prayer-book quoted as the sayings of the church . The church says so and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We learn here who this lady is . She is no other than the British parliament . The Prayer-hook is one of her acts just as truly as the law of the Protestant succession to the crown . This is " the church " who speaks so authoritatively . The following passage in the litany of King Edward was stricken out by order of queen Elizabeth " From the tyranny of the Bishop of Rome and all his detestable enormities , good Lord deliver us . " The rubric ( leclaring that by kneeling at the sacrament no adoration was intended to the corporeal presence of Christ , was also stricken out . This however was restored in the reign of Charles II , but it is not in the American Prayerbook . ( See Neal 's History of the Puritans , Vol . I , pp. 177 and 376 , edition 1S1G , Newburyport. ) // when every thing was unsettled , this is the work which in England has continued with no material alteration unchanged to the present day , and in this country has had few alterations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the time of Cranmer , the public mind was unprepared to dispense with a liturgy , as such a mode of worship had been long in use . It was the progress of religious knowledge and of freedom which induced the Puritans to pray themselves , instead of using other men 's prayers . Whether Cranmer and his associates , had they lived , would have proceeded to a farther reformation of the liturgy , or whether they would have dispensed with a liturgy entirely , is a subject on which there will be different opinions . One thing is certain , that the liturgy as it now is , was established under the supreme influence of a sovereign who was a jealous guardian of the royal prerogative , and quite willing to retain every relic of Popery which could be reconciled with her own supremacy . That a work which had its origin in such circumstances should serve as a directory of worship in this enlightened age , in the progress of missionary enterprise , in the multiplication of revivals of religion , and in the dawn of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known how to worship God in a manner which admits a free expression of feeling in accordance with the change of times , the spirit of the age , and the maturity of the church , is to us a matter both of regret and surprise . As the book was compiled in the infancy of Protestantism , when Popery was for the most part the religion of the people , there is a great accommodation to the latter religion in its general arrangement . Hence we find not only Christmas provided for without any scriptural authority , but Advent , Epiphany , Ash Wednesday , Lent , Good Friday , Easter , &amp;c. &amp;c . We find also St. Andrew 's day , St. Thomas 's day , St. Stephen 's , St. John 's , St. Mark 's , St. Matthew 's , St. Bartholomew 's , &amp;c. &amp;c . And though some of the saints ' days of the Romish ritual are omitted , abundant compensation is made for the omission by the appointment of All Saints ' day . So if they should fail of paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may atone for it . To say nothing of the Popish system of canonizing particular persons , as though John , or Matthew , or Stephen , were any more a saint than other Christians , this part of the Prayer-book is plainly contrary to Protestantism , and contrary to scripture . What authority can be produced for setting apart particular days with special services , in reference to men of like passions with ourselves ? And if the birth of Christ was intended to be celebrated rather than his whole work of redemption , why is there no hint in the Bible whereby we can determine the day ? And why is it a matter of perfect uncertainty , with all the lights of history , upon what day that event fell ? So also we may inquire for the significancy of Advent ? If it celebrates the coming of Christ , as the word would seem to imply , what advance does it make upon the views which we receive from the Bible concerning the coming of the long promised Messiah ? Why should " Epiphany , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular feast , when that idea is fundamental to the very existence of the gospel , and is held forth in every exhibition of Christ which is made to the people ? What is accomplished in the work of man 's salvation by Ash Wednesday , Lent , Good Friday ? Is any impression created by this long fast more lasting or practical than by the ordinary preaching of the gospel ? What // does Easter Sunday mean in commemoration of the resurrection of Christ , when every Sunday is intended for the same thing ? And Trinity Sunday ? - we confess we are in darkness here also . We have never been able to learn any plausible reason for such a day . Surely " the church " does not require a worship of the Trinity more on this day than at other times . And commemoration here is out of the question . In our humble opinion , a day called Christian-Sunday or God-Sunday , would have been quite as proper . The truth undoubtedly is , that all those days were found in the Roman Catholic ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was compiled , it did not occur to the authors that they could be dispensed with . " The Annunciation of the blessed Virgin Mary , " is another day of the same character ; and as no gospel truth is made plainer or more efficient by any of these days , we can not conceive any possible use to which they can be applied , unless it is to preserve that savor of Popery which has already resulted in the extensive prevalence of Puseyism . Nor do we like , any better than we do these feasts and fasts , the appellation of " priest , " constantly given to ministers of the gospel , it is contrary to New Testament usage , and contrary to fact . A priest is one that offers sacrifices . The Roman Catholic ritual retains this appellation because the priest is supposed to offer the sacrifice of the mass ; but no such thing is pretended by any true Protestants . Under the Christian dispensation there is but one priest , the great " High Priest of our profession , " the Lord Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . The whole body of Christians are figuratively called " an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices , " but no one class are so designated . We regard these general features of the Prayer-book , together with other things which we intend to mention , as extremely disastrous to the cause of truth and experimental religion in the Episcopal church . If the idolatry of the church of Rome is not directly authorized by the liturgy , yet such affinities with it are retained , as may easily decoy men into it. * We believe that the Popish dress of the liturgy furnishes a half-way house to Popery itself ; and that the entertainments of that house being served up with exclusive pretensiorts to ordination and validity of ordinances , and some mysterious sanctity or power conveyed by the imposition of the bishop 's hands from the Apostles through the church of Rome , lead directly to this result.t And instead of wondering that there have * It is a remarkable fact that no less than three clergymen of the Episcopal church in Connecticut have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We allude to Dr. Kewley of Middletown , Mr. Barber of Waterbury , and Mr. White of Derby . We use the phrase validity of ordi , zances , because this is the current language of Episcopalians ; but we confess we have never been able to attach an intelligible idea to it . We conceive an ordinance to be valid if accompanied by the divine blessing , and invalid if not . That is , we do not conceive that ordinances are any thing in themselves but only as they affect the heart , or teach some important truth . If a sinner hears the gospel and is induced by it to give up his heart to Christ , becoming regenerate by the Holy Spirit , we suppose his regeneration is valid whoever may have been the preacher ; and to question the validity of preaching which issues in salvation , appears to us supreme nonsense . So also if a Christian communes with the Lord Jesus Christ and his brethren at the Lord 's table and finds spiritual nourishment thereby , in our plain way of thinking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been laid on the administrator or not . The validity of ordinances is a phrase which takes its origin from the same Popery that talks of holy vestments , holy houses , consecrated burying grounds , holy wafers , holy water , holy crucifixes , &amp;c. // been so many examples of it , we rather wonder that there have been so few . We regard the recent developments under the name of Tractarianisrn , as much the same thing , and arising from the same cause . There is a broad foundation laid for this error in the usages and preaching of the Episcopal church , and the affinity produced by them to something different from all the rest of the Protestant world . We believe it will be found that no where among Protestants has the principle prevailed , that ordination in order to be legitimate , must be derived in uninterrupted succession from the apostles , except in the English Episcopal church and the offshoots from her . We see in this fact how far the idea is from the Scriptures , since nobody has discovered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking . When Bancroft , chaplain to Archbishop Whitgift , afterwards Bishop of London , first broached this idea in 1588 , it was received with misgivings by nearly all that heard it . Some were afraid it would prejudice the Queen 's prerogative ; for if the bishops acted by divine right derived through the church of Rome , what would become of her supremacy as head of the church ? Others were afraid of disaffecting the foreign Protestants , and by a new doctrine separating themselves from their communion . The effect which Bancroft intended of elevating the hierarchy , then confessedly founded on human authority , above Presbyterianism , would hardly compensate , in the opinion of some of the adherents of the church of England , for the loss of the confidence of the Protestant churches abroad . The idea however was so consonant to prelatical pride that it rapidly gained the ascendancy ; and it has been handed down to the present day with no abatement of its arrogant pretensions . Were there any foun dation for this idea of apostolic succession , the Nestorian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , could put in a claim for it infinitely better than any of our Episcopal brethren in this country or in England . But he discarded the idea . Protestants are the last persons in the world who can reasonably assert such a claim ; for they must derive it through the church of Rome  --  a church which has long ago excommunicated them all . They can not therefore with any show of reason pretend to exercise powers which she who gave them has officially taken away . If the church of England ever had that imaginary thing , the apostolic succession , it was taken from her by the supreme authority from which it was derived . If a man derives authority to exercise the office of a sheriff from the government , and the same government revokes that authority , it is clear that he is sheriff no longer ; and he can neither communicate the office to others nor exercise it himself , unless by other authority than that from which he derived it . So also the church of England , having been disfranchised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or it is all a vain pretense . She can do nothing by virtue of authority from Rome , Rome having taken back whatever she gave . This principle extends of course to her descendant in America . If it should be said that the power being once communicated is inalienable , that ordination impresses an indelible character ; we reply , we can form no idea of such a thing , and we do not believe that others can . And that our Episcopal brethren do not credit it , appears from the fact that they sometimes depose a minister and by that means obliterate his clerical character , the imposition of the bishop 's hands notwithstanding . had the reformation in the English church proceeded farther , and // the liturgy been founded strictly on the principles of Protestantism , holding forth in every shape an abhorrence of Popery-rejecting even an innocent usage which had been prostituted to idolatry , and associated with that in the minds of the people , as the Puritans wished ; and had the pride and self-glorification of Bancroft and his coadjutors met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day the mother church in England , and her daughter in America , much less exposed to the influx of iRomish doctrines . When Hezekiah , king of Judah , perceived that even so sacred a relic of antiquity as the brazen serpent of Moses was perverted to idolatry , " he brake it in pieces , " and by way of derision " called it Nehushtan . " Had the men who gave character to the English church been such thorough reformers , that communion would never have been cursed as it now is with the manifestation of a propensity to relapse into the worst doctrines of Romanism . We repeat it , then , that the Popish tendencies of the liturgy , supported by exclusive pretensions to validity of ordination and of sacraments derived from the church of Rome , prepare the mind for a return to Popery . When therefore Romish doctrine appears in the Oxford tracts , and circulates extensively among those who have lived under such an influence , it is as seed suited to the soil already watered to receive it . It springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence , the single fact that Puscyism finds all its disciples among the jure divino Episcopalians , is proof enough of our assertion . Other Protestants have no more thought of becoming Puseyites than of becoming Mohammedans ; an argument after the manner of the Oxford divines having not the shadow of plausibility to their minds . The forms of address to the peo pIe which are interspersed throughout the Prayer-book , were well enough to serve a temporary purpose , but are miserably adapted for perpetual use . When the clergy were so ignorant that they could not make an address themselves , it was right and proper to compose one for them ; but when they are able to write sermons these forms ought to be given up . There is an obvious objection to them , arising from the fact that one set of words frequently repeated as an exhortation to the people , becomes of course a matter of no significancy . It is like a constant repetition of the same sermon from sabbath to sabbath , which would be an intolerable annoyance . The first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abounding in tautologies which no preacher of the present day would dare to put forth . The people are exhorted to acknowledge and confess their manifold sins and wickedness-not to dissemble nor cloak them , when they assemble and meet together . They are to ask those things which are requisite and necessary . These defects of language in an ordinary exhortation would be considered unpardonable . The reason they are not noticed here is , that the whole exhortation is a mere dead letter , serving only to fill up a place in the book without any meaning . It is moreover somewhat absurd , or at least it presupposes a remarkable degree of indifference to public worship , that the worshipers should need twice a day to be exhorted in the same words to pray , when that is the very object for which they are assembled . Not only this , but all the addresses seem to proceed upon the hypothesis that the minister is incompetent to do any thing but read other men 's thoughts-an hypothesis which was no doubt founded in truth in respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means so at // the present day . Nothing is placed at the discretion of the officiating minister but the reading or omitting to read some portions of the appointed service . What a contemptuous treatment is this of the clergy ! * Let us now examine the services prescribed for every Sahhath . We have already remarked upon the address to the people as unhappy for the present day , however it might have answered a temporary purpose in the day in which it was first composed . The " general confession " which follows , is an admi rable summary , expressed in simple language , though alfogether too general . It is inferior , in our opinion , to many an extempore prayer flowing from a full heart , deeply impressed with a sense of sin , and richly furnished with scriptural language . But yet it is excellent . The absolution which follows , however , is a perfect nullity . It seems to he a general principle of the liturgy , that when confession is made , absolution follows . This can he accounted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least * The addresses in the Prayer-book , not only presuppose that the clergy are ignorant and incompetent to teach , hut they also manifestly assume , that the people are so profoundly innorant as to need to be told , over and over continually , the first principles  --  the very rudiInents of the Christian religion . Thus , in the address at the opening of the daily mornin and evening prayer , the people are not only exhorted to pray-as if they did not know for what purpose they had come together  --  but they are treated as being so ignorant as not to know , or so stupid as not to consider , that the Scripture inculcates the sinfulness of man , and the necessity of repentance . And therefore , with much formality , these elementary truths are drawn out , and amplified , and urged , in two long , complicated , and heavy sentences , as a necessary preparation for the ordinary worship of God . The minister must say : " Dearly beloved brethren , the Scripture moveth admon. isheth us , in sundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickedness , and that we should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty God , our heavenly Father , hut confess them with an humble , lowly , penitent and obedient heart ; to the end that we may obtain forgiveness of the same , hy through his infinite goodness and mercy . Ahd although as we ougbt , at all times , humbly to acknowledge our sins before God , yet ought we we ought chiefly especially so to do , when tve assemble and meet together , to render thanks for the great benefits that we have received at his hands , to set forth his most worthy praise , to render him deserved homage , to hear his most holy word , and to ask those things which are requisite and necessary , as well both for the body as and the soul . " The other addresses in the liturgy presuppose , in the clergy the same incompetence to instruct , and in the people the same profound ignorance and stupidity . They are also drawn up in a style equally feeble , prolix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notifying seasons of communion , and at the communion table ; and also the addresses to be made to the *ick , and to prisoners and condemned malefactors . It is also noticeable , that long , verbose , tan tological , and ill-constructed sentences occur in every part of the Prayer-book , except in the portions translated from the Scriptures . Tautology , indeed ,  --  or the repetition of the same thought in another form , and the coupling together of synonymous words ,  --  seems to have been studiously sought after , as if it was a great beauty of style : and long , complicated , and verbose sentences seem to have been regarded as most consonant to good taste . The collects , prayers , and thanksgivings are , almost uniformly , thrown into long and complicated sentences , in which a happy precision of thought , and a pleasing vivacity of expression , are by no means usual characteristics . The collects for the several Sundays and holy days , roost commonly labor to bring out some obscure or fanciful analogy between the day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , not unfrequently , a partial or a total failure . In some insta , ices , such a fog is raised , and such indistinct vision produced , that the whole collect is involved in great obscurity . Thus the collect for the first Sunday in Ad. vent contains this very confused picture " Almighty God , give us grace that we may cast away the works of darkness , and put upon us tho ? or we ? the armor of light , now in the time of this mortal life , in which thy Son , Jesus Christ came to inset us , great humility ; that , in tiec last day , when he shall come again in frs glorious majesty to judge both the quick and dead , we may rise to life inemortal , through Him who liveth and reigneth 1843. 477 // something which should be called by that name , was necessary in the time of Edward , lest too great a shock should be produced in the minds of those who had been accustomed to such a service in the Romish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appears to be an attempt to unite the Protestant idea that God only forgives sins , with the Popish , that absolution must come from the priest . Accordingly , the minister is directed to stand while the people continue kneeling . And what does the minister say ? He declares that " God hath given power and commandment to his ministers to declare and pronounce to his people being penitent , the absolution and remission of their sins . " What then ? Does the minister exercise this power and obey this commandment ? By no means . He tells them that " He ( God ) pardoneth and absolveth all those who truly repent , and unfeignedly believe his holy gospel . " Here then is a complete contradiction . God has given power and commandment to his ministers to pronounce abso with thee and the Holy Ghost , now and ever . Amen . " Here the three dramatic unities , of time , place and action , are all disregarded ; and the scene shifts so often , so suddenly , so totally beyond all calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly . For similar examples , see the collects for the third and fourth Sundays in Advent , and for Epiphany , and for all the Sundays in Lent . The collect for peace , in the daily morning prayer , presents an equally confused picture to the mind . Indeed it is most manifest , that the writer had no distinct idea of the object for which he would teach us to pray . It might be peace with God , or peace in the conscience , or domestic or social peace , or peace among contending factions , or peace among warring nations , or any , or all of these comhined . The language of the collect is : " 0 God , who art the author of peace and lover of concord , in knowledge of whom standeth is our eternal life , whose service is perfect freedom ; defend us , thy humble unworthy servants , in from all assaults of our enemies ; that we , surely safely trustin , , in thy defense , may not fear the power of any adversavies , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In all parts of the liturgy , the diction and phraseology are antiquated , unpolished , and at variance with good taste . We mi* ht reasonably expect such to be the style of the work , as it was originally drawn up in the *e of King Edward VI ; hut we are surprised to find that the same faulte are continued and handed down through all subsequent revisions of the hook ; and are even imitated and made conspicuous in the most recent additions to the volume . The English and American compilers of the liturgy seem to have as great abhorrence of modern taste in language , as the Quakers have of modern taste in dress ; for , as the latter scrupulously avoid appearing in public dressed like other people , so the former scrupulously avoid using in the house of God the diction and phraseology sanctioned by general custom . Among the faults to which we have alluded , the following are worthy of more specific notice . 1 . We often meet with words which are entirely obsolete , or at least are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of this character are the following : Let , for hindrance ; and to let , as a verb , in the same sense-Prevent , for preceding , going before. - Premo ish , for admonish-Health , for spirittlal life , or spirituality ; and healthful , for promotive of spirituality. - Governance , for providence-Godly motions , for divine influences. - Moveth , for admonisheth. - inspiration , for gracious influence-Good living , for holy living. - The folk , for the people. - Word , for thing , in the phrase no word impossible. - Shawms , for hautboys , musical instruments-Picking , for pilfering-Troth , for faith , or fidelity. - Estate , for state , every where . 2 . We meet , at almost ev cry step , with colloquial words and phrases , or those which modern taste will allow only in conversation . These sink the dignity of grave discourse , and sometimes border on the ludicrous . As examples of single words , we notice : doings for actions ; fetch , for bring ; help , for aid , assistance ; and hart for harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ot words , are very common . I'hus we have the " sharpness of death , " for the panes of death-The " kindly fruits of the earth , " for the various fruits , &amp;c. - " This naughty world , " for this evil world. - " The old &amp;am , " for the old man , original sin. - " comfortable gospel , " for comforting gospel ; and " most comfortable sacrament , " for comforting sacrament. - " Lovingly called and bidden , " for affectionately calhed. - We pray " for all sorts and conditions of men . " - We offer to God 478 Oct. // lution ; but they do no such thing . They only say that God does it . The minister is here made either to utter a falsehood , or disobey the commandment of God in the very midst of divine worship . The power of absolution God has not committed to the hands of the clergy . He reserves that to himself . " He pardoneth and absolveth the penitent " in the solemn and personal intercourse of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a priest to interpose in this matter . As God only is the judge of true penitence and genuine faith in Christ , he has given no commandment to others , however high may be their standing in the visible church , to pronounce forgiveness . This mongrel service , which is neither Popish nor Protestant , should have been long ago expunged from a Protestant liturgy . And it would have been , we doubt not , had the principles of the Reformation been permitted to grow to maturity unchecked by the civil power . We consider this part of the service as peculiarly offensive , not only for the reasons first given , but because it is repeated so often . It is read twice our " most humble and hearty thanks . " - We ask him to " turn avert from us all evils . " - We speak of " the prayers of thy humble servants ; " and of " us , thy poor ser ants . " - We tell the Almighty , " we repent , nd re heartily sorry . ' - We pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who " do him laudable servece. - We call on him to " stir up the wills " of his people. - We pray him to " mortify and kill all vices in us , " and " that we may not be carried away with every blast of vain doctrine . ' - We pray to be defended " among all the changes and chances of this mortal life-Over a sick man , we pray , that he " may take his sickness patiently , " and speak of " the means which shall be made use of . " - We address God with the appellation of " the Sovereign Commander of all the world . " - In a storm at sea , we intreat him to " send his word of command , " and rebuke the raging winds ; and before a battle , that he would " make it appear " that he is our deliverer-We are to say to him , " 0 most mighty and gracious good God and , of ourselves , we are to say , " we , thy poor creatures ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lord . " 3 . Many passages of the liturgy are greatly obscured , ( if not rendered unintelligible , ) hy the use of archaisms , or other faulty expressions . Thus we say , " there is no health in us ; " meaning , there is no spiritual life in us . And we pray , that God would " send down upon our bishops &amp;c. , the healthful spirit of his grace ; " which means , I know not what . We are to sing : " 311 ye powers of the Lord , bless ye the Lord ; " intending , perhaps , the holy angels . When we denominate God , " the Father of Heaven , " what do we mean ? In praying for the President of the United States and others in authority , we ask God to " endue them plenteously with heavenly gifts . " What gifts are here meant ? We ask God , to " mercifully assist our prayers ; " when the connection shows that we mean , to hear , or attend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates for holy orders , we ask God to " replenish them with the truth of his doctrine ; " probably meaning , with his true doctrine . We are to pray , " that our land may yield us her fruits of increase ; " when others would say , the increase of her fruits , or simply , her fruits . On the first Sunday in Lent , we thus pray : " give us grace to use observe such abstinence , that our flesh being subdued to the Spiret , we may ever obey thy godly motions . " rrhe godly motions here mentioned are , probably , the divine admonitions . But what is intended by our flesh being subdued to the Spirit ? Does it signify , our sinful nature being subdued and made obedient to the Holy Spirit , or our bodies being subjected to our better part , the mind ? We say : " 0 Almighty God , who alone canst order regulate , reduce to order , the unruly wills and affections of sinful men . " Grant , that , hy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think those things that are good . " - " Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts hy the inspiration grace of thy Holy Spirit . " - " That we may do all such good works as thou hast prepared prescribed for us to walk in . " " Nourish us with all goodness , the manner in which ? or the material with which ? and of thy great mercy keep us in the same . " - " Bring forth in us the fruit of good living " holy living. - " Increase in them the spirit of counsel and ghostlystrength. " ( ? ) - " That lie may d*ily increase in thy Holy Spirit ( ? ) more and more . " " Our Savior , who liveth and reigneth with thee , in the unity of the same Spirit , ( ? ) one God , " &amp;c . To a sick man , the priest must say : " I require request you to examine yourself and your estate state , both towards God and roan . " In one of our prayers , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and as though this were not enough , something similar to it is appointed in the communion service in the shape of a prayer or benediction . This latter is to be said by the priest , or " the bishop , if he be present ; " which provision shows that something more than a mere prayer , which would be as well to come from the one as the other , is intended . The idea , if there is any thing in it , evidently is , that the absolution comes by authority . Indeed the same idea is implied in this absolution , supposing it to be a prayer , when the priest pronounces it . Why should the minister rise up in the midst of the congregation and pray separately from them , unless some peculiar authority were attached to his prayer , not as an individual , but as a public functionary ? It is difficult to make less of this than a beggarly imitation of Popery . The general confession being over and the absolution pronounced , the congregation are now prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time with the minister . To us there would appear much more decency whose consciences by sin are accused ; " instead of ; they whose consciences accuse them of sin . 4 . In consequence of the careless use or construction of terms , the sense is sometimes wholly perverted , and even an ontruth asserted . Thus , in the longer form of absolution at morning prayer , the priest exhorts us to beseech God , " that those things may please Him , which we do at this present whereas we ought to pray , that we may do those things , which wilt please Him . For there is a great difference between asking Him to be pleased with whatever we are disposed to do , and praying for grace so to act , as to meet his approbation . In the prayer used at the meetings of convention , request is made " that the comfortable ( ? ) gospel of Christ may be truly preached , truly received , and truly followed , in all places , to the breaking down the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of thy dispersed sheep , being gathered into one fold , shall become partakers ofeverlasting life . " But are all men , even those still in the kingdom ofsin and Satan , the dispersedsheepof Christ ? Where then are the goats ? - In the thanksgiving for deliverance from great sickness and mortality , we are to say : " 0 Lord God , who now , in the midst ofjud*ment remembering mercy , hast redeemed our souls from the jaws of death ; " implying , either that the soul is mortal , or that , if we die in such seasons of pestilence , our souls are sent to hell . In the collect for the day of St. Paul 's conversion , we must say : " 0 God , who , through the preaching of the blessed apostle St. Paul , hast caused the light of the gospel to shine throughout the world while yet many nations are unenlightened by the gospel-In the Catechism , the child , being asked how many sacraments Christ has ordained , must answer : " Two only , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that only two are generally necessary to salvation-In the Visitation of the Sick the invariable prayer is : " 0 Lord , save thy servant ; send him help mightily defend him . Let the enemy have no advantage of him ; nor the wiched approach to hurt him . Be unto him , 0 Lord , a strong tower , fro the face of his enemy . " The manifest iniplication is , that Satan , the wiched one , is the cause of the sick man 's disease , and that if this enemy can be overcome or kept away , the sick man will recover-The Gloria Pain , which is to be often repeated every Sunday , is in these words : " Glory be to the Father , arid to the Son , and to the Holy Ghost ; as it was in the beginnessg , es now , and ever shall be , world without end . " This implies a desire , that just so much homage and adoration may be given to God , as was given him in the beginning , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither more nor less . We had intended to notice two other very common faults in the diction and phraseology of the liturgy ; namely , pleonasm or the insertion of words which add nothing to the meaning ; and bad grammar , especially in the regimen of verbs , and in the use of prepositions . But the length of this note forbids a suitable illustration of these and other faulfs in the style of the book . We will therefore only add , that it is to be lamented that a book so extensively and constantly used , and having so much influence in forming the taste as well as shaping the religious views of vast masses of people , should not only be handed down from age to age unimproved and unpurged of its most glaring and obvious faults , but be imposed upon a very numerous arid respectable denomination of Christians , as containing the only thoughts arid expressions with which they may publicly worship God from the beginning to the end of their lives . 480 Oct. // and order if the people would follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of taste . The ejaculation which follows , " 0 Lord , open thou our lips , " with the response from the people , " and our mouth shall show forth thy praise , " must be taken in a sense altogether below the original force of those words when they came from the Psalmist . As all that is to be uttered is prepared beforehand and written down , it can not be the state of the heart , out of the abundance of which the mouth speaketh , but the muscular motion , by which the precoroposed form can be made audible . Or if this be too barren a sense to put upon the words , as indeed it ought to be , if you insist u1 on the living energy of the Psalmist 's petition ; then we think it peculiarly unhappy , because it betrays at once the imperfection of a lituyy . The prescribed form must needs prevent an answer ; for however the heart may be enlarged , the effusions of the lips corresponding therewith , have no enlargement nor liberty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this solemn invocation and the Gloria Patri , which by the way is repeated so often the same day as to lose all its force , what do we find next ? The congregation all go over to a recitation of some portion of the Psalms , no matter how inappropriate it may be for the present occasion . Indeed appropriateness seems to be entirely out of view in this part of the service . The minister recites one verse , and the people respond with another , like a school-boy and his teacher repeating a lesson . Is this prayer , or is it praise ? or is it instruction ? If the latter , the minister had better read it alone ; if neither of the former , what ideas can be attached to it when all the Psalms as they happen to arise , containing a great variety of different subjects , and setting forth different states of the mind , are used ; and when the verses are read alternately , though they are frequently divided in the midst of the sense . Though it is scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all purposes under the sun . To transfer the Psalms without distinction , accommodation , or change , to the ordinary worship of a Christian assembly , seems to us exceedingly absurd . Take for example the twentieth Psalm . This was composed probably with reference to some battle into which King David was about to go , or some other great trial which he expected to encounter . He meets the people in the place of worship , and the priest perhaps commences singing , " The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble ; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee , send thee help from the sanctuary , and strengthen thee out of Zion-remember all thy offerings , and accept thy burnt sacrifices - grant thee according to thine own heart , and fulfill all thy counsel . " Then the congregation in full chorus sing , " We will rejoice in thy salvation , and in the name of our God we will set up our banners : the Lord fulfill all thy petitions . " Then the king alone , " Now know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand . " Then the congregation conclude in full chorus " Some trust in chariots , and some in horses , but we will remember the name of the Lord our God . They are brought down and fallen ; but we are risen and stand upright . Save , Lord : let the king hear us when we call . " This is beautiful and appropriate . But when a minister of the gospel in the assembly of the saints reads the first verse , and the people respond by reading the second , and so on alternately to the end of the Psalm , what does it mean ? Still more inappropriate to Christian // worship is the sixtieth Psalm . The minister reads , v. 6 , " God hath spoken in his holiness , I will rejoice ; I will divide Shechem , and mete out the valley of Succoth . " And the people answer , " Gilead is mine , and Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads , " Moab is my wash-pot ; over Edom will I cast out my shoe ; Philistia , triumph thou because of me . " The people respond , " Who will bring me into the strong city ? who will lead me into Edom ? " Here we ask again , is this worship in a Christian assembly ? If so , then to take it away from the region of the ludicrous , a man must resort to some Swedenborgian principles of interpretation by which an imaginary sense different from the obvious one is put upon the words . What shall be said of the imprecations in the Psalms ? Does a Christian congregation adopt them as its own ? A portion of the Old Testament , we believe , is next read , which is rather inelegantly concluded by " Here endeth the first lesson . " Then various other selections , which we can not particularly notice , including a portion of the New Testainent , all concluded by " Here endeth the second lesson . " Now the time is come for the general supplication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Apostles ' creed , so called , must be said by the minister and people standing . This we suppose is introduced here as a profession of faith , showing the people 's qualifications for the services which follow . We have no objection to this , except that it shows no such thing ; and the frequent repetition of it as an essential part of divine service , tends to produce a false impression on the minds of the ignorant . It tends to produce the impression that a mere formal recognition of the principles of Christianity is the condition of salvation-an error easily gaining access to the human mind . Because they believe all these truths , they suppose they exercise that faith in the Redeemer which is required . Whereas every well informed Christian knows that there is no virtue in assenting to the articles of the creed . If they are true , there is evidence which compels assent ; and there is no virtue in acknowledging that which we can not resist . All these things we may believe , and yet be totally destitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable prayer . What advance then is here made on the subject of qualifications to be recognized in the Christian assembly ? The faith of the gospel lies deeper than the mere assent of the understanding . It is something distinct from the outward observance of prescribed forms . It is the cordial consent of the heart which constitutes the spirit of prayer , and which no human being can witness . We can see no possible reason for cumbering the liturgy with this confession of faith , but the fear of innovation on the Catholic ritual  --  a reason which was good enough perhaps in the days of King Edward , but which now has no force . The church of Rome recognizes as her children all who give an intellectual or even a merely formal assent to the Apostles ' creed , and who submit to her regimen . It was on this principle that Bonaparte supposed he had become reconciled to the church and to God because he confessed his faith . It was the same principle which led Talleyrand to think that he died in the communion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same principle which leads many at the present time to mistake a belief in certain articles of faith , for a belief in the Lord Jesus Christ . If the creed must be said , we had rather see it occupy any other place than this in the liturgy . We have seen too much of its fatal influence . // True , the minister may , and doubtless many do , warn the people against such an abuse of this confession . But there it stands , indicating a preparation for certain acts of worship . When therefore the people assent to it with an audible voice , they feel in spite of the remonstrances of the minister , that they are believers . And especially when they hear the " exhortation " which is appointed sometimes to be read before the communion to the whole congregation , beginning with these words " Dearly beloved brethren , on I intend , by God 's grace , to celebrate the Lord 's supper ; unto which , in God 's behalf , I bid you all who are here present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed in the idea that they are believers ? While we speak of the creed as containing truths , we would not be understood as saying that all its declarations are true , or that it contains all the essential parts of Christianity . It is manifestly deficient in regard to one great doctrine which constitutes the very essence of our religion , without which we can not conceive that the gospel is acknowledged . We allude to the doctrine of justification by faith in the blood of Christ . Not an allusion is made in this creed to the atonement . A man may believe the historical facts of Christ 's death , burial , resurrection and ascension , and yet know nothing and believe nothing of the great design of these facts . He may believe and confess all that is said in this creed , and yet know nothing and believe nothing of the plan of salvation which God has devised . So that he may he totally ignorant of the only way in which he can be saved . Paul declares , Gal . i , 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accursed . " We understand the Apostle here as calling that another gospel which holds forth any thing in the place of justification by faith . Though the creed does not positively do this , yet it presents no obstacles to doing it on the part of the preacher , or the person who repeats the creed in sincerity . What would he who was not behind the chiefest of the apostles say of a creed which omits that great doctrine which he took so much pains to establish , and yet calls itself the Apostles ' creed ? The " litany " appears to be taken from several Romish litanies , leaving out the idolatrous parts , and greatly improving the rest . - There are some things in this part of the service which we greatly admire , and other things which are worthy of decided reprobation. rphe beautiful , strong , and simple Saxon English is used , with a few exceptions , throughout . It contains most of the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the responses are by no means deficient in meaning or solemnity . But we very much dislike the idea of addressing the Father in general terms , and then the Son in the same terms , and then the Holy Ghost in the same , and last of all , the Trinity . This appears to us unevangelical . It looks like the vain repetitions of the heathen , against which the Lord 's prayer is intended to caution us ; and it certainly has no example in sacred writ to authorize it . XVe dislike also the repetition of words nearly synonymous in several petitions , followed by the response , " Good Lord , deliver us . " We look upon the prayer to be delivered " from lightning and tempest ; from plague , pestilence , and famine ; from battle and murder , and from sudden death , " without any conditions annexed of submission to the will of God , as savoring too much of a spirit of fear and worldliness , unwilling to leave all in the hands of infinite wisdom and love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vio // lating again the rule of our Savior , that we use not vain repetitions as the heathen do . And especially the form which immediately follows the litany in the American Prayer . book , but in the English is incorporated with it , is liable to this objection . It is what is called in the iRomish rituals , Kyr'ie eleison- " 0 Christ hear us , Lord have mercy upon us , Christ have mercy upon us , Lord have mercy upon us , " each repeated by the minister and the people . This we believe to be a most flagrant violation of Christian rules . It is too much like " 0 BanI , hear us , " which was once , with frequent repetition , preferred to one who had no eye to pity , and ro arm to save . Pefore we leave this part of our subject , it is proper to remark , that a portion of the Old and New Testaments is read every morning and afternoon , besides a portion of the gospels , a portion of an epistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infusion of scripture in the service is claimed as a great excellence . The late Bishop Hobart once said , that there is enough of scripture in the Prayer-book for salvation . And Bishop Eastburn , of Massachusetts , said at the last anniversary of the Massachusetts Bible Society , " that he loved his own church for many reasons , but chiefly for its professed reverence for the word of God ; and that the Episcopal church in her daily service commanded more of the Holy Scriptures to be read than any other church in Christendom . " This argument of the bishop goes upon the ground that the more scripture there is read in the public service of the church the better . Hence if the argument is good for any thing , it proves that nearly all the service should consist in reading the Scriptures . Now while we freely admit that our own ministers , being left to their own discretion , may read too little , we think that the Episcopal clergy actually read too much . If the head of a family should read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or six chapters in the Bible , he would not he thought to act judiciously . The minds of his audience would not be half so much impressed with scriptural truth as if a smaller portion were read . So it is in the public worship of God . If the Episcopal clergy would teach their hearers to read the Bible at home , while they should read only so much at church as to recognize its paramount authority and convey instruction and edification , a much better knowledge of the sacred oracles would be gained . As it is , the word of God makes no great impression , because there is so much read . We do not find that other devout Christians or other congregations are less acquainted with the Scriptures than Episcopalians . The service is made so long by this means and by the frequent repetitions in the prayers , that very little time is left for the sermon . Thus the ordinance of preaching , which , from the stress the Bible lays upon it , we infer is the first in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner , and treats as a mere appendage to the rest . It pleases God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe . It is the truth , proclaimed by the living voice , that God has chosen as the main instrument of conversion , sanctification , and salvation . It is this which the Holy Spirit uses to kindle and sway the living energies of man . There are many other things which *e deem ohjectionable in the ordinary service of the Episcopal church , such as bowing at the name of Jesus in the creed , as though that ceremony were required at that place more than at others , or as though it were required at all ; the theatrical effect of changing the dress on the part of the clergy , and that too in the midst of the service , // 485 when the people are engaged in singing the praises of God ; the public proclamation which the minister makes of secret prayer , when on his return from the vestry he ascends the pulpit , folds up his gown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all the while engaged in singing ; the standing of the people when the gospel is read , and their sitting during the reading of the epistle , as though one were to be held in more reverence than the other . But these things , and some others which we forbear to mention , are of minor importance , and we have neither time nor inclination to dwell upon them . We will now examine the communion service . The simplicity of this ordinance is entirely destroyed by loading it with so many forms and ceremonies . In the first place the idea of communion , which consists in fellowship expressed by the act , not only with the Lord but with one another , is wholly excluded . Instead of sitting down together or using the table posture , after the example of our divine Lord and the primitive disciples , the communicants kneel and receive a piece of bread and afterwards the wine from the hands of the minister , separately-each one having a form repeated to him , which , in the case of the bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the form at the Popish mass . Here the prominent idea is receiving at the hands of the minister the body and blood of Christ , each in his separate capacity ; but no reference is made to the disciples of Christ sitting and eating together the same bread and drinking the same cup , in token of union to the same Lord . It is doubtless a commemoration of the death of Christ , though not agreeable to the original institution ; but it is not the communion of saints . The latter idea is absent , as the separate participation by each individual , manifestly shows . In the next place , the number of prayers appointed to be said , several of which have no particular bearing on the subject ; the ten commandments , as if this gracious institution were not wholly different from the law ; the formal exhortation repeated to every communicant ; the absolution ,  --  all these contribute to diminish the simplicity of the institution . The effect which the prayer of consecration , as it is called , is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and savoring not a little of Popery . The following direction is given : " And if any of the consecrated bread and wine remain after the communion , it shall not be carried out of the church ; but the minister and other communicants shall , immediately after the blessing , reverently eat and drink the same . " Who can fail to see here a trace of that spirit which regards the consecrated elements as the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ ? True , this doctrine is not believed by the entire Episcopal church ; but does not the direction here quoted look as if it had not wholly left the minds of those who compiled the book ? Certainly the Prayer-book recognizes the bread and wine as something different after consecration from what it was before ; for it must not be carried out of the church , but be eaten and drunk by the communicants . If there should happen to be a large quantity left , the duty prescribed must be no small burden ; and the laws of temperance might possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that the bread and wine have been changed by the act of consecration ? And if they have been changed , what is the character which they sustain ? Are they different in any respect from what they were before ? If so , what is the evidence ? And how does such an idea agree with the simplicity of the ordinance as it came from the hands of Christ ? Why throw a // mystery over a plain subject ? How far is this from the elevation of the host , or the recognition of a supernatural power in the priest , or in the words of consecration , of which the Bible says nothing ? The ordinance as it came from the Lord Jesus Christ is perfectly simple and intelligible , and in this consists its practical value . It is the joint participation of bread and wine by the followers of Christ , without any formalities but such as decency and order require , in commemoration of his great sacrifice for sin . There is nothing efficacious in the mere ceremony : it is the spiritual presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all its efficacy . What then can be the significancy of the minister 's taking a few chosen companions and reverently eating and drinking after the service is over , unless it is a recognition of some mysterious sanctity in the elements themselves ? And if this is admitted , how many steps further must we advance before we arrive at the doctrine of transubstantiation . For ourselves , we are desirous of celebrating the Lord 's supper in all the simplicity of its original institution . And in this way only do the ideas which it is intended to impress upon the mind come up before us in their living reality . We want no talking during the celebration . We want no priest to pronounce over us any words , however solemn may he their import . We look upon the speaker as an intruder between us and the Lord . We would meditate in the stillness of private devotion upon the great things brought to view . The silence of human voices alone accords with the solemnity of the scene . Let us turn now to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defective in many respects , hut so decidedly unscriptural that we see not how an intelligently pious man can use it . We have often wondered that evangelical men among the clergy of the Episcopal church can use this part of the liturgy , without such misgivings as to induce them to give up the whole . Holding principles totally opposite to those declared in the baptismal service , by what philosophy of language or of reasoning , can tbey satisfy their consciences ? For ourselves we declare , without judging other men , that we could no more offer the prayer , beginning " We yield thee hearty thanks , most mer- , ciful Father , that it hath pleased thee to regenerate this infant with thy Holy Spirit , to receive him for thine own child by adoption , " than we could publicly declare an untruth under the sanction of an oath . And were there no other objection to the liturgy , this would forever bar us from adopting it . The whole service goes upon the principle , that regeneration is expected and is accomplished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some have said , that regeneration is distinguished from renovation , and that the word is used in a different sense from that in which we employ it ; for it is regeneration by the Holy Spirit which is declared to have taken place . If there is any other regeneration , renovation or change of heart , which fits us for heaven , we have never discovered it in the Scriptures . The doctrine of the prayer is the doctrine of baptismal regeneration . The whole prayer takes it for a certainty that an inward spiritual renovation has accompanied the outward ceremony . Those writers in the church of England who maintain , in opposition to the evangelical clergy of that establishment , the doctrine of baptismal regeneration to be the doctrine of their church , clearly have the better of the argument . To talk of a change of heart not experienced in baptism , but when a person becomes convinced of his sins and turns from them to the wisdom of the Just , under the special influence of the Holy Spirit , as the // evangelical clergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the liturgy . One or the other , for consistency 's sake , and for conscience ' sake should be renounced . This service , connected with other parts of the Prayer-book , accounts for the looseness which prevails on the subject of regeneration in the Episcopal church . Where is the passage in the whole liturgy that plainly recognizes the doctrine that man as he is by nature needs a total change in his moral character to fit him for heaven ? Where do we find recognized the Scriptural doctrine that all the moral acts of an impenitent person are sinful , and that his whole moral character needs to be changed ? Where do we find any thing in harmony with a general state of awakening and seriousness like what is observed in a revival of religion ? Where do we find any pleading of the promises , any ardent wrestling for the immediate effusions of the divine Spirit ? Where are those deep and devout aspirations which are prompted by the presence of a multitude of immortal souls solemnly and earnestly inquiring the way to eternal life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that in baptism the original stain of our nature is washed away , and the regenerating influences of the Spirit are enjoyed in such a measure that nothing farther is needed than the gradual cultivation of piety . We regard this defect of the liturgy on the subject of baptism as fundamental . It is evidently composed to meet the views of men who had just awaked from the sleep of Popery , and had not received fully the Protestant religion . We have another objection to this baptismal service , which ranges it again under the head of Poperywe mean its total silence in regard to the foundation of infant baptism . Not a hint is given that it is a covenant transaction-no reference is made to the unfailing promise , " I will be a God to thee , and to thy seed after thee . " Nothing is said of the true Scriptural ground of baptizing our children ; and were there no better view of infant baptism than that presented in this ritual , we should find no decisive argument against our Baptist brethren . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godfather and godmother ( a sort of people by the way unknown to the Bible ) promise in its name that it shall " renounce the devil and all his works , and constantly believe God 's holy word , and obediently keep his commandments . " What a singular system of imputation ! We have heard of the imputation of sin and righteousness , but never before of the imputation of moral agency . One intelligent being here promises for another , without the power of controlling the heart , that he shall obey the laws of God ! The obligation which baptism imposes upon the infant is not that it belongs to the household of God , from which it must break away to walk in the paths of the wicked , but that some other person promises that it should do right ! What is the penalty upon the godfather in case of disobedience on the part of the child ? What becomes of the godfather if he can not make his child believe and do the things which he promises that the child shall believe and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution of infant baptism merely as an historical fact , without entering at all into the principles upon which it is founded . They have retained the Romish customs respecting it without correcting them by the Scriptures . If we understand it , baptism is beneficial to an infant not because of any inherent virtue in the water or the service , but chiefly because it is an appointment of God by the observance of which the parent recognizes his obligation to train up a child in the nurture and admonition of the Lord . // 1-laying recognized that obligation , he is more likely to perform the duty than if he had not , just as a professor of religion is more likely to feel his obligations as a Christian than a non-professor . XVe have taken great delight in the ordinance of infant baptism . It fills us with an ndmiring sense of God 's wisdom and goodness- We esteem it a great privilege that our children may be recognized in the everlasting covenant of Abraham as entitled to the external privileges and therefore to the spiritual influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the influence of this covenant carried out in its appropriate sign , and laying obligations both upon the parent and the child , is an important means of perpetuating the church from generation to generation . But in this ceremony of the Episcopal church there is a total mistake in regard to the true consolations and confidence which God intended to be had in the ordinance . There is a false doctrine declared , and that too in solemn supplication to Goda doctrine which we would hope few of the Episcopal men of the present day will be found willing to admit in all its grossness . Or if they admit it , we certainly do not . Nor do the Scriptures . " Neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature . " Neither baptism nor circumcision is set forth in the Scriptures as regeneration by the Holy Spirit , but merely as a sign , an external emblem of that inward change . In full accordance with the baptismal service we find , " the order of confirmation , or laying on of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of discretion . " The qualifications for this ceremony are ability to say the creed , the Lord 's prayer and the ten commandments , and " to answer such other questions as in the short catechism are contained . " Of these persons it is affirmed in the prayer prescribed for the occasion , that God has vouchsafed to regenerate them by water and the Holy Ghost , and has given them forgiveness of all their sins . And the request preferred in their behalf at the throne of grace is , that they may be strengthened , and " the manifold g*fls of grace " be daily increased in them . Now admitting that in some instances the superior vigilance and faithfulness of individual clergymen may see that other and greater qualifications be had , it is manifest that the door is here open to a great looseness ; and that the effect of this ceremony on ignorant people must be bad , and bad only . Alas ! it is too true , that men accounted intelligent in the things of the world are often sadly ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suppose that they are reconciled to God , while they may be , for aught that the Prayer-book demands of them , in the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity . But does this qualify them for the communion ? If the prayer which is solemnly uttered in the presence of God , and addressed to him who searches the heart , has any truth in it , they are now entitled to eat and drink at the Lord 's tabie . And if they have no other qualifications than those specified , what is it but mockery to partake with the people of God of that supper which is designed for those whose spiritual eye can discern the Lord 's body ? This service , it will be observed , partakes of the same error as has already been noticed in regard to the confession in the creed , that mere intellectual assent to truth is the service of the heart which the Scriptures mean by the term faith . It arises , in our opinion , from the idea never absent from the liturgy , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , a political authority to which external subjection is all that is necessary . This // idea is natural enough in the circumstances in which the liturgy was formed ; but surely unscriptural , and perfectly ill-suited to a state of things so entirely different as that which exists in this more favored country . To say nothing of the want of foundation in the Scriptures for the ceremony of confirmation ; what does it do for the child but confirm him in error which may be fundamental in his estimate of himself , and therefore , an obstacle to his salvation ? We know that there is some modification in the practice of evangelical clergymen of the Episcopal church in regard to the proper subjects of confirmation . And as the bishop confirms none but those who are presented by the parish minister , a check is in the hands of the latter which may be used to prevent unworthy subjects from being officially and solemnly pronounced regenerate by water and the Holy Ghost . But how difficult is it to use this check when the Prayer-book so manifestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confirmed , " so soon as he can say the creed , the Lord 's prayer , and the ten commandments , and is sufficiently instructed in the other parts of the church catechism , set forth for that purpose . " Can the child intelligently make the promises demanded of him in this service , and can the bishop believe that they are of any avail when there is no more evidence of a moral change than the mere increase ef years and of intellectual strength ? What more than this is done by a person who fully and heartily conforms to the principles of the liedeerner 's kingdom ? And does not the putting of such promises into the mouth of one who has no spiritual feelings , no communion with God , tend to make a mockery of holy things ? But if there were probable evidence of a change of heart in the persons confirmed , who has given the bishop authority to assume the prerogative of God , and pronounce with certainty concerning it ? The burial of the dead . -T his is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who instituted it , and altogether unexceptionable , provided mankind were much better than they are . Could we have confidence that every baptized person who had not been excommunicated from the church , and had not laid violent hands on himself-for to every such person this form is appropriated by the rubric-is a saint , the service would be inimitably fine . But when we take it as a service to be performed indiscriminately , over all the dead included within the prescribed limitations , we are compelled to withhold our admiration . It is cheerfully confessed , that the American edition of the Prayer-book is less objectionable in this respect than the English . In the latter , we read , " Forasmuch as it bath pleased Almighty God , of his great mercy , to take unto himself the soul of our deceased brother here departed , we therefore commit his body to the ground ; earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust ; in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ , " &amp;c . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more general char. acter , not pronouncing with certainty concerning the state of the dead . There is , however , the idea running through the whole that it is a saint who is buried . There is the recognition of the voice from heaven , declaring the blessedness of those who die in the Lord , and a thanksgiving " for the good examples of all those thy servants who having finished their course in faith , do now rest from their labors " - which is little to the purpose , unless the person buried is a saint . // All this also , taken in connexion with the direction at the commencement of the service , forbidding its being said over any who has not received the Prayer-book regeneration , seems to take it for granted , that the person buried is among those who rest from their labors . Inasmuch , however , as there is no direct declaration of this kind , and unlike the English Prayer-book , no confidence is expressed which definitely applies to the case of the deceased , we are not disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a solemn and useful influence upon those who hear it . It is decidedly the best part of the Prayer-book , and the only part to which , as a whole , we should not take strong exceptions . We had not intended to remark upon the marriage ceremony , lest we should appear to some stanch friends of the liturgy as rather captious ; for the faults of this book are so numerous that we may expose ourselves to this charge . But we can not forbear to notice the illjudged particularity and bad taste in which the marriage ceremony is drawn up , especially when we consider that it is not in its original place among the cumbrous formalities of the British government , but under the plain institutions of republicanism . It is no small lesson which the bride and bridegroom must learn before they are qualified to be married . Since , however , it is a mere matter of taste and not of conscience which we have now in view , we are not disposed to dwell upon it , or to show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If any choose to subject themselves to all this bondage of forms , we certainly have no objection . But there is one thing which appears to us to come under a different principle . We allude to the ceremony of the ring . This , in the circumstances of this country , is an unmeaning ceremony , wholly unworthy of the dignity and solemnity with which an attempt is made to invest it by invoking the glorious name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost . The man is required to say to the woman , " With this ring I thee wed , and with all my worldly goods I thee endow : in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost . Amen . " We call ? bis unmeaning , because the marriage is a legal ceremony . Marriage is an institution of God , but the manner of celebrating it is entirely of human device . It may be British law , that a man is married by a ring ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowment of the bride with the wordly goods of the bridegroom by means of the ring is an absolute falsehood . The inheritance of property is not regulated by the kingdom of Christ , which in this country is separate from the state , but by the laws of the land . If the law says that by virtue of marriage a woman is entitled to all the " wordly goods " of her husband , then she has them . But if the law says that she shall have a third ; or if the law recognizes a jointure which may have been agreed upon between the parties ; then a man does not endow his wife with all his worldly goods . Now we consider this unmeaning ceremony , performed in the name of the holy Trinity , as approaching to profaneness . It looks too much like uttering a falsehood in the name of God . Tb authors of this ceremony have not only overstepped the hounds of good taste , but have rather trespassed upon the dominions of conscience . It is painful that in so solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welfare of the parties depends , so much account should be made of ceremony and so little of prayer . The Lord 's prayer , which is introduced on all occasions in the liturgy , // as though nothing could be done without it , and one short , very short and general , prayer , is all that we find of invoking the divine blessing in God 's own appointed way ! No opportunity is afforded to allude to particular circumstances of interest , and no solemn appeal is made to heaven in behalf of the newly married couple , as subject to the trials , temptations , and vicissitudes of life ; but a mere formal petition of the most general and unimpressive kind imaginable ! Such is the liturgy of the Protestant Episcopal church . It is radically defective in regard to Protestantism , being committed to many of the saints ' days , and other feasts and fasts of the Romish heresy ; wearing distinctly a Popish garment throughout ; and showing that its origin was in a dark age , unfit to dictate the devotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its prescriptions for the ordinary worship of God on the Sabbath . It is likewise defective in its provision for the communion and for baptism . it endorses errors which have long ago been exploded . It obscures truths which it is the happiness and the duty of every one to see with the clearest eye . And it occupies such a space on the Sabbath , as to throw into the background the great ordinance of preaching the gospel , which , accompanied by the Holy Spirit , is the power of God unto salvation . With these great defects before us , we can not agree with its admirers , in calling it , " The excellent liturgy . " Whatever may be the feelings of others , we could not conform to this liturgy without an entire sacrifice of conscience . Accustomed as we are to a simpler and more evangelical mode of approaching our Maker , we could not submit to be bound to a set form , and to a tacit endorsement of so many dangerous errors . The national church of England , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not admire , though we acknowledge it has embosomed , and still embosoms , many great and good men . The shadow of the British establishment , extending to our own shores , we can not sit under with delight . We had rather identify ourselves with our Puritan ancestors , of whom the world was not worthy , being members of those churches which they founded in the primitive order and simplicity of apostolical example , unincumbered with the trappings of England and Rome . Such is the universal abhorrence of Popery among these churches , that the suspension of pictures of Christ on the cross , such as are now seen in many Episcopal churches , would not be tolerated . The Oxford movement has no affinity with them . No semi-papistical influence has been exerted upon them in the use of a defective liturgy , by which the way is prepared for such a system . No disposition to exhume old errors and bring them into the reformed church of God , has been cherished among them . The Bible is in their bands . And this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liturgy , or the creed , or any other paper teaches : the Bible , the Bible only , is their standard of faith and practice . The churches of our Pilgrim fathers  --  the blessing of the Lord be on them ! For our brethren and companions ' sake we will now say , peace be within them !
