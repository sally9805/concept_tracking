txt /q/as varieties which originate in a certain soil and climate , are found best adapted to that locality , the production of new sorts of fruit , of high merit , may be looked on as a most valuable , as well as interesting result . Beside this , all the fine new fruits , which , of late , figure so conspicuously in the catalogues of the nurseries and fruit gardens , have not been originated at random and by chance efforts . Some of the most distinguished pomologists have devoted years to the subject of the improvement of fruit trees by seeds , and have attained if not certain results , at least some general /z/ laws , which greatly assist us in this process of amelioration . Let us therefore examine the subject a little more in detail . In the wild state , every genus of trees consist of one or more species , or strongly marked individual sorts ; as , for example , the white birch and the black birch ; or , to confine ourselves more strictly to the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild or bird cherry , the sour cherry , the mazzard cherry , &c.; These species , in their natural state , exactly reproduce themselves ; to use a common phrase , they " come the same " from seed . This they have done for centuries , and doubtless will do forever , so long as they exist under natural circumstances only . On the other hand , suppose we select one of these species of fruit-trees , and adopt it into our gardens . So long as we cultivate that individual tree , or any part of it , in the shape of sucker , graft , or bud , its nature will not be materially altered . It may , indeed , through cultivation , be stimulated into a more luxuriant growth ; it will probably produce larger leaves and fruit ; but we shall neither alter its fruit in texture , color or taste . It will always be identically the same . The process of amelioration begins with a new generation , and by sowing the seeds . Some species of tree , indeed , seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any variation by seed ; but all fruit-trees and many others , are easily domesticated , and more readily take the impress of culture . If we sow a quantity of seed in garden soil of the common black mazzard cherry , ( Cerasus avium , ) we shall find that , in the leaves and habit of growth , many of the seedlings do not entirely resemble the original species . When they come into bearing , it is probable we shall also find as great a diversity in the size , color and flavor of the fruit . Each of these individual plants , differing from the original type , ( the mazzard , ) constitutes a new variety ; though only a few , perhaps only one , may be superiour to the original species . It is worthy of remark , that exactly in proportion as this reproduction is frequently repeated , is the change to a great variety of forms , or new sorts increased . It is likely indeed , that to gather the seeds from a wild mazzard in the woods , the instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very few ; while if gathered from a garden tree , itself some time cultivated , or several removes from a wild state , though still a mazzard , the seedlings will show great variety of character . Once in the possession of a variety , which has moved out of the natural into a more domesticated form , we have in our hands the best material for the improving process . The fixed original habit of the species is broken in upon , and this variety which we have created , has always afterwards some tendency to /z/ make further departures from the original form . It is true that all or most of its seedlings will still retain a likeness to the parent , but a few will differ in some respects , and it is by seizing upon those which show symptoms of variation , that the improver of vegetable races founds his hopes . We have said that it is a part of the character of a species to produce the same from seed . This characteristic is retained even where the sport , ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , to return to cherries , the Kentish or common pie-cherry is one species , and the small black mazzard another , and although a great number of varieties of each of these species have been produced , yet there is always the likeness of the species retained . From the first we may have the large and rich Mayduke , and from the last the sweet and luscious Black-Hearts ; but a glance will show us that the duke cherries retain the distinct dark foliage , and , in the fruit , something of the same flavor , shape and color of the original species ; and the heart cherries the broad leaves and lofty growth of the mazzard . So too , the currant and gooseberry are different species of the same genus ; but though the English gooseberry growers have raised thousands of new varieties of this fruit , and shown them as large as hen 's eggs , and of every variety of form and color , yet their efforts with the gooseberry have not produced any thing resembling the common currant . Why do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant the stone of a Green Gage plum , will it not always produce a Green Gage ? This is often a puzzling question to the practical gardener , while his every day experience forces him to assent to the fact . We are not sure that the vegetable physiologists will undertake to answer this query fully . But in the mean time we can throw some light , on the subject . It will be remembered that our garden varieties of fruits are not natural forms . They are the artificial productions of our culture . They have always a tendency to improve , but they have also another and a stronger tendency to return to a natural , or wild state . " There can be no doubt , " says Dr. Lindley , " that if the arts of cultivation were abandoned for only a few years , all the annual varieties of plants in our gardens would disappear and be replaced by a few original wild forms . " Between these two tendencies , therefore , the one derived from nature , and the other impressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progeny of varieties always to reappear in the same form . Again , our American farmers , who raise a number of kinds of Indian corn , very well know that , if they wish to keep the sorts distinct , they must grow them in different fields . Without this precaution they find on planting the seeds produced on the /z/ yellow corn plants , that they have the next season a progeny , not of yellow corn alone , but composed of every color and size , yellow , white and black , large and small , upon the farm . Now many of the varieties of fruit trees have a similar power of intermixing with each other while in blossom , by the dust or pollen of their flowers , carried through the air , by the action of bees and other causes . It will readily occur to the reader , in considering this fact , what an influence our custom of planting the different varieties of plum or of cherry together in a garden or orchard , must have upon the constancy of habit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another reason for this habit , so perplexing to the novice , who , having tasted a luscious fruit , plants , watches and rears its seedling , to find it perhaps , wholly different in most respects . This is the influence of grafting . Among the great number of seedling fruits produced in the United States , there is found occasionally a variety , perhaps a plum or a peach , which will nearly always reproduce itself from seed . From some fortunate circumstances in its origin , unknown to us , this sort , in becoming improved , still retains strongly this habit of the natural or wild form , and its seeds produce the same . We can call to mind several examples of this ; fine ' fruit trees whose seeds have established the reputation in their neighborhood of fidelity to the sort . But when a graft is taken from one of these trees , and placed upon another stock , this grafted tree is found to lose its singular power of producing the same by seed , and becomes like all other worked trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , in dissolving the strong natural habit of the variety , and it becomes like its fellows , subject to the laws of its artificial life . When we desire to raise new varieties of fruit , the common practice is to collect the seeds of the finest table fruits those sorts whose merits are every where acknowledged to be the highest . In proceeding thus we are all pretty well aware , that the chances are generally a hundred to one against our obtaining any new variety of great excellence . Before we offer any advice on rearing seedlings let us examine briefly the practice and views of two distinguished horticulturists abroad , who have paid more attention to this subject than any other persons whatever ; Dr. Van Mons of Belgium , and Thos . Andrew Knight , Esq. , the late President of the Horticultural Society of London . The Van Mons Theory . Dr. Van Mons , Professor at Louvain , devoted the greater part of his life to the amelioration of fruits . His nurseries containec in 1823 , no less than two thousand seedlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly on /z/ Pears , he succeeded in raising an immense number of new varieties of high excellence . The Beurr Diel , IV Louvain , Frederic of Wurtemberg , &c.,; are a few of the many well Known sorts which are the result of his unwearied labours . The Van Mons theory may be briefly stated as follows : All fine fruits are artificial products ; the aim of nature , in a wild state , being only a healthy , vigorous state of the tree , and perfect seeds for continuing the species . It is the object of culture , therefore , to subdue , or enfeeble this excess of vegetation ; to lessen the coarseness of the tree ; to diminish the size of the seeds ; and to refine the quality and increase the size of the flesh or pulp . There is always a tendency in our varieties of fruit trees to return by their seeds towards a wild state , This tendency is most strongly shown in the seeds borne by old fruit-trees . And " the older the tree is of any cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the nearer will the seedlings , raised from it , approach a wild state , without however ever being able to return to that state/ " ' On the other hand , the seeds of a young fruit tree of a good sort , being itself in the state of amelioration , have the least tendency to retrograde , and are the most likely to produce improved sorts . Again , there is a certain limit to perfection in fruits . When this point is reached , as in the finest varieties , the next generation will more probably produce bad fruit , than if reared from seeds of an indifferent sort , in the course of amelioration . While , in other words , the seeds of the oldest varieties of good fruit mostly yield inferiour sorts , seeds taken from recent varieties of bad fruit , and reproduced uninterruptedly for several generations , will certainly produce good fruit . With these premises , Dr. Van Mons begins by gathering his seeds from a young seedling tree , without paying much regard to its quality , except that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , a garden variety , and not a wild sort . These he sows in a seedbed or nursery , where he leaves the seedlings until they attain sufficient size to enable him to judge of their character . He then selects those which appear the most promising , plants them a few feet distant in the nursery , and awaits their fruit . Not discouraged at finding most of them of mediocre quality , though differing from the parent , he gathers the first seeds of the most promising and sows them again . The next generation comes more rapidly into bearing than the first , and shows a greater number of promising traits . Gathering immediately , and sowing the seeds of this generation , he produces a third , then a fourth , and even a fifth generation , uninterruptedly , from the original sort . Each generation he finds to come more quickly into bearing than the previous one , ( the 5th sowing of /z/ pears fruiting at 3 years , ) and to produce a greater number of valuable varieties ; until in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellence . Dr. Van Mons found the pear to require the longest time to attain perfection , and he carried his process with this fruit through five generations . Apples he found needed but four races , and peaches , cherries , plums , and other stone fruits , were brought to perfection in three successive reproductions from the seed . It will be remembered that it is a leading feature in this theory that , in order to improve the fruit , we must subdue or enfeeble the original coarse luxuriance of the tree . Keeping this in mind , Dr. Van Mons always gathers his fruit before fully ripe , and allows them to rot before planting the seeds , in order to refine or render less wild and harsh the next generation . In transplanting the young seedlings into quarters to bear , he cuts off the tap root , and he annually shortens the leading and side branches , besides planting them only a few feet apart . All this lessens the vigour of the trees , and produces an impression upon the nature of the seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to continue in full force the progressive variation , he allows his seedlings to bear on their own roots. * Such is Dr. Van Mons ' theory and method for obtaining new varieties of fruit . It has never obtained much favour in England , and from the length of time necessary to bring about its results , it is scarcely likely to come into very general use here . At the same time it is not to be denied that in his hands it has proved a very successful mode of obtaining new varieties . It is also undoubtedly true that it is a mode closely founded on natural laws , and that the great bulk of our fine varieties have originated , nominally by chance , but really , by successive reproductions from the seed in our gardens . It is not a little remarkable that the constant springing up of fine new sorts of fruit in the United States , which is every day growing more frequent , is given with much apparent force as a proof of the accuracy of the Van Mons theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many seeds gathered from the best old varieties of fruits , were surprised to find their seedlings producing only very inferiour fruits . These seedlings had returned by their inherent tendency almost to a wild state . By rearing from them , however , seedlings of many repeated generations , we have arrived at a great number of the finest apples , * " 1 have found this art to consist in regenerating in a direct line of descent , and as rapidly as possible an improving variety , talking care that there be no interval between the generations . To sow , to re-sow , to sow again , to sow perpetually , in short to do nothing but sow , is the practice to be pursued , and which can not be departed from ; and in short this is the whole secret of the art I have eraployed . " Van Mons ' Arbres Fruiliers , 1 . p. 223. /z/ pears , peaches and plums . According to Dr. Van Mons , had this process been continued uninterruptedly , from one generation to the next , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of first rate varieties . To show how the practice of chance sowing works in the other hemisphere , it is stated by one of the most celebrated of the old writers on fruits , Duhamel of France , that he had been in the habit of planting seeds of the finest table pears for fifty years without ever having produced a good variety . Theso seeds were from trees of old varieties of fruit . The American gardener will easily perceive , from what we have stated , a great advantage placed in his hands at the present time for the amelioration of fruits by this system . He will see that , as most of our American varieties of fruit are the result of repeated sowings , more or less constantly repeated , he has before him almost every day a part of the ameliorating process in progress ; to which Dr. Van Mons , beginning de novo , was obliged to devote his whole life . Nearly all that it is necessary for him to do in attempting to raise a new variety of excellence by this simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fully ripe , ) from a seedling sort of promising quality , though not yet arrived at perfection . The seedling must be quite young must be on its own root ( not grafted ; ) and it must be a healthy tree , in order to secure a healthy generation of seedlings . Our own experience leads us to believe that he will scarcely have to go beyond one or two generations to obtain fine fruit . These remarks apply to most of our table fruits commonly cultivated . On the other hand , our native grapes , the Isabella , Catawba , &c.,; which are scarcely removed from the wild state , must by this ameliorating process be carried through several successive generations before we arrive at varieties equalling the finest foreign grapes ; a result , which , judging from what we see in progress , we have every reason speedily to hope for . In order to be most successful in raising new varieties by successive reproduction , let us bear in mind that we must avoid 1st , the seeds of old fruit trees ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we have the best grounds for good results when we gather our seeds from a young seedling tree , which is itself rather a perfecting than a , perfect fruit . It is not to be denied that , in the face of Dr. Van Mon 's theory , in this country , new varieties of rare excellence are sometimes obtained at once by planting the seeds of old grafted varieties ; thus the Lawrence 's Favourite , and the Columbia plums , were raised from seeds of the Green Gage , one of the oldest European varieties . Such are the means of originating new fruits by the Belgian mode . Let us now examine another more direct , more interesting , and more scientific process cross-breeding ; a mode almost /z/ universally pursued now by skilful cultivators , in producing new and finer varieties of plants ; and which Mr. Knight , the most distinguished horticulturist of the age , so successfully practised on fruit trees- Cross-breeding . In the blossoms of fruit-trees , and o most other plants , the seed is the offspring of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and female parents , growing in the same flower . Cross-breeding is , then , nothing more than removing out of the blossom of a fruit tree the stamens , or male parents , and bringing those of another , and different variety of fruit , and dusting the pistil or female parent with them , a process sufficiently simple , but which has the most marked effect on the seeds produced . It is only within about fifty years that cross-breeding has been practised ; but Lord Bacon , whose great mind seems to have had glimpses into every dark corner of human knowledge , finely foreshadowed it . " The compounding or mixture of plants is not found out , which , if it were , is more at command than that of living creatures ; wherefore , it were one of the most notable discoveries touching plants to find it out , for so you may have great varieties of fruits and flowers yet unknown . " In figure 1 , is shown the blossom of the Cherry . The central portion , a , connected directly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding threads I , are the stamens . The summit of the stamen is called the anther , and secretes the powdery substance called pollen . The pistil , has at its base , the embryo fruit , and at its summit , the stigma . The use of the stamens is to fertilize the young seed contained at the base of the pistil ; and if we fertilize the pistil of one variety of fruit by the pollen of another , we shall obtain a new variety partaking intermediately of the qualities of both parents . Thus , among fruits owing their origin directly to cross-breeding , Coe 's Golden Drop Plum , was raised from the Green Gage , impregnated by the Magnum Bonum , or Egg plum ; and the Elton cherry , from the Bigarrieu , impregnated by the White Heart. * Mr. Knight was of opinion that the habits of the new variety would always be found to partake most strongly of the constitution , and habits of the female parent . Subsequent experience does not fully confirm this , and it would appear that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other ; but more frequently share the qualities of both . Mr. Coxe describes an Apple , &; cross between a Newtown Pippin and a Russet , the fruit of which resembled externally at one end the Russet and at the other the Pippin , and the flavour at eithei end corresponded exactly with the character of the exteriour. // whose character is most permanent , impresses its form most for cibly on the offspring . The process of obtaining cross-bred seeds of fruit trees is very easily performed . It is only necessary when the tree blooms which we intend to be the mother of the improved race , to select a blossom or blossoms growing upon it not yet fully expanded . With a pair of scissors , we cut out and remove all the anthers . The next day , or as soon as the blossom is quite expanded , we collect , with a camel 's hair brush , the pollen from a fully blown flower of the variety we intend for the male parent , applying the pollen and leaving it upon the stigma or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to those busy little meddlers , the bees , it is well to cover the blossoms with a loose bag of thin gauze , or they will perhaps get beforehand with you in your experiments in cross-breeding . Watch the blossoms closely as they open , and bear in mind that the two essential points in the operation are ; 1st , to extract the anthers carefully , before they have matured sufficiently to fertilize the pistil ; and , 2d , to apply the pollen when it is in perfection , ( dry and powdery , ) and while the stigma is moist . A very little practice will enable the amateur to judge of these points . There are certain limits to the power of crossing plants . What is strictly called a cross-bred plant or fruit is a sub-variety raised between two varieties of the same species . There are , however , certain species , nearly allied , which are capable of fertilizing each other . The offspring in this case is called a hybrid , or mule , and does not always produce perfect seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindley , " appears to be much more common in plants than in animals . It is , however , in general only between nearly allied species that this intercourse can take place ; those which are widely different in structure and constitution not being capable of any artificial union . Thus the different species of Strawberry , of the gourd or melon family , intermix with the greatest facility , there being a great accordance between them in general structure , and constitution . But no one has ever succeeded in compelling the pear to fertilize the apple , nor the gooseberry the currant . And as species that are very dissimilar appear to have some natural impediment which prevents their reciprocal fertilization , so does this obstacle , of whatever nature it may be , present an insuperable bar to the intercourse of the different genera . All the stories that are current as to the intermixture of oranges and pomegranates , of roses and black currants , and the like , may therefore be set down to pure invention . " In practice , this power of improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present day . Not only in fruit trees , but in ornamental trees , shrubs , and plants , and especially in florists ' flowers , it has been carried to a great /z/ extent . The great number of new and beautiful Roses , Azaleas Camellias , Fuchsias , Dahlias , and other flowering plants so splendid in colour , and perfect in form , owe their origin to careful cross-breeding . In the amelioration of fruits it is by far the most certain , and satisfactory process yet discovered . Its results are more speedily obtained , and correspond much more closely to our aim , than those procured by successive reproduction . In order to obtain a new variety of a certain character , it is only necessary to select two parents of well known habits , and which are both varieties of the same , or nearly allied species , and cross them for a new and intermediate variety . Thus , if we have a very early , but insipid , and worthless sort of pear , and desire to raise from it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertilize some of its pistils , with the pollen of the best flavoured variety of a little later maturity . Among the seedlings produced , we should look for early pears of good quality , and at least for one or two varieties nearly , or quite as early as the female parent , and as delicious as the male . If we have a very small , but highly flavoured pear , and wish fora larger pear with a somewhat similar flavour , we must fertilize the first with the pollen of a large and handsome sort . If we desire to impart the quality of lateness to a very choice plum , we must look out for a late variety , whether of good or bad quality , as the mother , and cross it with our best flavoured sort . If we desire to impart hardiness to a tender fruit , we must undertake a cross between it and a much hardier sort ; if we seek greater beauty of colour , or vigour of growth , we must insure these qualities by selecting one parent having such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertilization are not found to produce precisely the same varieties , though they will nearly all partake of the mixed character of the parents , it follows that we shall be most successful in obtaining precisely all we hope for in the new race , in proportion to the number of our cross-bred seedlings ; some of which may be inferiour , as well as some superiour to the parents . It is always well , therefore , to cross several flowers at once on the same plant , when a single blossom does not produce a number of seeds . We should observe here , that those who devote their time to raising new varieties , must bear in mind that it is not always by the first fruits of a seedling that it should be judged . Some of the finest varieties require a considerable age before their best qualities develop themselves , as it is only when the tree has arrived at some degree of maturity that its secretions , either for flower , or fruit , are perfectly elaborated . The first fruit of the Black Eagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pronounced worthless when first exhibited to the London Horticultural Society ; its quality now proves that the tree was not then of sufficient age to produce its fruit in perfection . /z/ AFTER having obtained a new and choice kind of fruit , which in our hands is perhaps only a single tree , and which , as we have already shown , seldom produces the same from seed , the next inquiry is how to continue this variety in existence , and how to increase and extend it , so that other gardens and countries may possess it as well as ourselves . This leads us to the subject of the propagation of fruit trees , or the continuation of varieties by grafting and budding . Grafting and budding are the means in most common use for propagating fruit trees . They are , in fact , nothing more than inserting upon one tree , the shoot or bud of another , in such a manner that the two may unite and form a new compound . No person having any interest in a garden should be unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer , mations and improvements in all trees and shrubs , no less valuable , than they are beautiful and interesting . Grafting is a very ancient invention , having been well known and practised by the Greeks and Romans . The latter , indeed , describe a great variety of modes , quite as ingenious as any of the fanciful variations now used by gardeners . The French who are most expert in grafting , practice occasionally more than fifty modes , and within a few years have succeeded perfectly in grafting annual plants , such as the tomato , the dahlis , and the like . The uses of grafting , and budding , as applied to fruit trees , may be briefly stated as follows : 1 . The rapid increase or propagation of valuable sorts of frui* not easily raised by seeds , or cuttings , as is the case with nearly all varieties . 2 . To renew or alter the heads of trees , partially or fully grown , producing in two or three years , by heading-in and grafting , a new head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . To render certain foreign and delicate sorts of fruit more hardy by grafting them on robust stocks of the same species native to the country , as the foreign grape on the native . And to produce fine fruit in climates or situations not naturally favourable by grafting on another species more hardy ; as in a cool /z/ climate and damp strong soil , by working the Peach on the Plum . 4 . To render dwarf certain kinds of fruit , by grafting them on suitable stocks of slower growth , as in the case of the Pear on the Quince , the Apple on the paradise stock , &c.; 5 . By grafting several kinds on the same tree , to be able to have a succession of fruit , from early to late , in a small garden . 6 . To hasten the bearing of seedling varieties of fruit , or of such as are a long time in producing fruit , by grafting them on the branches of full grown , or mature bearing trees . Thus a seedling pear , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen years , will generally begin to bear the third or fourth year , if grafted on the extremity of the bearing branches of a mature tree . The proper time for grafting fruit trees is in the spring , as soon as the sap is in motion , which commences earliest with the Cherry and Plum , and ends with the Pear and Apple . The precise time of course varies with the season and the climate , but is generally comprised from February to the middle of April . The grape vine , however , which suffers by bleeding , is not usually grafted until it is in leaf . The most favourable weather for grafting is a mild atmosphere with occasional showers . The scions are generally selected previously ; as it is found in nearly all kinds of grafting by scions , that success is more complete when the stock upon which they are placed is a little more advanced the sap in a more active state than in the scion . To secure this , we usually cut the scions very early in the spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lower ends in the ground in a shaded place , or keeping them in fine soil in the cellar till wanted for use . In cutting scions , we choose straight thrifty shoots of the last year 's growth , which may remain entire until we commence grafting , when they may be cut into scions of three or four buds each . In selecting scions from old trees it is always advisable to choose the most vigorous of the last year 's shoots growing near the centre or top of the tree . Scions from sickly and unhealthy branches should be rejected , as they are apt to carry with them this feeble and sickly state . Scions taken from the lower bearing branches will produce fruit soonest , but they will not afford trees of so handsome a shape , or so vigorous a growth , as those taken from the thrifty upright shoots near the centre or top of the tree . Nurserymen generally take their scions from young grafted * trees in the nursery-rows , these being usually in better condition than those taken from old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for grafting upon , is generally a tree which has been standing , at least for a year previously , on the spot where it is grafted , as success is much less certain on newly moved trees . /z/ In the case , however , of very small trees or stocks , which are grafted below the surface of the ground , as is frequently the practice with the Apple in American nurseries , the stocks are grafted in the house in winter , or early spring , put away carefully in a damp cellar , and planted out in the spring ; but this method is only successful when the root is small , and when the top of the stock is taken off , and the whole root is devoted to supplying the graft with nourishment . The theory of grafting is based on the power of union between the young tissues , or organizable matter of growing wood . When the parts are placed nicely in contact , the ascending sap of the stock passes into and sustains life in the scion ; the buds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth of the season , begin to elaborate and send down woody matter , which , passing through the newly granulated substance of the parts in contact , unites the graft firmly with the stock . " If , " says De Candolle , " the descending sap has only an incomplete analogy with the wants of the stock , the latter does not thrive , though the organic union may have taken place ; and if the analogy between the alburnum of stock and scion is wanting , the organic union does not operate ; the scion can not absorb the sap of the stock and the graft fails . " Grafting therefore is confined within certain limits . A scion from one tree will not , from the want of affinity , succeed on every other tree , but only upon those to which it is allied . We are , in short , only successful in budding or grafting where there is a close relationship and similarity of structure between the stock and the scion . This is the case with varieties of the same species , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; next with the different species of a genus as the Apple and the Pear , which grow , but in which the union is less complete and permanent ; and lastly with the genera of the same natural family , as the Cherry on the Plum which die after a season or two . The ancients boasted of Vines and Apples grafted on Poplars and Elms ; but repeated experiments , by the most skilful cultivators of modern times , have clearly proved that although we may , once in a thousand trials* succeed in effecting these ill assorted unions , yet the graft invariably dies after a few months growth. * The range in grafting or budding , for fruit trees in ordinary * The classical horticulturist will not fail to recall to mind Pliny 's account of the tree in the garden of Lucullus , grafted in such a mariner as to bear Olives , Almonds , Apples , Pears , Plums , Figs , and Grapes . There is little doubt , however , 4 that this was some ingenious deception as to this day the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and grafted on Oranges and Pomegranates . This is ingeniously managed , for a short lived effect , by introducing the stems of these smaller plants through a hole bored up the centre of the stock of the trees their roots being in the same soil , and their stems , which after a little grnvth fill up these holes , appearing as if really grafted. /z/ culture is as the following ; Apples , on apple or crab seedlings for orchards ( standards , ) or on Paradise apple stocks , for dwarfs ; Pears , on pear seedlings for common culture , or Quince stocks for dwarfs , and sometimes on the thorn for clayey soils ; Peaches , on their own seedlings for standards or for orchards ; on Almonds , for hot and dry climates ; on Plums in cold or rnoist soils , or to secure them against the worm ; Apricots , on Plum stocks , to render them hardy and productive , or on their own seedlings to render them long-lived . Nectarines are usually worked on the Peach or Plum ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherry for dwarfs . The manual operation of grafting is performed in a very easy and complete manner when the size of the stock , or branch to be grafted , corresponds precisely with that of the scion . In this case , which is called splice grafting , it is only necessary with a smooth sloping cut , upwards on the stock a , and downwards on the scion 5 , Fig. 2 , to make the two fit precisely , so that the inner bark of one corresponds exactly with that of theother , to bind them firmly together with a strand of matting , and to cover the wound entirely with grafting clay or wax , and the whole is finished . In this , which is one of the neatest modes , the whole forms a complete union nearly at once ; leaving scarcely any wounded part to heal over . But , as it is only rarely that the stock is of so small a size as to fit thus perfectly to the scion , the operation must be varied somewhat , and requires more skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties , is called tongue Splice grafting , grafting . We may remark here that grafting the shoots of Peaches , Nectarines and Apricots , owing to their large pith is more difficult than that of other fruit trees . A variation of splice-grafting , Fig. 3 , has been invented to obviate this . This consists in selecting the scion a , so as to leave at its lower end about a fourth of an inch of two years old wood which is much firmer . The bottom of the slope on the stock is cut with a dove-tail notch &,; into which the scion is fitted . Tongue grafting , ( or whip-grafting , ) Fig. 4 , resembles very nearly splice-grafting , except , instead of the simple splice , a tongue is made to hold the two together more firmly . In order to understand this method let us explain it a little in detail . Fig- 2 - , . /z/ Fig. 3 . Splice grafting the peach . /z/ Fig. 3 .

If the stock is quite small , it may be within three or four inches of the ground . Then , with a very sharp knife , make a smooth cut . upwards b , about two inches in length . Next make a slit , from the top of this cut about one fourth of the way downwards , c , taking out a thin tongue of wood . Cut the scion four or five inches long , or so as to have three buds ; then shape the lower end with a single smooth sloping cut , e , about the same length as that on the stock , and make the tongue upward f , to fit in the downward slit of the stock . Now apply the scion accurately to the stock making the inner bark of the scion Jit exactly the inner bark of the stock , at least on one side , g . Without changing their position , tie them together carefully with a piece of bass-matting , or tape h . And finally cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This ball of clay should more than cover the union , by an inch above and below , and should be about an inch thick . If grafting-wax is used , the covering need not be above half an inch thick . In a month 's time , if the graft has taken , it will be expanding its leaves and sending out shoots . It will then be necessary to rub or cut off all shoots between the ball and the ground , if it is a small stock , or all those which would rob it of a principal share of nourishment , if upon a large tree . If the scion or stock is very weak , it is usual to leave one or two other buds for a time , to assist in drawing up the sap . About the middle of July , after a rainy day , you may remove the ball of clay , and , if the graft is /z/ securely united , also the bandage ; and the angle left at the top of the stock , a , should now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark of the stock and the scion to heal neatly over the whole wound . Though it is little attended to in common practice , the amateur will be glad to know that the success of a graft is always greatly insured by choosing the parts so that a bud is left near the top of the stock , k , and another near the bottom of the scion , / . These buds attract the rising sap to the portions where they are placed , form woody matter , and greatly facilitate the union of the parts near them ; the upper part of the stock , and the lower part of the scion , being the portions soonest liable to perish from a want of nourishment. * Cleft grafting is a very easy though rather clumsy mode , and is in more common use than any other in the United States . It is chiefly practised on large stocks , or trees the branches of which have been headed back , and are too large for tongue-grafting . The head of the stock is first cut over horizontally with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleft about two inches deep is then made in the stock with a hammer and splitting-knife . The scion is now prepared , by sloping its lower end in the form of a wedge about an inch and half long , leaving it a little thicker on the outer edge . Opening the cleft with the splitting knife , or a small chisel for that purpose , push the scion carefully down to its place , fitting its inner bark on one side to that of one side of the stock . When the stock is large , it is Fig. 4. usual to insert two scions , Fig. 4 . On withdrawing the chisel , the cleft closes firmly on the scions , when the graft is tied and clayed in the usual manner . Apple stocks in many American nurseries , are grafted in great quantities in this mode the stocks being previously taken out of the ground , headed down very near the root , cleft grafted with a single scion , sloping off with an oblique cut the side of the stock opposite that where the graft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows so as to allow only a couple of buds of the scion to appear above ground . It is not usual with many , either to tie , or clay the grafts in this case , as the wound is placed below the surface ; but when this plan is adopted , the grafts must be set * In grafting large quantities of young trees when stocks are scarce , it is not an unusual practice in some nurseries to tongue or whip-graft upon small pieces of roots of the proper sort of tree , planting the same in the earth as soon as grafted . Indeed , Dr. Van Mons considers this the most complete of all modes , with regard to the perfect condition of the grafted sort ; 1st. because the smallest quantity of the stock is used ; and 2d , because tVe lower part of the scion being thus placed in the ground , after a time it throws out fibres from that portion , and so at last is actually growing on its own roots . /z/ and the trees planted at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graft . Another way of grafting apple stocks , common in some western nurseries , consists in tongue-grafting on seedling stocks of very small size , cut back almost to the root . This is performed in winter , by the fireside the grafts carefully tied , and the roots placed in the cellar , in sand , till spring , when they are planted , the top of the graft just above ground . Grafting the Vine is attended with great success in the cleft manner if treated as follows . Cut your scions during the winter or early spring , keeping them partially buried in a cool damp cellar till wanted . As soon as the leaves of the old vine or stock are fully expanded , and all danger of bleeding is past say about the 10th of June , cut it off smoothly below the surface of the ground , and split the stock and insert one or two scions in the usual manner , binding the cleft well together if it does not close firmly . Draw the soil carefully over the whole , leaving two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the root of the stock is a strong native grape , the graft will frequently grow ten or fifteen feet during the first season , and yield a fair crop the second year . The Vine may also be grafted with good success at the usual season if grafted below the ground , but above ground , it should not be attempted , on account of bleeding , until the leaves are nearly expanded . Saddle grafting . Fig. 5 , consists in cutting the top of the stock in the form of a wedge , splitting the scion and thinning away each half to a tongue shape , placing it astride the stock , and fitting the two , at least on one side , as in tongue-grafting . This mode offers the largest surface for the junction of the scion and stock , and the union is very perfect . Mr. Knight , who practised it chiefly upon Cherry trees , states that he lias rarely ever seen a graft fail , even when the wood has been so succulent and immature as to preclude every hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode , for stocks larger than Saddle grafting , the scions , is practised with much success in England after the usual season is past , and when the bark of the stock separates readily . " The scion , which must be smaller than the stock , is split up between two or three inches from its lower end , so as to have one side stronger than the other . This strong side is then properly prepared and introduced between the bark and the wood ; while the thinner division is fitted to the op. posite side of the stock . " The graft , thus placed , receives a /z/ large supply of the sustaining fluid from the stock , and the union is rapid ; while the wound on the stock is speedily covered by a new layer of bark from that part of the scion which svanda astride it . Grafting clay is prepared by mixing one third horsedung free from straw , and two thirds clay , or clayey loam , with a little hair , like that used in plaster , to prevent its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , until it is thoroughly incorporated . When used , it should be of such a consistency as to be easily put on and shaped with the hands . Grafting wax of excellent quality we have made by melting together three parts of bees- wax , three parts of rosin and two parts tallow . While yet warm it may be worked with the aid of a little water , like shoemaker 's wax , by the hand . The Fig. 6 . Saddle grafting large stock common grafting wax of the French gardeners is of two kinds . The first , is melted and laid on with a brush in a fluid state , and is made of half a pound of pitch , half a pound of bees-wax , and a pound of cow-dung boiled together . The second , which is spread while warm on strips of coarse cotton , or strong paper , and wrapped directly about the graft , answering at once to tie and to protect it , is composed of equal parts of bees-wax , turpentine , and resin . The grafting wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and resin , in equal parts , or , as many prefer , with a little more tallow to render it pliable . Grafting wax is a much neater and more perfect protection than grafting clay , but the trifling cost of the latter , where a great deal of work is to be done , accounts for its greater use by nurserymen , and gardeners generally . Budding . Budding ( inoculating , of the old authors ) differs from common grafting not the least in its nature or effects . Every bud is a distinct individual , capable of becoming a tree under favourable /z/ circumstances . In grafting , we use a branch , composed of several buds with a considerable quantity of bark and wood ; while in budding , we employ but a single bud , with a very small quantity of the adjoining bark and wood . The advantages of budding fruit trees , compared with grafting , are so considerable , that in this country it is ten times as much practised . These are , first , the great rapidity with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever boy following him to tie the buds , being able to work from a thousand to twelve hundred young nursery stocks in a day . 2d . The more convenient season at which it is performed , in all countries where a short spring crowds garden labours within a small space . 3d . Being able to perform the operation without injuring the stock in case of failure , which is always more or less the case in stocks headed down for grafting . 4th . The opportunity which it affords , when performed in good season of repeating the trial on the same stock . To these we may add that budding is universally preferred here for all stone fruits , such as Peaches , Apricots , and the like , as these require extra skill in grafting , but are budded with great ease . The proper season for budding fruit trees in this country is from the first of July to the middle of September ; the different trees coming into season as follows ; Plums , Cherries , Apricots on Plums , Apricots , Pears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable size will require budding earlier than young seedling stocks . But the operation is always , and only , performed when the bark of the stock parts or separates freely from the wood , and when the buds of the current year 's growth are somewhat plump , and the young wood is growing firm . Young stocks in the nursery , if thrifty , are usually planted out in the rows in the spring , and budded the same summer or autumn . Before commencing you should provide yourself with a budding knife , Fig. 7 , ( about four and a half inches long , ) having a rounded blade at one end , and an ivory handle terminating in a thin rounded edge called the haft , a , at the other . In choosing your buds , select thrifty shoots that have nearly done growing , and prepare what is called a stick of buds , Fig. 8 , by cutting off a few of the imperfect buds at the lower , and such as may be yet too soft at the upper ends , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitbuds . Cut off the leaves , allowing about half an inch of the foot-stalks to remain for conveniently inserting the buds . Some strands of bass-matting about twelve or fourteen inches long , previously /z/ eoaked in water to render them soft and pliable , ( or in the absence of these some soft woollen yarn , ) must also be at hand for tying the buds . Shield or T budding is the most approved mode in all countries . A new variety of this method now tenerally practised in this country we shall describe rst as being the simplest and best mode for fruit trees . American shield budding . Having your stick of buds ready , choose a smooth portion of the stock . When the latter is small , let it be near the ground , and , if equally convenient , select also the north side of the stock , as less exposed to the sun . Make an upright incision in the bark from an inch to an inch and a half long , and at the top of this make a cross cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stick of buds , your knife being very sharp , cut a thin , smooth slice of wood and bark containing a bud , Fig. 9 , a . With the ivory haft of your budding knife , now raise the bark on each side of the incision just wide enough to admit easily the prepared bud . Taking hold " of the footstalk of the leaf , insert the bud under the bark , pushing it gently Fig. a A down to the bottom of the incision . If the upper stick of bud*. portion of the bud projects above the horizontal part of the T , cut it smoothly off now , so that it may completely fit , b . A bandage of the soft matting is now tied pretty firmly over the whole wound , Fig. 10 , commencing at the bottom , and leaving the bud , and the footstalk of the leaf only exposed to the light and air . Common shield-budding , Fig. 11 , practised in all gardens in Europe , differs from the foregoing only in one respect the removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken out with the point of the knife , holding the bud or Fig. 9 . American sme ld by the leaf stalk , with one hand , inserting shield budding . the knife under the wood at the lower extremity , and then raising and drawing out the wood by bending it upwards and downwards , with a slight jerk , until it is loosened from the bark ; always taking care that a small portion of the wood remains behind to fill up the hollow at the base or heart of the bud . The bud thus prepared is inserted precisely as before described . The American variety of shield budding is found greatly peferable to the European mode , at least for this climate . Many sorts of fruit trees , especially Plums and Cherries , nearly mature Fig. 10. /z/ Fig. 11. their growth , and require to be budded in the hottest part of our summer . In the old method , the bud having only a shield of bark with but a particle of wood in the heart of the bud , is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than when the slice of wood is left behind in the American way . Taking out this wood is always an operation requiring some dexterity and practice , as few buds grow when their eye , or heart wood is damaged . The American method , therefore , requires less skill , can be done earlier in the season with younger wood , is performed in much less time , and is uniformly more successful . It has been very fairly tested upon hundreds of thousand fruit trees , in our gardens , for the last twenty years , and , although practised English budders coming here , at first are greatly prejudiced against it , as being in direct opposition to one of the most essential features in the old mode , yet a fair trial has never failed to convince them of the superiority of the new . After treatment . In two weeks after the operation you will be able to see whether the bud has taken , by its plumpness and freshness . If it has failed , you may , if the bark still parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lose more than 6 or 8 per cent . If it has succeeded , after a fortnight more has elapsed , the bandage must be loosened , or if the stock has swelled much , it should be removed altogether . When budding has been performed very late , we have occasionally found it an advantage to leave the bandage on during the winter . As soon as the buds commence swelling in the ensuing spring , head down the stock , with a sloping back cut , within two or three inches of the bud . The bud will then start vigor isly , and all " robbers , " as the shoots of the stock near to and below the bud are termed , must be taken off from time to time . To secure the upright growth of the bud , and to prevent its being broken by the winds , it is tied when a few inches long to that portion of the stock left for the purpose , Fig. 12 , a . About midsummer , if the shoot is strong , this support may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly cut away in the dotted line , Z , when it will be rapidly covered with young bark . We have found a great advantage , when budding trees which do not take readily , in adopting Mr. Knight 's excellent mode of tying with two distinct Treatment/ th bandages ; one covering that part below the bud , growing bud . /z/ and the other the portion above it . In this case the lower bandage is removed as soon as the bud has taken , and the upper left for two or three weeks longer . This , by arresting the upward sap , completes the union of the upper portion of bud , ( which in plums frequently dies , while the lower part is united , ) and secures success . Reversed shield budding , which is nothing more than making the cross cut at the bottom , instead of the top of the upright incision in the bark , and inserting the bud from below , is a good deal practised in the south of Europe , but we have not found that it possesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of budding , worthy the attention of amateur cultivators , consists in using a blossom-bud instead of a wood-bud ; when , if the operation is carefully done , blossoms and fruit will be produced at once . This is most successful with the Pear , though we have often succeeded also with the Peach . Blossom-buds are readily distinguished , as soon as well formed , by their roundness , and in some trees by their growing in pairs ; while wood-buds grow singly , and are more or less pointed . We have seen a curious fruit grower borrow in this way , in September , from a neighbor ten miles distant , a single blossom-bud of a rare new pear , and produce from it a fair and beautiful fruit the next summer . The bud , in such cases , should be inserted on a favourable limb of a bearing tree . Annular budding . Fig. 12 , we have found a valuable mode for trees with hard wood , and thick bark , or those which , like the walnut , have buds so large as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . A ring of bark , when the sap is flowing freely , is taken from the stock , a , an a rm corresponding size containing a bud , J , from the scion . If the latter should be F . " ' too large , a piece must be taken from it to make Annular budding , it fit ; or should all the scions be too small , the ring upon the stock may extend only three fourths the way round , to suit the ring of the bud . An application of this mode of great value occasionally occurs in this country . In snowy winters , fruit trees in orchards are sometimes girdled at the ground by field mice , and a growth of twenty years is thus destroyed in a single day , should the girdle extend quite round the tree . To save such a tree , it is only necessary , as soon as the sap rises vigorously in the spring , to apply a new ring of bark in the annular mode taken from a branch of proper size ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclude the air , and finally drawing up the earth so as to cover the wound completely . When the tree is too large to apply an entire ring , separate pieces , carefully fitted , will answer ; and it is well to reduce the top somewhat by pruning , /z/ that it may not make too large a demand on the root for a supply of food . Budding may be done in the spring as well as at the latter end of summer , and is frequently so performed upon roses , and other ornamental shrubs , by French gardeners , but is only in occasional use upon fruit trees . Influence of the stock and graft . The well known fact that we may have a hundred different varieties of pear upon the same tree , each of which produces its fruit of the proper form , colour , and quality ; and that we may have , at least for a time , several distinct , though nearly related species upon one stock , as the Peach , Apricot , Nectarine , and Plum , prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however small , in preserving its identity . To explain this , it is only necessary to recall to mind that the ascending sap , which is furnished by the root or stock , is nearly a simple fluid ; that the leaves digest and modify this sap , forming a proper juice , which re-descends in the inner bark , and that thus every bud and leaf upon a branch maintains its individuality by preparing its own proper nourishment , or organizing matter , out of that general aliment , the sap . Indeed , according to De Candolle , * each separate cellule of the inner bark has this power of preparing its food according to its nature ; in proof of which , a striking experiment has been tried by grafting rings of bark , of different allied species , one above another on the same tree without allowing any buds to grow upon them . On cutting down and examining this tree , it was found that under each ring of bark was deposited the proper wood of its species , thus clearly proving the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves . On the other hand , though the stock increases in size by the woody matter received in the descending sap from the graft , yet as this descends through the inner bark of the stock , it is elaborated by , and receives its character from the latter ; so that , after a tree has been grafted fifty years , a shoot which springs out from its trunk below the place of union , will always be found to bear the original wild fruit , and not to have beer , in the least affected by the graft . But , whilst grafting never effects any alteration in Jie identity of the variety or species of fruit , still it is not to be denied that the stock does exert certain influences over the habits of the graft . The most important of these are dwarfing , inducing fruitfulness , and adapting the graft to the soil or climate . Thus every one knows that the slower habit of growth in the /z/ Quince stock , is shared by the Pear grafted upon it , which becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Paradise stock , and , in some degree , the Peach on the Plum . The want of entire similarity of structure between the stock and graft , confines the growth of the latter , and changes it , in the case of the Pear , from a lofty tree to a shrub of eight or ten feet in height . The effect of this difference of structure is very apparent , when the Peach is grafted on the Plum , in the greater size of the trunk above , as compared with that below the graft ; a fact which seems to arise from the obstruction which the descending sap of the graft finds in its course through the bark of the stock . To account for the earlier and greater fruitfulness caused by grafting on a stock of slower growth , Mr. Knight , in one of his able papers , offers the following excellent remarks . " The disposition in young trees to produce and nourish blossom buds and fruit , is increased by this apparent obstruction of the descending sap ; and the fruit , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same age which grow upon stocks of their own species . But the growth and vigor of the tree , and its power to nourish a succession of heavy crops , are diminished , apparently , by the stagnation in the branches and stock of a portion of that sap which , in a tree growing on its own stem , or upon a stock of its own species , would descend to nourish and promote the extension of its own roots . The practice , therefore , of grafting the Pear on the Quince , and the Peach on the Plum , when extensive growth and durability are wanted is wrong ; but it is eligible wherever it is wished to diminish the vigour and growth of the tree , and its durability is not so important . " In adapting the graft to the soil the stock has a marked influence . Thus in dry chalky soils where the Peach on its own roots will scarcely grow , it is found to thrive admirably budded on the Almond . We have already mentioned that in clay soils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well if worked on the Plum . M. Floss , a Prussian gardener , succeeded in growing fine pears in very sandy soils , where it was nearly impossible to raise them before , by grafting them on the Mountain Ash , a nearly related tree , which thrives on the diyest and lightest soil . A variety of fruit which is found rather tender for a certain climate , or a particular neighborhood , is frequently acclimatised by gra/ting it on a native stock of very hardy habits . Thus near the sea-coast where the finer plums thrive badly , we have seen them greatly improved by being worked on the beechplum , a native stock adapted to the spot ; and the foreign grape is more luxuriant when grafted on our native stocks . A slight effect is sometimes produced by the stock on the /z/ quality of the fruit . A few sorts of pear are superiour in flavour , but many are also inferiour , when grafted on the Quince , while they are more gritty on the thorn . The Green Gage , a Plum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks ; and Apples raised on the crab , and Pears on the Mountain Ash , are said to keep longer than when grown on their own roots . In addition to the foregoing , a diseased stock should always be avoided , as it will communicate disease slowly to the graft , unless the latter is a variety of sufficient vigour to renew the health of the stock , which is but seldom the case . The cultivator will gather from these remarks that , in a favourable climate and soil , if we desire the greatest growth , duration , and development in any fruit , ( and this applies to orchards generally , ) we should choose a stock of a closely similar nature to the graft an apple seedling for an apple ; a pear seedling for a pear . If we desire dwarf trees , that come into bearing very young , and take little space in a garden , we employ for a stock an allied species of slower growth . If our soil or climate is unfavourable , we use a stock , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its hardier roots , endure the cold . The influence of the graft on the stock seems scarcely to extend beyond the power of communicating disease . A graft taken from a tree enfeebled by disease , will recover with difficulty , even if grafted on healthy stocks for a dozen times in repeated succession . And when the disease is an inherent or hereditary one , it will certainly communicate it to the stock . We have seen the yellows , from a diseased peach tree , propagated through hundreds of individuals by budding , and the stock and graft both perish together from its effects . Hence the importance , to nurserymen especially of securing healthy grafts , and working only upon healthy stocks . Propagation by cuttings . Propagating by cuttings , as applied to fruit trees , consists in causing a shoot of the previous seasons ' wood to grow , by detaching it from the parent tree at a suitable season , and planting it in the ground under favourable circumstances . In this case , instead of uniting itself by woody matter to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending woody matter becomes roots at the lower end , and the cutting of which , is then a new and entire plant . Every bud being a distinct individual , capable of forming a new plant , has indeed theoretically the power , if separated from the parent stem , of throwing out roots and maintaining a separate existence ; and some plants as the grape vine are frequently propagated by single buds planted in the soil . But in practice , it is found necessary , with almost all trees and /z/ plants , to retain a considerable portion of the stem with the bud , to supply it with food until it has formed roots to draw nourishment from the soil . All fruit trees may be propagated by cuttings with proper care and attention , but only a few grow with sufficient facility in this way to render their propagation by cuttings a common mode . These are the Gooseberry , the Currant , the Vine , the Quince , the Fig , and the Mulberry . Cuttings of the Currant , Gooseberry , and the hardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil not too dry , in the open garden . Currants and Gooseberries are generally taken off in the fall or winter , prepared for planting , and two thirds of their lower ends buried in the ground till the commencement of spring , when they are planted out , either where they are to remain , or in nursery rows . If planted in autumn , they are liable to be thrown out by winter frosts . They will succeed nearly as well if taken off in the spring , but , owing to the period at which they commence growing , this must be attended to very early , if deferred till that season . In order to raise plants of the Gooseberry and Currant , with straight , clean stems , which shall not throw up suckers , it is only necessary , before planting the cutting , to cut out every eye or bud to be placed below the surface of the ground , Fig. 14 . The cutting should be about a foot long , eight inches of which may be inserted in the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gooseberry , or other shrubs , it is customary to plant the cuttings on the shaded side of a wall or fence , in deep rich loam , rather damp than dry . Cuttings of the vine are generally prepared when trimming the oofe &err; c* P lants in autumn #@# or winter ; they may then be ting , jnvpared buried with their lower ends in the ground , or kept and planted . in earth in the cellar till spring . Scarce sorts of foreign grapes , which it is desirable to multiply extensively , are frequently propagated by joints ; that is , by buds having about two inches of wood attached to each every bud in this way forming a plant . When this mode is adopted , it is usual to plant the " joints about half an inch deep , in light soil , in a common hot bed prepared for the purpose , or each joint is planted in a pot by itself . In the first way a great number of - a* , plants may be grown in a small space . Success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The large English black mulberry is propagated by cuttings /z/ as follows : about the last of October , take cuttings from the thrifty shoots of a bearing tree , cut out all the buds except two or three at the top , and pare off the bottom of the cutting just below p. bud . Lay-in the cuttings in a sheltered border , burying them so that only the two buds at the top are exposed , and covering them with some loose straw or litter . In the spring , make a small hot-bed with very sandy soil in which to plant the cuttings on taking them out of the ground , or place each one in a small pot in any hot-bed ready at hand , and in a few weeks they will be found to have made roots freely . As a general rule , cuttings succeed best when they are taken off just between the young and the previous year 's wood ; or , in the case of young side shoots , when they are cut off close to the branch preserving the collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly across just below a bud , the soil should in all cases be pressed firmly about the lower end of the cutting , and it should always be planted before the buds commence swelling , that the wound may in some measure heal before growth and the absorption of fluid commences . Propagation by Layers and Suckers . A layer may be considered as a cutting not entirely separated from the plant . Layering is a mode of propagation resorted to in increasing some fruit tree stocks , as the Paradise stock , the Muscle Plum , and some kinds which do not grow so well from the seed . Certain varieties of native grape , as the Eland 's Virginia , which do not root readily by cuttings are also raised in this way , and it may be applied to any sort of fruit tree which it is desirable to continue on its own root without grafting . Fruit trees are generally layered in the spring , and the layers may be taken off well rooted plants in the autumn . But they may also be layered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the mother plant should be made light and mellow by digging . Being provided with some hooked pegs to fasten down the layers , bend down a branch so that the end may recline upon the ground . Open a little trench three or four inches j / Q C deep to receive the young wood to be layered ; make a cut or tongue , Fig. 16 a , halfway through the under side of the shoot , .. pegging down the branch with the hooked peg b , to Fig 16 Laveiingm /z/ keep it in its place ; press the earth slightly round the tongue , and , in filling in the soil , raise nearly upright the end of the layer c , which remains above the surface of the ground . The descending sap , filled with organizable matter , is arrested by this tongue , accumulates there , and the emission of roots speedily takes place . Ringing , wounding , or twisting the limb , answers the same purpose less perfectly , and indeed many trees root readily from the mere position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil . A tree or plant which is kept for raising layers is called a stool , and is headed down , both to facilitate the rooting of the layers , and to afford an abundance of shoots near the earth . Shoots of some of the fruit tree stocks in the English nurseries are pegged down to the surface before growth commences in the spring , covered about an inch deep with soil , and at the end of autumn afford hundreds of plants ; almost every bud making a separate root . Suckers are shoots sent up from the root , or from portions of the stem below the surface of the soil , which are easily separated from the parent plant . Suckers of fruit trees are frequently used as stocks for budding or grafting upon , but they are greatly inferiour to seedlings for this purpose , as they are always more liable to produce suckers , and they have not the thrifty vigorous habit , or the same power of forming as good roots as seedlings . Beside this , should the tree from which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the malady with them . Propagating by suckers , is an easy and desirable way when we wish to continue a seedling fruit of value on its own root , and some of our common fruits appear to be more healthy and permanent when growing in that way . It is also the only mode in use for increasing the Raspberry ; as is also that of runners , which is a kind of sucker above ground , for the Strawberry . /z/ 1 . Pruning to promote growth or modify the form of fruit trees . In this country almost all fruit trees are grown as standards . In this way they develop their natural forms , attain the largest size , and produce the greatest quantity of fruit , with the least possible care . Our bright and powerful sun , reaching every /z/ part of the tree , renders the minute systems of pruning and training , which occupy so large a portion of the English works on this subject , of little or no moment to the cultivator here . Pruning is , therefore , commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeble trees , or to regulate and im. prove the form of healthy and luxuriant trees . Pruning has the power of increasing the vigour of a tree in two ways . If we assume that a certain amount of nourishment is supplied by the roots to all the branches and buds of a tree , by cutting off one half of the branches , at the proper season , we direct the whole supply of nourishment to the remaining portion , which will , consequently , grow with nearly double their former luxuriance . Again , when a tree becomes stunted or enfeebled in its growth , the thinness of its inner bark , with its consequent small sap- vessels , ( which it must be remembered are the principal channel for the passage of the ascending supply of food ) renders the upward and downward circulation tardy , and the giowth is small . By heading back or pruning judiciously , all the force of the nourishing fluid is thrown into a smaller number of buds , which make new and luxuriant shoots , larger sap-vessels , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree with these renewed energies will continue in vigour for a long time . This treatment is especially valuable in the case of small trees of feeble or stunted growth , which are frequently cut back to a single bud , and a new shoot or shoots , full of vigour , gives a healthy habit to the tree . In the nurseries , this practice of heading down unthrifty trees is frequently pursued , and small orchard trees which have become enfeebled may be treated in the same manner ; cutting back the head as far as the place where it is wished that new shoots should spring out . Older trees should be headed back more sparingly , unless they are greatly enfeebled ; and their roots should at the same time be assisted by manure . A judicious pruning to modify the form of our standard trees is nearly all that is required in ordinary practice . Every fruit tree , grown in the open orchard or garden as a common standard should be allowed to take its natural form , the whole efforts of the pruner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded branches ; those which are filling uselessly the interiour of the tree , where their leaves can not be duly exposed to the light and sun , or those which interfere with the growth of others . All pruning of large branches in healthy trees should be avoided by examining them every season and taking out superfluous shoots while small . Mr. Coxe , the best American author on fruit trees , remarks very truly " when orchard trees are much pruned , they are apt to throw out numerous ( superfluous ) suckers from the boughs in the following summer ; these should be rubbed off when they first appear , or they may easily /z/ be broken off while young and brittle cutting is apt to increase their number . " Where pruning is not required to renovate the vigour of an enfeebled tree , or to regulate its shape in other words , in the case of a healthy tree which we wish to retain in a state of the greatest luxuriance , health , and vigour , it may be considered worse than useless . Bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leaves and branches , if these are in due proportion , and in perfect health , the knife will always be found rather detrimental to luxuriance and constitutional vigour than beneficial. * The lest season for pruning to promote growth , theoretically , is in autumn soon after the fall of the leaf . Next to this , winter pruning , performed in mild weather , is best , and in orchards this is the season usually most convenient . In all parts of the country where the winters are not very severe , ( and always in the southern and western states , ) the roots are collecting a certain stock of nourishment during the whole autumn and winter . When a tree is pruned in autumn or winter this whole supply goes to the remaining branches , while in the case of spring pruning it is partly lost . North of the 43 of latitude , however , the winters are so severe that winter pruning should be deferred till the last of February . We should especially avoid pruning at that period in spring when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow , as the loss of sap by bleeding is very injurious to most trees , and , in some , brings on a serious and incurable canker in the limbs . There are advantages and disadvantages attending all seasons of pruning , but our own experience has led us to believe that , practically , a fortnight before midsummer is by far the best season , on the whole , for pruning in the northern and middle states . Wounds made at this season heal over freely and rapidly ; it is the most favourable time to judge of the shape and balance of the head , and to see at a glance which branches require removal ; and all the stock of organizable matter in the tree is directed to the branches that remain . In pruning large limbs , some composition should always be at hand to cover the wound . This will not only prevent its cracking by the cold in winter pruning , but will keep out the air , and maintain the exposed wood in a sound state , until it is covered * Ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause them to grow up with lean and slender stems , by injudiciously trimming off the young side shoots and leaves , in the growing season . By taking off these shoots , the stem is deprived of all the leaves which would attract and elaborate the sap , thus preparing nourishment for the growth of the stem ; and the trunk of the tree does not increase in size half so fast as when the side branches are allowed to remain for a time , pruning them away gradually . It is better , in the case of these young trees , to stop the side branches when of moderate length by pinching out the terminal bud . /z/ with a new layer of bark . Many compositions have been ir fashion , abroad , for this purpose , which , under our summer sun and wintry frosts , are nearly worthless , as they generally crack and fall off in a single year . The following is a cheap and admirable application , which we recommend to all cultivators of fruit trees . Composition for wounds made in pruning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much gum shellac as will make a liquid of the consistence of paint . Apply this to the wound with a common painter 's brush ; always paring the wound smoothly first with the knife . The liquid becomes perfectly hard , adheres closely , excludes the air perfectly , and is affected by no changes of weather ; while at the same time its thinness offers no resistance to the lip of new bark that gradually closes over the wound . If the composition is kept in a well corked bottle , sufficiently wide mouthed to admit the brush , it will always be ready for use and suited to the want of the moment . 2 . Pruning to induce fruitfulness . When a young fruit tree is too luxuriant , employing all its energies in making vigorous shoots , but forming few or no blossom buds , and producing no fruit , we have it in our power by different modes of pruning to lessen this over-luxuriance , and force it to expend its energies in fruit-bearing . The most direct and successful mode of doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into very successful practice by European gardeners . Root pruning has the effect of at once cutting off a considerable supply of the nourishment formerly afforded by the roots of a tree . The leaves , losing part of their usual food , are neither able to grow as rapidly as before , nor to use all the nutritious matter already in the branches ; the branches therefore become more stunted in their growth , the organizable matter accumulates , and fruit buds are directly formed . The energies of the tree are no longer entirely carried off in growth , and the returning sap is employed in producing fruit buds for the next year . Root pruning should be performed in autumn or winter , and it usually consists in laying bare the roots and cutting off smoothly at a distance of a few feet from the trunk , ( in proportion to the size of the tree ) the principal roots . Mr. Rivers , an English nurseryman of celebrity , who has practised this mode with great success , digs a trench early in November , eighteen inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting off the roots with a sharp spade . By following this practice every year , he not only throws his trees into early bearing , but forces Apples , Pears , and the like , grafted on their own roots , to become prolific dwarfs , growing only six feet apart , trained in a /z/ conical form , full of fruit branches , and producing abundantly . These dwarf trees , thus annually root pruned , he supplies abundantly with manure at the ends of the roots , thus keeping up their health and vigour . The plan is an admirable one for small gardens , or for amateurs who wish to grow a great many sorts in a small surface . Mr. Rivers , in a pamphlet on this subject enumerates the following among the advantages of systematic root pruning . " 1 . The facility of thinning , ( owing to the small size of the trees , ) and , in some varieties , of setting the blossoms of shy- bearing sorts , and of thinning and gathering the fruit . " 2 . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden , as a few barrowsful of rich mould will support a tree for a lengthened period , thus placing bad soils nearly on a level with those the most favourable . " 3 . The capability of removing trees of fifteen or twenty years growth , with as much facility as furniture . To tenants this will indeed be a boon , for perhaps one of the greatest annoyances a tenant is subject to , is that of being obliged to leave behind him trees that he has nurtured with the utmost care . " In conclusion , Mr. Rivers recommends caution ; " enough of vigour must be left in the tree to support its crop of fruit , and one , two , or three seasons cessation from root pruning , will often be found necessary . " Root pruning in this country will , we think , be most valuable in its application to common standard trees , which are thrifty , but bear little or no fruit . They will generally be found to require but a single pruning to bring them into a permanently fruitful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which do not usually give a fair crop till they are twelve or fourteen years old , may be brought into fruit by this means as soon as they are of proper size . Several nearly full grown peach , pear , and plum trees , on a very rich soil on the Hudson , which were over-luxuriant but bore no fruit , were root pruned by our advice two years ago , and yielded most excellent and abundant crops last season . In the case of Apple orchards , where the permanent value depends on the size , longevity , and continued productiveness of the trees , it is better to wait patiently and not resort to pruning to bring them into bearing ; as it can not be denied that all excessive pruning shortens somewhat the life of a tree . Mr. Coxe , indeed , recommended that the first fruit should never be allowed to ripen on a young apple orchard , as it lessens very materially the vigour of the trees . Shortening-in the shoots of Peaches , Nectarines , and Apricots , as we shall hereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitfulness of these trees , since by reducing the young wood , the sap accumulates in the remainder of the branch , and n.any /z/ bearing shoots are produced instead of one . And the English practice of spurring-in , which consists in annually shortening the lateral shoots of trained Pears , Apples , and the like , in order to make them throw out short fruit branches , or spurs , is founded on the same principle . Bending down the Iwibs is an easy and simple means of throwing such branches directly into fruit . By this means the circulation is retarded , rapid growth ceases , organizable matter accumulates , and fruit buds , as before stated , surely follow . The limbs are bent , while flexible , in June or July , and tied down below a horizontal line until they retain of themselves their new position . When this can be easily applied , it is a never failing mode of rendering such branches fruitful . It is stated in Loudon 's Gardener 's Magazine that " a very large crop of Pears was obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees which had not borne at all , by twisting and breaking down the young shoots , late in the autumn , when the wood had become tough ; and the pendent branches afterwards continued perfectly healthy . " Disbarking and Ringing are two modes that have been recommended by some authors , but of which , except as curious experiments , we entirely disapprove . Disbarking , that is , removing the outer bark of the trunk in February , May , or March , is and may be practised with good results on trees in very sheltered positions , and under glass , but must always be a somewhat dangerous practice in open orchards , and in a variable climate like ours ; while its good effects may in a great measure be attained by keeping the bark in a healthy state by a wash of soft soap . Kinging , which is nothing more than stopping the descending sap in a branch and forcing it to organize blossom buds , by taking off a ring of bark , say a fourth or half an inch , near midsummer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health of the branch , and if carried to any extent , finally destroys the tree . It is gradually falling into disuse , since root pruning , and other and better modes , are becoming known . A ligature or bandage tightly applied to the limb , will have temporarily the same effect as ringing , without so much injury to the branch . Inducing fruitfulness ly other means . The influence of certain soils on the productiveness of fruit trees is a subject of every day observation , but the particular ingredients of the soil , which insure this abundant bearing , is not so well known . Limestone soils are almost invariably productive of all sorts of fruit ; and certain strong loams in this country seem to be equally well adapted to this end . In a curious work called the " Rejuvenescence of Plants , " etc. by Dr. Schultz , of Berlin , the author , who has devoted consider- /z/ able time to the subject , states that common salt and chloride of lime contribute greatly to the flowering of most plants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with safety , in small quantities . " Salts of lime , " he continues , " appear to produce so nearly the same effect as those of potash and soda , that it is only necessary to place lime within their reach , if there is no deficiency of manure in the shape of general food . Lime will in the main promote , in an astonishing degree , the fruiting and flowering of most plants , because calcareous salts promote evaporation and the concentration of the sap . " Although we can not coincide with many of Dr. Schultz 's views as expressed in this work , yet , the remarks just quoted agree so entirely with facts that have come under our own observation , that we gladly place them before the cultivator of fruit trees . One of the most productive fruit gardens in our knowledge is on a limestone soil , and another more than usually prolific , in a neighbourhood not very fruitful , is every year treated with a top dressing of coarse salt , at the rate of two bushels to the acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and should be the subject of more extended and careful experiments . Rendering trees more fruitful by dwarfing , and by adapting them to soils naturally unfruitful by growing them upon other and better stocks , we have already placed before the reader under the head of Grafting . /z/ TRAINING fruit trees is , thanks to our favourable climate , a proceeding entirely unnecessary in the greater part of the United States . Our fine dry summers , with the great abundance of strong light and sun , are sufficient to ripen fully the fruits of temperate climates , so that the whole art of training , at once the trial and triumph of skill with English fruit gardeners , is quite dispensed with : and in the place of long lines of brick wall and espalier rails , surrounding and dividing the fruit garden , all covered with carefully trained trees , we are proud to show the open orchard , and the borders in the fruit garden filled with thrifty and productive standards . Nothing surprises a British gardener more , knowing the cold of our winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine fruits , arriving at full perfection in the middle states , with so little care ; and he sees at /z/ once that three fourths of the great expense of a fruit garden here is rendered entirely needless . Training fruit trees , in this country , is therefore confined to the colder districts north of the 43 of latitude , and to the gardens of amateurs . There can , however , scarcely be a more beautiful display of the art of the horticulturist , than a fine row of trained trees , their branches arranged with the utmost symmetry and regularity , and covered , in the fruit season , with large and richly coloured fruit . North of the 43 latitude , ( or south of the Mohawk , ) the peach does not ripen well , and this , as well as some other rather tender trees , will , in such situations , generally yield abundant crops when trained on a common upright trellis , or espalier rail , seven or eight feet high. * Still farther north , as in Maine , or Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own observation leads us to believe that , generally , the espalier rail will be found not only cheaper , and more easily managed in training , but really preferable to a wall , as full exposure to light is sufficient without much additional heat . With regard to walls themselves , in the middle portions of the Union , a southern aspect is almost always the worst , being too hot in midsummer ; a wall running north and south , and affording east and west aspects , is much the best . The western aspect is indeed preferable for all tender fruits , as the blossoms are not there liable to injury from early frosts . A north wall is useful for producing a later crop . The objects of training are , by a more complete exposure of the leaves and branches to the light and sun , to ripen fruits in a naturally unfavourable climate ; to render them more fruitful , lessening vigour and excessive growth by the lateral or horizontal arrangement of the branches ; and lastly economy of space , as trees when trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit garden than standards , and leave the borders more open for cropping with vegetables . Training conical standards . A very easy and simple mode of training fruit trees , which has lately come into great favour with amateurs , is the conical standard , or Quenoui/le , ( pronounced kenool ) of the French . It is applied chiefly to pears , which , when treated in this way , may be planted about eight feet apart , and thus a great variety of sorts may be grown in a small garden . The best example of this kind of training in this country , at present , is in the garden of Mr. Johnson of Lynn , Mass . A great number of the specimen trees in the London Horticultural Society 's garden are trained in this manner ; and Loudon remarks , that in 1840 the Royal Kitchen garden of Versailles * Cellar or locust posts , set four or eight feet apart , with horizontal bars let in , and crossed by light perpendicular strips of pine from six to twelve inches apart , will form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 . Indeed many gardeners here prefer haying a light trellis a few inches from the wall , upon which to train , instead of nailing directly on the wall . /z/ contained two hundred trees trained in the conical manner , with the current year 's shoots tied down en quenouille . " They had attained the height of from six to twelve feet before the branches were bent down ; but the effect of this was to cover the shoots with blossom buds , and to produce the most extraordinary crops . " To produce Quenouille standards , plant a young tree , three or four feet high , and , after the first summer 's growth , head back the top , and cut-in the side branches , as represented by the dotted lines , on a , Fig. 16 . The next season the tree will shoot out three or four tiers of side branches , according to its strength . The lowest should be left about eighteen inches from the ground , and , by pinching off superfluous shoots , others may be made to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quenouille or conical training , progressive stages . larly , so as not to crowd the head , head back the leader as in , to strengthen the side shoots . Next season a fresh series of lateral shoots will be produced , four or five of which may be kept every year ; and , the third or fourth year , the lower branches may be bent down in midsummer , c , and kept in a pendulous position for a year or two , by tying them to stakes driven in the ground , or to the main stem . This successive growth at the top , and arrangement of the limbs below , must be continued till the requisite height say ten feet is attained , when all the branches assuming their final form , the tree will resemble Fig. 17 . A moderate pruning to produce new wood , and the occasional tying in of a rambling shoot , will be all that is required . The French quenouille pig Conical or QuenouVh training is performed with dwarf training , complete . stocks , but the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own stocks , and kept within proper bounds by root pruning , after Mr. Rivers ' method , explained in a previous page . The two best modes of training for this country , on walls or espaliers , are fan-training , and horizontal training . The first is the simplest and easiest mode of training the Peach , the Apricot , Nectarine , and Cherry ; and the latter is best adapted to the Pear . In training to a wall , the branches are fastened in their places by shreds of leather and nails ; and , as espaliers , by tying them with slips of bass-matting to the rails of the trellis . The following account of these two modes of training is so concisely abridged from the practice of the best English gardens , in the Suburban Horticulturist , that we can not do better than to place it before the reader . Fan-training in the common English manner . A maiden plant ( a tree but one year from the graft , ) being planted " is to be headed down to four buds or eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two shoots on each side , as shown in Fig. 18 . The following season the Fig. 18 . Fan-training , first two uppermost shoots are to he headed stage . down to three eyes , placed in such a manner as to throw out one leading shoot , and one shoot on each side ; the two lowermost shoots are to be headed down to two eyes , so as to throw out one leading shoot , and one shoot on the uppermost side , as shown in Fig. 19 . We have now five leading shoots on each side , well placed , to form our future tree . Each of these shoots must be placed in the exact position in which it is to remain ; and as it is these Fig. 19 . Fan-training , second stage . shoots which are to form the future tree , none of them are to be shortened . The tree should by no means be suffered to bear any fruit this year . Each shoot must now be allowed to produce , besides the leading shoot at its extremity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bottom and one about midway up the stem ; there must also be one shoot on the undermost side , placed about midway between the other two . All the other shoots must be pinched off in their infant WT . state - The tree w iH Fig. 20 . Fan-training , third stage . then assume , at the end of the third year , the appearance shown in Fig. 20 . From this time it may be allowed to bear what crop of fruit the gar- /z/ dener thinks it able to carry ; in determining which , he ought never to overrate the vigour of the tree . All of these shoots , except the leading ones , must at the proper season be shortened , but to what length must be left entirely to the judgment of the gardener , it of course depending upon the vigour of the tree . In shortening the shoot , care should be taken to cut back to a wood bud that will produce a shoot for the following year . Cut close to the bud , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year each shoot at the extremities of the leading branches should produce , besides the leading shoot , one on the upper and two on the under part , more or less , according to the vigour of the tree ; whilst each of the secondary branches should produce besides the leading shoot , one other placed near to the bottom ; for the grand art of pruning , in all systems to which this class of trees is subjected , consists in preserving a sufficient quantity of young wood at the bottom of the tree ; and on no account must the gardener cut away clean any shoots so placed , without well considering if they will be wanted , not only for the present but for the future good appearance of the tree . The quantity of young wood annually laid in must depend upon Fig. 21 . Fan-training complete . the vigour of the tree . It would be ridiculous to lay the same quantity into a weakly tree as into a tree in full vigour . The gardener here must use his own judgment . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others , a portion of young shoots must be laid in , and a greater quantity of fruit suffered to ripen on the over-vigorous branch . At the same time a smaller quantity of fruit than usual must be left to ripen on the weaker branch . This will tend to restore the equilibrium better than any other method . Fig. 21 , presents us with the figure of a tree in a more advanced state well balanced , and well calculated for an equal distribution of the sap all over its surface . We have varied this figure by representing it trained on a trellis , instead of a wall . Whenever any of the lower shoots have advanced so far as to incommode the others , they /z/ should be cut back to a yearling shoot ; this will give them room , and keep the lower part of the tree in order . In nailing to a wall , care must be taken not to bruise any part of the shoot ; the wounds made by the knife heal quickly , but a bruise often proves incurable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree ; it will endanger the life of the branch . In nailing-in the young shoots , dispose them as straight and regular as possible ; it will look workman-like . Whatever system of training is pursued , the leading branches should be laid-in in the exact position they are to remain ; for wherever a large branch is brought down to fill the lower part of the wall , the free ascent of the sap is obstructed by the extension of the upper , and contraction of the lower parts of the branch . It is thus robbed of part of its former vigour , while it seldom fails to throw out , immediately behind the parts most bent , one or more vigorous shoots . " Horizontal training consists in preserving an upright leader , with lateral shoots trained at regular intervals . These intervals may be from a foot to eighteen inches for pears and apples , and about nine inches for cherries and plums . " A maiden plant with three shoots having been procured , the two side shoots are laid in horizontally , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buds being rubbed off the latter but three , viz. , one next the top for a vertical leader , and one on each side near the top , for hori- T , , i i T A u f i f Fig. 22 . Horizontal zontal branches . In the course of the first training , frst stage . summer after planting , the shoots may be allowed to grow without being stopped . In the autumn of the first year the two laterals produced are nailed or tied in , and also the shoots produced from the extremities of the lower laterals ; the centre shoot being headed down as before , as shown in Fig. 23 . But in the second summer , when the Fig. 23 . Horizontal training , se- m ain shoot has attained the length cond stage . of ten or twelve inches , it may be stopped ; which , if the plant is in proper vigour , will cause it to throw out two horizontal branches , in addition to those which were thrown out from those of the preceding year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will Fig. 24 . Horizontal training , third stage . have four horizontal branches on each side of the upright stem . /z/ as in Fig. 24 ; and by persevering in this system four horizontal branches will be produced in each year till the tree reaches the top of the wall ( or espalier , ) when the upright stem must terminate in two horizontal branches . In the following autumn the Fig. 25 . Horizontal training , fourth year . tree will have the appearance of Fig. 25 . " Suburban Horticulturist , pp. 363 : 372 . Training fruit trees is nowhere in the United States practised to much extent except in the neighborhood of Boston ; and some of the best specimens of the foregoing methods in that neighborhood are in the gardens of J. P. Gushing , Esq. , Col. Perkins , and S. G. Perkins , Esq . /z/ As nearly all fruit trees are raised first in nurseries , and then removed to their final position in the orchard or fruit garden ; as upon the manner of this removal depends not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigour afterwards , and in many cases even their life , it is evident that it is in the highest degree important , to understand and practise well this transplanting . The season best adapted for transplanting fruit trees is a matter open to much difference of opinion among horticulturists ; a difference founded mainly on experience , but without taking into account variation of climate and soils , two very important circumstances in all operations of this kind . All physiologists , however , agree that the best season for transplanting deciduous trees is in autumn , directly after the /z/ fall of the leaf . The tree is then in a completely doimant state . Transplanted at this early season , whatever wounds may have been made in the roots commence healing at once , as a deposit directly takes place of granulous matter from the wound , and when the spring arrives the tree is already somewhat established , and ready to commence its growth . Autumn planting is for this reason greatly to be preferred in all mild climates , and dry soils ; and even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as the fixed position in the ground , which trees planted then get by the autumnal and early spring rains , gives them an advantage , at the next season of growth , over newly moved trees . On the other hand , in northern portions of the Union , where the winters commence early , and are severe , spring planting is greatly preferred . There , autumn and winter are not mild enough to allow this gradual process of healing and establishing the roots to go on ; for when the ground is frozen to the depth of the roots of a tree , all that slow growth and collection of nutriment by the roots is necessarily at an end . And the more tender sorts of fruit trees , the Peach and Apricot , which are less hardy when newly planted than when their roots are entire , arid well fixed in the soil , are liable to injury in their branches by the cold . The proper time , in such a climate , is as early as the ground is in a fit condition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the buds expand , may as a general rule be considered the best seasons for transplanting . It is true that there are instances of excellent success in planting at all seasons , except midsummer ; and there are many who , from having been once or twice successful in transplanting when trees were nearly in leaf , avow that to be the best season ; not taking into account , that their success was probably entirely owing to a fortunately damp state of the atmosphere at the time , and abundant rains after the experiment was performed . In the middle states , we are frequently liable to a dry period in early summer , directly following the season of removal , and if transplanting is deferred to a late period in spring , many of the trees will perish from drought , before their roots become established in the soil . Spring planting should , therefore , always be performed as soon as possible , that the roots may have the great benefit of the early and abundant rains of that season , and get well started before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NewYork , therefore , the best periods are , from the fall of the leaf , to the middle of November , in autumn ; and , from the close of winter , to the middle of April , in the spring ; though commonly , the seasons of removal are frequently extended a month beyond these limits . Taking up the trees is an important part of the operation . A transplanter should never forget that it is by the delicate and tender points or extremities of the root that trees take up their /z/ food ; and that the chance of complete success is lessened , by every one of these points that is bruised or destroyed . If we could remove trees with every fibre entire , as we do a plant in a pot , they would scarcely show any sign of their change of position . In most cases , especially in that of trees taken from nurseries , this is , by the operation of removal , nearly impossible . But although we may not hope to get every root entire , we may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , and more particularly the small and delicate fibres . After being taken up , they should be planted directly ; or , if this can not be done , they should be kept from drying by a covering of mats , and when sent to a distance by being packed in damp moss. * Preparing the places . Here is the fatal stumbling block of all novices and ignorant persons in transplanting . An English gardener , when he is about to plant fruit trees , talks about preparing his borders , an American says he will dig his holes ; and we can not give a more forcible illustration of the ideas of two persons as to the wants of a fruit tree , or a better notion of the comparative provision made to supply these wants , than by contrasting the two phrases themselves . The one looks upon a tree as a living being , whose life is to be rendered long , vigorous , and fruitful by a good supply of food , and a soil mellow and easily penetrated by the smallest fibre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a truncheon or a post , which he thrusts into the smallest possible hole , and supplies with the least portion of manure , trusting to what he seems to believe the inextinguishable powers of nature to make roots and branches under any circumstances . It is true that the terms differ somewhat from the nature of the culture and the greater preparation necessary in planting fruit trees in England , but this is not by any means sufficient to justify the different modes of performing the same operation there and here . In truth , in this country , where the sun and climate are so favourable , where pruning and training are comparatively so little necessary , the great requisite to success in the ordinary culture of fruit trees is the proper preparation of the soil before a tree is planted . Whether a transplanted tree shall struggle several years to recover , or grow moderately after a short time , or at once start into a very luxuriant and vigorous growth , depends entirely upon the amount of care and labor the planter is willing to bestow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several instances where , side by side , one man planted his trees in large spaces of deeply moved and rich soil , and another in * We should notice an important exception to this in the case of trees packed for shipping across the Atlantic . In this case they should be packed only in dry moss ; the moisture of the sea air being sufficient to keep the roots in good condition , while if packed in damp moss they will be injured by rotting or excessive growth . /z/ small holes in the common mode , which uniformly showed the irees of the first , larger after five years , than those of the last , after twelve . No fruit tree should be planted in a hole of less size than three feet square , and eighteen inches to two feet deep . To this size and depth the soil should be removed and well pulverized , and it should if necessary be properly enriched by the application of manure , which must be thorough mixed with the whole mass of prepared soil by repeated turnings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most skilful cultivators among us make their spaces four or five feet in diameter , or three times the size of the roots , and it is incredible how much the luxuriance and vigour of growth , even in a poor soil , is promoted by this . No after mending of the soil , or top dressings applied to the surface , can , in a climate of dry summers like ours , equal the effects of this early and deep loosening and enriching the soil . Its effects on the growth and health of the tree are permanent , and the little expense and care necessary in this preparation is a source of early and constant pleasure to the planter . This preparation may be made just before the tree is planted , but , in heavy soils , it is much better to do it several months previously ; and no shallow ploughing of the soil can obviate the necessity and advantages of the practice , where healthy , vigorous orchards or fruit gardens are desired . The whole art of transplanting , after this , consists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most favourable position for growth . Begin by filling the hole with the prepared soil , within as many inches of the top as will allow the tree to stand exactly as deep as it previously stood . With the spade , shape this soil for the roots in the form of a little hillock on which to place the roots and not , as is commonly done , in the form of a hollow ; the roots will then extend in their natural position , not being forced to turn up at the ends . Next examine the roots , and cut off all wounded parts , paring the wound smooth . Hold the tree upright on its little mound in the hole of prepared soil ; extend the roots and cover them carefully with the remaining pulverized soil . As much of the success of transplanting depends on bringing the soil in contact with every fibre , so as to leave no hollows to cause the decay of the roots , not only must this be secured by patiently filling-in all cavities among the roots , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pour in a pail of water when the roots are nearly all covered with soil . This carries the liquid mould to every hidden part . After the water has settled away , fill up the hole , pressing the earth gently about the tree with the foot , but avoiding the common practice of shaking it up and down by the stem . In windy situations it will be necessary to place a stake by the side of each tree to hold it upright , until it shall have taken firm root in the soil , but it is not needful in ordinary cases . /z/ Avoid deep planting . More than half the losses in orchard planting in America arises from this cause , and the equally common one of crowding the earth too tightly about the roots . No tree should be planted deeper than it formerly grew , as its roots are stifled from the want of air , or starved by the poverty of the soil at the depth where they are placed . It is much the better and more natural process in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole is complete , appear just as deep as before , but standing on a little mound two or three inches higher than the level of the ground about . This , when the mound settles , will leave it nearly on the level with the previous surface . Mulching is an excellent practice with transplanted trees , and more especially for those which are removed late in the spring . Mulching is nothing more than covering the ground about the stems with coarse straw , or litter from the barn-yard , which by preventing evaporation keeps the soil from becoming dry , and maintains it in that moist and equable condition of temperature most favourable to the growth of young roots . Very many trees , in a dry season , fail at midsummer , after having made a fine start , from the parched and variable condition of the earth about the roots . Watering , frequently fails to save such trees , but mulching when they are planted will entirely obviate the necessity of watering in dry seasons , and promote growth under any circumstances . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most injurious practice , as the roots stimulated at one period of the day by water , are only rendered more susceptible to the action of the hot sun at another , and the surface of the ground becomes so hard , by repeated watering , that the beneficial access of the air is almost cut off . If trees are well watered in the holes , while transplanting is going on , they will rarely need it again , and we may say never , if they are well mulched directly after planting . The lest manure to be used in preparing the soil for transplanting trees is a compost formed of two thirds muck or black peat earth , reduced by fermenting it several months in a heap with one third fresh barn-yard manure . Almost every farm will supply this , and it is more permanent in its effects , and less drying in its nature , than the common manure of the stable . An admirable manure , recently applied with great success , is charcoal the small broken bits and refuse of the charcoal pits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent manure for fruit trees in soils that are not naturally calcareous . Two or three handsful may be mixed with the soil when preparing each space for planting , and a top dressing may be applied with advantage occasionally afterwards , to increase their productiveness . But wherever large orchards or fruit gardens are to be planted , the muck compost heap should be made ready beforehand , as it is the cheapest , most valuable , and durable of all manures for fruit trees . /z/ Pruning the heads of transplanted trees , at the season of removal , we think generally an injurious practice . It is certainly n-eedless and hurtful in the case of small trees , or those of such a size as will allow the roots to be taken up nearly entire ; for , as the action of the branches and the roots is precisely reciprocal , and as new roots are rapidly formed just in proportion to the healthy action of the leaves , it follows that by needlessly cutting off branches we lessen the vital action of the whole tree . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large a size that some of the roots are lost in removing them , it is necessary to cut back or shorten a few of the branches as many as will restore the balance of the system otherwise the perspiration of the leaves may be so great , as to exhaust the supply of sap faster than the roots can collect it . A little judgment only is necessary , to see at a glance , how much of the top must be pruned away before planting the tree , to equalize the loss between the branches and the roots . When it is necessary to transplant fruit trees of large size , the best practice is to prepare them previously by digging a trench round the whole mass of roots , undermining them , and cutting off all roots projecting beyond this line . The trench should be dug at such a distance from the tree as will include all the large and sufficient ball of roots , and it should be done in the spring , or before midsummer , when it is desirable to remove the tree the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this circular trench are cut off , the earth is replaced , and by the season following an abundance of small fibres is sent out by the amputated roots , which , when the whole is now removed , will insure the success and speedy growth of the tree . This is more completely the case when the tree is prepared two years before transplanting . A variation of this mode , which has been found quite as successful and less laborious , consists in leaving the trench open , and covering it with boards only , or boards with a top layer of turf . The tree then is somewhat checked in its growth , it throws out an abundance of small fibres into the ball of earth containing the roots , and is the next season transplanted with great ease and safety . The proper size for transplanting varies somewhat with the sort of tree , and the kind of culture intended . It is , however , a maxim equally well settled , both among theorists and the best practical men , that health , immediate vigour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees of small size from three to six or seven feet . We are fully aware with what impatience the beginner , or a person who knows little of the culture of trees , looks upon trees of this size one who is eager to plant an orchard , and stock a garden with large trees , thinking to gather a crop the next year . The latter may indeed be done , but the transplanting so affects the tree , that its first scanty crop /z/ is followed by a long season of rest , and feeble growth , while the plantation of young trees is making wood rapidly , and soon comes into a healthy and long-continued state of productiveness often long indeed before the large trees have fairly arrived at that condition . The small tree , transplanted with its system of roots and branches entire , suffers little or no check ; the older and larger tree , losing part of its roots , requires several years to resume its former vigour . The constitution of the small tree is healthy and unimpaired ; that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit what the nurserymen call a good stocky plant is the true criterion of merit in selecting fruit trees for transplanting . Trees intended for orchards , being often more exposed than those in gardens , should be somewhat larger not less than six , or more than eight feet is the best size . For gardens , all experienced cultivators agree that a smaller size is preferable ; we prefer plants two years old from the graft . Most gardeners abroad , when they select trees with more than usual care , take what are called maiden plants those one year old from the graft , and there can be no doubt that , taking into account health , duration , and the ease with which such a tree can be made to grow into any form , this is truly the preferable size for removal into a fruit garden . But we are an impatient people , and it is not till another after century of trial and experience in the culture of fruit trees , that cultivators generally in this country will become aware of the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees may be transplanted differs considerably . Plums are generally removed with most success and after them nearly in the order as follows : Quinces , Apples , Pears , Peaches , Nectarines , Apricots , and Cherries ; the latter succeeding with some difficulty when of large size . Laying-in ty the heels is a practice adopted as a temporary kind of planting , when a larger quantity of trees is at hand than can be set out immediately . A trench is opened , and the roots are laid in and covered with soil , the tops being previously placed in a sloping position , inclining to within a few feet of the surface . In this way they are kept fresh and in good order , until it is convenient to plant them finally . In northern districts , where the autumn is often too severe for planting , and the spring is frequently too late to receive trees in time from nurseries farther south , it is a common and successful mode to procure trees in autumn and lay them in by the heels until spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary with coarse litter . In planting an orchard , always avoid placing the trees in the same spot or near where an old tree stood before . Experience has taught us that the growth of a young tree , in such a position , is weak and feeble ; the nourishment suitable to that kind /z/ of tree having already been exhausted by a previous growth , and the soil being half ' filled with old and decayed roots which are detrimental to the health of the young tree . /z/ IN our favourable climate many fruit trees will thrive and produce some fruit in almost any soil , except dry sand , or wet swamps . But there is much to be gained in all climates by a judicious selection of soil , when this is in our power , or by that improvement which may generally be effected in inferiour soils where we are necessarily limited to such . As we shall , in treating the culture of each genus of fruit , state more in detail the soils especially adapted to its growth , our remarks here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the orchard and fruit garden . The soils usually selected for making plantations of fruit trees may be divided into light sandy loams , gravelly loams , strong loams , and clayey loams ; the first having a large proportion of sand , and the last a large proportion of clay . The soil most inviting to the eye is a light sandy loam , and , as it is also a very common soil , more than half the fruit gardens in the country are composed of this mould . The easy manner in which it is worked , owing to its loose and very friable nature , and the rapidity with which , from its warmth , crops of all kinds come into bearing , cause it to be looked upon with almost universal favour . Notwithstanding this , a pretty careful observation , for several years , has convinced us that a light sandy soil is , on the whole , the worst soil for fruit trees . Under the bright skies of July and August , a fruit tree requires a soil which will retain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here the sandy soil fails . In consequence of this the vigour of the tree is checked , and it becomes feeble in its growth , and is comparatively short-lived , or unproductive . As a tree in a feeble state is always most liable to the attacks of insects , those on a sandy soil are the first to fall a prey to numerous maladies. * The open loose texture of a sandy soil , joined to its warmth , affords an easy passage , and an excellent habitation for all insects that pass part of their lives in the ground , preparatory to /z/ rising out of it to attack the fruit , foliage , or branches of the tree . Such are some of the disadvantages of a light sandy soil ; and , in thoroughly examining many of the fruit gardens of the middle states the last few seasons , we could not fail to be struck with the fact that in nine cases out of ten , where a variety of fruit was unusually liable to disease , to blight , or to the attacks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves were on sandy soils ; while on the other hand , and frequently in the same neighbourhood , the same sorts were growing luxuriantly and bearing abundant crops , where the soil was a rather strong loam. * For a few years , the growth and productiveness of the trees upon sandy soil , is all that can be desired ; but the trees are shorter lived and sooner fall into decay than where the soil is stronger . If there is any exception to this rule , it is only in the case of the Peach , and judging from the superiour flavour of this fruit on stronger soils , we are inclined to doubt the value of the exception even here . Gravelly loams are frequently much better adapted for orchards than sandy , especially where the loam is of a strong quality , and the gravel is not in excess ; and the hardier fruits usually do well on this kind of soil . Strong loams , by which we mean a loam with only just a sufficient portion of sand to make it easily worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens in this country . A strong loam is usually a deep soil , and affords during the whole heat of summer , a proper supply of moisture and nourishment to the roots of trees . Fruit trees do not come into a bearing state so soon in a strong as in a sandy loam , because the growth of wood is more vigorous , and fruit buds are not so soon formed ; but they bear larger crops , are much less liable to many diseases , and their longevity is much greater . The largest and most productive orchards of the apple and pear in this country are upon soils of this kind . Clayey loams are , when well drained , and when the clay is not in excess , good fruit soils they are usually strong and deep soils though rather heavy and difficult to work . Trees that will flourish on these soils such as the Apple , Pear , Cherry , Plum , and Apricot , usually are very free from disease , or insects , and bear large crops . In a moist climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clayey loam would die of canker , brought on by the excessive quantity of water contained in the soil , but such is * As an instance in point , the owner of one of the most highly cultivated gardens in the vicinity of Boston was showing us , in despair , some trees of the Seckel pear upon which he could no longer get good crops , or fair fruit , and lamenting the degeneracy of the sort . The next day we saw in a neighbouring garden beautiful crops of this pear growing with the least possible care . The garden in the first case was a light sandy loam ; in the second , a strong loam . /z/ not the case under the high and warm temperature of our sum . mers . The finest , largest , and most productive Plums and Pears within our knowledge , grow in sites on the North river , when the soil is a stiff clayey loam , almost approaching a clay . Those fruits that on light sandy soils are almost worthless from their liability to disease , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitful . It is , however , well to remark , that some varieties of fruit , perhaps from the circumstances of their origin , succeed better on sandy soils than any other ; thus the Newtown pippin will only arrive at perfection in a strong loam , while the Yellow Bellflower is finer when grown on a sandy soil . But these are exceptions to all rules , and what we have already stated , as to the relative quality of soils , will apply pretty generally to the whole of this country south of the Mohawk river ; and it may be added that calcareous soils , of whatever texture , are better than soils of the same quality where no limestone is present . Trenching is the most complete method of improving a soil too sandy , when the subsoil below is of a loamy or clayey nature . Deep subsoil ploughing , by bringing up a sufficient quantity of the stratum below , will answer the same purpose . When the subsoil of a sandy soil is sand or gravel , the surface can only be improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Top-dressing with clay is the most simple means of changing the nature of such a soil , and it is surprising how moderate a quantity of clay will give a closer texture to light sandy soils . In manuring such soils , we may greatly improve their nature as well as condition , by using composts of peat or bog earth , swamp muck , or river mud , instead of common barn-yard or stable manure . The former are not only more permanent and better as manures for fruit trees , but they gradually consolidate and improve the whole texture of the soil . Indeed no fruit garden , where the soil is not naturally deep and rich , is in perfect condition for planting trees , unless the soil has been well trenched two spades in depth . This creates a matrix for the roots , so deep and permanent , that they retain their vigour and luxuriance through the droughts of summer , and continue for a long time in a state of health and productiveness . It is difficult to give any precise rules as to aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects . Perhaps the very best aspect , on the whole , is a gentle slope to the southwest , because in such positions the trees , when in blossom , are somewhat protected from the bad effects of a morning sun after spring frosts . But , to remedy this more perfectly , it is sometimes the practice to plant on the north sides of hills , and this is an effectual way where early frosts are fatal , and where the season is long and warm enough to ripen the fruit in any exposure . A /z/ due south slope , is , south of New- York , frequently found too warm for many fruit trees , in soils that are light and dry . Deep vallies , with small streams of water , are the worst situations for fruit trees , as the cold air settles down in these vallies in a calm frosty night , and buds and blossoms are very frequently destroyed . We know a rich and fertile valley of this kind in Connecticut where the Cherry will scarcely grow , and a crop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once in ten years ; while the adjacent hill tops and high country , a couple or three miles distant , yield abundant crops annually . On the other hand the borders of large rivers , as the Hudson , or of some of our large inland lakes , are the most favourable situations for fruit trees , as the climate is rendered milder by large bodies of water . In the garden where we write , a fourth of a mile from the Hudson , we have frequently seen ice formed during the night , of the thickness of a dollar , when the blossoms of the Apricot were fully expanded , without doing the least harm to that tender fruit . This is owing to the slight fog rising from the river in the morning , which , softening the rays of the sun , and dissolving gradually the frost , prevents the injurious effects of sudden thawing . At the same time , a couple of miles from the shores , this fruit will often be quite destroyed . In short , the season on the lower half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river , be said to be a month longer a fortnight earlier in spring , and later in autumn , than in the same latitude a few miles distant ; and crops of the more tender fruits are , therefore , much more certain on the banks of large rivers or lakes , than in inland districts of the same climate . /z/ THE insects injurious to fruit trees are numerous , and to combat them successfully requires a minute acquaintance with their character and habits . While considering the culture of each class of fruit in the succeeding pages , we shall point out the habits , and suggest means of destroying the most important of these insects ; but , in the meantime , we wish to call attention to some general practical hints on this subject . In the first place , we can not too strongly impress upon the attention of the fruit grower the importance of watching carefully , and making an early attack , upon every species of insect . It is only necessary to look for a moment at the astonishing rapid- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if allowed to get well established in a garden , to become fully aware of this . The common caterpillars are the young of moths or butterflies , and that careful observer of the habits of insects , Dr. Harris , says as each female lays from two to five hundred eggs , a thousand moths or butterflies will , on the average , produce three hundred thousand caterpillars ; if one half this number , when arrived at maturity , are females , they will give forty-five millions of caterpillars in the second , and six thousand seven hundred and fifty millions in the third generation. * To take another example the aphides , or plant lice , which are frequently seen in great numbers on the tender shoots of fruit trees have an almost incredibly prolific power of increase , the investigations of Reaumur having shown that one individual , in five generations , may become the progenitor of nearly six thousand millions of descendants . With such surprising powers of propagation , were it not for the havoc caused among insects by various species preying upon each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by unfavourable seasons , vegetation would soon be entirely destroyed by them . As it is , the orchards and gardens of careless and slovenly cultivators are often overrun by them , and many of the finest crops suffer great injury , or total loss from the want of a little timely care . In all well managed plantations of fruit , at the first appearance of any injurious insect , it will be immediately seized upon and destroyed . A few moments , in the first stage of insect life at the first birth of the new colony will do more to rid us for the season , of that species , than whole days of toil after the matter has been so long neglected that the enemy has become well established . We know how reluctant all , but the experienced grower , are to set about eradicating what at first seems a thing of such trifling consequence . But such persons should consider that whether it is done at first , or a fortnight after , is frequently the difference between ten and ten thousand . A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects , will keep a large place quite free from them . We know a very large garden , filled with trees , and always remarkably free from insect ravages , which , while those even in its vicinity suffer greatly , is thus preserved , by half an hour 's examination of the whole premises two days in the week during the growing season . This is made early in the morning , the best time for the purpose , as the insects are quiet while the dew is yet upon the leaves , and whole races , yet only partially developed , may be swept off in a single moment . In default of other more rapid expedients , the old mode of hand-picking , and crushing or burring , is the safest and surest that can be adopted . /z/ For practical purposes , the numerous insects infesting fruit trees may be divided into four classes ; 1st , those which for a time harbour in the ground and may be attacked in the soil ; 2d , winged and other species , which may be attacked among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which infest the young shoots ; 4th , moths , and all night-flying insects . Insects , the larva , or grubs of which harbour in the ground during a certain season , as the curculio or plum- weevil , are all more or less affected by the application of common salt as a top dressing . On a larger scale in farm crops the ravages of the cut- worm are frequently prevented by sowing three bushels of salt to the acre , and we have seen it applied to all kinds of fruit grounds with equal success . Salt seems to be strongly disagreeable to nearly all this class of insects , and the grubs perish , where even a small quantity has for two or three seasons been applied to the soil . In a neighbourhood where the peach worm usually destroys half the peach trees , and where whole crops of the plum are equally a victim to the plum- weevil , we have seen the former preserved in the healthiest condition by an annual application of a small handful of coarse salt about the collar of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter , made to hold abundant crops , by a top dressing applied every spring of packing salt , at the rate of a quart to the surface occupied by the roots of every full grown tree . Salt , being a powerful agent , must be applied for this purpose with caution and judgment . In small quantities it promotes the verdure and luxuriance of fruit trees , while if applied very frequently , or too plentifully , it will certainly cause the death of any tree . Two or three years top-dressing in moderate quantity will usually be found sufficient to drive away these insects , and then the application need only be repeated once in two or three seasons . Any coarse , refuse salt will answer the purpose ; and packing salt is preferable to that of finer quality , as it dissolves slowly by the action of the atmosphere . In the winged state , most small insects may either be driven away by powerful odours , or killed by strong decoctions of to . bacco , or a wash of diluted whale-oil or other strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repugnance of all insects , to strong odours , and there is but little doubt that before a long time , it will lead to the discovery of the means of preventing the attacks of most insects by means of strong smelling liquids or odourous substances . The moths that attack furs , as every one knows , are driven away by pepper-corns or tobacco , and should future experiments prove that at certain seasons , when our trees are most likely to be attacked by insects , we may expel them by hanging bottles or rags filled with strong smelling liquids in our trees , it will certainly be a very simple and easy way of ridding ourselves of them . The brown scale , a trouble- /z/ some enemy of the orange tree , it is stated in the Gardener 's Chronicle have been destroyed by hanging plants of the common chamomile among its branches . The odour of the coal tar of gas works is exceedingly offensive to some insects injurious to fruits , and it has been found to drive away the wire worm , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil of turpentine is fatal to wasps , and that of tobacco smoke to the green fly . Little as yet is certainly known respecting the exact power of the various smells in deterring insects from attacking trees . What we do know , however , gives us reason to believe that much may be hoped from experiments made with a variety of powerful smelling substances . Tobacco water , and diluted whale oil soap , are the two most efficient remedies for all the small insects which feed upon the young shoots and leaves of plants . Tobacco water is made by boiling tobacco leaves , or the refuse stems and stalks of the tobacco shops . A large pot is crowded full of them , and then filled up with water , which is boiled till a strong decoction is made . This is applied to the young shoots and leaves with a syringe , or , when the trees are growing in nursery rows , with a common white-wash brush ; dipping the latter in the liquid and shaking it sharply over extremities or the infested part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap-suds , or a mixture of both , will kill every species of plant lice , and nearly all other small insects to which young fruit trees are subject . The wash of whale oil soap is made by mixing two pounds of this soap , which is one of the cheapest and strongest kinds , with fifteen gallons of water . This mixture is applied to the leaves and stems of plants with a syringe , or in any other convenient mode , and there are few of the smaller insects that are not desroyed or driven away by it . The merit of this mixture belongs to Mr. David Haggerston , of Boston , who first applied it with great success to the rose slug , and received the premium of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society for its discovery . When this soap can not be obtained , a good substitute may be made by turning into soap the lees of common oil casks , by the application of potash and water in the usual way . Moths and other insects which fly at night are destroyed in large numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of France . A flat saucer or vessel is set on the ground in which is placed a light , partially covered with a common bell glass besmeared with oil . All the small moths are directly attracted by the light , fly towards it , and , in their attempts to get at the light , are either caught by the glutinous sides of the bell glass , or fall into the basin of oil beneath , and in either case soon perish . M. Adouin applied this to the destruction of the pyraHs , a moth that is very troublesome in the French vineyards ; with two hundred of these lights in a vineyard of four /z/ acres , and in a single night , 30,000 moths were killed and found dead on or about the vessels . By continuing his process through the season , it was estimated that he had destroyed female moths sufficient to have produced a progeny of over a million of caterpillars . In our orchards , myriads of insects may be destroyed by lighting small bonfires of shavings , or any refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worm-eaten , if repeated two or three nights at the proper season , this is a very efficient and cheap mode of getting rid of the moth which causes so much mischief . Dr. Harris , knowing how important it is to destroy the caterpillar in the moth state , has recommended flambeaux , made of tow wound round a stake and dipped in tar , to be stuck in the fruit garden at night and lighted . Thousands of moths will find a speedy death , even in the short time which these flambeaux are burning . The melon-bug may be extirpated by myriads , in the same way . A simple and most effectual mode of ridding the fruit garden of insects of every description , which we recommend as a general extirpator , suited to all situations , is the following . Take a number of common bottles , the wider mouthed the better , and fill them about half full of a mixture of water , molasses , and vinegar . Suspend these among the branches of trees , and in various parts of the garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects , of every description not too large to enter the bottles wasps , flies , beetles , slugs , grubs , and a great variety of others . The bottles must now be emptied , and the liquid renewed . A zealous amateur of our acquaintance , caught last season in this way , more than three bushels of insects of various kinds ; and what is more satisfactory , preserved his garden almost entirely against their attacks in any shape . The assistance of birds in destroying insects should be duly estimated by the fruit-grower . The quantity of eggs and insects in various states , devoured annually by birds , when they are encouraged in gardens , is truly surprising . It is true that one or two species of these , as the ring-tail , annoy us by preying upon the earlier cherries , but even taking this into account , we are inclined to believe that we can much better spare a reasonable share of a few fruits , than dispense with the good services of birds in ridding us of an excess of insects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wren , the red-breast , and , in short , most of the birds of this class . All these birds should be encouraged to build nests and inhabit the fruit garden , and this may most effectually be done by not allowing a gun to be fired within its boundaries . The introduction of hedges or live fences , greatly promotes the domestication of birds , as they afford an admirable shelter for their nests . Our own gardens are usually much more free from insects than those a mile or two distant , and we attribute this in part to our practice /z/ of encouraging birds , and to the thorn and arbor vitse hedges growing here , and which are greatly resorted to by those of the feathered tribe which are the greatest enemies of the insect race . Among animals , the toad and the bat are great insect destroyers . The common bat lives almost entirely upon them , and in its evening sallies devours a great number of moths , beetles , weevils , etc. ; and the toad quietly makes way with numberless smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ botanists . Pommier , of the French j Apfdbaum , German ; Apfel , Dutch ; Mdo porno , Italian ; and Manzana , Spanish . THE Apple is the world-renowned fruit of temperate climates . From the most remote periods it has been the subject of praise among writers and poets , and the old mythologies all endow its fruit with wonderful virtues . The allegorical tree of knowledge bore apples , and the celebrated golden fruit of the orchards of Hesperus , guarded by the sleepless dragon which it was one of the triumphs of Hercules to slay , were also apples , according to the old legends . Among the heathen gods of the north , there were apples fabled to possess the power of conferring immortality , which were carefully watched over by the goddess Iduna , and kept for the especial dessert of the gods who felt themselves growing old ! As the mistletoe grew chiefly on the apple and the oak , the former tree was looked upon with great respect and reverence by the ancient Druids of Britain , and even to this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saluting the apple trees in the orchards , in the hope of obtaining a good crop the next year , still lingers among the farmers of portions of Devonshire and Herefordshire . This odd ceremony consists of saluting the tree with a portion of the contents of a wassail bowl of cider , with a toast in it , by pouring a little of the cider about the roots , and even hanging a bit of the toast on the branches of the most barren , the farmer and his men dancing in a circle round the tree , and singing rude songs like the following : " Here 's to thee , old apple tree , Whence thou mayst bud , and whence thou mayst blow ; And whence thou mayst bear apples enow , Hats full ! caps fullBushels and sacksfull ! Huz/.a ! " /z/ The species of crab from which all our sorts of Apples have originated , is wild in most parts of Europe . There are indeed two or three kinds of wild crab belonging to this country ; as the Pyrus coronaria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diameter grows in many parts of the United States ; and the wild crab of Oregon , P. rivularis , bearing a reddish yellow fruit about the size of a cherry , which the Chenook Indians use as an article of food ; yet none of our cultivated varieties of apple have been raised from these native crabs , but from seeds of the species brought here by the colonists from Europe . The Apple tree is , however , most perfectly naturalized in America , and in the northern and middle portions of the United States succeeds as well , or , as we believe , better than in any part of the world . The most celebrated apples of Germany and the north of Europe , are not superiour to many of the varieties originated here , and the American or Newtown Pippin is now pretty generally admitted to be the finest apple in the world . No better proof of the perfect adaptation of our soil and climate to this tree can be desired , than the seemingly spontaneous production of such varieties as this , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicious flavour and great beauty of appearance . The Apple is usually a very hardy and rather slow growing fruit tree , with a low spreading , rather irregular head , and bears an abundance of white blossoms tinged with red . In a wild state it is very long-lived , but the finest garden sorts usually live about fifty or eighty years ; though by proper care , they may be kept healthy and productive much longer . Although the apple generally forms a tree of medium growth , there are many specimens in this country of enormous size . Among others we recollect two in the grounds of Mr. Hall of Raynham , Rhode Island , which , ten years ago , were 130 years old ; the trunk of one of these trees then measured , at one foot from the ground , thirteen feet two inches , and the other twelve feet two inches . The trees bore that season about thirty or forty bushels , but in the year 1780 they together bore one hundred and one bushels of apples . In Duxbury , Plymouth county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures twelve feet five inches , and which has yielded in a single season 121 bushels . USES OF THE APPLE . No fruit is more universally liked or generally used than the apple . It is exceedingly wholesome , and , medicinally , is considered cooling , and laxative , and useful in all inflammatory diseases . The finest sorts are much esteemed for the dessert , and the little care required in its culture , renders it the most abundant of all fruits in temperate climates . As the earliest sorts ripen about the last of June , and the latest can be preserved until that season , it may be considered as a fruit in perfection the whole year . Besides its merits for the /z/ dessert , the value of the apple is still greater for the kitchen , and in sauces , pies , tarts , preserves , and jellies , and roasted and boiled , this fruit is the constant and invaluable resource of the kitchen . Apple butter , made by stewing pared and sliced sweet apples in new cider until the whole is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food in many farmers ' families , and is frequently made by the barrel , in Connecticut . In France , nearly the same preparation is formed by simmering apples in new wine , until the whole becomes a sort of marmalade , which is called Raisine . The juice of the apple un fermented , is , in some parts of the country , boiled down till it becomes molasses . When fermented it forms cider , and if this is carefully made from the best cider apples , it is nearly equal to wine ; in fact many hundreds of barrels , of the cider of New-Jersey , have been manufactured in a single year , into an imitation Champagne , which is scarcely distinguished by many from that made from the grape . Dried apples are also a considerable article of commerce . Farmers usually pare and quarter them by hand , and dry them in the sun ; but those who pursue it as a matter of trade pare them by machinery , and dry them slowly in ovens . They are then packed in bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sea stores , or are exported . In perfumery , the pulp of this fruit , mixed intimately with lard , forms pomatum . The wood is employed for lasts , and for other purposes by turners ; and being fine grained and compact is sometimes stained black , and used for ebony , by cabinet makers . The quality of an apple is always judged of by the use to which it is to be applied . A table or dessert apple of the finest quality should be of medium size , regular form and fine colour ; and the flesh should be fine-grained , crisp , or tender , and of a sprightly or rich flavour , and aroma . Very large sized , or coarse apples are only admired by persons who have little knowledge of the true criterion of excellence . Apples for kitchen use should have the property of cooking evenly into a tender pulpy consistence , and are generally acid in flavour ; and , although there are many good cooking apples unfit for the table , many sorts , as the Fall Pippin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this we may add that for the common applesauce made by farmers a high flavoured sweet apple , which boils somewhat firm , is preferred , as this is generally made with cider . The very common use made of this cheap preserve at the north and west , and the recent practice of fattening hogs , horses , and other animals upon sweet apples , accounts for the much greater number of varieties of sweet apples held in esteem here than in any other country . In fact , so excellent has the saccharine matter of the apple been found for this purpose , that whole orchards /z/ of sweet apples unfrequently planted here for the purposes of fattening swine and cattle , which are allowed to run at large in them . Cider apples are varieties frequently useless for any other purpose . The best for this purpose are rather tough , piquant , and astringent ; their juice has a high specific quality , and they are usually great bearers ; as the Harrison , the Red Streak , and the Virginia Crab . PROPAGATION . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pomace of the cider mills , and a preference is always given to that from thrifty young orchards . These are sown in autumn , in broad drills , in good mellow soil , and they remain in the seed buds , attention being paid to keeping the soil loose and free from weeds , from one to three years , according to the richness of the soil . When the seedlings are a little more than a fourth of an inch in diameter , they should be taken up , in the spring or autumn , their tap roots shortened , and then planted in nursery rows , one foot apart and three to four feet between the rows . If the plants are thrifty , and the soil good , they may be budded the following autumn , within three or four inches of the ground , and this is the most speedy mode of obtaining strong , straight , thrifty plants . Grafting is generally performed when the stocks are about half an inch thick ; and for several modes of performing it on the apple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When young trees are feeble in the nursery , it is usual to head them back two thirds the length of the graft , when they are three or four feet high , to make them throw up a strong vigorous shoot . Apple stocks for dwarfs are raised by layers , as pointed out in the article on Layers . Apple trees for transplanting to orchards should be at least two years budded , and six or seven feet high , and they should have a proper balance of head or side branches . SOIL AND SITUATION . The apple will grow on a great variety of soils , but it seldom thrives on very dry sands , or soils saturated with moisture . Its favourite soil , in all countries , is a strong loam of a calcareous or limestone nature . A deep , strong gravelly , marly , or clayey loam , or a strong sandy loam on a gravelly subsoil , produces the greatest crops , and the highest flavoured fruit , as well as the utmost longevity of the trees . Such a soil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fruit . Too damp soils may often be rendered fit for the apple by thorough draining , and too dry ones by deep subsoil ploughing , or trenching , where the subsoil is of a heavier texture . And many apple orchards in New-England are very flourishing and productive on soils so stony and rock-covered ( though naturally fertile ) as to be unfit for any other crop. * /z/ As regards site , apple orchards flourish best , in southern and middle portions of the country , on north slopes , and often even on the steep north sides of hills , where the climate is hot and dry . Farther north a southern or southeastern aspect is preferable , to ripen the crop and the wood more perfectly . We may here remark that almost every district of the country has one or more varieties which , having had its origin there , seems also to flourish more perfectly in that than in any other locality . Thus the Newtown pippin , and the Spitzenburgh are the great apples of New- York ; the Baldwin , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rambo , of Pennsylvania and New-Jersey ; and the Peck 's Pleasant and the Seek-no-further , of Connecticut ; and though these apples are cultivated with greater or less success in other parts of the country , yet nowhere is their flavour and productiveness so perfect as in the best soils of their native districts . This will account for the variety of opinions , respecting the comparative merits of different fruits in different states and localities . PLANTING AND CULTIVATION OF ORCHARDS . With the exception of a few early and very choice sorts in the fruit garden , the orchard is the place for this tree , and indeed , when we consider the great value and usefulness of apples to the farmer , it is easy to see that no farm is complete without a large and well selected apple orchard . The distance at which the trees should be planted in an orchard , depends upon the mode in which they are to be treated . When it is desired finally to cover and devote the whole ground to the trees , thirty feet apart is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land between the trees in gram and grass , fifty feet is not too great a distance in strong soils . Forty feet apart , however , is the usual distance at which the trees are planted in orchards . Before transplanting , the ground should be well prepared for the trees , as we have insisted in a previous page , and vigorous healthy young trees should be selected from the nurseries . As there is a great difference in the natural growth , shape , and size of the various sorts of apple trees , those of the same kinds should be planted in the rows together , or near each other ; this by marl or meadow mud , will be found capable of producing very fine apple trees . Good cultivation , and a system of high manuring , will always remunerate the proprietor of an orchard , except it be planted on a quicksand or a cold clay ; in such Roils , no management can prevent an early decay . One of the most thrifty orchards I possess , was planted on a blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud on ten acres , at an expense of about twenty-five dollars per acre , exclusive of much other manure ; on this land I have raised good wheat and clover . Of five rows of the Winecap apple planted upon it eight years ago , on the summit of a sandy knoll , not one has died out of near an hundred trees all abundant bearers of large and fair apples . View of Fruit Trees , p. 31. /z/ will not only facilitate culture and gathering the fruit , but will add to the neatness and orderly appearance of the orchard . It is an indispensable requisite , in all young orchards , to keep the ground mellow and loose by cultivation ; at least for the first few years , until the trees are well established . Indeed , of two adjoining orchards , one planted and kept in grass , and the other ploughed for the first five years , there will be an incredible difference in favour of the latter . Not only will these trees show rich dark luxuriant foliage , and clean smooth stems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , but the size of the trees in the cultivated orchard will be treble that of the others at the end of this time , and a tree in one will be ready to bear an abundant crop , before the other has commenced yielding a peck of good fruit . Fallow crops are the best for orchards , potatoes , vines , buckwheat , roots , Indian corn , and the like . An occasional crop of grass or grain may be taken ; but clover is rather too coarse-rooted and exhausting for a young orchard . When this , or grass , is necessarily grown among young trees for a year or two , a circle of three feet diameter should be kept loose by digging every season about the stem of each tree . When the least symptom of failure or decay in a bearing orchard is perceived , the ground should have a good top dressing of manure , and of marl , or mild lime , in alternate years . It is folly to suppose that so strong growing a tree as the apple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a few heavy crops of fruit , exhaust the soil of much of its proper food . If we desire our trees to continue in a healthy bearing state , we should , therefore , manure them as regularly as any other crop , and they will amply repay the expense . There is scarcely a farm where the waste of barn-yard manure , the urine , etc. , if properly economized by mixing this animal excrement with the muckheap would not be amply sufficient to keep the orchards in the highest condition . And how many moss-covered , barren orchards , formerly very productive , do we not everyday see , which only require a plentiful new supply of food in a substantial topdressing , thorough scraping of the stems , and washing with diluted soft soap , to bring them again into the finest state of vigour and productiveness. ! The bearing year of the Apple , in common culture , only takes place every alternate year , owing to the excessive crops which it usually produces , by which they exhaust most of the organizable matter laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recover , and collect a sufficient supply again to form fruit buds . When half the fruit is thinned out in a young state , leaving only a moderate crop , the apple , like other fruit trees , will bear every year , as it will also , if the soil is kept in high condition . The bearing year of an apple tree , or a whole orchard may be changed by picking off the fruit when the trees /z/ first show good crops , allowing it to remain only on the alternate seasons which we wish to make the bearing year. * PRUNING . The apple in orchards requires very little pruning if the trees , while the orchard is young , are carefully inspected every year , a little before midsummer , and all crossing branches taken out while they are small . When the heads are once properly adjusted and well balanced , the less the pruning saw and knife are used the better , and the cutting out of dead limbs , and removal sf such as may interfere with others , or too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that an orchard will usually require . But wherever a limb is pruned away , the surface of the wound should be neatly smoothed , and if it exceeds an inch in diameter , it should be covered with the liquid shellac previously noticed , or brushed over with common white lead , taking care with the latter , not to paint the bark also . INSECTS . There are three or four insects that in some parts of the country , are very destructive or injurious to this tree ; a knowledge of the habits of which , is therefore , very important to * One of the finest orchards in America is that of Pelham farm , at Esopus , on the Hudson . It is no less remarkable for the beauty and high flavour of its fruit , than the constant productiveness of trees . The proprietor , R. L. Pell , Esq. , has kindly furnished us with some notes of his experiments on fruit trees , and we subjoin the following highly interesting one on the Apple . " For several years past I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 bearing Newtown Pippin trees . I found it very unprofitable to vait for what is termed the ' bearing year , ' and it has been my aim to assist nature , so as to enable the trees to bear every year . I have noticed that from the excessive productiveness of this tree , it requires the intermediate year to recover its e lfto extract from the earth and the atmosphere the materials to enable it to produce again . This it is not able to do , unassisted by art , while it is loaded with fruit , and the intervening year is lost ; if , however , the tree is supplied with proper food it will bear every year ; at least such has been the result of my experiments . Three years ago , in April , 1 scraped all the rough bark from the ste'ms of several thousand trees in my orchards , and washed all the trunks and limbs within reach with soft soap ; trimmed out all the branches that crossed each other , early in June , and painted the wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay . I then , in the latter part of the same month , slit the bark by running a sharp pointed knife from the ground to the first set of limbs , which prevents the tree from becoming bark bound , and gives the young wood an opportunity of expanding . In July I placed one peck of oyster shell lime under each tree , and left it piled about the trunk until November , during which time the drought was excessive . In November the lime was dug in thoroughly . The following year J collected from these trees 1700 barrels of fruit , part of which was sold in New-York for four , and others in London for nine dollars per barrel . The cider made from the refuse , delivered at the mill - two days after its manufacture , I sold for three dollars and three quarters per barrel of 32 gallons , exclusive of the barrel . In October I manured these trees with stable manure in which the ammonia had been fixed , and covered this immediately with earth . The succeeding autumn they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever saw , while the other trees in my orchard not so treated are quite barren , the last season having been their bearing year . 1 am now placing round each tree one peck of charcoal dust , and propose in the spring to cover it from the compost heap . My soil is a strong , deep , sandy ' . chard grounds , as if there were no trees on them , and ' raise grain of every kind eir My soil is a strong , deep , sandy loam on a gravelly subsoil . I cultivate my or- cept rye , which grain is so very injurious that I believe three successive crops of it would destroy any orchard younger than twenty years . I raised last year in an orchard containing 20 acres , trees 18 years old , a crop of Indian corn which averaged 140 bushels of ears to the acre . " /z/ the orchardist . These are chiefly the borer , the caterpillar , and the canker worm . The apple Borer is , as we usually see it in the trunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fleshy white grub , which enters the tree at the collar , just at the surface of the ground , where the bark is tender , and either girdles the tree or perforates it through every part of the stem , finally causing its death . This grub is the larva , of a brown and white striped beetle , half an inch long , ( Saperda bivittata. ) and it remains in this grub state two or three years , coming out of the tree in a butterfly form early in June flying in the night only , from tree to tree after its food , and finally depositing its eggs during this and the next month , in the collar of the tree . The most effectual mode of destroying the borer , is that of killing it by thrusting a flexible wire as far as possible into its hole . Dr. Harris recommends placing a bit of camphor in the mouth of the aperture and plugging the hole with soft wood . But it is always better to prevent the attack of the borer , by placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small mound of ashes or lime ; and where orchards have already become greatly infested with this insect , the beetles may be destroyed by thousands , in June , by building small bonfires of shavings in various parts of the orchard . The attacks of the borer on nursery trees may , in a great measure , be prevented by washing the stems in May , quite down to the ground with a solution of two pounds of potash in eight quarts of water . The Caterpillar is a great pestilence in the apple orchard . The species which is most troublesome to our fruit trees ( Clisiocampa americana , ) is bred by a sort of lackey moth , different from that most troublesome in Europe , but its habits as a caterpillar are quite as annoying to the orchardist . The moth of our common caterpillar is a reddish brown insect , whose expanded wings measure about an inch and a half . These moths appear in great abundance in midsummer , flying only at night , and often buzzing about the candles in our houses . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry , and they deposit thousands of small eggs about the forks ancl extremities of the young branches . The next season , about the middle of May , these eggs begin to hatch , and the young caterpillars in myriads , come forth weaving their nests or tents in the fork of the branches . If they are allowed by the careless cultivator to go on and multiply , as they soon do , incredibly fast , they will in a few seasons , sometimes in a single year , increase to such an extent as almost to cover the branches . In this caterpillar state they live six or seven weeks , feeding most voraciously upon the leaves , and often stripping whole trees of their foliage . Their effect upon the tree at this period of the season , when the leaves are most important to the health of the tree and /z/ the growth of the fruit , is most deplorable . The crop is stunted , the health of the tree enfeebled , and , if they are allowed to remain unmolested for several seasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrepid and feeble . To destroy the caterpillar various modes are adopted . One of the most effectual is that practised by Mr. Pell in his orchards , which is to touch the nest with a sponge , attached to the end of a pole , and dipped in strong spirits of ammonia ; the sponge should be turned slowly round in the nests , and every insect coming in contact will be instantly killed . This should be done early in the season . Or , they may be brought down and destroyed with a round brush fixed to the end of a pole , and worked about in the nests . On small trees they may be stripped off with the hand , and crushed under the foot ; and by this plain and simple mode , begun in time , with the aid of a ladder , they may in a large orchard be most effectually kept under by a few moments daily labour of a single man . As they do not leave their nests until nine in the morning , the extirpator of caterpillars should always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are all lying quietly in the nests . And let him never forget that he may do more in an hour when he commences early in the season , than he will in a whole day at a later period , when they are thoroughly scattered among the trees . If they are allowed to remain unmolested , they spin their cocoons about the middle of June , and in a fortnight 's time comes forth from them a fresh brood of moths which , if they are not put an end to by bonfires , will again lay the eggs of an infinite number of caterpillars for the next spring . The canker worm , ( Anisoptcryx pometaria , of Harris , ) is in some parts of the country , one of the worst enemies of the apple , destroying also its foliage with great rapidity . It is not yet common here , but in some parts of New-England it has become a serious enemy . The male is a moth with pale , ash-coloured wings with a black dot , a little more than an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash-coloured above , and gray beneath . The canker worm usually rises out of the ground very early in the spring , chiefly in March , as soon as the ground is free from frost ; though a few also find their way up in the autumn . The females having no wings , climb slowly up the trunks of the trees , while the winged males hover about to pair with them . Very soon after this if we examine the trees we shall see the eggs of which every female lays some sixty or a hundred , glued over , closely arranged in rows and placed in the forks of branches and among the young twigs . About the twentieth of May , these eggs are hatched , and the canker worms , dusky brown , or ash-coloured with a yellow stripe , make their appearance and commence preying upon the foliage . When they are abundant INJtTRIOTTS INSECTS . 65 they make rapid progress , and in places , where the colony is firmly established , they will sometimes strip an orchard in a few days , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After feeding about four weeks , they descend into the ground three or four inches , where they remain in a chrysalis form , to emerge again the next season . As the female is not provided with wings , they do not spread very rapidly from one place to another . The attacks upon the canker worm should be chiefly made upon the female , in her way from the ground up the trunk of the tree . The common mode of protecting apple trees is to surround the trunk with a belt or bandage of canvass , four or five inches wide , which is then thickly smeared with tar . In order to prevent the tar from soon becoming dry and hard , a little coarse train oil must be well mixed with it ; and it should be watched and renewed as often as it appears necessary . This tarred belt catches and detains all the females on their upward journey , and prevents them from ascending the tree to lay their eggs . And if kept in order it will very effectually deter and destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary to apply the tarred bandage in October , and let it remain till the last of May , but usually it will be sufficient to use it in the spring . It is probable that a mixture of coal tar and common tar would be the best application ; as it is more offensive and will not so easily dry and become useless , by exposure to the air and sun . Some persons apply the tar directly to the stems of the tree , but this has a very injurious effect upon the trunk . Old India rubber , melted in an iron vessel over a very hot fire , forms a very adhesive fluid which is not affected by exposure to the weather , and is considered , by those who have made use of it , the best substance for smearing the bandages , as being a more effectual barrier , and seldom or never requiring renewal . Mr. Jonathan Dennis , jr . of Portsmouth , Rhode Island , has invented and patented a circular leaden trough , which surrounds the trunk of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ascent of the canker worm . There appear , however , to be two objections to this trough , as it is frequently used ; one , the escape of the oil if not carefully used , which injures the tree ; and the other , the injurious effect of nailing the troughs to the bark or trunk . They should be supported by wedges of wood driven in between the trough and the trunk , and the spaces completely filled up with liquid clay put on with a brush . The insects must be taken out and the oil renewed , from time to time . For districts where the canker worm greatly abounds , this leaden trough is probably the most permanent and effectual remedy yet employed . Experiments made by the Hon. John Lowell , and Professor Peck , of Massachusetts , lead to a belief that if the ground , under /z/ trees which suffer from this insect , is dug and well pulverized to the depth of five inches in October , and a good top dressing of lime applied as far as the branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed . The elm , and linden trees in many places , suffer equally with the apple , from the attacks of the canker worm . The Bark-louse , a dull white oval scale-like insect , about a tenth of an inch long , ( a species of coccus , ) which sometimes appears in great numbers on the stems of young apple and pear trees , and stunts their growth , may be destroyed by a wash of soft soap and water , or the potash solution . The best time to apply these is in the month of June , when the insects are young . The Woolly aphis ( aphis langinera , ) or American blight* is a dreadful enemy of the apple abroad , but is fortunately , very rarely seen as yet , in the United States . It makes its appearance in the form of a minute white down , in the crotches and crevices of the branches , which is composed of a great number of very minute woolly lice , that if allowed , will increase with fearful rapidity , and produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this insect is too easily destroyed . " This is effected by washing the parts with diluted sulphuric acid ; which is formed by mixing $ oz. by measure , of the sulphuric acid of the shops , with 7 oz. of water . It should be rubbed into the parts affected , by means of a piece of rag tied to a stick , the operator taking care not to let it touch his clothes . After the bark of a tree has been washed with this mixture , the first shower will re-dissolve it , and convey it into the most minute crevice , so as effectually to destroy all insects that may have escaped . " ( Loudon 's Magazine IX . p. 336 . ) The Apple worm ( or Codling moth , Carpocapsa pomonana , of European writers , ) is the insect , introduced with the apple tree from Europe , which appears in the early worm-eaten apples and pears , in the form of a reddish white grub , and causes the fruit to fall prematurely from the tree . The perfect insect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large round brown spot on the hinder margin . These moths appear in the greatest numbers in the warm evenings of the 1st of June , and lay their eggs in the eye or blossom-end of the young fruit , especially of the early kinds of apples and pears . In a short time , these eggs hatch , and the grub burrows its way till it reaches the core ; the fruit then ripens prematurely , and drops to the ground . Here the worm leaves the fruit and creeps into the crevices of the bark and hollow of the tree , and spins its cocoon , which * It is not a little singular that this insect which is not indigenous to this country , arid is never seen here except where introduced with imported trees , should be called in England the American blight . It is the most inveterate , enemy of the apple in the north of France and Germany . /z/ usually remains there till the ensuing spring , when the young moth again emerges from it . The readiest way of destroying them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow swine and poultry to run at large in the orchards when the premature fruit is falling ; or otherwise , the fruit may be picked up daily and placed where the worms will be killed . It is said that if an old cloth is placed in the crotch of the tree about the time the fruit begins to drop , the apple worm will make it a retiring place , and thousands may be caught and killed from time to time . As the cocoons are deposited chiefly under the old loose bark , the thorough cultivator will take care , by keeping the trunks of his trees smooth , to afford them little harbour ; and by scraping and washing the trunks early in the spring , to destroy such as may have already taken up their quarters there . When the fruit of orchards is much liable to the attacks of this insect we can not too much insist on the efficacy of small bonfires lighted in the evening , by which myriads of this and all other moths may be destroyed , before they have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blight which occasionally kills suddenly the ends of the limbs of the apple and the quince , appears to be caused by an insect similar to that which produces the fire blight of the pear , and must be treated in the same way as directed for that tree . GATHERING AND KEEPING THE FRTJIT . In order to secure soundness and preservation , it is indispensably necessary that the fruit should be gathered by hand . For winter fruit the gathering is delayed as long as possible , avoiding severe frosts , and the most successful practice with our extensive orchardists is to place the good fruit directly , in a careful manner , in new , tight flour barrels as soon as gathered from the tree . These barrels should be gently shaken while filling , and the head closely pressed in ; they are then placed in a cool shady exposure under a shed open to the air , or on the north side of a building , protected by covering of boards over the top , where they remain for a fortnight , or until the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cool , dry cellar , iu which air can be admitted occasionally in brisk weather . A cellar , for this purpose , should be dug in dry , gravelly , or sandy soil , with , if possible , a slope to the north ; or , at any rate , with openings on the north side for the admission of air very rarely in weather not excessively cold . Here the barrels should be placed on tiers on their sides , and the cellar should be kept as dark as possible . In such a cellar , one of the largest apple growers in Dutchess county is able to keep the Greening apple , which , in the fruit room , usually decays in January , until the 1st of April , in the freshest and finest condition . Some persons place a layer of clean rye straw between every layer of apples , when packing them in the barrels . /z/ Apples are frequently kept by farmers in pits or ridges in the ground , covered with straw and a layer of earth , in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fruit very speedily decays when opened to the air . The English apple growers lay their fruit in heaps , in cool dry cellars , and cover them with straw . When apples are exported , each fruit in the barrel should be wrapped in clean coarse paper , and the barrels should be placed in a dry , airy place , between decks . CIDER . To make the finest cider , apples should be chosen which are especially suited to this purpose . The fruit should be gathered about the first of November , and coarse cloths or straw should be laid under the tree to secure them against bruising when they are shaken from the tree . If the weather is fine the fruit is allowed to lie in heaps in the open air , or in airy sheds or lofts for some time , till it is thoroughly ripened . All immature and rotten fruit should then be rejected , and the remainder ground in the mill as nearly as possible to an uniform mass . This pulp should now remain in the vat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather is cool , in order to heighten the colour and increase the saccharine principle . It is then put into the press ( without wetting the straw , ) from whence the liquor is strained through hair cloth or sieves , into perfectly clean , sweet , sound casks . The casks , with the bung out , are then placed in a cool cellar , or in a sheltered place in the open air . Here the fermentation commences , and as the pomace and froth work out of the bung-hole , the casks must be filled up every day with some of the same pressing , kept in a cask for this purpose . In two or three weeks this rising will cease , when the first fermentation is over , and the bung should , at first , be put in loosely then , in a day or two , driven in tight leaving a small vent hole near it , which may also be stopped in a few days after . If the casks are in a cool airy cellar , the fermentation will cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known by the liquor becoming clear and bright , by the cessation of the discharge of fixed air , and by the thick crust which has collected on the surface . The clear cider should now be drawn off and placed in a clean cask . If the cider , which must be carefully watched in this state to prevent the fermentation going too far , remains quiet , it may be allowed to stand till spring , and the addition at first of about a gill of finely powdered charcoal to a barrel will secure this end ; but if a scum collects on the surface , and the fermentation seems inclined to proceed further , it must be immediately racked again . The vent-spile may now be driven tight but examined occasionally . In the beginning of March a final racking should take place , when , should the cider not be perfectly fine , about three fourths of an ounce of Isinglass should be dissolved in the cider and poured in each barrel , /z/ which will render it perfectly clear . It may be bottled now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or afterwards , late in May . When bottling , fill the bottles within an inch of the bottom of the cork , and allow the bottles to stand an hour before the corks are driven in . They should then be sealed , and kept in a cool cellar , with clean dry sand up to their necks ; or laid on their sides in boxes or bins , with the same between each layer . VARIETIES . The varieties of the apple , at the present time , are very numerous . The garden of the Horticultural Society , of London , which contains the most complete collection of fruit in the world , enumerates now about 900 varieties , and nearly 1500 have been tested there . Of these , the larger proportion are of course inferiour , but it is only by comparison in such an experimental garden that the value of the different varieties , for a certain climate , can be fully ascertained . The European apples generally , are in this climate , inferiour to our first rate native sorts , though many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great natural centre of the apple culture in America , is between Massachusetts bay and the Delaware river , where the Newtown pippin , the Spitzemberg , the Swaar , the Baldwin , and the yellow Belle Fleur , have originated , and are grown in the greatest perfection . The apples raised on the very fertile bottoms of the western states are very large and beautiful , but as yet , owing to the excessive luxuriance of growth , are far inferiour in flavour to those of the same quality , raised on the strong , gravelly or sandy loams of this section of the country . New varieties of apples are constantly springing up in this country from the seed , in favourable soils ; and these , when of superiour quality , may , as a general rule , be considered much more valuable for orchard culture than foreign sorts , on account of their greater productiveness and longevity . Indeed , every state has some fine apples , peculiar to it , and it is , therefore , impossible in the present state of pomology in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the finest apples of the United States . To do this , will require time , and an extended and careful examination of their relative merits collected in one garden . The following descriptions comprise all the finest American and foreign varieties yet known in our gardens . In the ensuing pages , apples are described as regards form as follows ; round , or roundish , when the height and the diameter are nearly equal ; fat , or oblate , when the height is much less ; oblong , when the height is considerably more than the diameter ; ovate , ( egg-shaped , ) when the blossom-end is narrowed and rounded ; conical , when the fruit is oblong and somewhat conical on its sides . Pearmain-shaped is a short or flattened cone ; and Calville-shaped signifies a ribbed or furrowed surface . /z/ Class 1 . Summer Apples . // Early Summer Pearmain . Core . A rich , high-flavoured fruit , much esteemed in New-Jersey , where it is most known . It appears to be quite different from the Summer Pearmain , ( of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it . It ripens gradually from the tenth of August to the last of September . Fruit of medium size , oblong , widest at the crown , and tapering slightly to the eye . Skin , red spotted with yellow in the shade , but streaked with livelier red and yellow on the sunny side . Stalk three fourths of an inch long , and pretty deeply inserted . Eye deeply sunk . Flesh yellow , remarkably tender , with a rich and pleasant flavour , and often bursts in falling from the tree . This is a valuable apple for all purposes , and it thrives admirably on sandy soils . In the nursery the tree grows slowly . // A good early Russian apple of the middle size , which ripens here the last of July . Form roundish , a little angular . Stalk , an inch long , planted rather deeply . Skin , pale green , with a semi-transparent appearance , faintly striped on the sunny side with light and dark red . Calyx in a large basin . Flesh , white , pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // This excellent early apple is a native of Dedham , Mass . The fruit is of medium size , nearly round . Skin , deep red . Flesh , yellow , tender , and of an agreeable rich , sub-acid flavour . Ripens during the whole month of August , and is a good and regular bearer . * In describing apples , we shall designate the size by comparison , as follows : small , as the English Golden pippin ; medium size , as the Newtown pippin ; large , as the Yellow Bellflower and Fall pippin as we consider this reference to a stan daid , generally known , better than an exact description by measure owing to the variation in different soils and seasons . The blossom-end , apex or crown of the fruit , is called the eye ; but we shall , for the sake of precision , call the remains of the blossom still found there the calyx , and the hollow in which it is placed the basin . $ This mark denotes varieties particularly recommended by the author . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarlet Perfume . A variety from England of second quality , but admired for its beauty of appearance . Fruit large , roundish , somewhat flattened and slightly angular . Skin nearly covered with deep crimson on a yellowish ground , or sometimes entirely red , with a little russet . Stalk long , woolly , planted in a cavity which is sometimes nearly closed up . Calyx large , in a broad basin . Flesh white , rather firm , juicy , with a somewhat rich and agreeable flavour . August . // Red Quarrenden . Lind . Sack Apple . A handsome English dessert fruit . The editor of the Pomological Magazine says , " there is no better autumn dessert apple ; " but after giving it a trial for several years by the side of the Williams ' Favourite , we consider the latter greatly superiour in flavour , and equally beautiful . Fruit scarcely of medium size , roundish , flattened , and slightly narrowed at the eye . Stalk short , deeply planted . Calyx with long segments , scarcely sunk in a very shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimson , and occasionally a spot of green on the shaded side , sprinkled with numerous green dots .

Early Summer pippin , of some New-York gardens . Bay Apple ac. to Bonne de Mai Thomp . This large , handsome , and excellent summer apple is highly deserving general cultivation . It is better ( though incorrectly ) known on the Hudson as the Summer Pippin , but it is very distinct from the apple known by that name in New- Jersey , which is the Holland pippin . It is also a very different fruit from the Drap d'Or of Lindley , and of Noisette , and most French authors , which is quite a small apple ; but it is the Vrai Drap d'Or of the old Duhamel , pi . xii . Fig. 4 . Fruit large , roundish , sometimes a little oblong , narrowing slightly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour , with distinct small brown dots , or specks . Stalk short , mode- /z/ rately sunk . Calyx set in a shallowish basin , which is rather plaited or irregular . Flesh crisp , juicy , and of a pleasant , sprightly , mild flavour , agreeable for the dessert or for cooking . This is the Summer Pippin of the previous catalogues of the nurseries here . August to October . The tree grows vigorously , and bears well , and the wood is smooth and dark brown . // Prince 's Harvest , or Early French Reinette , of Coxe . July Pippin . Floy . Yellow Harvest . Large White Juneating . Tart Bough . Early French Reinnette . An American apple ; and taking into account its beauty , its excellent qualities for the dessert and for cooking , and its productiveness , we think it the finest early apple yet known . It begins to ripen about the first of July , and continues in use all that month . The smallest collection of apples should comprise Fig. 26 . Early Harvest . this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , rarely a little flattened . Skin very smooth , with a few faint white dots , bright straw colour when fully ripe . Stalk half to three fourths of an inch long , rather slender , inserted in a hollow of moderate depth . Calyx set in a shallow basin . Flesh very white , tender and juicy , crisp , with a rich , sprightly , sub-acid /z/ flavour . The young trees of moderate vigour , with scarcely diverging shoots . Manning errs by following Coxe in calling this a flat apple . // Red Juneating . Margaret , or Striped Juneating . Remolds . Early Red Juneating . Eve Apple of the Irish . Striped Juneating . Margaretha Apfel , of the Germans . An excellent early apple , ripening about the middle of July , or directly after the Early Harvest . The tree while young is rather slender with upright woolly shoots . It is a moderate bearer . Fruit below medium size , roundish-ovate , tapering towards the eye . Skin greenish yellow , pretty well covered by stripes of dark red . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very shallow plaited basin . Flesh white , sub-acid , and when freshly gathered from the tree , of a rich agreeable fla vour . Fig. 27 . Early Red Margaret . This is distinct from the Margaret Apple , of Miller , the Red Juneating of some of our gardens , which resembles it , but is round , with a short slender stalk , and dull yellow skin striped with orange red on one side , the fruit fragrant and the leaves very downy. /z/ American Red Juneating ? Red Juneating , erroneously , of some American gardens . A beautiful variety which is said to have originated in the neighbourhood of New-York , and appears in the markets there about the middle of July . Its sprightly flavour , agreeable perfume , and fine appearance , place it among the very finest sum- /z/ mer apples . It is quite distinct from the Early Red Margaret , which has no fragrance , and a snort stem . Fruit roundish , narrowing towards the eye . Skin smooth and fair , finely striped and stained with bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalk an inch and a half long , rather slender and uneven , inserted in a deep cavity . Calyx rather small , in a shallow , narrow basin . Flesh white , slightly tinged with red next the skin , tender , sub-acid , and very sprightly and brisk in flavour , with an agreeable aroma . Fig. 28 . Early Strawberry . // Early Crofton . Ronalds . Fruit of medium size , round or a little flattened , and obtusely angular . Calyx pretty large and spreading , in a rather narrow basin . Stalk short , in a cavity of moderate depth . Skin yellowish green , with small dots in the shade , washed and streaked with brownish red in the sun . Flesh white , tender , juicy , and pretty well flavoured . A pleasing fruit , but does not rank so high here as in England . // Early Sweet Bough . Kenrick . Sweet Harvest . Bough . Coze . Flay . A native apple , ripening in harvest time , and one of the first quality , only second as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much esteemed for the kitchen as the latter , as it is toe sweet for pies and sauce , but it is generally much admired for the table , and is worthy of a place in every collection . /z/ Fruit above the middle size , an oblong-ovate in form . Skin smooth , pale , greenish yellow . Stalk rather long , and the eye narrow and deep . Flesh white , very tender and crisp when fully ripe , and with a rich sweet sprightly flavour . Ripens from the middle of July to the tenth of August . Tree moderately vigorous , bears abundantly , and forms a round head . /z/ Large Yellow Summer . Ken . A large and handsome American fruit , introduced to notice by Mr. S. Lyman , of Manchester , Conn . The bearing trees are easily recognized by their long and drooping branches , which are almost wholly without fruit spurs , but bear in clusters at their extremities . They bear poorly until the tree attains considerable size , when it yields excellent crops . Fruit quite large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale yellow . Flesh yellow , tender , sub-acid , rich , and high flavoured , and excellent either for the table or for cooking . Last of August . // Arbroath Pippin . Forsyth . An excellent Scotch apple , ripening early in August . Form roundish , below medium size , a little flattened . Skin rather tough , clear lemon yellow when quite ripe , mingled with a little bright green , and sprinkled with a few grayish green dots . Stalk short and thick , set in a rather shallow depression . Calyx in a shallow basin , a little plaited , with prominent segments . Flesh yellowish , firm , crisp , juicy , with a spicy aromatic flavour . The wood is strong , and grows pretty freely from cuttings . // A fruit of extraordinary beauty , first imported into England with the White Astrachan , from Sweden , in 1816 . It bears abundantly with us , and its singular richness of colour is heightened by an exquisite bloom on the surface of the fruit , like that of a plum . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality is good , but if not taken from the tree as soon as ripe , it is liable to become mealy . Ripens from the last of July to the middle of August . Fruit pretty large , rather above the middle size , and very smooth and fair , roundish , a little narrowed towards the eye . Skin almost entirely covered with deep crimson , with sometimes a little greenish yellow in the shade , and occasionally a little /z/ russet near the stalk , and covered with a pale white bloom . Stalk rather short and deeply inserted . Calyx set in a slight Fig. 29 . Red Astrachan. basin , which is sometimes a little irregular . Flesh quite white , crisp , moderately juicy , with an agreeable , rich , acid flavour . 15 . SlNE-QUA-NON . A native of Long Island , named by the late Wm . Prince . Fruit roundish - ovate , about medium size . Skin smooth , pale greenish yellow . Stalk slender . Flesh white , very tender , juicy , and of a delicate and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooked in growth . August . // Hutching 's Seedling . A foreign sort , which is ranked among first rate sorts by Thompson , but from specimens of two seasons produced here , it does not seem likely to take this rank with us . Fruit of medium size , oblong or conical , smooth , clear pale yellow , becoming nearly white on one side when fully ripe . Stalk nearly an inch long , deeply set in a regular cavity . Calyx sunk in a pretty deep basin . Flesh white , firm , very slightly acid , and moderately juicy . According to Lindley it has in England " a most agreeable lively flavour . " Ripens here the latter part oi July , and is very showy on the tree . /z/ // Woolman 's Harvest A very pretty and very excellent apple , highly esteemed as a dessert fruit . Fruit scarcely of medium size , roundish . Skin smooth , rich waxen yellow , streaked and blotched with a little red on the sunny side . Stalk rather short , and slender . Calyx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abounding with sprightly juice . Ripens early in August . // A popular midsummer apple for the dessert and kitchen . The fruit is large and broad at the crown , tapering towards the eye . The stalk is rather long , and is planted in a pretty deep cavity , sometimes partially closed . Calyx but little sunk in a narrow plaited basin . Skin fine deep yellow in its ground , though well striped and clouded with red . Flesh aromatic , yellow , rich and of good flavour . This variety forms a large tree with somewhat pendant boughs , and the fruit is in perfection by the tenth of August . // A nice little English dessert apple , but inferiour to many of our own . Fruit small , ovate , flattened at the eye . Stalk short and calyx set in a wide shallow basin . Skin shining bright yellow , with a little orange next the sun . Flesh yellow , firm , crisp and rich . Ripens in August . // Sops in Wine . Ray , ( 1688 . ) Rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming little apple for the dessert , which the amateur 's garden should always contain . Its flavour is sprightly , though not first rate , and its colour is very handsome . Its name probably comes from the red stain in its flesh . Its branches have a spreading habit , and bear plentifully ; and the fruit , in our garden , ripens gradually from the first of August to October . Fruit small , from an inch and a half to two and a half in diameter , globular , narrowing to the eye . Skin smooth , crimson in the shade , stained and striped with purplish crimson in the sun , and covered with a delicate white bloom . Stalk slender , three fourths of an inch long .

The flesh is white and juicy with a sprightly and agreeable flavour . August . // Owen 's Golden Beauty , ac . Thomp . Juneating . Core . This is an old variety mentioned by Evelyn in 1660 , and described by Ray in 1688 , and is a very tolerable little apple , ripening among the very earliest , during the last of June and the first of July , and deserves a place in a large collection chiefly on that account and its excellent bearing quality . It is very distinct from the Early Harvest , sometimes called by this name . Fruit small , round , a little flattened . Calyx closed in a wrinkled basin , moderately sunk . Stalk rather long and slender , three fourths to an inch in length , slightly inserted in a shallow Fig. 30 . White Juneating. depression .

Tree straight and forms an upright head . // Pyrus Astracanica . De CandoUe , ) Transparent de Moscovie , of the French gardens . Glace deZelande , ) A nearly white , semi-transparent , Russian apple , which bears freely and ripens about the tenth of August ; but in this country is of little or no value , as it nearly always grows mealy and water cored as soon as ripe . Fruit of medium size , roundish , /z/ inclining to conical , and a little ribbed at the eye . Skin very smooth , nearly white , with a few faint streaks of red on one side , and covered with a white bloom . Stalk thick and short ; calyx set in a small basin . Flesh quite white , partially transparent , tender and of delicate flavour , but rather dry . // A large and handsome dessert apple , worthy of a place in every garden .

Class II . Autumn Apples . // Emperor Alexander . Lind . Ron . Russian Emperor . Aporta . This is a very magnificent Russian sort , which thrives well in our gardens . The tree is no less striking in the spring when covered with its very large blossoms , than in autumn when loaded with its superb fruit . Fruit very large , frequently measuring five inches in diameter , and weighing nearly a pound , regularly formed , generally conical or cordate , tapering from the base to the eye . Skin greenish yellow , faintly streaked with red on the shaded side , but orange , brilliantly streaked and marked with bright red in the sun . Calyx large , set in a deep basin .

Skin brownish yellow , mixed with green on the shaded side , but next the sun , reddish , blended with yellow , streaked with deeper red , and sprinkled with numerous small brown specks . Stalk short , obliquely planted under a fleshy lip . Calyx set in a broad shallow basin , which is sometimes scarcely at all sunk , and obscurely plaited .

Fruit very large , roundish , three inches in diameter at the base . Skin yellowish , becoming deep orange , stained on the sunny side with dull and dark red stripes . Calyx set in a large hollow basin . Flesh yellow , breaking , very sweet , and of tolerable flavour .

The Catline is an apple rather below the middling size . It is a great bearer the form is flat , the stalk short and thick , the skin smooth , and of a beautiful yellow , with a clear and brilliant red towards the sun , with numerous streaks and many dark spots scattered on the surface . The flesh is a pale yellow , tender , rich , juicy and sweet ; as an eating apple in October , November and December , it is particularly fine . The tree is small , the form regular , and round in the head ; the shoots straight and delicate ; the foliage of a lively green it is very productive , and in six or seven years after transplanting , it bears abundantly , when well cultivated . // A handsome Russian fruit of good quality .

Stalk short , not deeply inserted . Skin smooth , yellow , dotted with small obscure specks . Flesh yellowish , crisp , with a brisk , rich , tart flavour .

Mr. Kenrick has confounded this with the Pomme Royale , of Connecticut , which is a distinct wnter variety . ( See Pound Royal . ) " Fruit large globular . Skin smooth , white , or very pale yellow , with a faint blush next the sun . Flesh white , with a rich saccharine sub-acid flavour . An excellent variety ripening in October . " // Chalmer 's Large . A very large kitchen apple , valued only for cooking , from August to September .

Stalk nearly an inch long , not very deeply inserted . Flesh greenish yellow , abounding with a lively sub-acid juice . October to January . // Sudlow 's Fall Pippin . This should be an American tariety , named after Dr. Franklin , as it appears , by the Horticultural Transactions , to have been taken from the United States to England , in 1806 ; but it is , we believe , only known to nurserymen here , by importation back again . It is an excellent dessert fruit , larger than the common English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ size , oval , very regular in shape , rather broadest at the base , Eye sunk in an even hollow .

We do not think it comparable to the Fall pippin , which it a little resembles . Fruit large , a little flattened , obscurely ribbed or irregular about the stalk , which is rather slender , an inch long , set in a wide , deep cavity . Calyx closed , small , in a rather shallow basin . Skin pale straw yellow , with a few scattered dots . Flesh white , juicy , crisp , with a rich , good flavour . October and November . // The Fall Pippin is , we think , decidedly an American variety , Thompson and Lindley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably , a seedling raised in this country , from the White Spanish Reinetle , or the Holland pippin , both of which it so much resembles , and from which it , in fact , differs most strongly in the season of maturity . The Fall Pippin is a noble fruit , and is considered the first of Autumn apples in the middle states , where its beauty , large size , and its delicious flavour for the table or for cooking , render it very popular . Fruit very large , roundish , generally a little flattened , pretty regular , sometimes with obscure ribs at the eye . Stalk rather long , three-fourths of an inch , projecting considerably beyond the fruit , ( which distinguishes it from the Holland Pippin , ) set in a rather small , shallow , round cavity .

Stalk about an inch long , slender at its junction with the fruit . Calyx closed , and set in a basin of moderate depth . Flesh tender , sweet , rich and excellent . The tree is a pretty free grower , and bears large crops . This we think will prove a valuable sort . Ripe in August and September . // Grave Slije .

The trees are very thrifty strong growers , and bear young . /z/ A showy , large , dark , blood-red fruit , but rather coarse , and scarcely worth cultivation . Fruit very large , roundish , distinctly ribbed , and irregular in its outline . Stalk short and strong , and calyx set in a well marked basin . Skin smooth , deep , dingy red , over the whole surface . Flesh white , rather dry , and without much flavour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fall Pippin are frequently confounded together . They are indeed of the same origin , and the leaves , wood , and strong growth of both are very closely similar . One of the strongest points of difference , however , lies in their time of ripening . This being with us a late summer , the Fall Pippin a late autumn , and the White Spanish Reinnette an early winter fruit . The Holland Pippin , in the gardens here , begins to fall from the tree , and is fit for pies about the middle of August , and from that time to the first of November , is one of the very best kitchen apples , making the finest tarts and pies . It is not equal to the Fall Pippin for eating .

The calyx is small , closed , very slightly sunk , in a small plaited basin . Stalk half an inch long , in a rather narrow cavity . Skin thin , greenish yellow , washed and streaked , and often entirely covered with stripes of pale and dull red . Flesh white , fine grained , and exceedingly juicy , tender , sweet and sprightly .

The Golden Pippin of the English , is the queen of all dessert apples , in the estimation of the English connoisseurs , as it unites the qualities of small size , fine form , and colour , with high flavour and durability . It is a very old variety , being mentioned by Evelyn , in 1660 , but it thrives well in many parts of England still . The Golden Pippin has never become popular in this country , either because the taste here , does not run in favour of small apples , with the high , sub-acid flavour of the Golden Pippin , and other favourite English sorts , or because our Newtown pippins , Swaars , and Spitzenburghs , etc. , are still higher flavoured , and of a size more admired in this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is rather suited to the garden than the orchard , with us .

The chief distinction between the two in our gardens lies in. the fruit , which , in the almond , consists of little more than a stone covered with a thick , dry , woolly skin , while the Peach has in addition a rich and luscious flesh* The bios* some of the almond resemble those of the peach , but are larger ; they are produced in great profusion , early in the season , before the leaves , and are very ornamental* Uses , The kernel of the sweet almond is bighly esteemed as an an article of food , and is largely used as an ingredient in confectionary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities in the south of Europe , especially in Portugal , and is an important article of commerce* The bitter almond is used in cookery and confectionary , and in medicine , it furnishes the prussic acid of the shops , one of the most powerful of poisons . From both species an oil is also obtained . In France the almond is preferred as a stock ou which toj bud and graft the peach , which , in a very dry climate or chalky soil , it is found , renders the latter more healthy and fruitful than its own bottom . The sweet hard-shelled variety ( Douce acoque dure , ) is preferred for stocks by French nurserymen , Cultivation . The almond thrives best in a warm dry soil , and its general cultivation in this country is precisely like that of the Peach* The sweet almond is the only variety considered of value here , and it is usually propagated by budding it on , Plum stock , or on the bitter almond seedlings .

The Soft-Shell Sweet Almond , or Ladies ' Almond , will not thrive well in the open garden as a standard , north of Philadelphia ; but they succeed well trained to a wall or on espalier rails in a warm situation ; the branches being slightly protected in winter . There is no apparent reason why the culture of the Almond should not be pursued to a profitable extent in the warm and favourable climate of some of the southern states .

In some parts of Germany , the free bearing sorts the Turkey , Orange , and Breda are largely cultivated for this purpose* CULTIVATION . This tree in almost always budded on the plum stock ( on which in July it takes readily , ) as it is found more hardy and durable than upon its own root , Many American nurserymen bud the apricot on the peach , but the trees , so produced , are of a very inferior quality short lived , mora liable to diseases , and the fruit of a second rate flavour* Buck ded on the plum they are well adapted to strong soils , in which they always hold their fruit better than in light sandy soils* Apricots generally grow very thriftily , and soon make fine heads , and produce an abun4ance of blossoms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls of when half grown ? from being stung by the Plum-weevil or curculio , to which the smooth skin of this fruit seems highly attractive . To remedy this , the same course must be pursued as is directed for the plum . Seedling apricots are usually more hardy and produce tive here , than the finer grafted sorts* This is a favourite tree for training on walls or espaliers , and ) in town gardens especially , we often see it trained against the sides of brick houses , and yielding most abundantly . As it bears its fruit in the same way as the peach , and requires the same management , we must refer our readers to the latter head for direction as to pruning and training . As the apricot , how 1 * ever , expands its blossoms very early , it should not be placed on an east wall , or in a situation where it is too much exposed to the full morning sun . DISEASES . When budded on the Plum , this tree is but little liable to diseases , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to render it fruitful , and keep it for a long time in a pro* ductive state , we can not too strongly urge the advantages of the shortming-w system of pruning recommended for the peach* I ALBEEGEEE* Thomp .

The flowers , the roots , and the inner wood are of the brightest yellow colour , and the small crimson fruit is borne in clusters . It is a popular but fallacious notion , entertained both here and in England , that the vicinity of this plant , in any quantity , to grain fields , causes the rust .

Brit . Rosac &x,; of botanists . Cerisier , of the French ; Kirschenbaum , German ; Cinego , Italian ; Cerezo , Spanish . THE cherry is a fine , luxuriant fruit tree , with smooth , light coloured bark , and , generally of rapid growth . The varieties of the black and heart-shaped cherries are always vigorous , and form fine large spreading heads , forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid or red cherry are of lower , more bushy and tardy growth . In the spring the cherry tree is profusely covered with clusters of snow white blossoms , and earlier in summer than upon any other tree , these are followed by abundant crops of juicy , sweet , or acid fruit hanging upon long stalks , and enclosing a smooth stone . The cherry comes originally from Asia , and the Roman general , Lucullus , after a victorious expedition into Pontus , has the reputation of having brought it to Italy , from Cerasus , a town in that province , in the year 69 , B. C. According to Pliny , the Romans , 100 years after this , had eight varieties in cultivation , and they were soon afterwards carried to all parts of Europe . The seeds of the cultivated cherry were brought to this country very early after its settlement , both from England and Holland . USES . As a pleasant and refreshing dessert fruit , the cherry is every where highly esteemed . The early season at which it ripens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always acceptable . While the large and fleshy varieties are exceedingly sweet and luscious , others which are more tender , and more or less acid , are very valuable for pies , tarts , and various kinds of cookery . The fruit of the Kentish or Early Richmond is excellent when stoned and dried , and the Mazzard , and our wild Virginia cherries , are used to give a flavour to brandy . The celebrated German Kirscliwasser is made by distilling the liquor of the common black mazzard or gean , ( in which the stones are ground and broken , and fermented with the pulp , ) and the delicious Ratifia cordial of Grenoble , is also made from this fruit . Maraschino , the most celebrated liqueur of Italy , is distilled from a small gean or mazzard , with which , in fermenting , honey , and the leaves and kernels of the fruit are mixed . The gum of the cherry is nearly identical with gum arabic , and there are some marvellous stories told of its nutritive properties . The wood of the cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable for many purposes , but the best wood is /z/ afforded by our common wild or Virginia cherry , which is a very good substitute for mahogany , taking a fine polish . The larger growing sorts of black cherry are the finest of all fruit trees for shade , and are , therefore , generally chosen by farmers , who are always desirous of combining the useful and the ornamental . Indeed , the cherry , from its symmetrical form , its rapid growth , its fine shade , and beautiful blossoms , is exceedingly well suited for a road side tree in agricultural districts . We wish we could induce the planting of avenues of this and other fine growing fruit trees in our country neighbourhoods , as is the beautiful custom in Germany , affording ornament and a grateful shade and refreshment to the traveller , at the same moment . Mr. Loudon in his Arboretum , gives the following account of the cherry avenues in Germany , which we gladly lay before our readers . " On the continent , and more especially in Germany and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side tree ; particularly in the northern parts of Germany , where the apple and the pear will not thrive . In some countries the road passes for many miles together through an avenue of cherry trees . In Moravia , the road from Brunn to Olmutz , passes through such an avenue , extending upwards of sixty miles in length ; and , in the autumn of 1828 , we travelled for several days through almost one continuous avenue of cherry trees , from Strasburg by a circuitous route to Munich . These avenues , in Germany , are planted by the desire of the respective governments , not only for shading the traveller , but in order that the poor pedestrian may obtain refreshment on his journey . All persons are allowed to partake of the cherries , on condition of not injuring the trees ; but the main crop of the cherries when ripe , is gathered by the respective proprietors of the land on which it grows ; and when these are anxious to preserve the fruit of any particular tree , it is , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw is tied in a conspicuous part to one of the branches , as vines by the road sides in France , when the grapes are ripe , are protected by sprinkling a plant , here and there , with a mixture of lime and water , which marks the leaves with conspicuous white blotches . Every one who has travelled on the Continent in the fruit season , must have observed the respect that is paid to these appropriating marks ; and there is something highly gratifying in this , and in the humane feeling displayed by the princes of the different countries , in causing the trees to be planted . It would indeed be lamentable if kind treatment did not produce a corresponding return . " SOIL AND SITUATION . A dry soil for the cherry is the universal maxim , arid although it is so hardy a tree that it will thrive in a great variety of soils , yet a good , sandy , or gravelly loam is its favourite place . It will indeed grow in much thin- /z/ ner and dryer soils than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep and mellow soil , of good quality , is desirable* When it is forced to grow in wet places , or where the roots are constantly damp , it soon decays , and is very short lived . And . we have seen this tree when forced into too luxuriant a growth in our over-rich western soils , become so gross in its wood as to bear little or no fruit , and split open in its trunk , and soon , perish . It is a very hardy tree , and will bear a great variety of exposures without injury . In deep warm valleys , liable to spring frosts , it is , however , well to plant it on the north sides of hills , in order to retard it in the spring . PROPAGATION . The finer sorts are nearly , always propagated by budding on seedlings of the common black mazzard , which is a very common kind , producing a great abundance of fruity and very healthy , free growing stocks . To raise these stocks , the cherries should be gathered when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days together , so that they may bo partially or wholly freed from the pulp by washing them in water . They should then be planted immediately in drills in the seed plot , covering them about an inch deep . They will then vegetate in. the following spring , and in good soil will be fit for planting out in the nursery rows in the autumn or following spring , at a distance of ten or twelve inches apart in the rows . Many persons preserve their cherry stones iu sand , either in the cellar or in the open air until spring , but we have found this a more precarious mode ; the cherry being one of the most delicate of seeds when it commences to vegetate , and its vitality is frequently destroyed by leaving it in the sand twenty-four hours too long , or after it has commenced sprouting . After planting in the nursery rows , the seedlings are gene* rally fit for budding in the month of August following . And in. order not to have weak stocks overpowered by vigorous ones f they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placing those of the same size in rows together . Nearly a , ll the cherries are grown with us as standards . The English nurserymen usually bud their standard cherries as high as they wish them to form heads , but we always prefer to bud them on quite young stocks , as near the ground as possible , as they then shoot up clean , straight , smooth stems , showing no clumsy joint when the bud and the stock are united* In good soils , the buds will frequently make shoots , six or eight feet high , the first season after the stock is headed back . When dwarf trees are required , the Morello seedlings are used as stocks ; or when very dwarf trees are wished the Perfumed Cherry , ( Cerasus Mahaleb , ) is employed ; but as standards are almost universally preferred , these are seldom seen here . Dwarfs in the nursery must be headed back the second year , in order to form lateral shoots near the ground . /z/ CULTIVATION* The cherry , as a standard tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle states , further than occasionally supplying old trees with a little manure to keep up their vigour , pruning out a dead or crossing branch , and washing the stem with soft soap should it become hard and bark bound* Pruning , the cherry very little needs , and as it is always likely to produce gum ( and this decay , ) it should be avoided , except when really required . It should then be done in midsummer as that is the only season when the gum is not more or less exuded . The cherry is not a very long lived tree , but in favourable soil the finest varieties generally endure about thirty or forty years . Twenty feet apart for the strong , and eighteen feet for the slow growing kinds is the proper distance for this tree . Training the Cherry is very little practised in the United States . The Heart and Bigarreau cherries are usually trained in the horizontal manner , explained in page 40 . When the wall or espalier is once filled , as there directed , with lateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice every season in the month of May and July all additional shoots to within an inch or so of the branch from which they grew . As the trees *row older , these fruit spurs will advance in length , but by cut " ting them out whenever they exceed four or five inches , new ones will be produced , and the tree will continue to keep its proper shape and yield excellent fruit . The Moreljo cherries , being weaker growing sorts , are trained in the fan-manner , ( page 38 . ) Gathering ike frwL This tender and juicy fruit is best when freshly gathered from the tree , and it should always be picked with the stalks attached . For the dessert , the flavour of many sorts in our climate , is rendered more delicious by placing the fruit , for an hour or two previous , in an ice-house or refrigerator , and bringing them upon the table cool , with dew drops standing upon them , VARIETIES . For the sake of enabling the amateur the more readily to identify varieties ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heart cherries* The Common Mazzard and the Black Heart may be taken as types of this division . The trees are rapid growing , with ample and lofty heads , and broad , light green , waved leaves- The fruit is more or less heart-shaped , with rich , tender sweet flesh* ( This includes the Meriners and Gmniers of the French , which seem to us , practically , not distinct . ) This section comprises excellent cherries , universally admired . Colour mostly black , II . Bigarreau cherries . This term comes originally from the French bigarrte speckled or variegated skin 4mt it is now in general use by all pomologists , to signify hard , or firm-fleshed , /z/ sweet cherries those which are firm and crackling , as compared with the melting , tender flesh of section I. The Common Bigarreau or Graffion , may be taken as the type of this class , which is mainly composed of the largest and most beautiful of cherries , admirable for the dessert , and whose firmness renders them well suited for carriage to market . The trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with similar foliage . ( B : garreaux , and Bigarreautiers , of the French . ) III . Duke cherries . This class is characterised by the roundish form of its fruit , thin skin , and juicy , melting flesh ; the flavour being generally sub-acid before fully ripe , when it is rich , and nearly or quite sweet . The Mayduke is the type of this class . The trees are upright in their growth while young , and finally form lower heads than those of the two previous sections , with narrower leaves , which are flat and darker coloured . The young wood is also darker , and a little less strong than that of the Heart and Biggarreau classes . These are excellent varieties , succeeding well in almost all soils and climates , and invaluable both for the dessert and for cooking . ( Cerisiers , of the French . ) IV . Morello cherries . The common Kentish or pie cherry , and the Morello , are well known types of this class . The fruit is mostly round , with thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being chiefly valued for cooking , preserving , and various culinary purposes . The trees are of rather low and spreading growth , with small wiry branches , and narrow dark green foliage . ( Griottiers , and Cerisiers , of the French . ) In describing cherries we shall designate their size by comparison , as follows : large , as the Tartarian , and Bigarreau ; middle sized , as the Mayduke and Black Heart ; small , as the Transparent Guigne and Honey , ( see the outlines of these sorts . ) As regards form , heart-shaped , as the Black Heart ; obtuse heart-shaped , as the Bigarreau ; and round , as the Kentish .

The label was lost on the passage , and the " Bigarreau de Mai , " being in the invoice it was supposed that such might be the name of this variety .
