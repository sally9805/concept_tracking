" Mixed characters , such as in fact we meet with in the world , afford the most proper field for displaying , without any bad effect on morals , the vicissitudes of life ; and they interest us the more deeply , as they display the emotions and passions of which we have all been conscious . When such persons fall into distress through the vices of others , the subject may be very pathetic ; but it is always more instructive when a person has been himself the cause of his misfortune , and when his misfortune is occasioned by the violence of passion , or by some weakness incident to human nature . Such subjects both dispose us to the deepest sympathy , and administer useful warnings for our own conduct . " Kames ' Elements of Criticism . PREFACE . The courtesy due to the public before whom this drama now first appears in print , demands some preface . Although a play , which has been performed more than fifty nights in the United States , and in London and Liverpool , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Atlantic , ) as an acting drama , requires little introductory comment . On its first representation , in New York , in November , 1837 , ( after which it was carefully and laboriously revised , ) the " extreme youth of the actress and authoress , " and the interest attached to her parents ' name , were important agents in its reception and in its subsequent successful career in the United States . That it was so well received in England , divested of these aids , was a result far more accordant with my wishes than with my expectations . Most of the leading incidents of the play , viz :  --  Castelli 's desertion of Octavia , his subsequent marriage , and also hers , the challenge , the slander , the murder at Octavia 's instigation , her death , and that of Bragaldi , occurred in the city of Frankfort , ( Kentucky , ) in 1825 . The false marriage of Octavia , her father 's history , Rossano 's confession , etc. are interpolations of my own . The real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution while sinking under his self-inflicted wounds . To these well-known facts alone am I indebted . My delineations of the characters of the three prominent personages in the play , differ widely from the descriptions I have heard of the originals . The events , when related to me , on the scene of their occurrence , made a vivid impression : besides their dramatic fitness , they admirably illustrate the futile and lamentable results of revenge , even under circumstances which in the world 's opinion serve in some degree to palliate it . The little explanation necessary to the other contents of this book , will be appended to their several subjects . In the laconic quotation selected , ( I trust , without presumption , ) as my motto , I have , in better words than my own , explained my motive for introducing these fruits of girlhood and womanhood 's leisure , to the reading public .

Charlotte M. S. Conner . New York , June , 1848 . Main text ACT FIRST . SCENE FIRST . An Apartment in Bragaldi 's Mansion near Milan . Enter Giulian , Meeting Luigi . Giulian . Giulian Is all prepared for our master 's return ? Luigi . Luigi It is . In truth thou art a careful steward . Giulian . Giulian I should be so . Our gentle mistress thinks me worthy of the trust ; and it is such happiness to serve her and to win her smile , that were my office ten times more laborious , I would perform it joyfully . Luigi . Luigi And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our master return ? Giulian . Giulian Since last night we expect him . He has now been absent , as I think , some fifteen days . Our lady mourns each moment of his stay . Luigi . Luigi Why did she not go to court along with him ? Giulian . Giulian In truth I can not say , unless it be that she doth love this mansion best . ' T is strange that one so happy and so young should dwell so much secluded . Luigi . Luigi Thou know'st I am as yet a stranger here . Tell me , doth our master descend from noble ancestry ? Giulian . Giulian From ancestry ennobled in their deeds alone . For scores of years they have been held in high esteem by all the Milan nobles , who ever honour merit ; but to titled grandeur our master can lay no claim . Luigi . Luigi Does he love my lady ? Giulian . Giulian Ay , indeed ; though they have been wedded now four months , ' t would seem they had not yet ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , I trust , for many years to come . ( Looking off . ) But here is our master 's sister , the gay Lady Clorinda . Enter Clorinda , and Exit Luigi . Clorinda . Clorinda How now , good Giulian , where 's my sister ? Giulian . Giulian In the west chamber , Madam , she watches for our master 's approach amidst the thick shades of the neighbouring forest . Clorinda . Clorinda How happy is my brother in her love ! Giulian , thou long hast lived beneath his roof ; Thy youthful locks have silvered in his service . He calls thee not his servant , but his friend . Giulian . Giulian Madam , the welfare of my Lord is as dear to me as my own life 's blood , and I rejoice to see him wedded unto one whose heart is pure , whose nature noble . Clorinda . Clorinda And withal impassioned and devoted . All girlhood 's budding freshness she retains  --  A child 's simplicity , a queenly soul . To please Octavia is my only wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there Thou mayst discern thy master 's coming , while I go to seek my sister . Exeunt Clorinda and Giulian . SCENE SECOND . Another Apartment . Enter Octavia . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Not yet returned ! what can have thus delayed him ? Fie , fie , Octavia , be again thyself ! Let me be calm , and still this beating heart That aching throbs with hope and fear . Enter Clorinda . Clorinda ! Say quickly , sister , is Bragaldi come ? Clorinda . Clorinda No ; eagerly I 've watched on yonder turret Since earliest day-break , but ' t is all in vain . Some unexpected cause must have detained him . The road is long and perilous , ' t is true ; But then his armed domestics follow him . Thou hast no cause for fear , in truth , Octavia . What ! mope and pine , because thou art a wife , And count each moment that thy lord 's away ! Trust me , so would not I. Octavia sits dejectedly , gazing at a cross which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That jewel , ( pointing to it )  --  Was my brother 's gift  --  his first , think thou told'st me ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Ay , it was his first , And since that day it has not left my side A single hour . Clorinda , Clorinda smiling . Oh ! what constancy ! ( Examining it . The fashion o n't is strange and ancient too ; I doubt if Milan holds another like it . ( She sits . Remember'st thou a merry tale , like those Which often have , since dear Francesco 's absence , Enlivened the long dreary nights , that else Had been so full of loneliness ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Oh no ! Thy list'ning eagerness exhausted soon My memory 's little store . Clorinda , Clorinda playfully . I 'll not release thee . I ask no poet 's legendary tale Of knights and ladies , pilgrims and crusades . No ; tell me one all faith and tender truth ; ( It will beguile the weary , anxious hour ; ) Tell me a tale of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mine ! ' T is , alas ! a history of wo ,  --  A trite and oft-told tale of woman 's love . I would not sadden thy young spirit  --  yet  --  Clorinda . Clorinda Is't melancholy then ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Listen , I pray thee . I was an infant when my mother died And left me to a father 's care . Thy dear Francesco was my childhood 's friend ; the wars Soon called him forth , a youth .  --  Ere sixteen years Had shed their glowing radiance o'er my head , The Count Castelli sojourned near our dwelling . While maids of rank , and dazzling beauty too , Vied for his love , he knelt and sued for mine . He won my girlish fancy , but my father  --  Clorinda . Clorinda Did he oppose your love ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi He did ; he bade me Renounce one called by fame a libertine ,  --  I disbelieved it all  --  Castelli sued  --  We fled together from my father 's home . Clorinda . Clorinda Oh fatal error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eve , ( No witness save a girl who lately died , ) A priest pronounced the words that made us one : We fled to Milan . Ere a week had passed I sighed once more to see my aged father , Implore his pardon and receive his blessing . Clorinda . Clorinda And didst thou then succeed ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi My father came , I yielded to the impulse of my heart  --  I flew to him ; in tearful supplication I clung  --  I prayed for pardon  --  long in vain . At length his heart did melt ; when , as he blessed me , The fearful agony of this sad meeting , The deeper anguish of his lengthened search , O'ercame his aged , fast-decaying frame ; A shudder chilled his heart , and with a groan He fell upon the earth , before my eyes ! He never rose again . Clorinda . Clorinda Alas ! Octavia , E'en while he pardoned , and was blessing thee ! How bitter was thy sorrow then ! Octavia , Octavia Bragaldi starting up . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ! A life Can not efface the memory of that hour . At first Castelli tended and consoled me . But when , amid his soothing words , my heart Refused all comfort , soon he spoke unkindly , And then declared I wearied him with grief . Clorinda . Clorinda Sure man can ne'er be guilty of such baseness . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi My heart soon learned the hollowness of passion Love 's certain grave 's indifference , contempt , Cold , biting sarcasm , that chills affection Sooner than anger , hate , or cruelty . At length Invasion 's dread alarum sounding , He joined the forces , and repaired to battle . Clorinda . Clorinda Didst thou go with him to the wars ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi With eagerness I sought to share his danger , But wearied by my presence once so loved , At night , in secret , he deserted me . Frantic I flew to seek for him  --  in vain ; A friendless stranger , houseless , penniless , I asked no mercy but to die unknown . Clorinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce believe So sad a history is thine , my sister . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi ' T was in this misery thy brother found me On his return , and bore me to my home . Clorinda . Clorinda And heard you naught , Octavia , of your husband ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Yes , ere a year had passed , the news arrived , ( Too fully proved ) that he had died in battle . Clorinda . Clorinda And no farewell , no token sent to thee ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi None ; none . Five years of grief and prayer passed on ; And soon thy brother told me of the love Which , like a lonely flower , he had reared Amidst the wintry gloom of war and battle . He called up all the golden memories Of childhood 's happiness , that had entwined Their fond and clinging grasp around my soul : He asked my hand , and with my heart I gave it . Clorinda . Clorinda And with no vain regret for thy first lord ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To deaden girlhood 's wild and giddy fancies . The dream of passion past , I saw a mortal , Erring , nay heartless ,  --  in my former deity , And in thy brother I beheld a being Whose love , for which a queen might humbly sue , And glory in entreaty , was all mine , His first , his only love ,  --  his chosen bride ! Clorinda . Clorinda Then thou wert blest in happy virtuous love . May thy past woes end all thy mis'ries here ! Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi When thou didst leave a convent 's holy walls To come and dwell with me , I would have told My story to thee then ,  --  but my loved lord From day to day , in kindness still delayed it . Now thou know'st all , pity me  --  pray for me ! Enter Giulian . Giulian . Giulian Madam , my master 's now dismounting at the portal . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Returns in safety ! Clorinda . Clorinda Holy Virgin , thanks ! Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Now haste to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A moment 's pause will still these thoughts of wo . Exit Clorinda . Oh ! would kind Heav'n from recollection chase All bitter grief , my future life might be Worthy of him for whose dear sake I live ! Away at once with this unthankful sadness ! Oh ! let me haste to clasp him to my heart , And in his love forget all former sorrows ! Exit Octavia . SCENE THIRD . The Hall of Entrance to Bragaldi 's Mansion . Giulian , Luigi , and other attendants precede Bragaldi and Alberto . All the attendants , except Giulian , Exeunt . Bragaldi Francesco Bragaldi to Alberto . You 're welcome to my home . Methinks my heart Doth beat more freely as I breathe this air , And tread each path wherein Content doth dwell With Happiness , two old and constant friends . Enter Clorinda .

Octavia Bragaldi Welcome , my husband ! Welcome to thy home ! What cause hath thus  --  Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi An accident befel my steed , Octavia ; I could not leave him on the road to perish . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi No more ? I feared  --  in truth I know not what . Affection ever thus , amid its own Real bliss , creates imaginary wo . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi But see , our guest . ( Pointing to Alberto . ) Octavia .

The demon War doth rest ;  --  unless he should Start up again , after a brief repose , With giant wrath ,  --  my gentle bride , no fear Need shade thy heart that I should hence be called To shed my blood in Italy 's defence . Alberto . Alberto Larini And more than this , I bear a mandate , lady , By thee with cheerful haste to be obeyed . While Milan 's Duke returns with glory decked , All hearts pour forth in gratitude to meet him . But in the gay masque and the mirthful dance Wherewith the Duchess graces his return ,  --  Amid her lovely and attendant train Of fair Ausonia 's dames , the eye of fame Hath marked thy absence , and my lips are charged To woo thee from thy peaceful solitude . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou art yet too young to play the matron . Wilt thou consent awhile to leave thy home ? Octavia .

Octavia Bragaldi By being happy . Go , my own Clorinda , And bid them spread the cheer . These wayfarers Need other welcome than our words can give . Clorinda . Clorinda I haste to do thy bidding . Exit , followed by Giulian . Alberto . Alberto Larini I am proud Indeed that thus my mission has succeeded . This very day we 'll bear thee back in triumph . An instant now , I pray , excuse me friends . I fain would seek my weary steed , that oft Amid the war , undaunted and untired , Hath borne me safe .  --  I 'll join you soon again . Bragaldi .

Absence , Octavia , gives a double zest To all the quiet , flowing joys of home . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi My brave Bragaldi ! I have much to tell : Trifles indeed , to all but those who love . Each little breeze that stirs the rivulet And makes it dance with joy , would pass Unheeded o'er the ocean 's vast expanse . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi How anxiously I 've sighed for my return ! It seemed the lagging councils of the state Were lengthened only to detain me there . I 've equalled thy impatience . She appears to deny it . Dost thou then So dearly love me ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Canst thou doubt it ? O ! Before we wedded , woman 's own reserve In conscious silence bade me hide my heart . But now thou art my own , my lord , my husband , My pride and glory centre in thy love . My only joy 's to live on earth with thee  --  My earnest prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that when our lives have ceased , United we may meet hereafter ! Exeunt Bragaldi and Octavia . END OF ACT I. ACT SECOND . SCENE FIRST . The Garden of Bragaldi 's Mansion in Milan . Enter Alberto and Clorinda conversing . Alberto . Alberto Larini I grieve that I must say farewell , sweet maid . Clorinda . Clorinda ' T is pity that you 've stayed so long in vain . My brother most sincerely will regret His absence to attend the Duke 's command , For he hath marvelled at not seeing you . Alberto . Alberto Larini Thou needst not doubt necessity alone Compelled my absence . There 's a charm around Bragaldi 's home that lures me to it ever . Know'st thou the charm I mean ? Clorinda . Clorinda The peaceful love , The music of their happy lives that flow In harmony ,  --  all these are charms  --  Alberto , Alberto Larini interrupting her . Nay , peace , I pray . Not such as these I mean . Full long I 've sought Bragaldi 's dwelling to behold A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which I would seek to humbly win and wear , And worship as my guiding star : thyself ! Clorinda . Clorinda Such warm and honeyed words I must not hear . I pray you let me seek my sister . Going . Alberto . Alberto Larini Detaining her . Stay ! Though shrinking , pure , and guileless is thy soul , As the first budding flow'ret of the year , Woman 's instinctive nature must have shown thee My true , but silent love . May I then hope ? Clorinda , Clorinda smiling . Sure more than marble were that maiden 's heart Who such sweet flatt'ries could hear unmoved . Yet I 'll believe the speaker is sincere . And though a simple and untutored girl , Bred in a convent 's loneliness , unused To veil a thought or wish from other eyes , I value such affection as I ought . When Time hath laid his seal upon your love , ( If still you ask for a return from me , ) The firm devotion of my life  --  my lord , What have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forget those words ! This foolish , timid heart In seeking to conceal hath told its secret . Alberto . Alberto Larini And made me happiest of the happy . Time , Time is my only rival ; and ere long I 'll tell thy brother of this cherished news That fills me now with joy , with fervent rapture . Kissing her hand . Clorinda . Clorinda Behold , the Lord Orsani . Enter Tebaldo . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Pardon me That I intrude thus hastly , fair maid ; I came to seek Larini : an affair Of state is my excuse No less a cause , Believe me , could  --  Clorinda . Clorinda Excuse , my lord , is needless ; My brother is from home ; but in his stead , From me receive your welcome . Exit Clorinda . Alberto . Alberto Larini Now , Orsani , Why come you thus in haste ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Know you the news ? Alberto . Alberto Larini Of what ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani A deputation has arrived ; And we are called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the import of this embassy ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani In sooth I do not . Say , what meant the crowd I saw but now assembled near the prison ? Alberto . Alberto Larini To see one doomed this hour to suffer death . He is a soldier wild and rude , whose sword In private broils hath oft shed gentle blood . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani His name ? Alberto . Alberto Larini Rossano . And the Duke hath sent ' T is said , to summon to the cell , Bragaldi . I hear this soldier hath made strange confessions ; Upon what theme I know not . Time will show . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani You 've known Bragaldi long ? Alberto . Alberto Larini I have , indeed ; And knowing , have revered him . Proud and noble , He , when a boy , as I remember me , Was formed all dignity and truth . His word Was ever sacred , and he gloried more In the unblemished honour of his name Than doth our Duke in his bright diadem . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisitely vulnerable , That calumny or censure undeserved Would send the angry blood into his cheeks , Lend fire to every word , and prompt his arm To silence the accuser . But if thwarted , On that one insult would he feed alone , ( When e'en the author had forgotten it , ) And on the offender 's head , when fortune favoured , He 'd vent his fierce , but noble indignation . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani A faithful chronicler ! Alberto . Alberto Larini He is no man Who does not honour virtue in his friend , And seek to make it honoured by the world . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Do not forget your duty in your zeal : We shall not hear the deputation . Come ; The Duke expects us now . Alberto . Alberto Larini This way , my lord . Exeunt Alberto and Tebaldo . SCENE SECOND . Octavia 's Apartment in Bragaldi 's Milanese Mansion . Octavia and Clorinda discovered seated . Clorinda embroidering . Clorinda . Clorinda Say , sister , what so long detains my brother ? Octavia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of great weight . Clorinda . Clorinda But nothing sad , I hope , to him or thee ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi None , none I trust ; and yet I 'm eyer fearful . Clorinda . Clorinda Do not despond . Thou hast had thy share of wo . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi The measure is not full , I fear , Clorinda . Leave but a single avenue unguarded By which one guilty thought may reach the heart , Though all around be deemed impregnable , ' Twill enter there , ' twill gain despotic sway , And like all tyrants , steep in lasting sorrow The once pure kingdom over which it reigns . Clorinda . Clorinda Thy first , thy only fault was disobedience ; That error too did spring from love alone . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi No ; call it passion or idolatry ; Such words best paint the cause of all my wo . Love , gentle , pure , and calm in its security , Such as I bear unto my noble husband , Is like the sun 's heat breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion , fierce , And e'en idolatrous , is but the desert whirlwind That scorches and destroys .

Octavia , Octavia Bragaldi looking off . Bragaldi . See , there 's anger on his brow . Leave us , I pray thee . Exit Clorinda . Sure some dreadful cause  --  Enter Bragaldi . Bragaldi , Francesco Bragaldi to himself . Ye raging thoughts , sink deep into my soul . Revenge can ne'er be gained ; cease then to tear And rack me thus , thou craving fiend ! Pacing to and fro in great agitation . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Bragaldi ! Bragaldi , Francesco Bragaldi to himself . And must I chill the warmth of innocence , And make her wretched ? No , I will be silent . Octavia , Octavia Bragaldi advancing to him . Francesco ? Art not well ? What sad mischance Hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing . A trifle scarcely worth a name . Octavia , Octavia Bragaldi gazing steadfastly at him . No more ? Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi No more , indeed .  --  Why shouldst thou doubt ? Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Nay , seek not to dissemble thus with me . No artifice can blind my eye . Thou'st heard  --  Thou hast  --  ay ! on my life ! some fearful news  --  Appalling news to stir thee thus . I am Thy wife to share thy wo , as well as joy . What is't ? Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi ' T is vilest falsehood.  --  Thou shalt know it . While I was here with thee , a summons came ,  --  Thou heard'st it too , ' t was from the Duke and council , ) That I might hear a criminal 's confession , Unasked for ,  --  offered by the slave himself . Two courtiers , by the Duke 's command , were present . The wretch was once a follower of Castelli . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Castelli ! how I tremble ! Speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he unasked , confessed That thou , Octavia , who for years didst dwell In poor , but honourable widowhood  --  Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Say on ! Bragaldi .

Francesco Bragaldi Yes , he confessed , Octavia , That for a heavy bribe from Count Castelli , He had assumed the holy father 's office , And their foul arts together had deceived thee . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Father ! thou art avenged ! Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi At first I deemed ' T was a forged tale ; enraged I seized the wretch For the base lie , and dashed him to the earth .

Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Wherefore that look of sudden wild alarm ? Why dost thou tremble thus ? Octavia , Octavia Bragaldi rushing to him . Francesco , I was deceived  --  was guiltless of this crime . I knew it not . As I do hope for mercy , I swear I knew it not ! Falls on her knees . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi I never doubted ! I know thy truth . The villains both are dead . Let not their guilt a moment cloud thy peace . Nay , rise . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Thou dost not doubt me then ?

When last I left my home , a year I dwelt amidst The din of camps ; till at one fierce affray , When left for dead upon the battle-field , A peasant staunched my wounds and bore me home . Beneath his roof my wasted strength returned . The anxious hours passed in vain endeavours To reach my country 's troops , who , as I heard Were then retreating with their lessened numbers . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani By what misfortune did thy efforts fail ? Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli My messenger was captured by the foe , Whose armed bands discovered my retreat , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary torture , the ripe noon Of an ambitious life that dawned in glory . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Most fearful doom . Death were a blessing to it . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli For near five years I pined within their cells . But our brave Duke soon forced the enemy To own , that when they triumphed over us , ' T was chance , and not their valour , that prevailed . To rescue back some captives of high rank , I was restored to light ; but while my fate Hung doubtful on the deputies ' success , The noble prince Alfonso , our ally , Offered a ransom of such matchless price , My foes cupidity no longer wavered : I was released  --  was free and in the month That since hath waned , my benefactor 's daughter , The fair Vitellia , hath become my bride . And not alone her beauty did she give , But her kind parent with her golden dower So heaped my coffers , that I doubt , Tebaldo , If e'en the Duke himself can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Joy to you ! Your treasures now will lift your power far Above the reach of that proud censor , who Commands the homage of our gaudy court , By his abundant riches . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Say , whom mean you ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Th ' untitled noble , as our gay gallants In mockery term him , for the honour and Respect which all ranks pay .  --  Bragaldi . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Ah ! Francesco ? Tebaldo assents . What ? Is he still living ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Ay . He lives esteemed and honoured by the Duke . He 's wedded too . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Indeed ? To whom ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani To one Of humble birth , ' t is said , now called by fame Peerless : Octavia Velti . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli ( To himself . ) Mighty Heaven ! I hoped e'er this a convent or the grave Had shrouded her from every living eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned She never was my wife ? Aloud . Where do they dwell ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani A few miles from the city , but the throng And bright array detain them now at court . Enter Lorenzo . Lorenzo . Lorenzo The princess bids me say it is the hour At which Lord Loredano gives his feast . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli I come . Exit Lorenzo . Tebaldo , you will join us there ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani I will . Till then farewell , my lord . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Addieu . Exit Tebaldo . Wedded ! in honour wedded , and to him , Whom e'en this moth doth praise ! We soon must meet I fear .  --  So let it be . Away regret ! no tongue Shall ever triumph over Count Castelli . One object  --  Power ! One feeling  --  vast Ambition ! Alone shall urge or stir my passions now . Enter Carlo . Carlo . Carlo My lord , a stranger here would speak with you . Enter Bragaldi , ( richly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Doubtingly . A stranger ! sure I 've seen  --  Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi My lord Castelli ! Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Assured by the sound of his voice . Bragaldi ! Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi You recognize me ? Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Ay , I do ; Although time in his onward course hath changed The youth 's smooth face to man 's stern lineaments . What would you with me ? Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi I 'm Octavia 's husband , You are Castelli  --  I have spoke my errand . Your new won grandeur , borrowed from your wife , ( For I have learned that you are nobly wedded , ) Avails not here . I ask that reparation Insulted pride demands from man to man . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli What mean you ? Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi That your hired slave , Rossano , The trusty agent of your hellish scheme , Dying , confessed it unto me this day . When by deceit and art you robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You snatched from mem'ry 's cheerless waste forever The one green spot that she could call her own , On which her eye might rest amid the ills Of this dark world , and all her heart you left A parched and barren wilderness . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Bragaldi , I can not now repair the wrong . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi ' T is true , Most sadly true . You never can recall The blessed days of youthful innocence , When she was happy as the warbling birds That charm us with their song . ' T is true , you ne'er Can give her back unblemished rectitude Nor take from her the shame she feels e'en now For her unworthy love . You can not pay Her o'er six years in sorrow wasted , nor Raise from the grave her doting , aged father , And teach his lips to bless her once again . All this you can not do , but you can give Revenge ! I 'm here , the champion of my wife . Strong in a husband 's dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ernesto , Count di Castelli How ? Bragaldi  --  Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Accept my offer , or be deemed a coward ! Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Coward !  --  That treat is impotent and vain . I am no coward , as the trophies tell That now adorn these old ancestral halls . All Milan knows and can attest my valour . This arm hath crushed my country 's foes too oft , To tremble at the coward 's brand . My rank Forbids that I should fight with thee . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Thy rank ! Is it not blackened and disgraced By withering a maiden 's hopes ? Vain worm ! Thy rank ! Defend thyself ,  --  or lo ! my sword  --  Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli After a pause . Be calm , Bragaldi , or thou dost a murder . My weapon still is sheathed . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Once more reflect  --  If thy base heart demands reflection here ; By all the fire and restless energy That actuates thy bold aspiring manhood  --  By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common with the tiger  --  By deadly hate , such as we bear each other  --  Again I call thee forth , or dread my rage ! Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Thou canst not injure me . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Proud man ! ' t is true , I can not open lay thy soul ' mongst men , And make them see the heartless wretch thou art ; But thou wilt meet thy punishment . The power Who guides the zephyr and the hurricane , Will hurl his fearful doom upon thy head E'en at the height of all thy guilty splendour . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Cease this vain conflict . Thou hast heard my answer . As strangers let us dwell . Pursue revenge No , more , nor further torture thy wife 's peace . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi The thought of her alone restrains my arm . Vengeance dies not , though it may sleep awhile . Proud man , now tow'ring in the plenitude Of power , and shielded by the lofty rank , Beware of my revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castelli Accursed fiends ! My bride ! Thy rank and dower scarce repay The powerless raging of my shakled passion . Yet ' t was my sole resource , for had we fought , The cause of our combat reaching her , So well I know Vitellia 's jealousy , My hopes of greatness would at once have sunk To ruin . Thou'rt too noble for a murder ,  --  I fear thee not , Bragaldi . ( Enter Lorenzo . ) Lorenzo . Lorenzo Gracious sir , The princess waits . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli I come . Now art must veil Each trace of the commotion of my soul . Away with hate ; and welcome revelry . Exit followed by Lorenzo . SCENE SECOND . An apartment in Bragaldi 's mansion .

Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Thou'rt here in safety ? Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi I have seen Castelli . Octavia , Octavia Bragaldi inquiringly . Oh ! my husband ? Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi His arrogance hath crushed my hopes . He hath Refused to meet this arm . His rank  --  ( Base worm ! ) Forbids it ! His high rank ! Would I had struck Him to the earth ! Octavia .

Octavia Bragaldi I thank thee , for , Oh ! Here there is no peace ! And shouldst thou meet Again that arrogant and heartless noble  --  Should I lose thee , my only hope , Bragaldi , What has this world of comfort left for me ! The wrong that 's past , is past . The fire is quenched  --  Oh ! for my sake then seek not to relume it ! If he rest silent , and no longer breathe A thought of injury against our peace  --  If he molest us not , let us be dumb .

They pass on and Exeunt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rejoice to see Your presence grace these halls .

Francesco Bragaldi Ah ! much I fear your arguments , my lord , Will prove in vain . Is't not so ? To Octavia . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Ay , indeed . Advances to Loredano . I sigh e'en now for my secluded home . My fond dependents , and the humble poor , Books , music , tapestry , my well-tried friends , My sister and my husband , all are found Collected near that old and quiet mansion . Such happiness is there , I almost deem An angel once did dwell beneath its roof , And still , for mem'ry 's sake , presides above it . Loredano . Cosmo Loredano Thy sister and thy husband both are here . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi ' T is true ; but their beloved and happy converse I can enjoy in peace and fondness there ,  --  While here , a gay crowd so surrounds us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noisy revel .

Exit , followed by Pietro and pages to the banquet . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi ( suddenly . Francesco ! if Castelli should be here  --  Bragaldi .

Octavia Bragaldi Hark ! now the merry laugh of thoughtless hearts Comes faintly on my ear . Till he returns I 'll rest upon you terrace girt with flowers , And ' mid the perfume of those shady groves , List to the warbling of the birds , that with The sighing breeze forms one continuous melody . She ascends the terrace and seats herself . Enter from the banquet Castelli , passionately , followed by Tebaldo , Loredano and Alberto . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli A thousand curses on his meddling tongue Loredano . Cosmo Loredano My lord , I do beseech you , be appeased ; Your agitation , which all eyes observe , Destroys the quiet of your anxious friends . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli ( Pacing to and fro . Your pardon ; but my rage will have its way . Accursed be the babbling fool whose mad Officious prating hath destroyed my hopes ! Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani ' T is true , your bride did bitterly reproach And threaten to return unto her father ; But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wonder that indignant pride Thus suddenly o'ercame her . Loredano . Cosmo Loredano I entreat You 'll now return unto the banquet . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Yes . I will return . I will not be the gape And stare of fools . I will return and prove The utter falsehood of that babbler 's tale . Castelli 's loud tones here first attract Octavia 's attention towards what passes . She gradually recognizes him , and rising , is about to withdraw , if possible , to escape notice , when her ear is arrested by the ensuing dialogue . Loredano . Cosmo Loredano Indeed ! Methought the tale was true . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli I say ' T is false  --  a vile and politic falsehood , Told to excite my wife to jealousy . Loredano . Cosmo Loredano Sayst thou , my lord , it is not true that thou Didst secretly , but falsely , wed Octavia ? Castelli , Ernesto , Count di Castelli passionately . Am I  --  a noble , to be questioned thus Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I ne'er did wed her  --  never loved her  --  no ! I could not love a wanton . Alberto . Alberto Larini How ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani What ? Loredano . Cosmo Loredano Strange ! ( Simultaneously . Castelli . Ernesto , Count di Castelli Ay .

Ernesto , Count di Castelli My worthy friends , Haste to the banquet , I will follow you . During these lines , Alberto , Tebaldo , and Loredano exeunt rapidly to the banquet . Castelli pauses to reflect . Yes ; that 's the plea ; I could not love a wanton . As he is going , Octavia rushes down the stage . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Great Heav'n ! will thou not strike the liar dead ! Castelli , Ernesto , Count di Castelli after a pause . Avenging fiends ! Octavia ! can it be ? That face  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard  --  Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Is it a dream ? Did I indeed hear those Dark words ? Oh , let me drive away the thought ! ( Perceiving Castelli .

Castelli Ernesto , Count di Castelli exclaims . Bragaldi 's voice ! He comes ! Away ! Away ! Castelli rushes out .

Clorinda One early fault Alone has been the source of all this wo . Sad moral  --  learned too late !

I know the cause . Castelli has returned . I 've learned his treachery in wedding thee , But he 'll not now molest thee . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Art thou sure ? Aside .

Though he deserves her not , Alberto says So truly doth she love him , that his death Would break her heart . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Aside . And I have widowed her ! Aloud . How have I injured thee , that thou shouldst tear My heartstrings thus ? Clorinda . Clorinda What have I said ? I spoke But to divert thy thoughts . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Ay , to divert !

Giulian , conduct me to Bragaldi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giulian My lord ? Alberto . Alberto Larini If yet there 's time I 'd warn him . Noise heard . ' T is too late . Giulian , Giulian looking off . What means that noise ? Soldiers here ! They Crowd the hall , and now surround each door . What can this mean ? Alberto retires dejectedly . Enter Tebaldo . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani How now , good Giulian , where 's your master ? Giulian . Giulian In his own apartment . Has aught occurred , my lord ? Some danger to the state ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani None . Giulian . Giulian My lord , forgive me ; I am old , and have lived with my kind master since his birth . I know his noble heart , and his affection makes me think him my son and not my master . Therefore I pray you tell me why you come with these soldiers to seek him so hurriedly ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani He is accused of murder . Giulian . Giulian Murder ! Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Yes . This morn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace entrance , slain . Giulian . Giulian And you suspect my master ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Castelli uttered slander ' gainst Octavia : Thy master vowed revenge . Not on these grounds Alone do we suspect . Know'st thou this jewel ? Shows the cross worn by Octavia , and which fell from her girdle in the last scene of Act IV . Giulian . Giulian ' T is very like one that my lady wears . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani ' T was found beside Castelli 's murdered corse . Giulian . Giulian Alas ! Alas ! Tebaldo .

Now then to seek my friend . Justice must be obeyed . Alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apartment in Bragaldi 's mansion . Centr doors leading to an inner room . Enter Bragaldi . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi My poor Octavia ! now she sleeps in peace . This respite from despair may aid her , else Her frame too sure will sink beneath the blow . Ere this ' t is known Castelli has been slain . Where will suspicion light ? On me ? There are No proofs ; if asked , I can deny . What ! lie To screen my life ! But will death be my doom ? A husband 's honour dwells within his wife , And she once slandered , what man 's heart could be So base and cold as not to seek atonement ! Yet midnight murder  --  such it is in truth , And I must bear the stain upon my soul . My wife ! Thy love has been my all on earth , Nor will I shrink from death itself for thee . Enter Luigi . Luigi . Luigi The Lord Orsani here would speak with you . Enter Tebaldo and exit Luigi . Bragaldi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orsani I bring unwelcome news .

Tebaldo Orsani Castelli has been murdered . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Murdered ! Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Ay ! Last night before his palace-door . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi And you Accuse me of the deed ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani The public voice Accuses thee  --  not I ; and as thy friend The Duke bade us in private tell thee this , In mem'ry of the high respect he bore thee . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi I thank his mercy . Why am I accused ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Thy story known did first suggest the thought To ev'ry mind ; but near the corse was found This curious jewel . ( Giving it ) Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Can it be ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani Your wife Wears one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have a jewel like it . She has none . It does resemble mine . ( Returns it . ) The officer re-enters with the cloak Bragaldi wore in the last scene of the 4th act . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani How now ? Officer . Officer My lord , Obeying your directions , we have searched Throughout the mansion , and have found this mantle . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani to Bragaldi . ' T is yours ? Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi It is . Officer , Officer unfolding it . Behold ! ' t is stained with blood . A pause . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Then be it so . Away all vain disguise ! The jewel is my own . I own it . Yes , I slew Castelli . I could stoop to murder , Commit a crime to satisfy revenge , But can not stoop to lie . I slew Castelli . Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani to officer . I 'll to the palace . Guard the pris'ner well . Exit Tebaldo . Alberto . Alberto Larini advancing . How could thy nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , my friend . I will not answer . No commune on my motives will I hold But ' twixt my heart and heaven . I 've confessed . My doom is death . Alberto . Alberto Larini Soon as I heard the tale I came , ( too late , alas ! ) to warn thee . Still A friend may sooth thy wo . Officer Officer advancing to Bragaldi . Good sir  --  Alberto . Alberto Larini I pray Let me perform thy duty . Officer assents and retires . Thanks ! To Bragaldi , Your sword . Bragaldi , Francesco Bragaldi offering it . ' T is here unstained . For my sake , wear it . He recoils . Nay , It hath been used but in my country 's cause . Take it , and when thou hear'st my name reviled , Let it remind thee of a man whose honour Was never stained but by one fearful deed . Alberto . Alberto Larini I take it , and will ever treasure it . Hast thou no other weapon Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi None . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ?  --  Alberto . Alberto Larini She does , and weeps In solitude . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi When I am gone , protect Her ! Alberto . Alberto Larini With my life . My mother shall be hers . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Thanks  --  thanks ! I would not see her , but I pray Give her my heart 's best wish , a brother 's blessing . My poor domestics too  --  Alberto . Alberto Larini They shall be cared for . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi And for my wife  --  Octavia , Octavia Bragaldi within . Detain me not  --  I will  --  I must have entrance . She rushes in . Oh , Bragaldi , speak What mean these armed men around the door ? Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Castelli has been murdered . I 'm accused . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Thou ! no ! who dares  --  Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi I have confessed . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi ' T is false . To Alberto and Officer . ' T was I that murdered him  --  I say ' t was I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I. If he is doomed , why I alike am guilty ; The partner of his crime should suffer with him . Rushing into his arms . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi My friends , believe her not . She raves . I slew him . I saw my wife ,  --  my honoured , faithful wife , Disgraced and slandered by the villain who First won her  --  then deceived her ! Could I pause ? Could I behold her thus deprived of all  --  The only pride of woman torn away  --  Her life , a life of shame and misery  --  Could I see this and tamely bear it ? No ; A true Italian spirit warmed my heart , Keen to perceive affront , and as the lightning Swift to avenge a wrong . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Oh ! say not so ! My desp'rate passion urged thee on to guilt  --  Yet thou'lt forgive  --  Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Forgive , and love thee ever ! Blame not thyself alone . Castelli 's scorn Increased the flame thy woes had kindled here . Alberto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guilt . A soldier 's pride  --  my honour as a husband  --  My happiness  --  my once untarnished name  --  All withered by his pois'nous breath :  --  I sought To crush the reptile ; nor observed the flower Which that rash action trampled in the dust . Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi Mourn not for me ! Thou art the only tie That made me love the world . Thou gone , it would Be misery to live . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Still true ! still firm Thy love ! I 've lived for thee alone , Octavia ; For thy sake I 'll gladly die . The officer advances , having examined the inner room . Officer . Officer Good sir , My duty bids . You must retire hence To yonder chamber more securely guarded . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi I go  --  Octavia . Octavia Bragaldi But not alone . No arm will tear A poor , heartbroken wife from her doomed lord . We will not part on earth . Officer . Officer Then be it so . I would be merciful to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bragaldi . Francesco Bragaldi Octavia , come ! In death alone thou'lt find The refuge which I can not give thee now . Daughter of sorrow , in the grave at least Thou wilt be safe from persecuting slander  --  It can not reach thee there .  --  Alberto , I Had deemed my heart so fenced with iron pride That naught could reach it ; but thy kindness has O'ercome me . I rejoice Castelli 's dead , And know his fate deserved . But when I see The gen'ral wreck I 've caused around me here , I feel ,  --  the blindness of man 's puny will E'en in success destroys itself , and so Should leave revenge to Heaven 's hand alone ! He bids Alberto farewell . Then , extending his arms to Octavia ! She rushes to him . They retire to the inner apartment and the doors are closed . A trumpet sounds without . Alberto . Alberto Larini Say , what new alarm is this ? Enter Luigi . Luigi . Luigi The nobles with a mandate from the Duke . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loredano We come with woful tidings . Speak , Larini Where are thy friends ? Alberto . Alberto Larini E'en now they left me in Such bitter anguish !  --  In the battle 's roar I 've seen my truest friend struck down beside me , And heard his dying groan for those afar  --  I 've seen the agony of her fond heart Who watched for his return , and flying swift To give him welcome , only met his corse ! But oh ! their wo ne'er equalled this despair , For self-reproach had no part in their grief . Loredano . Cosmo Loredano Is then Octavia and Bragaldi 's love Still firm ? Alberto . Alberto Larini Unchanging as the will of Heav'n ! Each seeks to save the other from the doom That threatens both . Their fate on earth is sealed . But midst the darkness of the tomb , one gleam Of sunshine lingers still with blessed power  --  Love , strongest e'en in death !  --  no more , I pray ! Enter Tebaldo . What brings you here ? Tebaldo . Tebaldo Orsani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pris'ner to the palace . A sound of something falling in the inner room . Hark ! What means that noise ? Where is Bragaldi ? Officer .

Let us bear hence his wife and bring her comfort . Octavia , waving him off still more wildly . Comfort ! I have it . I shall soon rejoin him . Poison now runs through my veins . Alberto . Alberto Larini Call help ! Octavia , supported by Alberto . No ! Stay ! I urged  --  Bragaldi  --  to the murder . Oh brain ! Seeking for her cross and not finding it about her . That cross !
