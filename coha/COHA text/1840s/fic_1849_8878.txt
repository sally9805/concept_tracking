Gia . Giacomo She ever does , my lord ; it is Her favorite walk . Car . Caraffa Away , then ! here , a ducat  --  get you gone ! Exit Giacomo . Now , by Saint Marc , I 'm in a fever fit To see this saintly dame . For weeks I have not looked upon her face  --  And such a face ! there may be up in heaven ; There is not here in Venice other such ! The lips a pair of rose leaves quaintly curved ! Her eyes two liquid stars  --  brow swan-like white  --  Hair of the midnight 's hue , and over all A robe of spotless virtue ! Virtue  --  bah ! It may be found in Parma making cheese , Or ' mong the highshod Lombards  --  where the toil Of moiling life works out the sin in sweat ; There 's no such item in the mart of Venice ; The month that followed on her marriage morn , The what with costly shows and masquerade , She bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him besides : but now all 's changed  --  For since his absence , she has kept herself More closely than a nun ; as I believe , By the advice of this same meddling priest : Well  --  well  --  there 's fortune here  --  this pretty note , Which I have ope 'd and read , a common trick , And sealed again  --  this doting husband 's letter  --  Filled with soft speeches and confiding folly  --  Gives wholesome cause for calling on the lady  --  Sweet welcome intercessor ! Ha ! she comes ! And , as the fiend would have it , comes the monk In closest converse with her ! by St. Jude , Had I a wife of such a build as this , I 'd have no priest thus whisper in her ear ; Who knows , but that old beads and scapular May love her too ? Mount Hecla 's breast of flame Burns not less fiercely under robes of snow , Than Etna with the vine-wreath on his brow ! And such a sun to draw the fever out ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the play Of those warm wicked eyes would melt the ice Of Alpine avalanche ! My countship for his monkship 's privilege  --  Not having that , let 's hear a chapter now From the confessional ! Retires . Enter Marinella and Lorenzo . Marinella . Marinella What ! love my lord ? Why , good Lorenzo , you do frighten me ; Be sure I love my lord  --  How could I else ? All Venice loves my lord ! Car . Caraffa ( Aside . ) There you make a slight mistake , I think . Lor . Lorenzo That is but admiration of Your lord 's high qualities ; as we admire The sun that gives us light  --  the flower fragrance  --  ' T is not that love of which I question you . Mar . Marinella Oh ! then you mean the love I 've read about In those sweet story books where it is said That all our senses are the slaves of it : The harshest sounds seem soft and musical ! The rudest picture seems a paradise  --  And all the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , if all this be true , For I have never felt a love like this . Lor . Lorenzo Have you not felt at times a secret pain When that my lord hath smiled , or seemed to smile Too tenderly on others that were fair ? Car . Caraffa ( aside . ) What the devil is the old dotard driving at ? Mar . Marinella Not I i ' faith ! I know not what you mean ; What is it , father ? Lor . Lorenzo " A passion strange , though natural ; And ever the concomitant of love : Without it love would change to simple friendship , And thus be robbed of half its sweet delight  --  Although it is a very thorn itself , Yet like the thorn  --  the guardian of the rose  --  It is love 's sentinel . " Its name is Jealousy ! Mar . Marinella Oh ! jealousy ? I 've read  --  a fearful thing ! It often causes murders and strange crimes . Father , you could not think ? no  --  no  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lorenzo So much the worse  --  alas ! my fears are right ! There 's no love here . ( Aside . ) Answer me , Marinella , Do you not feel at times a happy yearning To kiss my lord , your husband ? Car . Caraffa ( aside . ) In faith , a very interesting question To put to a wife . Mar . Marinella Be sure I do . Lor . Lorenzo  --  You do  --  you do ! Mar . Marinella Aye , father , what is there strange in ' t ? I feel the same to kiss good brother Basil . Lor . Lorenzo Ha ! Mar . Marinella What mean you , father , by that exclamation ? Is ' t wrong to kiss my brother ? I have done ' t A thousand times . Lor . Lorenzo You must do so no more . Mar . Marinella And wherefore , holy father ? that good book , You taught me to obey , has thus declared That I should love my brother as myself . And why not show my love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed , and you are now a wife . Mar . Marinella And why not now , as when a simple maid ? I must not kiss my own dear brother Basil ? My lord would even wish to see me do ' t ! I 'm angry with you , Fray Lorenzo , Indeed , I 'm angry with you ! Car . Caraffa ( aside . ) By the mass , a strange dialogue ! Lor . Lorenzo Alas ! poor child , you 'll have more cause for grief , When you do know why thus I counsel you . Believe me , ' t is with reason . Mar . Marinella With reason ? What mean you , father ? Lor . Lorenzo That the Count Basil  --  Mar . Marinella Speak , father , speak ! Lor . Lorenzo Is not thy brother ! Car . Caraffa ( aside ) . Ha ! Mar . Marinella Father Lorenzo , what strange jest is this ? Lor . Lorenzo It were a cruel jest , if it were one  --  Alas ! it is no jest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are mocking me  --  For if ' t be true , the truth will break my heart . Lor . Lorenzo Daughter , from childhood I have been thy friend , As long before the world had seen thy face I was thy father 's  --  I have cherished thee With fondness little failing even his . Have I not , Marinella ? Mar . Marinella You have  --  you have ! Lor . Lorenzo Then thou believest me , I 've spoke the truth . Mar . Marinella If thou say'st true , then it is true indeed ! Lor . Lorenzo ' T is meet I should make-known the nature of This strange revealment : therefore , listen me : Your father dying suddenly , confessed To me a secret hitherto his own ; That the Count Basil was not son to him , But privately adopted , to supply the place Of a male heir ; For failing this , his title and estates With all the wealth he meant for you as dower , Had else been forfeiture to Venice State  --  Here is the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Your father 's name appended , with his seal  --  You see ' t is as I 've said . Car . Caraffa ( aside . ) I 'll have those documents Ere I am eight days older . Mar . Marinella It is  --  it is  --  alas ! poor Basil ! Lor . Lorenzo It was your father 's latest wish and will That you should know of this  --  that knowing it You might treat Basil with such fair respect , As duty owing to your proper lord May counsel you . Mar . Marinella Knows my lord aught of this ? Lor . Lorenzo He nothing knows of it . Mar . Marinella Or Basil ? Lor . Lorenzo ' T is only known to you and me . Car . Caraffa ( aside . ) And me , your reverence . Mar . Marinella It is our duty , father , they should know it . Lor . Lorenzo Our duty as it was your father 's will  --  And straight on their return they shall be told  --  But let us farther walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy subject . Mar . Marinella Poor Basil ! Exeunt R. Car . Caraffa ( coming down Stage . ) Now , by the crown of thorns , ' t is burning shame For me , a noble gentleman of Venice , Thus to be cornered , and perforce compelled To play the listener ! State secrets , too ! A history of fraud and forfeiture . It comforts me to know that these have oft Seduced my betters from the path of honor ; Another comfort springs from my mishap . These goodly facts will make the Duke my friend  --  And fill my slender purse with gold ducati ; The Duke owes Casimir but scanty liking ; And I do hate him in my inmost soul For many crosses he hath cost my life  --  The latest , bitterest , that but for him I should have had the sole and whole command Of this great enterprise against Milan . My hate for him is only equalled by My burning lust for her : If I could make him suffer in his wife ' T would be a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she said as much : Her love was all safe lodged in brother Basil ! By all the saints ! it is the strangest case Of virtue I have met , and stranger still , If from such chaos I do not clip out A fortune fashioned so to suit myself : But see ! his reverence has ta'en his leave And straightway makes she back ! Come , cap and feather , sit as you were wont ! There 's virtue in you yet ! Gods ! such a walk  --  As though the earth were proud to have her on ' t ! Each step she takes , her knowing dainty foot Flings back the pebbles with a spurning pride , As though ' t was planted on a bleeding heart ! And when she smiles , the flowers ope their cups To catch new fragrance ! She is here ! Enter Marinella , R. Good day , most gentle lady ! Mar . Marinella Good day ! my lord , the Count Caraffa , I believe ? Car . Caraffa The same , sweet lady , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely day . Car . Caraffa Lady , The sun seems conscious that you are abroad ; He flings his fairest beam upon your path . Mar . Marinella Your courtesy mistakes effect for cause  --  ' T is for he shines so fair , I am abroad . Car . Caraffa Yet lady , on no fairer thing than thou , Deigns he to shine to day . Mar . Marinella My lord , is not this flattery ? I do not like ' t . Car . Caraffa Then you 're a miracle and not a woman , ( aside . ) No , lady , no : I never flatter . Or if I did , no compliment of mine Could flatter thee  --  a truce to this . I play the postman for your ladyship ; This letter ( shows letter ) from the general , your husband , Came with despatches for the Duke and Senate ; It brings glad news to you  --  your lord has won A brilliant victory . Mar . Marinella ( taking the letter . ) My lord , I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madam , thus to serve you . I ' faith she takes it codly , with as much sang froid As I would read the bilet of a sempstress , Or a coarse weaver 's bll for gloves and hose ! No touch of trembling in her delicate hand  --  No bounding of the heart like one that loves ! Bah ! she cares not for him . Just bought and sold As I have heard  --  a legal prostitution ; Then must she fall  --  it is as sure as  --  ( aside . ) What news , sweet lady ? how is my lord ? Mar . Marinella My husband 's well . Car . Caraffa " My husband 's well ! " By heavens , it seems To give her pain to say it ; that 's not strange . I 've known a score of them whom it hath pained To say " my husband 's well ; " ( aside ) ' T is rumored that The general will soon return ; So says he , does he not ? Mar . Marinella The day beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comes your brother , Count Basil , with my lord ? Mar . Marinella He does . Car . Caraffa You 'll be right glad to see your brother Basil , You were such friends of yore . Mar . Marinella Yes  --  yes , my lord . Car . Caraffa I , too , had a sister  --  but she married And soon forgot me , I believe . You are unwell ? Mar . Marinella A momentary dizziness , my lord ; I know not what . Car . Caraffa Yet you are pale  --  pardon me , ( taking her hand , ) I 'll kiss that hand though I should hang for it ; If that succeed , the lips will quickly follow : ( aside . ) Allow me to conduct you to the palace . Mar . Marinella There is no need , my lord . Car . Caraffa Nay , may it please you , madam . Mar . Marinella My lord , I 'm well . Car . Caraffa Nay , madam , do permit me ; I 'll kiss the hand though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft and dainty touch Thrills like electric fire to my heart ! Why should I fear ? ' t is only fools And cowards that do fail in such a cause ( aside . ) Sweet lady  --  ( kisses her hand . ) Mar . Marinella ( withdrawing it gently . ) My lord , you 've made me well again . Car . Caraffa Ha ! how ? Mar . Marinella Sir , you have made me well again . Car . Caraffa Can it be so that I have won her thus ? Yes , so ! they 're all alike Since Adam had a wife ! ( aside . ) Then , dearest lady , grant me  --  ( Attenpting to kiss her . ) Mar . Marinella Villain ! stand back !  --  my lord shall know of this , And punish you , believe me . Car . Caraffa The devil ! I did mistake this dame  --  ' T is wiser to repair this breach again  --  There 's many a citadel safe proof ' gainst storm , Will yield to bloodless siege  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nay , madam , you have punished me already . Yet , lady , hear A word that may extenuate my crime , Perhaps vouchsafe forgiveness . Since first I saw thy face , my soul was filled With love of thee  --  oh ! do not censure me  --  With equal justice might the magnet stone Condemn the steel that can not help approach , Than thou be angry with my helpless love . ' T is thus I 've erred , and thus I beg of thee , ( Kneeling . ) My crime shall be forgotten . Mar . Marinella Such rudeness , sir , can never be forgotten  --  If you 're a man , your conscience enough Will punish you  --  let this be of the past , But for the future , sir , We may not meet again . Exit L. Car . Caraffa ( Rising . ) There you are much mistaken , let me tell you  --  We 'll meet again at such a place and time , As you 'll not shun me with so cool a scorn : The patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hates with all its hate , Must sometimes reach its end ; and I will risk My life to compass this ! Fool I have been  --  My headlong haste has plunged me into hell ; And oh ! from such a heaven to have fallen ! Revenge and gold must hide humiliation  --  Gold and revenge ! I 'll make a solvent purse Supply the place of an insolvent heart ; I 've two friends left  --  the Devil and the Duke , And both are powerful in Venice city . The Duke loves Casimir no more than I. Some olden quarrel Hath bred between them hatred cordial  --  I 'll find an ally here  --  but lacking this , ' T is plain that he must suffer in his wife  --  She loves him not , and by the natural course Of woman 's heart , she must be false with some one ; Who knows who ? perhaps the new ex-brother ; Ha ! ' t would be a rich revenge . Such men are best ill used When wedlock 's confidence has been abused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Casimir , Casimir ( without ) R. Breathe your steeds , gentlemen , while from this hill We view fair Venice smiling from the sea A joyous welcome ! Enter with Basil , R. S. Brother Basil , Is ' t not a glorious sight ? Basil . Basil It is , indeed , my lord ! Cas . Casimir More glorious than war ! Bas . Basil Dost thou think so , my lord ? Cas . Casimir In very truth I do  --  a noble sight ! Look on it , Basil ! was ever warlike show So fair as this ? " Here on the Adrian shore The villa lifts above the orange groves Its snow-white walls , that nestling seem to sleep Along the golden outline of the leaves , Like a pure virgin on her downy couch , Whose soft rebelling bosoms have escaped Concealment of the careless drapery ! " Up from the azure bosom of the deep Aspiring walls with broad and bannered crests Pierce the blue heaven ! far as eye can reach The wings of commerce whiten all the sea ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilded crests and joyous rowers , Come bounding o'er the waves to bear us back To our sweet sea-kissed home ! Ah ! Venice , smiling city of the sea , Thou art a picture for a poet 's heart ! Look on it , brother ! this the fruit of war ? No  --  no . Such bright prosperity is born of peace  --  War never nurtured Venice ! Bas . Basil Pardon me , general , it seems somewhat strange To hear you speak of war in such a fashion ? Cas . Casimir It may seem strange  --  from boyhood I have led A soldier 's life  --  and ever until now The trumpet 's flourish , and the war steed 's neigh Have been the sweetest music of my soul : But I am changed of late  --  and but that duty Summoned us forth to curb the Milanese , I had not donned these trappings willingly . From victory I never longed before To head me home to Venice ; now , in truth , I yearn right much to see her . Bas . Basil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good Basil , Whom but Venice , as I said ? Bas . Basil Or Marinella , as you thought , my lord . Cas . Casimir Well , since you 'll have it so , my merry brother , Say Marinella , then . Ah ! brother Basil , could you only know The weary longings of a husband 's heart ! To you the bivouack was but the scene Of glorious excitement , but to me  --  " Well  --  well , if thou didst fare the best in camp , ' T is my turn now ; and oh ! how different The interests that wait to welcome us ! You but return to Venice as a home  --  Rejoin your old companions and their sports , And soon art satisfied ; while I come back Anticipating joys of wedded love So holy and so sweet , that even these long And weary hours of absence seem to win Some title to our praise , whose hard restraint Has taught us the high value of our love ; Exiling us awhile , but to enhance The sweetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy  --  Is there not a form in yonder balcony , Close by the Ducal palace ? A woman 's form . Do'st see it ? Bas . Basil I see not that  --  I see a thousand forms Upon the turrets clustered , to behold Our triumph  --  but the distance is so great , I can not separate a single one From the confused mass , much less bespeak The sex of it . Cas . Casimir Ah ! Basil , I 'm sure there is a woman 's ! My life ' t is Marinella ! Look again ! A scarf , I think  --  well ? see'st it ? Bas . Basil My lord , you must have sharper sight than I. Cas . Casimir No  --  no , my boy ; ' t is love alone Now lends me the advantage . Bas . Basil Is that not strange ? I 've always heard , That love was rather blind than otherwise . Cas . Casimir A slander , boy ; or truth but partly true ; ' T is only blind to all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lynx  --  An argus . You can not see her , then ? Bas . Basil No , my good general ; but see ! The smoke upon St. Marks ! they 've spied Your gonfalon . Cas . Casimir Aye , there 's the gun ! ' T would glad me much I could forego this triumph ; I long to lay my laurels at her feet ; But since this may not be ' till we 've upturned The sober city with our shows of war  --  I must endure it  --  that we may not fail In due respect , where most respect is due ; Bear this before , ( gives letter ) and say the writer comes Close on its heels . Bas . Basil I will , good general ; adieu ! Exit Basil , S. H. Cas . Casimir Kiss Marinella , boy , and say the kiss Comes from her husband ! Husband  --  do I dream ? No  --  no , it is reality ! and she My wedded wife  --  my own dear Marinella ! Husband and wife ! oh sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , There are no words of so endearing interest ! No tie can e'er be wove around the heart , So sacred and so strong as that which binds , The loving husband to his loving wife ! Oh ! Marinella , how my bosom yearns For the fond pressure of thy lovely form ! I 'm yet but half thy husband  --  cruel fate That rudely tore me from thy soft embrace , Now brings me back  --  perchance that when we meet Our hindered honeymoon might be more sweet ! Exit L. H.

Lorenzo My lord , I give you joy on your great victory ! It glads me much to see you safe again . Cas . Casimir I know  --  I know it does , my good Lorenzo  --  But say , How did behave our little caged dove ? Pined she much for her absent mate ? Lor . Lorenzo She did , indeed , my lord . Car . Caraffa ( Aside . ) And you too lie , old greybeard . Cas . Casimir Come , dearest , tell me  --  speaks he the truth ? Mar . Marinella Indeed , I did so , my good lord . Car .

Caraffa Remember it  --  it may be worth your pains . Luigi . Luigi I will , my lord . Cas . Casimir Indeed , Milan has cause to thank you , love .

Marinella ( To Casimir . ) My lord , you make me blush Before these gentlemen . Cas . Casimir Nay , there 's a constant blush upon thy cheek That I would kiss again , and thus forever ! These blissful moments , how much sweeter they Than the fierce joys of war ! How soft this snowy bosom when compared With the rude pillow of the battle field ! Unless the foe Himself should bring invasion on the State , I 'll go to war no more . Cas .

Heaven is my judge I never drew't , Ambition urged in an unrighteous cause ; The laurels I have plucked grew on the path Of my strict duty ; now no more of war , Its glory and its guilt !  --  the day will come When those bright names , that like so many gods Now glitter on the pages of the past In blood-writ fame , shall be forgotten all ; And in their stead , the good , the truly great Alone shall be recorded !

Casimir I can not fancy nature more divine ! Lor . Lorenzo My lord , I came  --  Cas .

Cas . Casimir Your argument ? Lor . Lorenzo My lord , within the centre of a grove There stood a tree , by far more beautiful Than those that grew around ;  --  that its fair form Might not be longer hid , the owner came And cut away the grove that sheltered it  --  It was made manifest a stately tree  --  The world saw and admired ; but jealous winds Began to blow ; ahd its unpractised sinews Could not withstand the tempest 's fierce assault ; Its green arms broke  --  its roots gave way  --  it fell ! Cas . Casimir Now  --  the application ? Lor . Lorenzo My lord , you well remember How , till her bridal morn , this maid hath passed Her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world she knew , was what is gleaned Within the harmless range of rural life ; If sin existed , nought knew she of it , Except by books , or what the human heart Itself conceives ; and hers was virgin pure  --  " As well the snow might gender its pollution .

Cas . Casimir No ! not a whit of danger . Lor . Lorenzo You understand  --  ? Cas . Casimir I understand , but not admit the argument  --  Had that rash husbandman But taught his tree to grow ere he exposed it , It would have baffled all the tempest 's strength  --  Though that my wife is but a child in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Virtue is too deep rooted in her heart , To be plucked forth by carnal conjuring  --  I 'll risk my soul on her fidelity ! Lor . Lorenzo My lord , be not too blind  --  Pardon the boldness of an earnest friend . I 'm older than yourself  --  a wayward youth Hath skilled me craftily in woman 's heart . And never since the first one guilty fell Hath it been found invulnerable . Cas . Casimir I 'm sorry , my good father , your experience Hath leapt to such conclusion  --  T'would grieve me much did I believe it thus  --  I have a higher faith In that most fair and noble work of God  --  And as for her , the fairest of her sex  --  I would not , if I could , doubt Marinella . Lor . Lorenzo My lord , it is not doubt , but simple prudence  --  Had that rash husbandman , as you have said , But taught the tree to grow ere he exposed it  --  Had he but guarded it against the storm , While its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  It would in time , unguarded and alone , Have stood defying all the tempest 's wrath  --  I do not doubt the virtue of your wife To be of strength unusual in her sex . Who doubts the value of that diamond gem ! Pointing to the ring on Casimir 's finger . If worn with care the jewel still may last A thousand thousand years , yet easily That gem may be destroyed  --  heat it but slightly , It will resist the flame  --  heat it still more , It may resist ; but fling it in the furnace , And it will melt and be as valueless As a poor pebble ! So is ' t with woman 's virtue ! Cas . Casimir Ah ! no  --  not alwasys so , my good Lorenzo  --  I do believe her virtue sometimes is More like the golden setting than the gem , Which flung into the furnace but comes forth More pure than ever ! The course you counsel me is plainly wrong . Lor . Lorenzo Wrong , think you , my good lord ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove it if you will  --  And from this very diamond I will draw My argument . Lor . Lorenzo And how , my lord ? Cas . Casimir Answer me , Wherein consists the value of this jewel ? Lor . Lorenzo Doubtless , my lord , in its Incomparable brilliance . Cas . Casimir You ' ve answered right  --  Where is its brilliance now ? Covering the ring with his hand . Lor . Lorenzo It hath no brilliance now . Cas . Casimir It hath no value then ! this jewel set In its fair circlet , as you see it now , Is full of value and an ornament Upon my finger  --  now it is valueless As a poor pebble ! My wife ' s a gem  --  a rare one all admit ; And you , forsooth , would have me , miserlike , Shut up this precious jewel from the world , Lest that the world 's bawd gaze should tarnish it . I tell you , fray Lorenzo , that the gem That will not bear the wearing is not worth The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll trust her conduct to her own good head  --  Her heart will be an ample guarantee . " Lor . Lorenzo My lord , I have no more to urge ; You ' ve had my counsel  --  let me take my leave . Cas . Casimir Stay ! By heavens ! you have made me somewhat jealous Without a cause ! Lor . Lorenzo Not jealous , my good lord , I would not wake The springs of that vile passion in your heart  --  I do but warn your heart against a cause , That such might ne'er exist . Cas . Casimir I find no cause  --  what would you have me do ? Whom would you warn me of ? Lor . Lorenzo Of all , but most of all those who are dearest . Cas . Casimir Ha ! Lor . Lorenzo Ask the poor broken hearted husband , who Hath robbed him of his earthly joy , his wife  --  And he will answer , ' t was his dearest friend . Ask the bereaved parents , who bereft them , They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she the ruined one , he was her friend  --  ' T is not the bold And published libertine that men need fear ; For he hath rarely access to the hearth , And only from the hearth can hearts be stolen . The wolf comes in the aspect of a lamb , And gains at once admittance to the fold  --  He gains at once both confidence and contact , For without these there is no guilty love  --  Need I speak plainer ? Cas . Casimir You 'd have me then suspect my dearest friend Of plotting my dishonor ? Lor . Lorenzo No , not suspect ; suspicion argues crime And here as yet no crime has been committed . I 'd have your caution waked  --  the cause removed , That else may lead to criminal effect . Cas . Casimir The cause removed  --  that is , you 'd have me lock And bar my doors against the faces of My friends ? Or is there , ha ! is there a single cause ? Lor . Lorenzo Since you have put me to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casimir There is ! and who ? Lor . Lorenzo It is a duty I would gladly shun ; But ' t is a duty , and  --  Cas . Casimir Then quick perform it , father ! For heaven 's sake , keep me not In this dread agony of painful doubt ! Who is he I should fear ? Lor . Lorenzo Count Basil ! Cas . Casimir Count Basil ! Lor . Lorenzo I 've said  --  though doubtless at this time Count Basil 's innocent , as I myself , Of wrong to you , or to your wedded wife , Who knows what fate is in the womb of time ? Two youthful hearts So lately joined by strange unnatural ties , And late so rudely severed  --  now may yearn To be united by a stronger bond  --  Here nature rules , volition is her slave  --  The close communion of the common hearth ; His hourly access to her eye and ear , May bring about results most to be dreaded ! I tell you , my good lord , that you do stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy task yet from the giddy height , To take yourself away  --  no violence Need to be used  --  Count Basil 's your lieutenant  --  Upon a thousand pretexts send him hence , If but a while , until domestic ties , Habit , like thoughts  --  perhaps that holy pledge That binds the loving husband to his wife , Have closer wove and bound your souls together . Cas . Casimir And thus in fear that others might do wrong , You 'd have me do a guilty wrong myself ? Banish , on false and frivolous pretext , My truest friend , who scarce a month agone Stept ' twixt my life and danger ? In doing so you 'd have me virtually To doubt the strength of virtue in my wife : I tell you , my good father , in this doubt There lies more bitter agony of thought Than in the known reality of wrong ! Where there 's no confidence there is no peace , And virtue 's valueless that will not bear Such slight temptation ! Though ' t is a thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's heart to love  --  No ! you may conquer worlds , yet not control The secret throbbings of one little heart ! What boots it if I locked her body up ? Her appetite would still be free as air : And I should be , for all my petty pains , The Moslem master of a thing enslaved ! No , no , my good Lorenzo , I will not Turn Turk as yet  --  when you can teach me , how To lock the subtle soul up with the body , Then shall I listen to your counsel , father , ' Till then , my wife goes free ! Lor . Lorenzo Enough ! my humble duty goes no farther ; My counsel has been vain , and heaven forbid , That future destiny should prove it worthy ! No , rather may my zeal be thought too blind Than too prophetic  --  once again , adieu ! Going . Cas . Casimir A moment stay ! good friend , mistake me not ; Your counsel has been kindly , wisely meant , And though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive , take my heart-felt thanks ! I do forgive you , for some bitter pangs , Fresh started here  --  if time to come should prove , That I have held her too infallible The error done would sit upon my soul As lightly then , as would suspicion now  --  For either one would bring that soul to nought : As for my wife , you are her sage instructor , And have free access to her every thought : You are free then , as is your generous will , To guide and strengthen those good principles You seem so much to fear . God prosper you ! Lor . Lorenzo Amen ! my honored lord ! Exit Lorenzo , L. H. Cas . Casimir He hath waked a new string in my secret heart .

I 'll clear at once my just and honest heart Of all dishonest thoughts , until ' t is pure As ' t was an hour ago !

Car . Caraffa My lord , I see you 're thirsting for my life  --  Perhaps when you have heard what I do know , You 'll turn your sword against a nearer friend . Cas . Casimir Fiend , what dost thou know ? Car . Caraffa Though I have played the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game  --  She 's false to you at least  --  Count Basil knows . Cas . Casimir Liar and dog ! ( They fight a few passes . Casimir runs him through . ) Car . Caraffa Curses on you !  --  be furies in your life ! ' T is true , Lord Casimir , she 's false  --  she 's false . Cas . Casimir Upon the brink of hell thou liest , accursed fiend ! Car . Caraffa Go home , my cuckold lord  --  go home  --  go home ! You 'll find Count Basil in her warm embrace . Oh ! oh ! curses  --  false  --  false  --  Dies . Cas . Casimir Slave doubly damned , thou diest with a lie Upon thy lips to give thee pass to hell ! Was it a lie ? Could this fiend speak the truth ? If there be truth in man , it should appear At such a time ! but be they true or false , His words have plunged me in a fiercer hell Than that to which I 've sent his guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with Count Basil . " Accursed fiend , I say again thou liest ! And if my eyes informed me of such truth , I 'd tear the senses forth for mocking me ! Oh ! Enter Lorenzo . Lor . Lorenzo My lord , what hast thou done ? Cas . Casimir I slew that wretch , who would have wronged my wife ; Who told me ere he died , that she was false With the Count Basil . Lor . Lorenzo He lied ! Cas . Casimir You 're sure he lied ? I conjure you as you do love your life To speak the truth  --  you 're sure he lied ? Lor . Lorenzo As my soul lives , I do believe he lied ; He was an idle braggant , my good lord , Whose word in Venice , spite of has high place , Was not worth half a ducat . Cas . Casimir Yet with these bitter words The wretch breathed forth his last ! Lor . Lorenzo It is not strange , and only proves Him the more hardened villain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necks , Have lesser villains boasted of their crimes And died most unrepenting . Cas . Casimir Ha ! I had forgot ! how came he then To know that she was not Count Basil 's sister ? Not knowing this , he would not then  --  Lor . Lorenzo My lord , he knew all this ; by some foul means He gained possession of those documents . They 're even now upon him . Cas . Casimir ( taking the papers from Caraffa . ) True  --  true ! Lor . Lorenzo Besides , my lord , as you yourself do know , He bore a rooted enmity to you , And ' t was in vengeance he hath thus declared . Cas . Casimir I never did him injury . Lor . Lorenzo Your smiling fortune injured him . He envied you , but envied most of all Your rich possession of so fair a wife , Whom he did love with all that fierce desire That burns within the breast of lustful man  --  A passion , my good lord , whose fearful strength Hath oft unseated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Lor . Lorenzo Nay more , what I have lately heard  --  This monster once before Did offer insult to your noble lady ; Which she with such high dignity repelled As bred within him purpose of revenge . Cas . Casimir Oh ! damned villain ! Lor . Lorenzo These things from prudent motives she concealed Save from myself ; Then think'st thou that an enemy like this  --  A fiend who had not one redeeming gift  --  Is like be pleased to die , at your sword 's point , With truth upon his lips to comfort you ? Cas . Casimir Father , I thank you for those soothing words ! Still there is doubt  --  one course alone is left ! Mine eyes themselves shall be my witness proof  --  I 'll watch each action with the tiger 's stealth Till I am satisfied ! I care not that the sight may strike me blind , If I look on the act ! Lor . Lorenzo My lord , this course is wrong  --  unworthy of Your noble nature . Cas . Casimir Admit it wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case as this Our judgment is dethroned  --  the senses are The only proofs can ever satisfy A doubting husband 's heart ! If I prove wrong Name not the measure of my just atonement ; This heart will do more pennauce at the shrine Of outraged confidence , than ever heart Before conceived ! I 'll square me up with faith ! Lor . Lorenzo Oh ! heaven grant That there be need for such a reckoning ! My lord , Count Basil comes , I take my leave . Exit . Enter Basil . Basil . Basil My lord , I come to bid farewell to you . Cas . Casimir Farewell ! Bas . Basil Yes , my good lord , I have resolved To leave you for a while . Cas . Casimir And whither goest thou , Basil ? Bas . Basil To France , my lord . Cas .

Cas . Casimir Thou hast chosen thy service well ; And now before you leave us come again , That I may give you letters to King Francis , With such report from me , your latest general , As may be need for your more sure advancement . Bas . Basil My lord , It is the very favor that I meant To sue you for . Cas . Casimir Slight favor , boy ! You 'd bid farewell To Marinella ? She is within . Exit Basil , R.

I do call All heaven to judge I can not help myself ; This opportunity ne'er offers more ; And should I pass it now , the doubt would still Live in my heart , and like a poisoned thorn Keep rankling there for life . Enough ! I 'll go ! Exit . END OF ACT IV . ACT V.  --  SCENE I. Chamber in Casimir 's Palace .  --  Enters Marinella . Marinella . Marinella My fears are now confirmed , and I have found The secret of my heart  --  ' t is idle now To play the hypocrite , with mine own thoughts : In vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they but return again  --  Oh ! I am lost ! Yes  --  lost to happiness , but not to honor . This heart shall cease to beat Ere it prove false unto the sacred vow That binds me to my lord  --  What do I say ? Am I not false already ? Swore I not Upon my bridal morn to love my lord ? I did  --  I did ! I call to witness heaven , Before whose presence it was registered , That I knew not the nature of that oath ! The secret and the suffering be mine , Mine , mine , alone ! let it be buried here . Oh ! would that he Would seek a home in some far distant land , That we might never meet on earth again ! How if I made my secret known to him And from his generous heart claim in return This sacrifice ?  --  it shall be done ! Enters Basil . L. Basil . Basil Good day , my lady ! Marinella .

Basil To France ; I go to join The army of her king . Mar . Marinella The very course I would have counselled him . How easy is this parting hour to him  --  Oh ! little knows he what it costs this heart To say farewell to him . Aside This is a sudden resolution , Basil  --  How long , think'st thou , wilt thou be gone ? Bas . Basil I can not tell how long  --  perhaps forever . Mar . Marinella Forever ! Bas . Basil ' T is better far I never should return . Mar . Marinella Ha ! thou speakest strangely  --  evil fortune Has sure befallen : May I not know it , Basil ? My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bas . Basil Thanks , thanks !  --  It is an evil fortune where no friend Could bring relief . Mar . Marinella Basil , you make me sad  --  there was a time When you would have confided this to me . Enters Casimir , listening . Bas . Basil Shall I go forth , my exile unexplained , As though I had committed some gross crime I dare not tell to her , who all my life Has been the echo of my every thought ? She shall know all  --  the secret will not stay A moment longer in my bursting heart . Aside . But promise to forgive me , I will speak The cause of my departure ? Mar . Marinella Forgive you , Basil ? I know you would not give me such offence , As might require forgiveness . Bas . Basil It is  --  that I do love you , Marinella , Not with that sweet affection , I once felt , But the strong passionate love that lovers feel . Oh ! do not censure me  --  as I do live The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For I have erred but with a helpless fate . Mar . Marinella Since it is thus , Count Basil , it is well  --  You have resolved , in leaving Venice , well . Bas . Basil For the dear friendship of our youthful years , I could not thus go forth upon the world And leave to you such action unexplained . Mar . Marinella And is it fair since he hath thus disclosed That I should play the hypocrite , and hide My heart from him ? my cup of misery Is far less bitter now to bear than his ! It shall not be ! no , let the dregs be mixed That both may share their equal bitterness ! There is no wrong ! it is to him alone That it may lighten oft his long lone hours Of absent life ; I can not help myself ; I must speak out , ( aside . ) Basil ! Bas . Basil Madam ? Mar . Marinella I too have found a secret , I have longed Much to disclose to you . Bas . Basil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need not ask of you That it be kept a secret from the world : ' T was half my purpose , ere you told your love , To make this strange confession , And from your generous heart to ask of you , What youv'e already purposed , That we should part to meet no more on earth  --  ' T is what I would have asked , as the return Of my unhappy love ! Bas . Basil Your love ? for me ? is ' t possible ? Mar . Marinella Alas !  --  alas ! Bas . Basil Oh ! Marinella , do not tell me this ! Oh ! fatal destiny , all , all undone ! I thought the misery was mine alone , But you too now must share it , and perchance Lord Casimir  --  Mar . Marinella No  --  never , Basil ! Be it our sacrifice as ' t is our secret  --  If we 've been guilty in this hapless love , Let us make such atonement as we may ; Though in this life we can not rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my will As you of yours art master  --  we 'll use their power To save our honor and his happiness .

For me , be it my struggle to forget you . Bas . Basil Oh ! cruel fate ! Mar . Marinella My only joy will be to cherish him , With duty that will rival love itself : And though the smiles I wear belie my heart , ' Twill break ere I betray it ! Bas . Basil Oh , noble Casimir ! ' T would break his heart to know of this . Mar . Marinella He never shall ! Surely there is no guilt In such hypocrisy , whose only end Is my lord 's happiness . Bas . Basil Oh ! Marinella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marinella Perhaps in after years . Bas . Basil In after years ? Mar . Marinella The friendship I now feel may turn to love : So said Lorenzo  --  I am little skilled In the heart 's history . Bas . Basil Heaven make it so ! Mar . Marinella And now farewell forever ! Exeunt Marinella R. Basil L. Casimir . Casimir ( Comes down the stage . ) There 's no revenge in this ! In any case , the wronger 's blood Is but poor medicine to heal the heart Of him who has been wronged . That parting scene Hath robbed my dagger 's point of all its power  --  Unless that I should turn it on myself  --  Perhaps ' t were better so  --  this wedge of steel , In passing through my heart , could not inflict Within its bleeding strings one half the pang I feel already ! Now there 's but one course left for me  --  to die ! The rose-wreathed pedestal on which I stood Is crushed beneath my feet ; and I have fallen Amidst the wreck of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? by poison ?

( taking his sword , ) With thee , old friend , I go to seek my grave Where death assumes its most alluring aspect  --  On the battle field ! Enter Basil , hastily . Bas . Basil My lord , fly , fly ! your enemies are now Decreeing your destruction ! Cas . Casimir That , by my friends , has been decreed already . Bas . Basil The Duke and Ten determine on your death . Cas . Casimir I have myself determined on my death . Bas . Basil Hear me , my lord ; this moment as I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( showing papers , ) I overheard a scene  --  Cas . Casimir And I too , Basil , overheard a scene Hath caused this heart more poignant agony Than all the vengeance of the Duke and Ten Of torture could inflict ! Bas . Basil My lord , what can you mean ? Cas . Casimir I will not rack thy brain with riddles now  --  I 've been for the last hour within this chamber . Bas . Basil Heavens ! can it be so ? My lord , I do confess ; Denial or defence I can not make ; If thou decreest my death , I 'm ready now To die . Cas . Casimir Not half so ready , sir , as I  --  Think you I meant to slay you , gentle sir ? Bas . Basil It is your right ; my life is yours ; Take it , for I am weary of it now ! Cas . Casimir Oh !

You might have drawn upon me for my life , I would have given it willingly , All , all , but that ! Bas . Basil ( kneeling . ) Spare me , my lord ! Here is my sword , and here my naked breast  --  Take it  --  take forth my life , but wound me not With your too just reproach . Cas . Casimir Put up thy guilty weapon , boy ! Within the bitter cup that I have drunk There 's not one drop of vengeance ! Bas . Basil Oh my too generous lord ! My lord ? ( Pointing out . ) Cas .

Marinella Yes  --  sad , indeed  --  ( aside . ) I do my lord . Cas . Casimir ' T is natural at parting with a friend ; One so endeared as Basil was to you . Mar .

Casimir Oh ! noble sacrifice of a pure woman 's heart ! Marinella ? Mar . Marinella My lord ? Cas . Casimir I have a tale for you . Mar . Marinella What is ' t , my lord ? ( They sit . ) Cas . Casimir Far from the echoes of a troubled world , Within the soft embrace of vine-clad hills , There lay a sunny vale ; in whose warm lap Had art divine and nature more divine Poured out their wealth in very wantonness ! A valley of bright fields and emerald groves , Above whose glowing foliage lordly towers Rose to the sapphire sky ! upon the ear There fell no sounds that were not musical  --  The songs of birds and bees and falling waters , The voice of Nature 's God , as soft and sweet As when it thrilled through earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No storms came here , Alone the breeze from the blue Appenines Stole softly down among the perfumed trees , Filling the air with incense ! It was indeed a scene of loveliness And over all Hung a rich canopy of blue and gold  --  The sky of Italy ! Mar . Marinella Oh ! sweet , sweet scene  --  how like our own dear home ! Cas . Casimir Within this vale , A maid of noble lineage had been reared ; She was indeed the ideal of her sex :  --  The bright embodiment of love itself ! Of form so lovely , so divine a face , It seemed as if the spirit of the place Had gendered her , from out its glowing flowers , To make the picture perfect ! Mar . Marinella How beautiful ! Cas . Casimir This maiden had a brother , a brave youth ; Her father too still lived , a good old man , The sole possessor of all these fair scenes ' Midst which they dwelt in innocence and peace , Unclouded as their skies ! A stranger came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet vale  --  he soon became Its owner 's welcome guest  --  companion of The maiden and her brother ; He was their elder , yet had never loved , For his young days had all been rudely spent Within the camp , or on the battle field  --  But the rare beauty of this glowing maid Soon made its image on his yielding heart : And he did love , as only they can love , Whose youth 's and mandhood 's flame have both been blent Into one burning passion ! He was not skilled in love 's diplomacy , And knew not even how to woo the maid  --  He told the good old father of his love , Who wooed and won her for him : They were wed . She then was but a child and ill could know The nature of her vow ; but the old lord Fearing a malady that vexed him much , Desired thus soon to see his daughter wedded . Close on the bridal morn the father died So suddenly , that there was no one near , Save his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youth whom all the world Supposed his son , and brother of the maid , Was not his son , nor yet the maiden 's brother ! Mar . Marinella How strange , my lord , how like  --  Cas . Casimir Nay , hear me , Marinella , to the end  --  This sad confession was made known to all The stranger lord , the maiden , and the youth ; But they had grown together three such friends , They would not part , but lived like as before In the sweet commune of the common hearth ! Now grows my tale more sad : In time , the maiden found within her heart A feeling undefined , which never yet Had centred there , or only as a dream : It soon became developed  --  it was love ! Love not for him whom she had vowed to love , But for the foster brother ! The youth too loved the maid ; Nature had placed The germ within their hearts , where it had lain Amidst the darkness of an erring fate Till nature called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ; each struggled hard To stifle it  --  when they had striven in vain , Lest that their friend should suffer from the thing , Each then resolved to see the other one No more on earth :  --  they met at length to part ; ' T was then that first they knew each other 's love Confessed at parting  --  parting when confessed  --  And without even a kiss , they spoke the sad , Sad word , farewell ! Meanwhile the husband , from some circumstance , Had grown suspicious of his young wife 's love ; He was admonished when this parting scene Was to take place ; And , leaving for a moment honor 's path , became A witness to it all ! It broke his heart ! ( Marinella faints upon Casimir 's breast . ) Cold as the marble from Carrara 's mine Sweet  --  sweet  --  and cold !

It comes too late , but by its mellowing light I may die calmer ! Could love 's poor victims only know of this , It might bring case to many a bleeding heart ! Love unrequited feels not half its sting , When pity thus is poured into the wound . Oh ! I could almost live . Mar . Marinella Ah ! these men ! why are they here ? Oh !
