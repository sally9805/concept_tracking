Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : PREFACE . from The snow-drop ( 1842 ) When through the snowy cover Of winter veiling all the ground , By nature 's earnest lover The Snow-drop fair is found , He takes it to his bosom , Nor loves his floweret less , I ween , Because the little blossom In humble guise is seen . A simple flower I bring you ; My fragile offering kindly take ! A simple song I sing you , Oh ! love it for my sake ! I 've nursed my Snow-drop sadly , With smiles and tears of fear and hope , And mournfully and gladly I see its light leaves ope . I mourn for all the brightness , The Innocence , the guileless truth , The faith , the joy , the lightness , That blessed my early youth ! Yet I rejoice in feeling , That still e'en now , whene'er beguiled By childhood 's sweet revealing , I am again a child ! Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : THE HOURS OF YORE. from The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strain , That many a bard has sung before , That thousands yet will wake again ,  --  The hours of yore ! the hours of yore ! The hours of yore ! sweet childhood 's hours , When all the livelong day I played With sunbeams , butterflies , and flowers , And wavelets in the woodland glade . I cared not then for plumes and pearls  --  The forest leaves were gems to me , I wreathed them round my careless curls , And found a crown in every tree ! The murmuring fount my music made , I danced on Nature 's broidered floor , A queen was I in the woodland glade , A crowned queen , in hours of yore ! I deemed the flowers were all alive , I fancied birds could talk like me , And many an hour I 'd listening strive To think what could their meaning be ! I did not sigh for wealth or pleasure ; If through the leaves a sunbeam stole , I called the ray my golden treasure , And blessed its beauty in my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , sage ! half-crazed with mystic lore , Sing , sing with me the sad refrain , " The hours of yore ! the hours of yore ! " Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : TO A LITTLE GIRL WHO SAID " I WILL DO IT TOMORROW . " from The snow-drop ( 1842 ) Have you any thing to do ? Go directly and begin it ; Stay not even to read this through ; Go and do it ,  --  now ,  --  this minute ! Just suppose , yon budding Rose , Your procrastination showing , Like you ,  --  loving long repose ,  --  Lazily should put off blowing !  --  Put it off from day to day , Just as you do ,  --  still delaying , Till the summer fades away , And the northern blast is playing ! Chilled to torpor , ' neath the sky , Where the wintry tempests roar ,  --  Ca n't you hear the poor thing sigh ,  --  " Oh ! that I had bloomed before ! " Now 's the time ! your Youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Fan it with the zephyr 's wing , Nurse it in the sun and shower ! Else in life 's cold winter-hour , When the tears of age are flowing , You will hear your spirit-flower Sigh because it put off growing ! Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : THE CHILD AND ITS ANGEL-PLAYMATE. from The snow-drop ( 1842 ) " My child ! thou droopest like a flower , That trembles ' neath the summer shower , And day by day , and hour by hour , More faint thy meek replying To tender questionings of mine ; A dreamy sorrow , half divine , Fills those dark eyes , that strangely shine ; My child , my child ! thou ' rt dying ! " " Sweet mother  --  no ! but by my side , Where'er I go , " the child replied , " Through all this glorious summer-tide , Is one , you can not see  --  A little child with sunny wings , And eyes like Heaven ;  --  of holy things , With earnest voice , it talks and sings  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ! ' it warbles low ; And when I say , ' I dare not so ! My home is here , ' it whispers  --  ' No ! Fair child ! thy home is mine ! ' And then , of some far lovelier land It fondly tells , where many a band Of blissful children , hand in hand , With sportive fondness twine . It says , they know not how to sigh , For nothing there can droop and die ; But bloom immortal glads the eye , And music wondrous sweet Doth ebb and flow , without alloy , From lyres of light , while Love and Joy Time to the tune , their blest employ , With weariless winged feet ! A purer prayer it teaches me , Than that I idly learned of thee ; It softens all my thoughtless glee , It makes me true and kind . My angel-playmate ! most I fear , ' T will wave its wings and leave me here ! ' Thou'lt miss me in that holier sphere ! Oh ! leave me not behind ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A daily waste of mortal breath , And still its sweet voice summoneth Me to that other land ; But even while it whispers so , The flowers around more brightly glow , And yet  --  and yet , I pine to go , And join that joyous band ! My mother ! Ill come often back ; I 'll not forget the homeward track , But oft when Pain and Sorrow rack Thy frame , I 'll hover o'er thee ; I 'll sing thee every soothing lay , I learn in Heaven ;  --  I 'll lead the way For thee to God ;  --  my wings shall play In dreams of light before thee ! Oh ! mother ! even now I hear Melodious murmurs in my ear ; The child  --  the angel-child is near ! I see its light wings glow ! I see its pure and pleading smile ! It moves beside me all the while , Its eyes my yearning soul beguile , Sweet mother ! let me go ! Hark to their plaintive spirit-strain ! ' Let us go home ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! My play-mate ! stay for me ! It clasps my hand ! It warbles low  --  ' Let us go home ! ' I go  --  I go ! My pinions play  --  with heavenly glow  --  My mother  --  I am free ! " The fair child lay upon her breast , As if in its accustomed rest , A slumbering dove within its nest . But well the mother knew That never more that pure , blue eye To her 's would speak the soul 's reply ; " She is not dead  --  she could not die ! My child in Heaven ! adieu ! " Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : TO A LITTLE GIRL , DISAPPOINTED IN A WALK . from The snow-drop ( 1842 ) Child ! you grieve because Clouds are in the air , Rule the weather in your heart , Make it summer there ! Tears of vain regret Dim your downcast eyes , Let the sunlight of the soul , Laughing , through them rise ! Clouds of sullen grief O'er your spirit go , Let the smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bow of Heaven , Beaming , bending there , All your sorrowing soul shall span , With its beauty rare ! Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : TO A CRICKET . from The snow-drop ( 1842 ) Cheerful , little , chirping cricket ! Thank you for your serenade ! Gaily , lightly , all the evening , You , your fairy lute have played . In some corner , dark and lonely , All unseen , unfound you sing ; By your merry music only Do we know you , happy thing ! So should I the lesson treasure ; Lone like you , without a name , Sing my song for others ' pleasure , Caring not for praise or fame . Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : LITTLE FANNY 'S ERROR . from The snow-drop ( 1842 ) Fanny shuts her roguish eyes , Then , because she can not see , Little simpleton ! she cries , " Ah ! you ca n't see me ! " Fanny 's like the sinner vain , Who , with spirit shut and dim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him ! Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : MARY 'S TALK WITH THE STAR . from The snow-drop ( 1842 ) " Star ! star ! lovely star ! " Little Mary cried in glee , " Come from your blue house afar ! Come and play with me ! " " Child ! child ! darling child ! " Warbled soft the star above , And , in Mary 's eyes , it smiled , With a look of love ,  --  " Child ! child of hope and glee ! " Silver-soft the star replied , " Come to Heaven and play with me ! On the rainbow ride ! I to you may never bend ; But your being 's law , from Heaven Is to still in light ascend , Till it be forgiven . Little flower of Joy and Love ! " Silver-soft the starlight sighed , " Mary ! come and bloom above ! Here no tempests chide . In a beaming , golden boat , Plying still my pearly oar , Through the great , calm Heaven I float , Singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bid them flutter free ! Wander home from that cold world , Come and play with me ! " Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : ELLEN AND THE ROSES . from The snow-drop ( 1842 ) The child was athirst , and stretched her hand To a flower-filled , crystal vase close by , With a pleading smile and an accent bland ;  --  " Nay ! that ' s for the roses , love , " said I. She gazed at them , and she gazed at me , Young thought had awakened a dawning star ! And it shone in her eyes , as she asked in glee , " Are the Roses drinking the water , Mama ? " Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : A HYMN . from The snow-drop ( 1842 ) Approach not the altar , With gloom in thy soul , Nor let thy feet falter , From terror 's control ! God loves not the sadness Of fear and mistrust ; Oh ! serve him with gladness , The gentle , the Just ! His bounty is tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendor The blue arch above ! Confiding , believing , Oh ! enter always " His courts with thanksgiving , His portals with praise ! " Nor come to the temple With pride in thy mien ; But lowly and simple In courage serene , Bring meekly before Him The faith of a child , Bow down and adore Him With heart undefiled ! Then " by the still waters And through the green shade , " With Zion 's glad daughters , Thy paths shall be made ! Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : TRUST IN HEAVEN . from The snow-drop ( 1842 ) The coldest hour of all the night Precedes the sunrise-shining ;  --  The wildest cloud , though dark to sight , Has still " its silver lining .

And have you not in rapture smiled , And talked in whispers sweet and low About your play , your griefs , and joys , And begged the baby not to go , And promised it your prettiest toys ? I have ,  --  I often do ;  --  Mama Thinks all young children thus are blest , That infant angels come from far , To watch and share their sinless rest . And , Julia , when again I hear My spirit-playmate 's accent clear , And see again the wavy gleam Of golden winglets , in my dream , I 'll tell the angel-child of you , And pressing on its lip of dew A loving kiss , I 'll bid it fly To where you in your beauty lie , And bring me in another trip A message from your own sweet lip !
