txt WHEN we see so close an analogy between the natural body and the body politic , in their gradual advance from infancy to maturity , in their healthy and diseased action , and in their self-preserving power to remedy the evils they may chance to encounter , we are naturally led to extend it still farther , and to suppose that , as the animal body has , by the laws of its structure , a certain term of existence which it can not transcend , so must political communities have their old age and death , as well as their infancy and manhood . But this is carrying the parallel too far . Governments may be more correctly compared with species than with individuals-while the latter flourish for a time and then pass away , the former have the power of perpetual renovation . The dissolution of a government , then , not being a necessary condition of its existence , it behoves a people who have one created by themselves and fashioned to their tastes and circumstances , to consider the remote as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , that they may devise means of prevention where practicable , and mitigate what they can neither prevent nor cure . Our inducements thus to look ahead are peculiarly strong when we recollect the extraordinary capacities of our country , and the career of glory for which it seems marked out . Its destinies are , in some sort , in the hands of the present generation . Here , too , the great problem is to be solved , whether man is capable of selfgovernment , or whether those artificial forms which prevail in the old world , and which seem to us adapted to that state of ignorance in which they originated , are necessary in an advanced stage of intelligence . Most of us are , indeed , apt to consider that this question has already been settled . Our present government has been tried for half a century , during which our success , when examined by the ordinary tests of good government , has been unexampled . But the rest of the world refuses to abide by this experiment , and they insist that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is due to the peculiar circumstances of our country-that since these are temporary , our government is destined to encounter trials of which it has as yet had no experience . We are bound , we think , in candor to admit this . The frame of government which has worked admirably in one state of society may be unsuited to another . Let us , then , both as patriots and honest searchers after truth , seriously inquire into the dangers which we are likely to encounter in those changes of condition to which we may look forward , see how far they may be obviated , and what will be the probable extent of the mischief , where they are irremediable . The dangers which may be supposed most to threaten the success of our great experiment , may be referred to the character of our polity , both as to its complexity and its democracy ; to the diversity of feelings and interests in the different States ; and to the diversity between classes of the people in the same State . These comprehend all that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may occasion its downfall . On each of them we propose to bestow some consideration . One of the most obvious dangers to which the permanency of our system seems exposed , arises from the complexity of its structure , by which the attributes of sovereignty are so distributed // between . the general and State governments , that some of them are exercised by one of these governments exclusively , and some others by both concurrently . This part of our polity has always been viewed by us with peculiar favor , from its enabling us to combine the highest degree of civil freedom with our vast extent of country . In any other system than ours , the two things would be utterly irreconcilable . No single national government could make laws or execute them so as to suit the diverse tastes and circumstances of the several States ; and though it could , the power and influence required for those objects would be greater than could be safely trusted . Overcoming , either gradually or by sudden violence , all checks devised for its control , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our present system , every State is left free to make all its laws which more nearly touch the individual interests and concerns of man-those which establish rules of property , regulate contracts , define and punish crimes , provide for the preservation of morals , the means of instruction , the facilities of intercourse  --  and to adapt them to its . local circumstances , its usages , its feelings , and its tastes . The functions of the general government are , on the other hand , limited to the subjects of national defence , of foreign intercourse , and two or three minor objects , in which peculiar considerations made uniformity desirable , as in the post-office , coining money , and naturalizing foreigners . We may form some idea of the benignant character of our local legislation by reflecting upon the large proportion of those State laws which have long held an undisturbed place in the State codes , because they were suited to the circumstances of their respective States , and which would never have been enacted by a national legislature . In our ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union and the several States , we are under an illusion produced by this very excellence of the State governments . Questions relating to the national government generally excite a livelier interest among our citizens than mere local State questions . Yet this is not because they are intrinsically more interesting , but because the others are commonly so regulated as to give general satisfaction . They faithfully reflect the feelings and opinions in each State . Let us only suppose the improbable fact that a State legislature should make a radical alteration , not called for by public opinion , in the law of descents or in the criminal law . We should find that the sentiments of the community would not be confined , as in our federal politics , to newspaper discussion and occasional public addresses , but that one general burst of indignation would break out in every corner of the State , cause the prompt repeal of the odious law , and consign the faithless representative to lasting ignominy . Yet this machinery , which produces such admirable results , is liable to disturbance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For our political engine to perform its destined part , each government must exercise its due portion of power , and no more . If the States appropriate more than their share , the general government can not discharge its high national functions . If the latter arrogates undue powers the citizen is affected in his dearest interests , and the safeguards of liberty are weakened . In either case , the stability of the system is endangered . The framers of the national government have endeavored to secure us against these hazards by a written constitution , in which the powers assigned to it , and thus , virtually , those retained by the States , were , as they hoped , so carefully marked out , as to preclude uncertainty or dispute . But this was , in the nature of things , utterly impracticable . From two causes , inseparable from man , their purpose was unattainable . These are , the impossibility of foreseeing all the cases that may arise , and consequently , of devising rules adapted to such multifarious occasions ; and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will not admit of different interpretations , both from the inherent uncertainty of language , and the disposition which men have , both purposely and unconsciously , to interpret it according to their passions and interests . Is this a mere speculation of fancy , or does it accord with our actual experience ? During the half century that the present form of government has been in operation , how many are the laws passed by the federal legislature which some of the States have regarded as inconsistent with the Constitution , and in some insthnces , have been tempted openly to resist ? There was the law which laid a tax on carriages , that which established // a bank , the *edition law , the law repealing the judiciary act of 1799 . Then the power of affording direct protection to manufactures ; that of laying an indefinite embargo ; the power over the militia of the States , of making roads or canals , of appropriating money to a purpose not specified in the Constitution , of admitting new States not comprehended within the limits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation , and of the jurisdiction of the federal courts , have all been subjects of warm and obstinate dispute , besides many others of minor interest . Though on several of these questions ambitious politicians , in their struggles for power , and mercenary men , looking only to emolument , have taken sides , without much regard to what was the true meaning of the Constitution , yet it is reasonable to suppose that most of our citizens honestly differed about them , and in the sincerity of their convictions some of the questions have agitated the public mind to its centre , and threatened nothing less than open resistance to authority . Even the sedition law , which has been pronounced unconstitutional by the most unequivocal evidence , was deemed to be clearly constitutional by one of the most honest and acute men we have ever known , and he held and avowed that opinion to the day of his death. * Nor is the mischief from this source confined to acts of the general government . The States too may assert contested powers , and may even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectually destroyed by putting a weight in one scale as in the other . The State legislatures are likely to interpret the Constitution in their favor in all cases that are doubtful , or can be made to appear so ; and , in some cases , so as to frustrate salutary powers given to the general government . Thus , many believe that the Constitution meant to prohibit any State from making a paper currency of any kind ; and , consequently , that , in creating banks with State capital , whose notes constitute much of the money of the State , and were so intended , they violated this prohibition . So they may pass laws violating the obligation of contracts ; refuse obedience to federal laws , passed forregulating the militia , orforpur poses of revenue . Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , New York , Virginia , Illinois , Georgia , &amp;c. , have all passed laws which have been pronounced unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States ; some of which laws have been carried into execution . The questions which have thus atisen may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power they assert , the General Government has exceeded its authority when it has attempted to restrict that power . If , however , they are wrong , the States are disturbing that equilibrium which they all agreed to establish . It is easy to see from these examples , stated from memory , and which it would require no great diligence of research to extend , that our written Constitution , however indispensable in organizing the government , and quieting the jealousy of the States , has been as yet very fruitful of controversy , and may be expected to continue so . Yet we must submit to this evil , if we would prescribe a law to the legislature . XVe could not have had union without a written constitution , and we can not have such a constitution without differing and disputing about its interpretation . It is true that most of these questions have passed away with no more serious mischief than the temporary effervescence they produced , and some of them are already forgotten . Yet we can not confidently pronounce that they will always prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storms of a hundred winters , may yield to a more furious hurricane at last . It behoves every good citizen , who wishes to perpetuate the government which secures to us so many blessings , to do what he can to mitigate these dissensions ; we can not hope to be exempt from them altogether . With this view some well-meaning persons offer a notable recipe , which they call strict construction . Yet , so far as we have observed , those who are very rigid in their interpretation of some parts of the Constitution , are equally liberal in construing others ; for the great cause in the difference in the interpretation of that instrument is the difference of men 's feelings and interests ; and , since they differ about the distribution of power between the general and State governments , he who is strict in construing the // powers he wishes to abridge , will be latitudinous in construing those he wishes to enlarge . On this point men may be always expected to disagree ; but to those who feel no strong bias either way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only practical and consistent rule , and that is , to give that construction which seems most obvious to common sense-that which the people , when they ratified the Constitution , may be presumed to have attached to it ; and that which they will be likely to give it , when appealed to in the last resort . With this view , philological niceties , ingenious subtleties , and wiredrawn distinctions , such as we often see pressed into the service in constitutional discussions , should be peremptorily rejected . Accommodating ourselves to the rule of action of our ultimate arbiter , we should endeavor to give that interpretation which , without deviating from the words , will best promote the great ends of national security , liberty and prosperity for which the government was created . Although we can not confidently pronounce that agitations from this source may never prove more disastrous than they have done , yet there are many circumstances that are well fitted to soothe our apprehensions on this point . In the first place , it may be presumed that the questions concerning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in importance , are very likely to have already occurred ; and , in whatever way they may have been withdrawn from the forum of the people , they will not probably be revived . What Congress would again enact a sedition law , or lay an indefinite embargo ? If , however , some of these questions should be again agitated , or others of equal interest should present themselves , they will be somewhat less likely to inflame the passions of our citizens , from the recollection that similar questions , once deemed vital , have proved comparatively insignificant , or have passed into oblivion . The soldier acquires firmness in battle by being familiarized to danger , and by finding that the hazards of death , which seem at first so imminent , are far less than those of escape . Dangers to the Constitution , like all others , are alarming in proportion as they are new . When the amended Constitution of Virginia was under discussion , and the question whether the slaves should make part of the basis of representation , threatened to break up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as deeply for the public welfare as any member of the body , but was not misled by his fears , coolly remarked to some of the alarmists , " I have been in a convention before . " Besides , good and brave men , who watch over the safety of the State , and regard their country 's welfare as yet dearer than their own , become both more confident and more skillful in healing these irritations , and in lighting upon some happy compromise , by which the enkindled passions of men are soothed , their jarring interests reconciled , the plighted honor of heated partisanship is saved , and a spirit of mutual conciliation restored to the community . The opponents of a law deemed unconstitutional are further encouraged to forbearance by the conviction , drawn from many examples , that , if they are clearly right , the peaceful , but efficient remedy of a change of the public agents is at hand ; and the more satisfied men are of the truth and justness of their views , the more confidently will they expect this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival ; just as we find that those injuries which in savage life could be atoned for only by the blood of the aggressor , are , in a state of civilization , quietly left to the avenging power of the laws . And lastly , time will have its accustomed effect of increasing the veneration of our citizens for the Constitution . It will be associated in their minds with every great and glorious act achieved under it , whether civic or military ; and with the prospect of national greatness which lies before us . What is now the dim future to us will be the well-defined past to them , and these interesting reminiscences will give new fervor to their love of country , and to all that is connected with it . We are aware that a late intelligent traveller in this country has expressed the opinion that the power of the individual States is increasing , and that of the national government diminishing ; and that , in this way , our system carries with it the seeds of its own destruction . Though M. De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he has examined our institutions more in the spirit of philosophy than any other European traveller , or rather , we may say , he is the only one who has so examined them ; and though many of his specula // tions , both favorable and unfavorable , indicate a depth and soundness of reflection remarkable for one of his years , yet some of his most important views manifest that want of accurate knowledge which is to be expected in a stranger . He mistakes accidental and varying circumstances for uniform and permanent results of our social system . Where he is right as to their character , he sometimes mistakes the cause ; and he prematurely forms a theory from too small a number of facts . Of this description is the opinion in question . It is probably as yet too soon to decide which power will preponderate in the equilibrium our Constitution meant to establish , but many of our profoundest thinkers believe that the general government is gradually gaining , and the States gradually losing , their relative weights in the system . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional band to the Union , and gives additional power to the general government . It is true that we have seen many instances in which States have disregarded or contravened acts of the federal government ; but many of them not beingof general moment , and exciting but a transient interest , they have been unnoticed . The play was not worth the candle . It is also true that , where a number of neighboring States combine to oppose important measures of the national government , that government may sometimes find it prudent to temporize , and not attempt to enforce what it believes to be its legitimate authority . This was the case when most of the New England States refused to place their militia under the control of the national Executive . But that case was singular in all its circumstances . It may never again happen that the general government will put the loyalty of so large a portion of the Union to so severe a test as did that embargo ; or that equally strong considerations of prudence will prevent the general government from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extremely rare ; and though the sympathy of States similarly circumstanced , would seem to be a natural and powerful motive of cooperation , we find that , on these occasions of resistance to the laws of the Union , the other States promptly rally round the national standard to compel obedience . The insurrection in Pennsylvania was put down , not by a standing army , but by thevolunteer militia of other States ; and during the resistance of South Carolina to a tariff which she regarded as unequal , unjust , and unconstitutional , we believe that , in all the neighboring States , though they had the same cause of complaint as herself , and some of them yet greater , there was a majority of the people who disapproved her course , and would not have supported her in the event of an appeal to force . Our government is now in a course of experiment , and the reflecting portion of our citizens , justly appreciating its merits as to civil liberty , and the thousand blessings she brings in her train , watch its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their weight into the scale of the Union or of the States , as time and circumstances shall show is required , and to weaken or strengthen the powers of the component parts-to restrict or retain the executive veto-to alter or continue the appointing powerto regulate the elections to the federal legislature by the national government , or to leave it to the States , as they think that a weight should be added here , or taken away there , for the proper adjustment of the complex machinery . This conservative power , active , sagacious , unceasing in its vigilance , and , though marked by no badge of office , silently pervading the whole community , seems to have been overlooked , or not sufficiently appreciated by M. De Tocqueville . As to the evil auguries of other European commentators , they are , compared with his , the niaiserie of children , and of spiteful children too . There seems then to be nothing in our frame of government which is inconsistent with its permanency ; on the contrary , it is endued with the faculty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this faculty it will retain as long as the character of the people for intelligence and love of freedom remains unchanged . But prolific sources of dissension meet our view when we look at the diversity of interests and pursuits among the several States . Some are largely engaged in shipping and foreign commerce , while others are shut out from the ocean . Some are extensively employed in manufactures , others principally in agriculture . Some permit domestic slavery , others prohibit it . Some contain large quantities of the public lands , others , not an acre . Some are in contact with the Indians , others are so separated from them as // hardly to know of their existence . In some , the population is homogeneous ; in others , it is made up of foreigners and natives . Some , being large , have much more than an equal share of political power ; and others , being small , have much less . In these several points of diversity , we find most of the principal sources of discord among communities ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure which would not have different , and even opposite effects in different States . Here are certainly many causes of disagreement , but let us not overrate them . It is often the diversity which produces harmony , not discord . Some of the most striking points of difference are fitted to draw the States closer together , rather than to separate them , and to bind them in the strongest of all bonds , that of mutual benefit . The difference in their leading occupations and pursuits is the foundation of a profitable commercial intercourse , and consequently , of good feeling , instead of that jealousy which sometimes arises between communities whose productions and pursuits are the same . The manufacturing States find in the agricultural the best vent for their fabrics , while these again find in the others a growing market for their redundant produce ; and in this way , the peculiar advantages possessed by each portion are imparted to both . Whatever doubts may be entertained about the benefits of free trade between different nations , there can be none about those between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural relation in which the States stand to each other , by reason of their diversity of interests and pursuits ; hut this diversity has incidentally been , and is yet likely to be , the parent of dissension in another way . Many of the States , not content with the advantages they intrinsically possess , seek to enhance these advantages by askin* of the general government the total or partial exclusion of foreign competition , by which means the other States would be shut out from the greater cheapness of foreign articles . In this way those other States consider themselves virtually taxed for the benefit of the manufacturing States , whether they buy the foreign . article subjected to the tax , or the similar article made at home . We shall not now stop to inquire whether these complaints of injustice are well founded , or , supposing they are , whether the injustice is compensated . It is suf ficient for our purpose that the question has made the States seriously differ about the policy of the general government-some insisting that foreign industry and capital should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their right of buying wherever they can buy cheapest . On a sober view of this question , it seems , under existing circumstances , to present no serious ground for difference in practical poliey . It is admitted that the ordinary expenses of the general government , which must naturally somewhat increase with the increase of population and extension of settlement , can not be reduced under twenty-four or twenty-five millions a year . To raise this revenue , there is no way so easy , . both to the government and the people and so economical , as by the impost But to raise it on articles exclusively produced abroad , such as tea , coffee , silk , wine , and the finer fabrics of the loom , as the opponents of the tariff wish , and as would unquestionably hear equally on all the States , would be utterly impracticable . Low duties would fail , from the insufficiency of the amount imported , and high duties would equally fail , both because they would be evaded , and would lessen consumption . We must then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are both produced at home and imported from abroad ; and all duties thus laid must operate as an encouragement to the domestic producer . Of the duties thus laid , if the manufacturing States pay less than their proportion , the inequality admits of no remedy which would not be worse than the evil itself . In addition to the consideration which has just been mentioned , there are causes which will more and more tend to allay the irritation produced by the subject . The States which can advantageously engage in manufactures will increase with the increasing density of population , and the motives for asking protection will be less strong , as the market furnished by the consuming States is diminished . Manufacturing industry and skill too , are making more or less progress in all the States , and to the same extent that they are diffused is the inequality among the States reduced . A further , but more distant , ground for expecting the influence of this question to decline , is to be found in that reduction of the price of labor which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the home market which will defy // all foreign competition . Our distance from the workshops of Europe and Asia already profits our domestic manufacturers more than the tariff  --  and this protection the smugglers have no means of evading  --  but when the price of labor in those countries ! and in this , shall lose somewhat of its present disparity , the distance will be decisive . The same effect will be accelerated by the increasing substitution of machinery for human labor , and the rapid accumulation of capital in our country . And lastly , we may hope that sound principles of political economy will be better understood , and more strictly pursued , by the mass of our citizens , than they have been heretofore . Though much of this vexed question may , doubtless , be resolved into one of local interests , yet very many also embrace erroneous opinions concerning it from an honest conviction of their truth . A better knowledge of the science will tend to harmonize many of those who now stand in the relation of angry disputants . The difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did once threaten to produce discord between the Atlantic and the Western portions of the Union , but the wise policy of discontinuing sales on credit , by which so many of our XVestern citizens were placed in the delicate relation of debtors to the government , arrested the danger ; and now , on the subject of these lands , most of the Western States , and a large majority of their population , have precisely the same interest in the disposal of these lands as the Atlantic States . There is , however , a difference in the interior polity of the States which is more threatening than any we have mentioned , and which it behoves every man who regards the Union as the anchor of our political safety to watch closely and unceasingly . It so happens that one half these States , continuing the usages of their ancestors , hold in domestic slavery another race of men , and , believing that race to be inferior to their own , they are unwilling to admit them to an equality with themselves , and think they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the States who are exempt from this class of persons , in their zeal for civil freedom , or abstract claims of humanity , endeavor , by every means in their power to bring about the emancipation of these slaves ; and , when their passions are thus enkindled , their animosity to the master is often in proportion to their sympathy for the slave . Their taunts and reproaches naturally react on those to whom they are addressed , and thus the breach is ever widening between them . Time , however , is silently at work , and will bring a remedy for this source of internal dissension . Before the lapse of the present century , most of the States now permitting slavery , will be impelled by self-interest and a moral necessity to put an end to it . In that time , human labor , obeying the general law of declining in value with its increase in quantity , will have so fallen as to make the rearing of slaves unprofitable , when , of course , slavery , in some mode or other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction of the misapplied sympathy of the abolitionists , of the unwarranted interference of the citizens of one State with the interior policy of another , are so deeply impressed on a large majority of the citizens of every State , and especially of those who are most intelligent and respectable , that this source of civil strife can never produce any more serious consequence than to afford materials to those who follow the craft and mystery of politics , to inflame the prejudices of one part of the country against another , and so far to adnlterate the purity of our popular elections . But is there not a real danger to the peace and integrity of our confederate republic in that party strife which rages here so furiously and unceasingly ? Without doubt , in all free countries , there are always arising questions , before which , for the time , all others disappear , and which divide the people into two distinct and hostile communities . This war of opinion gives new force to all our affections , good and evil , and if party attachments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the ties of blood-so party animosities are more bitter and unappeasable than any other . If this feeling has Samson 's strength , it has his blindness too . Swayed by its illusions , merits are enhanced or diminished , faults are exaggerated or overlooked , as they belong to men of one sect or the other . Scarce any talent , service , or merit is acknowledged except where it is accompanied with orthodoxy or party questions ; nor is there an error or vice , or hardly even a crime , over which party zeal will not throw its protecting shield ; and we may every day see such instances of its illusive power as was afforded by a female supporter of Wilkes , who , in de // fence of his horribly distorted vision , denied that he squinted ; " if he did , it was not more than a gentleman ought to squint . " Since , then , this propensity in men to differ and dispute , to love those who agree with them in feeling and opinion , and hate those who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to hope to eradicate it ; so long as we take an interest in public affairs and are free to discuss them , it may be thought that we should be reconciled to its mischiefs , grievous as they sometimes are , for the blessings of that civil freedom , of which they are the certain sign , and the never failing attendant , just as we reconcile ourselves to the occasional explosions of steam engines by the recollection of their preponderating benefits , or are not disposed to forego the uses of fire because it sometimes causes ruinous conflagrations . But it is urged by some , who admit that party conflicts are inseparable from civil liberty , that they are here carried to an unexampled excess-that , in other countries , this fevered state of the public mind is only occasional , while here it is constant . In others , such agitations merely ruffle the surface of society , but here they upheave the whole mass from the bottom ; and that this excess is the more dangerous in this country , because there is less here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out into action . Of this excess there can be no question , and it is plainly referable to the character of our people , as well as of its government ; for nowhere does the great body of the community think , and feel , and speak so much about public measures as here . Party spirit , then , animates the whole mass ; and every citizen , whether he points to the north pole or the south , obeys the magnetic influence . And although a regard to the public interest is the motive which actuates most men in uniting themselves with a party , yet , after a while , according to a well-known principle , what was first regarded as means becomes afterwards the end ; and thus the interests of the country are merged in those of the party . When these divisions are once formed , pride , emulation , the desire of distinction , the contagious sympathy with numbers , and that disguised form of self-love , the esprit de corps , all concur to swell the tide of feeling , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human breast . It may be further remarked , that party disputes are never more violent than when they are founded on mere differences of opinion , and of no opinions so much as those of a general or abstract character . Thus , where party zeal has turned on religious doctrines , it has exhibited peculiar force ; and questions about the forms of government and the proper distribution of political power , have kindled livelier passions than the immediate acts of the government . Now , we can not say what questions of this kind are in store for us - what quillets of constitutional lawwhat new principles of policy or morals - what ultra doctrines of political freedom may hereafter arise ; and , intoxicating men 's minds with their subtle essence , hurry them into the wildest excesses of madness and folly . Who could have believed thirty years ago that the circunistance , whether a man was a freemason or not would more affect his snpposed fitness for the office of President , than whether he preferred beef to muttonwore a black coat or a brown one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we know not what dogmas may be erected into tests of merit , nor what reaction such arbitrary caprices may produce . Such are the reflections which are likely to present themselves when we look at the operations of party spirit in this country . But , on a further consideration of the subject , we may find much to make us more tolerant of the evil , and to allay our fears that time will aggravate its mischiefs . Besides that party strife is an incident to civil freedom , it now also serves to satisfy a want of our moral nature . According to that nature , we must feel as well as think ; and however men may differ about their capacity for thought , their powers of feeling are substantially the same . The mind craves emotion of some sort , and must have it . With the uncultivated , if it is not found in pursuits of gain , in war , in love , in spectacle , they are apt to resort to the bottle , or the exciting hazards of the gaming table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have the inure force with us from the present circumstances of the country . They thus may sometimes prevent vicious stimulants , and yet wilder fanaticism ; and as our country advances and improves , a part of this moral heat may be conducted off by the gentler excitements of literature , of the arts , and other refinements of civilization . // In the mean time may we be permitted to make a suggestion , by which some of the asperity of party spirit will be smoothed ? Every one must have observed that in the frequent shiftings of party questions , and of the relation of individuals to them , men are , ever and anon , finding themselves with new associates : to-day estranged from one who was yesterday his friend , and fighting side by side by another who bad been his bitter opponent . In such a situation he is sure to see , if he has been honest in his change , merits in his new friends , which he had previously overlooked ; and he is likely to feel no small self-reproach for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moral virus of party prejudice to bear in mind , that he whom we are now disposed to regard with alienation , will , in all probability be by and by our friend , to whom , though now he turns on us a frigid if not a hostile look , we shall be warmed by kindred feelings , and be linked in some common cause of public interest . In like manner , when we become separated from those with whom we once acted , let the remembrance of our former friendly relations keep down our rising wrath . In this course there is a concurrence between Christian benevolence and worldly prudence that does not always exist . What , we would ask , is there in party contestswhat in the triumphs of victory-what in its vain applause , to compare with those feelings of kindness and forbearance which give to the cup of life its purest pleasures and most uncloying sweets ? There is another source of civil discord , which is independent of all political measures , of all party contests for power , or of speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which may be supposed to increase with the increase of the destitute class . In every community those who are distinguished by talents , public services , wealth , or the lustre of their connections , arrogate a superiority over those who are less favored , and form themselves into a separate class ; while the others are impatient of these claims , and are ever contesting them . Society is thus divided into the cqi1*-ii and the of whom , as was said of Ca*sar and Pompey , one can not bear an equal , and the other a superior . The seeds of this aristocratic pride and democratic resentment exist everywhere , but they are most developed in countries that are most free . One of them exceeds in moral strength , the other in physical ; and there might seem to be danger of their conflicts producing civil commotion . Now , the prominent questions which are ever agitating the public mind here-such as the choice of a President or the distribution of political power-make so many cross divisions which break up the other parties into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arisloi nor the latter against the people . Though these parties are ever on the watch to assert and maintain their respective sentiments , and readily incline to that side in the other divisions which seems to have most affinity with their own , yet on almost all great questions , the greater number of both are found co-operating warmly and indiscriminately on the same side . And thus our vehement party disputes , with - all their mischiefs , save us from the danger from this deep-rooted and permanent source of dissension . As our population advances not only very rapidly but at very unequal rates in its Atlantic and Western portions , we should be on our guard against the effects of those changes of relative weight which must necessarily ensue . Hitherto the Atlantic States have had the preponderance of numbers , and consequently of political power , and our national policy has been adapted to that state of things . But in twenty years , or less , the Western States will have the ascendency , which will be constantly increasing . At present we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to arise when power shall thus pass the eqainoctial line . Yet it is possible that views peculiar to the Western portion of the confederacy may present themselves , and that it may use its power in conformity with such views . Suppose , for example , what is , however , very improbable , that the Western States should be disposed to adopt the Chinese policy as to foreign commerce , and , inviting all nations to trade with us , to witlidraxv from the ocean , and thus save ourselves the expense of supporting a navy . Such a policy would seem to the Atlantic States suicidal , and would be opposed as all vital questions are . But we will state a more probable cause of difference . We see that the tide of our population presses on to the West with a force which nothing but the Pacific can arrest . Will this mighty current deflect to the right , so as not to touch the territory now occupied by our red brethren , and solemnly guaranteed to them forever ? Not only national honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but humanity and justice will confirm it with the right-minded portion of our citizens , both of the East and the West . Yet will these liberal and just sentiments prevent bickerings and disputes between our citizens and the Indians , where their respective territories touch ? Can any measures of precaution secure us against such collision ? And when a continued course of mutual aggression , such as has always taken place under similar circumstances , has inflamed the passions of both parties , what can lirevent the quarrel from extending to the neighboring States , and growing into open war ? a war which we might consider would be one of extermination , and of short continuance , if we had not lately seen that a few hundreds of this brave people , when driven to despair , and favored by the localities of the country , may defy the efforts of more than as many thousands of our well-appointed troops . And , though our reiterated attacks would , no doubt , finally prove victorious , yet at what a prodigious cost , not only of money but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , what is yet more to he deprecated , at what a cost of national character . When such a disastrous issue seems so probable , ought we not to prepare in time to adopt the only course by which it may be prevented , and that the incorporation of these Indians with the people of the United States ? Let us assign to them a term of probation , at the end of which they may become , according to their numbers , members of the federal union . On this subject we have little popular prejudice to encounter-none that can not be easily overcome . This race is remarkable for some of man 's noblest virtues . Courage , both in daring and suffering ; veracity , fidelity to engagements , and an indomitable love of freedom . XVe have , in them , no evidence of that intellectual inferiority commonly attributed to the African race . There are but few of their descendants among us , but of those few , an unusually large proportion are among the distinguished of the land . Three we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor of Louisiana ; another is now a Judge in Virginia ; and the third had the power of enchaining attention by his bold imagery , his burning words and cutting sarcasm , beyond any man of his day . Who has not noticed the unusually fine appearance of their *623 deputies to this city , and especially of those who traced their descent both from the white and the red race ? Their robust , well-proportioned frames , their manly beauty , their inborn dignity of demeanor , and their excellent sense , little aided , as it is , by instruction , was well calculated to suggest the theory that the mixture of the two races was an improvement on both . Be this as it may , it may be safely asserted that we should not be discredited by the association ; and the bill , a few years since submitted to the consideration of Congress , of giving the tribes , lately established beyond the Mississippi , a federal government , to prepare them for admission into the Union , appeared to me to be as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add , are not only children of the same family , but are much seldomer seen apart than some of our legislators seem to suppose . Of the dangers , of which we have hitherto spoken , we have already had a foretaste . The dissensions of our citizens arising from collisions between the general and the State goverments , and those growing out of a difference of interests , pursuits or opinions , have been experienced in more force , in some instances , than they are hereafter likely to exert . But we may , in the process of time , encounter dissensions of a different description , which may put our political system to a yet severer test . Our population is , at present , in most of the States , very thin , and will continue to be comparatively so , until our whole vacant territory is occupied . Its density will then , everywhere , steadily , though slowly , increase , until it reaches , or approaches , that of European countries of similar climate and fertility . In this state of things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , a class of persons possessing property , and a much larger class without it . Can these two classes live together in peace and harmony , when they possess an equal share of political power ? or must our government change its character , and have infused into it new vigor and means of restraint , suited to the new order of things ? And , lastly , suppose such a change requisite , will it be practicable ? These are questions about which reflecting minds may be divided , and their momentous character well justifies us in pushing our speculations into the future , for the purpose of anticipating the effects of this change in our social condition , especially when it is not so remote but // that some of the present generation may live to see it . However favored may be the circumstances of a country , and whatever its aggregate wealth , the great mass of its people must be poor . Even in England , with a degree of opulence such as the world has never before seen , if her whole annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each individual would not amount to more than from seventy to eighty dollars , which would be barely sufficient to give to each one the means of plain and comfortable subsistence , at the price they bear in that country , and not enough to do that , according to the standard which prevails in the United States . In this country , though , on such a distr*ution , the proportionate share would , in quantity , be larger than it is in England , the money price would be less ; that is , from sixty to sixty-five dollars-enough to furnish the comforts of life on a very simple scale , and nothing more . But this income is , and must ever be , very unequally distributed . Fortune blindly rewards some men , but the virtues of industry , integrity and prudence , a far greater number ; and in the same degree that some have more than their proportionate share , others must have less . We know that many have an income one hundred times as large as the average , and some in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have less than the average , must be proportionate . Thus , if there he one in a hundred who have but fifty times the average income , then the average income of the rest of the community , that is , ninety-nine hundredths , would be reduced to one half the average  --  a pittance barely sufficient to sustain life , which many obtain by honest labor ; but some are fain to seek it by crime , or fraud , or beggary , and a portion , not obtaining it , experience the miseries of hunger , disease , and premature death . Such would seem to be the condition of every civilized community . By far the largest portion are dependent upon their daily labor for the means of subsistence ; those means are necessarily small , and gradually diminish with the increasing density of population . The gradual rise in the price of raw produce , or the gradual fall in the price of labor , are but different modes of expressing this fact . Such a class as we have here supposed , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and well-being of society , by its numbers , its necessities , and the vices and crimes engendered by its ignorance and wants . Looking with envious discontent on those who are in affluence or ease , desirous of change and confusion , by which they may gain , but can not lose , they will be ready to follow any leader who will give them bread , or promise it . Nor is it necessary that the worst passions of this class should be appealed to , since plausible pretexts for reformation can always be devised by the cunning and unprincipled demagogue , sufficient for minds so undiscriminating , and so easily yielding to impressions , so that the better portion of the destitute class often unite with the worst , in riot , ontracre and disorder . Such is the character of the populace in Europe , and signs of the rise of a similar class may be occasionally seen in our largest cities . To guard against these mischiefs , which strike at the root of society , and which have their seat in the appetites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , government , it is urged , must be armed with an adequate physical force ; and political power , moreover , must be withheld from those who are so incapable of rightfully exercising it , and would be so sure to abuse it . Even the system of representation affords no security with such a constituency , for the representative will faithfully reflect the feelings and opinions of those who have chosen him . If they favor a liberal and enlightened policy , so will he ; if one that is narrow-minded and unjust , as certainly will lie . If they wish to defraud their creditors , he too will be a repudiator . If they wish to lay an unequal tax on the rich , he is their willing instrument . The government must then have the power to quell commotion , or rather to keep it from rising ; and that power must be exercised only by those who have intelligence and independence . So far you may , in a densely peopled community , extend the elective franchise , and no further . Such is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imply a considerable change from our present political system , and a far less degree of civil freedom than we now possess . They would not only disfranchise a large part-perhaps much the largest part of the community  --  but it supposes a degree of power in the Executive which sometimes may be brought to bear upon // 625 the honest and loyal , as well as on the Vicious and lawless , and which may lead to further encroachments . It has been from such small beginnings that military usurpation , profiting by the proper moment , has taken its rise , and that monarchies have been reared on the ruins of republican government . This remedy may thus create a worse disease than it cures . But will it be necessary to alter the distribution of political power ? and when our population becomes dense , may not our democratic institutions be retained in their present form , or with only such slight modifications as experience shall clearly point out ? There are many circumstances to favor these agreeable anticipations . In the first place , the class which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country than it is in any part of Europe . Equality of civil rights , though it can not produce equality of property , tends to lessen the inequality . It keeps the avenues to profitable employment , whether in public office , or by the efforts of industry , open to all competitors , and it cherishes the pride of personal independence . Here are no laws of primogeniture-no privileged orders-no enormous salaries-no monopolies to favorites-no means of perpetuating property in the same familiesas exist in other countries ; by all of which the inequality of property is increased and maintained . On this account , property , which is now more equally distributed in this country than in any other , is likely to continue so , and consequently , the class of the destitute to be proportionally diminished . Nor is this all . Many of those who are without property , seeing the field of competition open to all , and that a large proportion of those who have attained affluence or distinction , were once as poor as themselves , are encouraged to hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same security for their obedience to the laws as would the possession of property . But in the next place the poorest class with us is not likely to . be so poor as the correspondent class on the old Continent , from the peculiar circumstances of the American people . We know that , in the regular progress of society , the population of a country is in proportion to its means of subsistence , and that this has been no less the case when its people were in the condition of hunters , as the aborigines of this continent , with scarcely one to the square mile , than when they amount to two or three hundred . The population is thus always up to the level of the food , and , without doubt , the increasing demand for food , occasioned by increasing numbers , has been the parent of husbandry and all the other arts by which human aliment is augmented . The state of things has , however , been very different in this country . Here , a people possessed of those useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i*country which contained not more than one to a square mile . Hence , while in other countries population has been determined by subsistence , here subsistence has been determined by population . In consequence of these peculiar circumstances , there has always been here a liberal rate of subsistence , such as is not seen , and probably never has been seen , in any part of the Old World . Now , when a people become habituated to so liberal a standard of comfort , they are likely to cling to it , and thus the preventive checks to redundancy may be expected to operate sooner here than they have done elsewhere , and to keep down our population to the means of liberal subsistence ; or , if they can not reach that point , they will greatly tend to reduce the number of that needy , ignorant , and desperate class of which we have been speaking . Our last , census shows conclusively that the moral checks have already begun to operate in this country , though the means of subsistence have been all the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if , in the progress of society , the influence of intelligence andproperty is , on some accounts , diminished by the increased numbers and votes of the ignorant and necessitous , that influence is , on other accounts , augmented by the increased dependency of the destitute class on the others for employment and subsistence . Every large land-owner or ship-owner , every great manufacturer or miner , has an influence over those he employs , far greater in a dense , than a thin population ; and this influence , having its foundation in the nature of man , furnishes a further security against the supposed danger from the class without property . We are likely to have another security which must not be overlooked ; as popular ignorance is one of the principal elements of the mischief , it is consoling that the ignorant class will ever probably be // unusually small in this country . The policy of diffusing instruction among the people is of such obvious benefit , and is so vital in democratic governments , that it is a popular measure in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools are so general as in some of the States , and in the others , they are steadily increasing . Greater density of numbers , so far from checking the diffusion of this benefit , will give new facilities to it , as experience has already shown us . May we not also count something on that extraordinary respect for the laws which is manifested by our citizens , and which generally characterizes democratic governments ? By far the greater number of the laws being promotive of the public interest , and , in fact , dictated by the popular will , the people have the strongest motives to respect , as well as obey them , and thus the sentiment becomes by habit engrafted in the character of the people . Hence it is , that at our largest and most tumultuous assemblies , one may see thousands yield the same obedience to a constable as in most countries is yielded only to the armed bands of the government . On all these accounts the fears entertained by some that our political system is not suited to a dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils to which we are even now e4osed , without carrying our speculations to a distant future . The great merit of a democratic government is , that the people will , for their own sakes , aim at good laws-laws which are suited to their circumstances-which impose light duties , and secure personal rights ; and although they may , sometimes through ignorance , mistake their true interests , in most cases , the sagacity of self-love is too unerring for this . But the preceding theory , it must be recollected , supposes only that the interests of the majority will be promoted in good faith , and with effect . Now , it may sometimes happen that the interests , as it often does , that the wishes of the two parties into which all free States are commonly divided , will be directly opposite , and on these occasions , there is always danger that the majority will be unjust to the minority-we do not mean by disappointing their wishes , but by departing from those principles of right which all recognize and profess to respect-that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a sense of duty . Thus , to give examples , the majority of a State legislature may so unequally arrange the election districts as to secure to themselves more than their fair proportion of political power . They may appropriate to themselves all the public offices , and put incapable men in the place of those of tried skill and integrity , on the ground that " to the victors belong the spoils , " and they may so adjust the revenue laws as to make them bear more heavily on the minority than the majority . In these ways may minorities be deprived of their just share of political power , and robbed of their property . These flagrant wrongs are not peculiar to any party . They arise in all free governments , and are incidents of human weakness . Is there any remedy for the evil ? There can be none by any device of organization , which might not at times , as formerly in Poland , paralyze the necessary action of the government . Would constitutional provisions avail ? Party leaders are too ingenious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible to satisfy their indiscriminating followers , and are sometimes reckless enough to make boldness supply the place of ingenuity . There then can be be no remedy for this injustice , but improving the moral sense of the community . All good men must endeavor to give new force to that rule of action which is written on the human heart , and is man 's law to himself . The very lively interest which the people of the United States take in the election of their chief magistrate threatens also , as some think , the future peace and stability of the Union . At every successive election , this interest is likely to increase , both from the increase of the President 's patronage , and the growing power and importance of the nation of which he is the head ; and as the weight and dignity of the office augrpents , the voters not only increase in number , but also somewhat alter in character . The recollection that the contest , in this election , is one in which millions are engaged , will , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and produce a fervor of feeling which may lead to the most serious civil commotions . The rapid growth of our cities , and the steady increase of the needy , ignorant and vicious , who are the ready instruments of the ambitious intriguer , greatly enhance the mischief . When we see the causes of // danger thus increasing , who can say that we shall be always able to escape them ? While the storm is yet rising , we can not be sure that the ship may not continually founder . Such are the gloomy anticipations , not only of those who look with unfriendly eyes on our institutions , but of many of our citizens , whose love of country shows itself in over-anxious fear about the future . That the presidential election will be an object of increasing interest we can not doubt , but that the interest will be at all in proportion to his increase of power , or that of the nation , may well be questioned . In the contest of 1800 , between Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a third of their present amount , the people were as much excited as at this time . Even if the interest were to go on increasing , it is too much to suppose that it would lead to the predicted consequences . Such an opinion is utterly inconsistent with that love of order , and that habitual respect for the laws which mark the character of the American people , and which temper their deportment in the wildest paroxysms of party zeal . Broken heads and bloody noses , so familiar in some countries in popular elections , are unknown here , except now and then in some of the cities , and where too most of the actors are foreigners who have not yet been disciplined into sobriety by a government of equal laws . This part of our political system has ever been the favorite occasion of evil augury , whether men predicted what they feared or what they hoped . They first insisted that the weight of General Washington 's character kept the frail structure of the federal government together , and that after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to go on as well under his immediate successors , the effect was then ascribed to the great names of the Revolution . But these have passed away , and it is found that for its safety and healthy action it is indebted to its own inherent vis medicatrix , and that strong as it has already proved , it is ever gaining new strength by time . Yet the interest taken in the election of President , though not fraught with such disastrous consequences , is still mischievous ; and it would be desirable to lessen somewhat of this absorbing feeling , which not only painfully agitates the nation , but in no small degree diverts it from objects of more intrinsic importance , and more direct bearing on the national welfare . How can this be done ? We know of no means except those of abridging the term for which he is eligible , and lessening his power and patronage . The framers of the Constitution seemed to fear that the federal Executive would be too weak for the legislature , but experience has shown that their fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against majorities of both Houses in Congress has been far more frequently used of late than formerly . Should this exercise of executive power become familiar , it would give to that branch of the government a share in legislation , and even of initiating laws which would destroy the lines of separation its framers thought it wise to draw . Though these and similar changes might not cure the evil of excessive popular agitation in electing a President , they could scarcely fail to mitigate it. * If there are dangers to our government , in common with all others that are free , from the sway of sinister passions-from We are strengthened in these views by the reasoning of alate conspicuous member of thi5 Institute , who perished by that terrible accident on hoard the Princeton , which threw the nation into mourning , and deprived Virginia of three of her most cherished sons . Judge Upahur , who was fast attaining the same eminence as a statesman , he had previously reached as an orator and jurist , in his able tract on the Constitution of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive has a growing power , which ought to be diminished . Concurringwithhim in these views , we were farfrom concurring mall , more especially as to the rights which he asserts for the individual States ; and we had promised ourselves the pleasure of conversing with him on some of the political topics on which we both had reflected , and of learning from him whether , since he had seen the working of the government from a new position , some of his former opinions were not materially modified , but alas ! all that we expect , as well as all that we possess , hangs by a brittle threTad : " Omnia sunt hominum tenui pendentia fib Et subito casu , qure vabuere mont . " His work , already a text-book to the advocate for the rights of the States , may be profitably read by all who would be well acquainted with the theory of the federal Constitution . // agitations and commotions-from that sudden ebullition of feeling in which the virtue of moral restraint evaporates , and right and wrong are melted down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character ? May not our political system perish by paralysis as well as by fever ? May not our splendid hopes be eventually marred by our too great strength instead of* weakness ? It is easy to see that these States will , in the course of two or three generations more , attain a degree of power and wealth of which the world presents no example . In this state of confident strength , shall we engage in a career of conquest , or shall we gradually fall into a state of torpor ? For the first , there appears to be no adequate field , even if democratic jealousy should see no objection to it . Longbefore the period to which we advert , the destinies of Canada and Mexico will be determined . They will give us no provocation , whether the one renjains independent and united , or the other becomes so . They will either have been incorporated with these States , or , more probably , neighbors too far inferior to them to excite fear or jealousy , or even to keep alive a military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possible that the energies of our people may decline , for want of adequate causes to call it forth , and that we may sink into a listlessness similar to that of the Chinese ? Though that precise result should not take place , is there not danger that we may want sufficient motives of national emulation when we have greatly surpassed in numbers , wealth and strength all the nations with which we have intercourse ? Every species of human excellence is mainly the effect of exercise and the desire of excelling-from the art which makes a nail to that which produces a poem or a statue  --  and to this emulation between individuals must be added national rivalry to call forth the utmost powers of which man is capable . What nations of this earth have elevated our species to the highest point of excellence in letters , arts or arms ? They are , first , the Greeks , among whose little States there was an unremitting struggle for superiority or independence , and also for distinction at those remarkable institutions , the Olympic and other games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind assembled from every part of Greece , to attain honor for themselves and their country . And those States with which the rivalry was the greatest , because they were most nearly equal in power , were the Athenians and Spartans , who both , though in very different ways , exhibited human nature in its greatest exaltation . Then the Romans and Carthaginians , in their struggle for superiority , excelled in the art of war , and those virtues it most favors , all their contemporaries . The Italian States , long afterwards , produced the same result in painting , sculpture and architecture . Who have taken the lead among the moderns in letters , science , arms , and the useful arts ? England and France , who , by the emulation stimulated by neighborhood , and the animosity it is so apt to engender , have put the higher faculties of our nature in requisition , and given them the most energetic and unremitted exercise . Spain and Portugal were never so great as when they felt this same animating principle in their commercial enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her contest with Great Britain for naval supremacy , exhibited a degree of vigor and power altogether disproportioned to her numbers , and which was truly astonishing . It would not be difficult to extend this list , and perhaps it would not be going too far to aver , that no nation ever attained a high place in the scale of human greatness , in which the force of this principle of national emulation may not be distinctly traced . But it is indispensable to this spirit of rivalry that there should be some approach to equality between the parties-some ground for hope that extraordinary efforts will be crowned with success . As soon as the disparity is too great for dispute , and to be above the probability of change , ' the emulation ceases . It has continued longer between France and England than in the other instances , and therefore the effects have been greater in advancing both nations . Shall we not , then , be likely to want this great , and , as it would seem , indispensable incentive to the exertion which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall not . The source of it is to be found in the separateness of the States of our con The Greeks , says Cicero , thought it nearlyfas great an honor to obtain a prize at these games as a triumph at Rome : " Hoc est apud Grtecos prope majus et gloriosius quam Romn triumphesse. " // federacy , together with the important attributes of sovereignty retained by them . By reason of their large powers and numerous important functions , they are felt to be distinct communities ; and they are , with their resl ) ective citizens , much more the object of love of country than the general government . This will be yet more the case hereafter , when the migrations of our citizens , which greatly weakens this sentiment , will be less considerable than at present ; and in the same degree that their native States are objects of affection and pride , will be the emulation among the citizens of the different States . Signs of this rivalry may already be seen , and it may be expected to grow as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emulation has everywhere been most strong in communities most advanced . In one part of our country , or with one class , we may expect to see rivalship in commerce and manufactures ; in another , in the arts ; in another , in literature . The masterpoet of Ohio will be compared with that of Massachusetts or Connecticut ; the historian of New York with that of Illi nois or Michigan ; the architecture or sculpture of Pennsylvania with those of Maryland ; the orators of Virginia with those of South Carolina or Kentucky . In this way the amor patrice and the lauduel immensa cupido* will lend new force to each other , and all the human faculties will have the incentives and the exercise necessary to their full development . Thus viewing the benefits of rivalry , we find consolation for the occasional dissensions among the States , and we see a further argument against their consolidation9 It would indeed be better if our citizens could follow the noble advice of Aristides , when he proposed to his ancient rival that they should contend who should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinterested virtue are too rare to be relied on , and our hopes of the well-being of States must rest on principles of action that are common , not on those that are extraordinary . It is , then , to State pride and State patriotism , alloyed as it may be with State jealousy , that we are to look for the full development of all our faculties , and the ultimate fulfillment of some of our most splendid visions of national glory.
