txt AMONG the sermons of Dr. Barrow is to be found one on " industry in our particular calling as gentle . men , " in which the author naturally sets out with the inquiry , what is the particular calling of a man , whose rank according to the old English notion of the term , made it unbecoming for him to labor , except in one or two of the professions , and whose estate rendered labor unnecessary . If it be true , says Barrow , that no labor or trouble can be exacted of a gentleman , " then truly he is a sad piece , the most inconsiderable , the most despicable , the most pitiful and wretched creature in the world . If it is his privilege to do nothing , it is his privilege to be most unhappy . " He then goes on to consider the duti*s of the gentleman arising from his wealth and station in society . It is his business , among other things , " to protect the weak , to rescue the oppressed , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be such a gentleman and so employed as Job was who did not eat his morsel alone , so that the fatherless did not eat thereof , who deliver . ed the poor that cried , and the fatherless , and him that had none to help him . It is his business to be hospitable , kind , and helpful to strangers , following those noble gentlemen , Abraham and Lot , who were so ready to invite and entertain strangers with bountiful courtesy . It is his business to maintain peace and appease dissensions among his neighbors , interposing his counsel and authority thereto ; whereto he bath that brave gentleman , Moses , recommended for his pattern . It is his business to promote the welfare and prosperity of his country , with his best endeavors and by his interest ; in which practice the sacred history doth propound divers gallant gentlemen , Joseph , Moses , Samuel , Nehemiah , David Mordecai , and all such renowned patriots , to guide him . " To these duties " the very nature of gentility or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author analyzes into two elements , courage and courtesy . rp he former , says he , J ' is not seen in a flaunting garb , or strutting deportment ; not in hectorly ruffian-like swaggering or huffing ; not in high looks or big words ; but in stout and gallant deeds , employing vigor of mind and heart 10 achieve them . Courtesy again " doth not consist in modish forms of address , or complimental expressions , or hollow professions , commonly void of meaning // or sincerity ; but in real perform . ances of beneficence , when occasion doth invite , and in waiting for opportunities to do good . " The sermon closes with a passage commending the example of Christ to gentlemen , which is not unexceptionable on the score of good taste . " In such works of beneficence it was that the truest and greatest pattern of gentility that ever was , did employ himself . Who was that ? Even our Lord himself ; for he had no particular trade or profession ; no man can be more loose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had less need of business or painstaking than he ; for he had a vast estate , being heir of all things , all the world being at his disposal . Yet did he find work for himself , and continually was employed in performing service to God , and imparting benefits to men ; nor was ever industry exercised on earth comparable to his . " We find fault with this passage not only for a punning levity peculiar to the age of Barrow , and for overlooking the " form of a servant " in which Christ appeared for our salvation , but also because it attempts to confine , so to speak , within a gilded rim , a picture of boundless grandeur and rnagnificence , to limit a great ideal by the forms of a modern conventional class . And this last objection will apply to what Barrow says of those " noble gentlemen , Abraham and Lot , that brave gentleman , Moses , " and other worthies of the Old Testament . As we should laugh at a painter for representing Abraham in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we feel that it is a descent from the dignity of the ideal , when a term peculiar to modern civilization is applied to the ancient saints . It is right , it is in conformity with the laws of thought , and serves a good moral purpose to look at them with a veneration which the particular coloring of modern society would destroy . And with regard to our Lord we may add , that just as it would have been a degradation to him , the ideal and type of perfect manhood , to have appeared robed in splendor , and surrounded by pomp , so also to conceive of him under any form of life implying an outward condition of opulence , is to conceive of him below his true character . These passages of Barrow are deserving of notice as an attempt to idealize a notion which at first attached itself to a certain rank and station in society . Such attempts the human mind is perpetually making ; for , if we mistake not , the meaning of a vast many words are ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral sense . The gentleman of the middle ages was a man of gentle birth ; which gentility itself was traceable back for the most part to some military ancestor , whose bravery had secured for his family a considerable domain . With this elevated condition of life , a certain style , demeanor and address , which become a mtin placed in the most favorable circumstances , are first associated in thought ; and afterwards those moral and social traits , which a nation or an age ascribe to the higher specimens of manhood . It is remarked by Mr. Lieber that the word gentleman , which is used nearly five hundred times in Shakespeare , hardly ever designates there the true modern gentleman , but almost exclusively a nobleman or a man of the higher classes , with polished and graceful manners . So little had the word in that age got clear of the outward scaffolding by means of which it was constructed , and which needed to be pulled away in order that its fair proportions might be manifest . In the present age , when rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for civilizing and // polishing society , and educated men find in the creations of literature higher standards of moral and social character than the highest classes themselves can furnish ; the tendency to idealize the character of a gentleman , to divorce the term altogether from the wealth and rank which attended it at first , must be on the increase . And it is one of the proofs of a moral advancement that the term , although often unmeaning and used to denote merely the externals , such as manner and dress , in its nobler sense suggests moral quality of a high order . In our country where rank and its influence , except through novels and continental travelers of the baser sort , are unknown , the term is destined to have one of these widely different acceptations ; either that outward one in which only what strikes the eye is considered or the inward one in which many of the most pleasing and admirable traits of character are united . The gentleman for us will he either any well-dressed , well-behaved man , any one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the man who in the qualities of his nature is supposed to approach to a high standard of manhood . The two meanings are naturally connected as we shall hereafter see . At present an inquiry of considerable interest arises as to the qualities essential to the gentlemanly character . Are they determinate or vague ; and can they be reduced to any fundamental idea ? And we may ask also whether it is important for a man in this country , who has adopted the high standard of character which the Scriptures give us , to aim at the gentlemanly character ; or whether it is not enough for him to adopt perfection for his watchword , and trust that the greater  --  the Christianwill involve and evolve the less-the gentle man . To the first question , what constitutes the gentlemanly character , the following reply is given by Professor Francis Lieber , in his Political Ethics , while treating of another subject . " Society is not only interested in a general gentlenianlike intercourse , on account of general convenience or refinement ; but free states are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gentlemanlike behavior , founded upon a nice feeling of that honor , which is ashamed of doing any thing even slightly mean ; upon mutual acknowledgment and readiness to serve , or absence of selfishness , and upon habitual avoidance of what may hurt our neighbor , which elements are perhaps the most prominent in the character of the true gentleman . " The same able and useful writer has discussed this subject at length in an address delivered before the students of Miami University , in the summer of 1846 . He speaks first of the character of the gentleman in general , and then in certain particular spheres-those of the divine , the lawyer , the physician , the journalist and the politician . We extract a passage or two , bearing upon the meaning or essence of the term . " I believe it signifies that character , which is distinguished by strict honor , self-possession , forbearance , generous as well as refined feelings , and polished deportment ,  --  a character to which all meanness , explosive irritableness , and peevish fi-etfulness are alien ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veracity , courage , both moral and physical , dignity , selfrespect , a studious avoidance of giving offense to others , or oppressing them , and liberality in thought , argument and conduct are habitual , and have become natural . Perhaps we are justified in saying that the character of the gentleman implies an addition of refine . ment of feeling and loftiness of conduct , to the rigid dictates of morality and purifying precepts of religion . It seems to me that w* always connect the ideas of honor , polish , collectedness of mind , and liberal disposition , with the word gentle . man , and feel that its antagonistic characters are-if you permit me in the spirit of philosophical inquiry , to use words , some of which do not often find a belitting place // The True Gentleman . in a gentlemanly discourse  --  the clown , the gossip , the backbiter , the dullard , coward , braggart , fretter , swaggerer , bully , ruffian and the blackguard . " - pp. 14,15 . After making the remark that the present type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he accounts for this circumstance chiefly from the broader civil liberty of England , which inspired the upper classes with a consciousness of rights and a respect for the rights of others , and with a greater regard for veracity than the subjects of despotic states could entertain . But to Christianity it is , according to Prof. Lieber , that we are indebted for the ability to conceive this character in its fulness . We extract another passage bearing on the characteristic traits of the geutleman , which occurs somewhat later in the address . " We shall find , " says he " That the calmness of mind which we have acknowledged as a constituent of'the character ofthe gentleman , naturally leads him to use temperate language , and prevents him from indulging in careless vulgarity , unmanly exaggeration or violent coarseness . The kindness of his feelings prevents him from vaunting ; moroseness and asperity are foreign to him , and his forbearance as wett as generosity make him the safe keeper of secrets , even without the special exaction of secrecy . He is not meddlesnme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep positive secrets , but to abstain from talking about the personal affairs of others , to be suspended only when there is a positive and specific reason for so doing . He keeps a secret , even though it give him power over an antagonist , because a secret of this kind is power , and a generous use of all power is one of the essential attributes of the true gentleman . In discussions he shows his true character , not only by his calmness and by abstaining from offensive positiveness , but also by the fairness of his arguments . He does not recur to those many fallacies , which , though they belong to vulgar minds , or whose employment shows that we consider our adversaries as such , are nevertheless not without their effect in t ) risk disputes . The well-bred gentleman gladly seizes upon those minor yet delicate attentions , which , though apparently trifling , are cheering tokens of a friendly heart , and may be compared to graceful fiowerets growing by the roadside of the rugged and toilsome path of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a familiar term , off-hand in his intercourse with friends ; he delights in serving others , and in turn feels the luxury of being grateful . Above all , it pains him to give pain ; and he does and feels all that we have mentioned without affectation , selfishness , dryness or pedantry. " - pp. 46 , 50 . In these and other parts of his address , Dr. Lieber has correctly delineated the gentleman , in many of his most important traits ; but has failed , as it seems to us , both in giving a notion precise enough of the character which he describes , and in referring it back to its original elements . It is our purpose to attempt this analysis as briefly as possible ; and if we fail by seizing upon too many elements or too few , it must be our consolation that such an analysis has not been within our knowledge often attempted . The notion of the gentleman then , so far as its elements are of an ethical nattire , is confined to that part of morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and man ; and consists chiefly of an unusual delicacy of feeling and judging concerning duties in that sphere , united with a spirit to conform to the law of right thus perceived . On the one hand then , the gentleman is something more than a man of good mor. als : he is a man who engrafts on morality of conduct , as usually understood , a regard to the law of right action in those minute points which are apt to escape the ordinary eye . And on the other hand , the character of the gentleman as such , has tiothing to do immediately with his relations to God ; although it is true , and a most important truth , that none , however highly endowed by nature and however lofty in his aims , can be a true gentleman in the highest sense of the term , without that spirit of piety and that sense of obligation to God , by which , more than by all things else , men are assisted in the discharge of their duties to one an-484 4 , Oct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral element ; but to this must be added a nice sense of the beautiful and the becoming , so that the external form may correspond to the internal endowments , and the moral impulses maybe powerfully assisted , as they ought to be , by taste and the love of beauty . And in order that a man so endowed may act freely in trying circumstances , he must have a calm atd courageous spirit , one in which self-possession or the power of collecting himself in emergencies and of forming rational judgments on a sudden , as well as superiority to fear , will enable him to judge and act , with no law controlling his soul besides the law of right . These two latter qualities connected with temperament and constitution , are conditions without which the others , the primary and essential qualities , can not be fully manifested . Our definition , if abridged , will be something like this : the gentleman is the man who closely conforms to the laws of honor and of politeness , and to the law of the beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts . On each part of this definition we shall dwell for a few moments . We must first explain what we mean by the law of honor . Paley , a man of strong sense , but with no delicate or deep moral sentiments , looking at society in its corrupt state , defines the law of honor to be a system of rules made by people of fashion , in order to facilitate their intercourse with one another . This definition is both too broad and superficial . It is too broad , because it would include within this system of rules , kindness and politeness , which certainly help the intercourse of people of fashion ; and superficial , because we may still ask what is that which disturbs human intercourse ; whether it is not referrible to some grand division of morality ; and whether it can be supposed that even corrupt people of fashion have social laws among themselves , which arise without a seeming or real moral basis . Or it may be said again , that honor is merely regard for per . sonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fluctuating and uncertain , as the opinions of the society in which we live . Shame guards the rule from violation , whatever it be , as remorse that of conscience . Nor need the feeling , it may be said , be called forth merely when others are cognizant of our actions ; but even in secret and unobserved conduct , the imaginative faculty makes us conceive of others as real eye-witnesses , and thus a dishonorable action , although shrouded in darkness , may excite shame and a sense of self-degradation in the more susceptible of mankind . We object to this account of honor , as equally applicable to all our judgments concerning right and the beautiful , and therefore as proving too much . It may be said with the same justice that men get their notions of duty from others , that morality is merely the creature of opinion , that this opinion takes its rise in a perception of what is for men s interests ; and even that remorse is nothing but the pain felt in opposing it . It may be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beautiful , and that here too , there is no standard except opinion founded on the pleasant . Now as we feel that right and the beautiful are distinct in idea from pleasure and happiness , and are eternal realities , so we must believe that there is an apparatus within the mind , whereby it can decide what is right or beautiful , without ever knowing what other men think ; and that opinion governs partly with reason , because an unprejudiced community is more likely to decide aright upon a point of duty or a question of taste than a single individual , and partly without reason , through the unthinking carelessness of most men who // exercise not their own minds upon such matters . And some believe that the honorable is a branch of the right , and that the truly honorable man is one who has a sense of right , at least in one particular direction . One may feel pained by the censure of others , whether he has pursued an honorable or a dishonorable course ,  --  the pain is the burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or false ,  --  but he can not do a dishonorable deed , if in the main an honorable man , without a pain of soul which men 's opinion has nothing to do with , which the lens within burns into him . If then there is something of a moral nature , deserving to be called honor besides the sense of reputation with which honor is often confounded , what is this something , and in what division of morals may it be found ? Wordsworth has attempted to tell us in a sonnet of which we will quote a few lines . Say , what is honor ? t is the finest sense Ofjustice , which the human mind can frame , Intent each lurking frailty to diselaim , And guard the way of life from all offense , Suffered or done . It is true , the poet in this sonnet speaks of national honor , but the principle here , as with honesty , is the same in nations and individuals . We believe that the definition in the first verse is a happy one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception of what the law of suum cuique ' including of course our own claims upon others , requires . The honorable is but a department of that great division of morals , justice ; and the man of honor is one who has such quickly instinctive as well as nicely sensitive perceptions of what this law imposes on him in intercourse with others as well as of what it demands from them for the preservation of his rights and social position , that he feels the smallest violations , and carefully avoids them . As an objective thing the law of true honor , - if it could well be reduced to a code and did not with more efficacy appear in the judgments and conduct of finely constituted menwould be a system of rules for the government of conduct in the minuter shadings of human relations , the duties in which are not obvious to every mind . These nicer shadings of human relations exist chiefly in the case of our equals , with whom we have a more unrestricted and intimate converse . Equals are in continual danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so than inferiors and superiors . The relation in the latter case more readily suggests the conduct due between the parties , is more easily adjusted and less intimate . The relation between equals may be compared to the scales of a balance kept in equipoise ; that between inferiors and superiors to the scales when one is weighed down and the other empty . It is far easier to produce a preponderance than an equipoise , and there is but one point where the scales in even balance will place themselves . Hence it is seen why moralists , like Paley , define the law of honor to be a code governing the conduct of equals toward one another . But there is no reason why it should be confined within this narrow circle . The same just spirit , which prompts a man to yield to his equals all their dues , will recognize what is owed to or due from a superior , or an inferior in the intercourse of life , and thus St. Paul 's rule will be observed , " fear to whom fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing the feeling of honor must include a delicacy of perception of one 's own rights and those of others , and a corresponding delicacy of conscience in case of violation by one 's self , and of resentment in case of violation by others . The feeling will well compare with what we call tenderness of conscience , which consists of two parts , one pertaining to the rational // nature and consisting of judgments concerning right and wrong , and the other to the sensitive nature and manifested by keenness of self-reproach , when you have yourself committed wrong , or strength of moral disapprobation when the wrong is another 's . We are aware that this latter element is not in common parlance ascribed to tenderness of conscience , but we believe the one inseparable from the other , because we judge , when impartial , ofourown moral c*nduct and that of others by the same standard , and have feelings in some degree the same , irrespective of the doer . Now the rights of men , especially of equals in the intercourse of life , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more valued than the right to have one 's good name untarnished . Sensitiveness in this respect increases with refinement in the society , and the sense of wrong must increase proportionate ly . It is because this kind of rights is the most liable to be invaded in the free intercourse of equals , and because the smallest invasion of them will depress a man below the level of his peers and thereby disturb the balance between him and them , that the honorable man is peculiarly alive to any breach of duty in such cases . And hence also it is , that honor is so often restricted , so as to be merely a regard for reputation ; and an honorable man supposed to be merely one who will not brook an insult . It is indeed true that in its firstsense , honor , the Latin honos , meant the esteem in which one stood with others , something external to the object honored , and had no moral quality ; but it must always be that the moral notion in a word is not put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense only when it denoted deserving of honor . Conscience meant at first the minds accompanying itself in its knowledge , or its thinking and being the subject of thought . This reflex action was not of a moral nature by necessity , and yet even in the latin conscius there is the beginning of a restricted moral sense . One remark more is needed to explain the reason why such a low place has been given by moralists to the law of honor , and why the very word suggests to some , deviations from the path of right , resentment at imaginary insults , hypocritical pretenses to respect others when one in fact despises them . It is that all moral rules have a tendency to run intb formalism , and to be corrupted by false opinion . This tendency of our nature , which so strikingly proves the fallen condition of man , - since an uncorrupt being would have within him a fountain of living inward rules ,  --  is seen not only in the notions men entertain of right and wrong in conduct , when they measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also in all our judgments concerning conduct and character . We shall show soon that politeness to be true must be founded on a spirit of good will ; but how often does it degenerate into the hollow aping of certain forms , the muttering of insincere words . And this must be , if men are selfish . And so too the code of honor becomes a mockery , a vile counterfeit , when , without any inward sense of what is just , men take up what the resentful have established as honorable , arid stake their reputation upon the observance of mere outward rules . This too must be , if men are selfish and unjust . The same selfishness which blunts the moral sense , and puts the opinions of others as to right and wrong in the place of enlightened judgments formed by ourselves , acts here to weaken the sense of what is due to and from others , of what is worthy to be held in repute ; to put opinion in the place of conviction , and to measure our own violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider another es // sential characteristic of a gentleman , - his conformity to the law of true po. liteness . The law of politeness is the law which governs the intercourse of polite or polished people with one another , and therefore with all mankind , as far as the law is received inwardly and become a habit . Polished people are those whose roughnesses , or points unpleasant to others , are softened down . The effect of politeness then is to please . Now the roughnesses which render men unpleasant to others , are chiefly reducible to selfishness , in some one ' of its various manifestations . Among them we may number disregard for the feelings of others , want of deference to their opinions , carelessness about their comfort or enjoyment , unwillingness to sacrifice our own ease or pleasure in small things to theirs . To these and such vices of character politeness is the foe . If its effect is to please , its aim , when real , is more than to please ,  --  it is to make happy ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the strength of her character on efforts to please , will be found destitute of the essentials of politeness , because her aim is a selfish one ; - by pleas . ing she wishes to stand high in the esteem of society , and often she will show to a domestic or an inferior that surliness or pettishness of temper which she studiously represses among her equals . She cleanses the outside of the cup and the platter : her politeness is all show , because the inside is full of selfishness . The law of politeness then is to that of benevolence as honor is to justice ; and hence politeness is truly a Christian attainment , so much so that a Christian society even of barbarian converts must in process of time , as it grows in purity , grow also in that polish of the feelings and manners which can not fail to accompany benevolence . As in the former case , the law considered as an objective thing , comprehends many rules which have been adopted by society as contributiRg to the comfort or pleasure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more definitely than in the case of honorable action , and the reason perhaps is this : that the question how our conduct will affect the feelings of others , is of easier solution than the question what is just , what is an equitable adjustment of our own and other men 's claims in the more delicate parts of human intercours* . It takes no time generally to know what will please , what will offend ; but some questions of the other sort may be called chancery trials of the conscience , in which equity is hard to be ascertained . And hence probably greater delicacy of perception is needed to be honorable than to be just . As a subjective inward principle politeness involves two things , an active desire to make others happy , and a certain fineness of feeling giving rise to judgments , by which the mind is enabled to enter instantly into the situations and feelings of others , and judge what each new case requires . This delicacy is wanting to many true Christians who have much higher and rarer qualities , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence they are not qualified to shine in society as polite persons ; but as they have the foundation of politeness in them , it will be of far more use to them to learn a system of outward rules , than to persons who are still under the control of selfishness . It is present again in many such selfish persons , but the only use of it is to enable them to wear an outside show with the more success . It is capable also of improvement ; at least the capacity to judge what conduct the law of politeness requires in new situations , can be improved to a very great extent , until it shall seem quite instinctive . This delicacy is oftenest found in the female sex , whose judgments are more rapid // and feelings more delicate than those of ' men . Hence nothing can be more beautiful than the conduct of a Christian lady , bred in refined society , and accustomed to company . She not merely seeks to please every body , but " the law of kindness is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions through embarrassment or fear of being repulsed , feelings which have on the manners of novices and of many who are not novices , an injurious effect , but having already gained the courage to attempt to be kind , and from her delicacy of perceptions knowing how to be so , she is fitted to grace her circle and to adorn religion by showing the good will of the gospel in its most attractive form . We may add that great sensitiveness-morbid delicacy-of feeling is not favorable to true politeness . There is a golden mean in all the moral sentiments . Thus conscientiousness may become morbid and punctilious , and be the torment of the mind , and yet what possession is more valuable than a tender , delicate conscience . The sense of justice in its manifestation , as the sentiment of honor , may become morbid , and lead to claims perfectly unreasonable , or to performances chivalrous and romantic ; but this too , when the due balance is observed , is a most desirable quality . Morbid delicacy of feeling is apt to extinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , by making him dread intercourse , lest in that intercourse something may hurt his sensibilities . It has , therefore , not only nothing of benevolence in it , but its tendency is all the other way , and needs to be counteracted in order that true politeness may exist . It is obvious that the laws of politeness , so far as manner at least is concerned , ought to come from the highest circles of society , where they originate in the intercourse of equals with one another . For it is in such circles that niceness of judgment as to such matters is cultivated , and among them too delicacy of feeling is more apt to be developed . And yet such circles are beyond most others formal , hollow , hypocritical , wearing masks and making professions which others see through , filled with pride which weighs lightly the deserts of a rival , and envy which grieves at his success . The delicacy of feeling developed in such society is more than counterbalanced by selfishness in acting , which is powerfully fostered , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be little better than formality , when it is not animated by Christian love . The word courtesy derived from the high circle of a court , where it grew up , denotes the same thing as politeness ; or rather embraces a part of its extent , referring principally to that deference to others which is of prime importance in in tercourse . It may be doubted , however , whether courtesy ought not to be referred as much to honorable as to polite sentiments ; whether it does not respect the feeling of equality among equals in their conversation , and check all arrogance and assumption of superiority , as much on the ground of justice as on that of kindly feeling to others . We are commanded in the Scriptures to be courteous . The original word ( q*tX6oi's* , in 1 Peter , 3 ) denotes kindliness and friendliness of mind , and is strikingly well chosen to describe the true politeness of the heart . But it so happens that a large number of manuscripts have in ' 6q*ioi'e* , humble-minded , in this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this reading takes from us a scripture argument for courtesy , it leaves another in its place ; for the lowly person , he who exalts not himself above his true place , he alone is capable of being always just and always kind to others . No self-conceit makes // him disposed to thrust himself forward beyond his place . No lofty pride shuts him within himself to despise other men and demand their homage . He has the best , the most successful antagonist to selfishness , unkindness , impoliteness , in a low opinion of himself . It is only when we are humble that we can forget ourselves , and allow the stream of kindly affection to flow unimpeded , because unobserved . The characteristics of the gentleman which we have named thus far , are of a moral nature . We now pass on to an element , which takes its rise in a different part of our constitution , and serves , besides furnishing support to a kind and just disposition , to regulate the accompaniments of action , such as manner , dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful is as universal as a feeling of justice ; but the gentlemanly character is distinguished by its greater intensity and by a neater power to realize it in external conduct . It may be that the latter is not found in the same degree with the former . A person thus constituted will have the same relation to another in whom the sense of beauty and the power to realize it are both highly developed , as the critic to the poet . He can appreciate and take pleasure in that which conforms to the laws of art , but can not conform to them with the same success in his own person . When , on the other hand , the susceptibility is deficient , the the perfection of gentlemanly deportment can not be reached . Such a person may indeed , by rules derived from others who are nearer to the standard , keep himself from enormous transgressions of the law of beauty . Fashion and imitation may help him to steer along the straight course ; and if the other parts of gentlemanly character are strongly marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglectful of the beautiful and becom ing . But he can not be aware of the exquisite taste displayed by others in a thousand particulars of conduct ; nor can he have an ever present standard of beauty and grace before his mind , by which to mould his outer man , and avoid whatever is awkward , unrhythmical , or out of keeping . With respect to graceful and becoming manners , indeed , it may be thought that a nice sense of beauty is of little importance , since the spirit of justice and kindness reigning in the mind may be supposed to control all our treatment of others , and to keep us from every thing needlessly offensive or unpleasant . This is true so far as manners are an emanation and a manifestation of the disposition ; nothing is so essential for perfection of manner as that it spring from a right state of feeling towards others . But after all , there are nuances and delicate shades of manner , the attainment of which does not depend on the disposition . There may be two styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards others , and yet a man possessed of a refined taste will necessarily choose the one and avoid the other . Other persons too by the pleasure they feel will approve of his choice , and perhaps will erroneously refer their pleasure to a wrong cause in himto superior goodness of disposition rather than to a more exquisite sense of beauty . In regard to dress and whatever else is more external to the man than manner , no one probably will doubt that a sense of beauty and of the becoming , is of the highest importance . Here we come within the sphere of the painter , the statuary and the practitioners of that art which the ancients called orchestik , - an art not exactly answering to the modern art of dancing , but more comprehensive , as including within its range all measured , rhythmical , harmonious motions . The // modern art of dancing would have been looked on by the Greeks with scorn , as being unworthy of a free and grave man ; but they assigned a high place to the effect of musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that young persons brought up within the hearing of serious tunes , proceeding from the harp , would become insensibly conformed in their deportment to the laws of beauty . And so much was effected in this way , even in shaping the character and feelings , that the imperfections of moral education , necessary amid the examples of their mythology and in their ignorance of God , were in part supplied by this method of training . The same result will be accomplished by the continual presence of the law of beauty before a susceptible mind , without any direct attempt to train the outward demeanor . There is no need of spending time or wasting thought upon external appearance . A feeling of ill success after failures , and casual observation of the failures and successes of others , will suggest to good taste and a sense of beauty what is to be done and what to be avoided . The influence of this part of our nature is no where seen so manifestly as in the matter of dress . Here we refer not to the set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to do , but to the fashion , colors , patterns and the like , where preference has room to act . It is to be regretted that modern fashion is so despotical , that even here the power of choice is taken in a good degree out of men 's hands ; still there is ample room , especially in the female sex , for the display of good taste in the decorations of the person . Nothing is more common than to see one lady dressed expensively and in high fashion , yet unable to bear comparison as to beauty of attire with another who has spent no time and the smallest amount of money upon her apparel . The former aims to please and fails because of a natural defect ; the latter hardly aims to pfease , but following her own idea of beauty succeeds in pleasing to perfection . Perhaps we may still be misunderstood if we do not add that the law of beauty , where it is present , acts for the most part insensibly , like the laws of justice and kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed us thus far , to be unworthy of human nature , and still more so of that refined human nature which we make essential to a gentleman , that it should occupy itself with such trifles as make up our external appearance and deportment ; that a man should study himself with the eye of an artist , in order to detect whatever faults may lurk in his dress or movements , and to mould himself into as finished a model as possible . And so indeed it would be . But if we can conceive of a constant silent force of the law of beauty enabling the mind to form judgments so rapid that they can hardly be perceived , like those which we form concerning distances and magnitudes , then it will not appear unworthy of our nature to come under the power of such a law ; and the gentleman will turn out to be one who gives less attention perhaps than any one else , to these external matters , in which his success is most apparent . For the external accompaniments of gentlemanly action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no more unfailing sign of a decay of taste than fondness for ornament and display . Barbarians are dazzled with splendor ; but civilized men reject with aversion whatever is gorgeous and overloaded with decorations . A truly well dressed person is simply dressed . Good manners have no bluster or swell about them , but are quiet and unobtrusive . A strut in * // walking will be offensive even to a child . No doubt the want of simplicity offends by its thrusting an individual unduly forward , which is like attacking the rights of others , and it may displease by exciting a suspicion of insincerity ; but it offends also by being opposed to the law of beauty . Sensibility to the beautiful and becoming , is a great aid in upholding the laws of kindness and justice . Whether beauty can be defined or not , it may be considered as involving pleasure arising from the perception of proportion , and orderly arrangement . Now what a powerful ally must this element of our nature be , if it approves by the pleasure attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gaits , gestures , expressions of countenance , tones , conformable to its law ; but also of proportion in character , of orderly arrangement in social intercourse , of harmony among the coniponent parts of the man and of the community , of a unity among members , making them conspire in what is good . The higher displeasure and more acute pain which some refined persons feel , when transgressions against the laws of society are committed , can not , we suspect , always be resolved into sensibility to public opinion , moral disapprobation or resentment , but sometimes must be accounted for by this violated sense of the beautiful which stands up as the foe of the unbecoming and the base in wrong conduct . We must content ourselves with this endeavor to analyze the gentleman , imperfect as it is , and simply observe in closing this part of our subject , that the true elements may be in very different proportions . A nice sense of justice may be pre . ponderant ; and then , a man otherwise gentlemanly , will have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scales may turn in favor of kindness ; and then a man may be complying , weakly , ready to surrender his rights , and without dignity of character . Or an elegant taste may be in excess ; and then a man may dwell too much on externals , and even in them fail of his object by wanting the necessary right feeling . In general it is obviously better that the last should be in defect rather than either of the two first ; for the knowledge of what will please united with the spirit of kindness will go a great way in supplying the place of a sense of beauty . Yet the old saying of Pindar holds good of the gentleman ; aoq* 6 st&amp;g qv&amp; , natural endowments are the best fountain of knowledge . In giving our definition of the gentleman , we named calmness and courage as the conditions without which that character could not be manifested . Yet so ' far are they from being confined to this specific character , as to appear sometimes in the very opposite ; calmness may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice , and courage in brutal violence . They are however of extreme importance , especially the former ; and to the want of them must be imputed many of the imperfections in manner , many abortive attempts at kindness , much of seeming coldness or rudeness , much shrinking from one 's appropriate part . Happily however they may be cultivated . Much of the advantage of mingling in society is reducible to the cultivation of a calm self-possessed spirit . And perhaps the evidences of gentlemanly character , which strike the eye in strangers and speak most highly in their favor , are owing to this quality united to acquaintance with the usages of polite life . Courage is the opposite of dread of harm or of dread of opinion . Dread of harm is counteracted by any controlling sentiment , and among the rest by dread of opinion , as the new recruit is kept from running away by the fear // of ' being called a coward . Physical courage , happily , is not much drawn upon in civilized society either for maintaining our own or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the character , half latent as it were , is a conservator of the proprieties of life . Dread of opinion is but too much cherished in refined classes and times ; it is the only virtue of many , having dissolved in itself , so to speak , all other good qualities . The courage which dares to oppose opinion , even that of a whole society , is derived from insensibility or pride , or else is a very high endowment , the flower of the most valuable principles . In ordinary intercourse this courage unites with calmness to keep the mind free and unembarrassed , to allow the sentiments of kindness and justice their full play without any exterior control ; and to repress , with a becoming spirit , all insurrections on a small scale against riTht social order . We may now inquire whether the ideal of a gentleman is of any use in the formation of character , and particularly in this country . It is a remark of Sismondi , * that in a republic there is no distinction made between a virtuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this remark , it may be thought that our political forms prevent the development of the idea , and that the word must lose its specific sense , and include all well-behaved civil men . It may be said also to be an unnecessary term , implying a character below that of a Christian , and extremely apt to degenerate from its standard . Upon the important topics here started we have only space to bestow a short attention , and are far from feeling that we can do them justice . With regard then to the preservation of gentlemanly feeling under our political institutions , it is manifest that it can not principally be due to any class of society occupying the front rank , or to the examples or the literature of the other continent . It is plain also that , if the notion continues among us , It will assume its more ideal shape , becoming separated from those adjuncts , which in other countries have until lately gone along with it . Can it then in such a form be rooted upon our soil , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a very undesirable result is made unlikely by the greater sensitiveness and quickness of perception , which characterize the American nation . We are capable of nice feeling and discrimination . Why then should we not understand and value the gentlemanly character ? The probability is , that by and by our educated men will have higher standards of excellence than those of other lands , hecause the personal qualities of the man no where make so great a part of his importance . The habit of judging of men according to th&amp;r naked characteristics without external advantages , gives moral qualities which are worthy of admiration their due sway over the mind . Why then , when we judge of certain traits of character and manner contained in the notion of a gentleman , should we not demand as much of it , and give as great comprehension to it as any other people ? Again we might say that our social equality , or religious principle , or both , has spread through society a more universal spirit of kindness and deference than is else*vhere seen ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their guard , to make them stand by their own rights and respect those of their fellow citizens . If then a coarsening influence goes forth from our institutions , we may depend upon it that a refining one , of at least equal strength , goes * Hist. des Repubi . Italiennes , Vol . XVI , p. 447. // along with it . But enough , for if we can only show that our form of society does not preclude the existence of the character in question , it is all that we at present desire . The deteriorating tendencies of our government , if there are any , are so much more of a reason why cultivated men should aim at the highest style of gentlemanly conduct . With regard to the other point , namely why we need a standard besides that which the Scriptures give , and what the use is of the notion of a gentleman , we have one or two remarks to make , with which we will close the whole subject . L It is not enough to have a standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor indeed is it possible to avoid perceiving and naming particular qualities . Thus there is a positive gain for morals , when we name a man , honest , sincere , faithful , because a tolerably distinct idea of the moral quality attends on the word , which but for the word would remain unnoticed by the mind . Why then may not the same advantage accrue to morals , by uniting in one term two or more traits of importance , and calling the aggregate a gentleman ? Will it be said that in popular usage this term can scarcely fail of sinking in its meaning ? And is not the same true of all moral terms ? Is not he often called an honest man , who is only " indifferent honest , " who pays his debts not from a principle of honesty , but because his reputation or interest requires it ? Is not the phrase ' a good man ' used daily , with a very low standard in the mind ? Or will it be said that by separating certain qualities from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion for the very common irnpression that the virtues have separate roots in the soul , and are not all emanations , when genuine , of one living principle-an impression , which leads multitudes to comfort themselves for the absence of many good qualities by the supposed presence of one . But , if this is so , might we not object to the calling a man contented , or liberal or honest , for the same reason ? If his contentment seems to exist without other virtues , it is nothing more than a tendency to a particular form of virtue , which however , as the character is not truly virtuous , must give place , when temptation comes , to discontent and a rebellious will . But we can not and ought not to avoid observing and naming these qualities , notwithstanding such wrong impressions . 2 . The civilization of a time or a people manifests itself continually in language . Words descriptive of moral character are the result of the reflections of those who sway opinion within the bounds of the language . Such words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters of multitudes . Now the word gentleman is a growth of our civilization , which arose in the rriiddle ages , and having gradually cast off unessential accessories , has at last reached a high and pure ideal . What its power is upon all classes , we know from the offense and reproach which the charge of wanting it occasions . The term then is a necessary part of our language , and ought not ,  --  any more than the term honor ,  --  to be abandoned to pretenders , whose wrong application of it is calculated to injure morals beyond measure . It is desirable for the cause of virtue and religion , not that we leave such words in bad hands , - thereby perhaps divorcing religion from the qualities of social life ,  --  but that we rescue them from bad uses , and strenuously maintain that they involve notions akin to and growing out of the noblest principles of the Christian . Thus we shall show that the highest effort of civilization in a moral way , that of inventing terms indicative of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alloy , is seconded by Christianity ; which comes in to purify still more the moral conception , and to heap up motives for making it real in conduct . 3 . It is a lamentable fact that some men , who have made no pretensions to a religious character and neglect their duty toward God , are gentler , more forbearing , polite and courteous in social life , than some men of undoubted piety . Why is this ? It may be for the same reason that a clergyman who dabbles in commercial matters , will do things at which honest merchants would hesitate . They are in the habit of examining questions relating to mercantile honesty , and he is not . And so a man who has learned that the gentlemanly character involves gentleness and forbearance , being desirous of the character or of the reputation of it , will put a force upon himself , and become habituated to these qualities , or at least to the show of them , without having yet attained to true fundatnental virtue . Thus we see that by familiarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one man of no very exalted virtue will have a great advantage over another of the best disposition who has overlooked them . It seems to us , when the amount of influence and happiness lost by this neglect is considered , that it is wholly inexcusable . Indeed we know not what can excuse a Christian , the servant of the gentlest , kindest , justest master , from being a gentleman , unless a natural want of delicacy of feeling , which it is beyond his pow* er to alter . With no such defect he ought to be the more successful in rearingthe flowers of gentlemanly intercourse , for they have with him a better root . And he can not fail of being more successful , if he will form a clear notion of this term gentleman in its highest import , and feel that it may help him in practice to have such a standard before his eyes . There is every need that a Christian should be a gentleman , a man of gentle soul and manners , of the nicest justice , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : there is ordinarily no reason why he should not be one.
