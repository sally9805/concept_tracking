txt MANY of the sciences which enter into a course of liberal education , have come into existence within a period comparatively // recenL Chemistry , for example , is one of the modern sciences . A century ago , what is now called chemistry had no existence . From a few rude experiments and undigested facts , it grew up , suddenly , into an exact and beautiful science , the fairest achievement of a purely inductive philosophy . Geology is another example . Those extended observations and comparisons , which , in their summing up , give so wonderful a revelation respecting the structure of the globe as it exists , and so many exciting glimpses of its primeval history-are of modern date . But new as these sciences are , they have found a place in all systems of liberal education . No man , in our day , passes for a well informed man who is not acquainted with at least the outlines and fundamental facts of these departments of knowledge . With equal reason , an equal place may be demanded in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is one of the sciences of the modern era of science . In its origin and progress it synchronizes with geology arid chemistry . It is beginning to have its effects upon history ; shaping the legislation and diplomacy of governments ; overthrowing old systems of national policy which were founded on a false philosophy , and which have been gtiarded not only by wide spread and inveterate prejudices , but by the fiercer and more jealous power of selfish interests . The political and comtnercial questions of tlie.day , which are discussed in all quarters as qtlestions of tin iversal concern , are even unintelligible , in any ordinary statement of then*withont some knowledge of the leading terms and prin*iples of Political Economy . Yet we have systems of liberal education-so called-in which a knowledge of Political Economy is treated as if it were less important to the character of a well informed man , than an acquaintance with the Greek meters , or with the properties of the ellipse and the parabola . Thus it happens , not tinfrequently , that men who seem to be otherwise intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distinctions , and of the most unquestionable principles , in Economical Science . The first of the works to which reference is made at the head of this article , proceeds from an accurate , discriminating , patient thinker who well understands what has been done by his Eprede* cessors , and who has attempted to incorporate into his treatise all the results of the most recent discussions . Particular topics in Political Economy have been profoutidly investigated within the last few years ; and many new ideas and , new applications of ideas have been brought out . So far as these discussiotis have added anything to the science , by making its definitions more l ) recise , its distinctions more clear , its inductions more comprehensive , and its conclusions more exact , a work like that of Say , which at the time when it was written was in advance of all others , falls // behind the actual state of the science . Mr. Mill has given us a revision and digest of the entire science of Political Economy , as illustrated by successive discussions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the present time . The approbation with which his work , in this aspect of it , has been received by the highest authorities in his own country , need riot be confirmed by any testimony of ours . But this work , as the title implies , is something more than a dry and abstract digest of " the principles of Political Economy . " The principles which constitute the science of the production and distribution of wealth , are here exhibited in connection with " some of their applications to social philosophy . " It is to this characteristic of the work that the author , in his preface , particularly invites attention . In this respect , " the design of the book , " he tells us , " is different from that of any treatise of Political Economy which has been produced in England since the work of Adam Smith . " " The most characteristic quality of that work , and the one in which it most differs from some others which have equaled or even surpassed it as mere expositions of the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles with their applications . This of itself implies a much wider range of ideas and of topics , than are included in political economy , considered as a branch of abstract speculation . For practical purposes , political economy is inseparably intertwined with many other branches of social philosophy . Except on matters of mere detail , there are perhaps no practical questions , even among those which approach nearest to the character of purely economical questions , which admit of being decided on economical premises alone . And it is because Adam Smith never loses sight of this truth , because , in his applications of political economy , he perpetually appeals to other and often far larger considerations than pure political economy affords-that he gives that well grounded feeling of command over the principles of the subject for purposes of practice , owing to which the " Wealth of Nations , " alone among treatises on political economy , has not only been popular with general readers , but has impressed itself strongly on the minds of men of the world and of legislators . Mr. Mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied by statesmen , by legislators , by those who undertake to mold and direct public opinion on political subjects , by all who would form a ' * indeperident and intelligent judgment on questions of national policy OP*Of social reformation and progress . If it seems too voluminous to be used as a class book in the college recitation room , it should nevertheless be thoroughly studied by the teacher ; and its rich stores of historical and statistical illustration should be largely employed , in the discussion of those questions which must be discussed in the process of teaching . rphe science of political economy , studied as Mr. Mill teaches it in these volumes , will be found inferior to no other as a means of intellectual excitement , as a method of exercising the attention and the power of discriminatiori and argument , as inspiring the student with a thirst for // knowledge in other departments of political and moral science , and as a preparation for the duties of a liberally educated citizen in a free country , and in an age when all traditionary usages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remodeled . On two great subjects of national economy , there has been much discussion in our country . The policy of protection to American industry by duties on imports , has been the characteristic policy of one great party in the Union ; while the other party has been characterized , not indeed by a universal and unqualified adhesion to the principle of freedom in commercial intercourse , but by a prevailing tendency that xvay . The policy which proposes to regulate the currency of the country , and to facilitate exchanges between distant points by the operations of a national bank , is now indeed regarded as " an obsolete idea ; " but within the last twenty years the whole Union has been agitated with the conflict of parties for and against that policy . On other subjects , of great importance to the common weal , demagogues are constantly discoursing from the stump ' and from the press , and the people are slowly working their way into some sort of empirical knowledge . The relations between labor and capital-the tendencies of manufacturing and trading corporations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of laws for the suppression of usury  --  the nature and working of banks-the comparative advantages of direct and indirect taxation-these and other topics of the same sort are so constantly agitated , that intelligent men desiring to discharge their duty as citizens , and especially desiring , as ednicated men , to aid in guiding the minds of their neighbors and of the public , might be expected to study thoroughly the science to which such questions are most intimately related , arid on which they depend for their solution . Mr. Colton 's " Public Economy , " if it proves nothing else , may be taken as a proof of the extent to which men in this country who assume to instruct the public on such subjects , arid who are applauded by fellow partisans for the cogency of their argumerits and the originality of their views , may be ignorant of the simplest distinctions and the plainest principles of economical science . Mr. Kellogg 's labored work and the reception it has ' found on the part of many who are heartily , arid as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laboring masses to a better chance of obtaining a just share in the aggregate of national wealth ,  --  is another illustration to the same point . 1*Xe may presume , then , that it will not be entirely a stiperfinotis work it in this connection , we enter into some statements of quite an elementary character , respecting the natural laws which govern the production and distribution of wealth . It seems tiecessary // to do this in order to set in a clear light the schemes of policy and philanthropy to which the second and third of the works before us are devoted . That there are in the constitution which God has given to human nature and to the material world , and in the consequent relations of the one to the other , certain laws or principles , to which the phenomena included in the production and distribution of wealth may be referred , and into which those phenomena when analyzed and classified resolve themselves ; that the activity aud progress of industry among a people , and the increase of wealth from age to age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws which may be counteracted by an oppressive government or an un*vise legislatioti , but to which a wise legislation will necessarily conform hself-may be taken for gratited , though Mr. Colton virtually denies it . The investigation of these natural laws or principles , tracing them out as they are modified by the infinite variety of circumstances in which men act , is the function of the political economist . Presumiiig that the ascertainment of these laws or principles is a legitimate and practicable object of intellectual effort , he observes , he analyzes , he reasons from effects to causes and then from causes to effects , and so he proceeds to construct his science . Jtist so far as the principles which determine the production and distribution of wealth , are ascertained by the observation and analysis of facts , * so far the science of political economy is established . Man , by the constitution of his mind and body , is placed in certain relations with the external world , which involve the necessity of mental and bodily labor , and out of which arises the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual man may have in some things external to himself . Mart has a thousand wants which tiature supplies . Some of these wants , common to all mankiuid , are supplied by the unlimited arid spontaneous bounty of nature . The vital air , the light of the stin , and , in ordinary circumstances , water as it falls from the clouds or runs iii the rivers , are enjoyed without limit and without any necessity of effort . These things , arid such as these , however necessary to the gratification of human desires , can not be appropriated , or divided into parts among the individual members of the human family . Valuable as they are , they can not be held as possessions , or transferred from one individual to another . But there are other meauts of human subsistence arid enjoyment , which nature does not yield spontaneously and universally . Food , which is as necessary to life as air and light , must be obtained by human effort . Even where there is rio agriculture , and where man , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the spontaneous productions of nature , human food is obtained by some measure of human effort , as really as // where the densest population obtains its subsistence by all the complicated and ingenious industry of the most advanced civilization . Wild game must be hunted and killed and prepared for use ; the cocoanut and the bread fruit , or the wild berries , must be gathered , before they can be used for food . Tl'he tnaterial of food , thus obtained , can be kept for a longer or shorter time before it is consumed , he who has obtained it can transfei ' it to another ; it can be accumulated . One man may have more than is requisite for the supply of his personal need ; another may have less than his necessities require , and rather than suffer for the want of it , he may be ready to make sacrifices and render services in order to obtain it . So of the clothing which man needs to cover his person-whatever it may be , and however acquired , it is obtained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is al ) propriated to him who has obtained it ; it can be kept and accumulated ; it can be transferred from one possessor to another . So of ornaments , from the simple feathers and shells that decorate the person of a savage , to the jewels of the imperial crown of Great Britain ; and so of all articles of convenience or luxtiry ,  --  they are originally created or acquired by human contrivance and exertion , they can be possessed and kept , they can be transferred from hand to hand . Thus we begin to analyze and define the idea of wealth . It consists of things which minister to human subsistence or enjoyment , and which therefore , in their fitness to gratify some human desire , whether natural or factitious , have an intrinsic value . It consists of things over which an exclusive right of use and enjoyment can be acquired and held , and may therefore be considered as property . It consists of things which may be transferred from one possessor to another , and which being therefore the subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less than two hundred and fifty years ago , all the wealth of what is now New England , yielded only a scanty subsistence to a sparse and savage population . The corn of here and there a little half tilled planting ground ,  --  the nuts and berries gathered from the woods , the fish caught by the rudest artifices from the streams ,  --  the flesh and skins of wild beasts taken in traps or transfixed with arrows ,  --  huts of a more comfortless architecture than a New England farmer would now employ in constructing a winter-shelter for his sheep or for his swine  --  the furniture of those huts , consisting of mats braided from the husks of the Indian corn , and baskets woven from splinters of the ash and hickory , together with a few utensils of the most primitive sort for the preparation of food  --  the wrw*drobes , to which neither the loom nor the spinning wheel contributed anything , and which were made up of furs and rudely manufactured leather pervious to moisture ,  --  the personal ornaments which were the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of plumage from gorgeous birds , teeth and talons from beasts of prey , and many-colored beads , or wampum , laboriously fabricated front shells  --  the canoes , which were fashioned with infinite pains and patience from logs hollowed out with fire and with tools of stone , and which were paddled along the rivers and across the bays and sheltered sounds  --  and finally the weapons of savage hunters and warriors , bows fabricated without the aid of a knife , arrows tipped with sharpened flint or slate , stone hatchets , knotted war clubs hardened in the fire-such was the entire " grand list , " the complete inventory of the wealth of what is now New England . What is the wealth of New England now ? Almost every acre of land , with the exception of rugged and inaccessible mountain tops , is producing something of value . Ever so many grains , fruits , esculent roots , and grasses , once exotic , have become naturalized , and are covering the land with their annual supplies of food for man and beast . Millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose flesh is good for food , whose fleeces , skins , horns , bones , are applied to a thousand uses ,  --  derive their subsistence from the otherwise super* fluous products of the cultivated soil . In the place of a few wigwams here and there in the woods , there are now the houses which shelter and protect more than two millions of people , and the meanest of which is far superior , in its comforts and accommodations , to the best habitation that ever sheltered an Indian on this soil before the country began to be invaded by civilization . In the very poorest and most cheerless of those dwellings , there are utensils and articles of convenience , comfort or ornament , for which an Indian sachem , in the year 1600 , would have been almost ready to part with all his royal treasures . The household furniture of the 400,000 families now living in New England , from the scanty supply in the apartments of the poorest family up to the magnificence exhibited in the palacelike dwellings of the wealthiest citizens-must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wealth of New England at the present hour . Then think of the clothing of our population-all the articles of apparel for winter and si*mmer , for the house and for the open air , for working days and for holy days , for ordinary wear and for occasions of display-and you have another item in the inventory . Think in how many thousand dwellings there are books , maps , engravings , pictures , instruments of music , statues , jewels , and when you have formed some just conception of the aggregate , you have another item . Think of the vast stocks and deposits of merchandize laid up in stores for the purposes of commerce . Think of the ships and the freights which they are carrying . Think of the steamboats . Think of the wharves , the roads , the pavements , the railroads XOL . VII . 54 // with their wondrous enginery , the milidams and mills , the workshops with their tools , the great manufactories with their machinery , and the supply of raw materials in the shops and mannfactories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarries , the mines , and all the machinery and apparatus for working them . Think of the forts and arsenals and armories and their contents , and of all the varions kinds of arms and weapons distributed among the people . Think of the edifices devoted to religion , to legislation and justice , and to the education of the people . Think of the piles erected for the abode of learning , the apparatus and cabinets , and the libraries : And last of all-not to say least of all-think of the banks , and the gold and silver in their vaults , at ) d the gold and silver coin in circulation . In this way-by some such recollection and summing up of particulars , you may begin to form some idea of the wealth existing in New England now , compared with the wealth which existed within the same territorial limits two hundred and fifty years ago . Now how has all this wealth been produced ? How has this great change been effected ? What has created the difference in respect to wealth between that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , and this New England in which we are living ? It is natural to say that all this change has been brought to pass by labor . And for the purposes of popular declamation the statement is true enough . All this transformation of poverty into riches-all this accumulation of objects that minister to human wants or gratify human desire , and that can be possessed and transferred-is the achievement of intelligent , ingenious , patient industry . The men of this boasted " AngloSaxon " stock , have been here , and have been working and accumulating for somewhat more than two centuries and a quarter . But this does not tell the whole story . Could labor have done the same in the desert of Sahara ? Could the same amount of intellectual and muscular labor have created the same amount of wealth in Greenland ? Surely then , something else has been concurring with labor in this creation . Natural resources-the resources of the soil , of the mountain ledges and the veins pf ore , of the waterfalls and navigable streams , and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and converted into actual wealth . Nature and human labor have codperated in the change by which the New Englaud of Captain John Smith 's day has been transformed into the New England of our day . Labor must have land to work upon , land with its own capabilities and resources . Nor is the whole story told even yet , that must be told if we are to account for the production of this wealth . The one hundred men women and children , who landed at Plymouth at the // close of 16*O , did not land there in absolute helplessness . Poor as they were , they brought something with them . They brought with them not onlythe means of acquiring by purchase a title to the soil which they were to cultivate , but the clothing and food , or articles to be exchanged for food , by which they might prolong their existence till their labor should obtain a harvest from that soil . They brought with them the seeds without which there could have been no planting . They brought with them the implements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought with them cattle for labor and other useful animals . they brought with them tools and materials for the erection of their houses , and for the various handicrafts without which they could not have subsisted . Without such things as these they would have perished ere the spring , without being able to dig each other 's graves ; for not even a grave can be opened without tools . Such things as these , provided for them by the mercantile company in London who were their partners in the undertaking , were as essential to the creation of any wealth upon that spot as labor itself ; for without these things there could have been no labor . The more than twenty thousand people who within a few years followed them from the old England to the New , and who dotted the line of the coast and of the rivers with their settlements , did not come empty-handed . Had they brought nothing with them - had they come as the starving Irish are now coming , with nothing but the rags that cover them-they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been abortive . Had nothing but labor come hither , however sturdy and patient , however enterprising or ambidextrous , New England , with all its natural capabilities , would have been a wilderness still . In other words , the capital which came over with the settlers of New England , the capital which gave them subsistence till they could produce their own subsistence from the soil , and which equipped them with all the materials and implements of labor , was a distinct and indispensable element in the creation of the wealth of New England . There are then these three elements in the production of wealth , - land , or the resources and agencies of rtature ,  --  labor , or human effort , whether muscular or rnental ,  --  and capital , or the imjilements and sustenance of labor . What wealth can be created without capital ? Robinson Crusoe , on his lonely island , was a capitalist as well as a laborer and a landholder . Put him down there without any capital-simply a naked , featherless , two-legged and two-handed animal , wiQout clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hatchet or knife or rusty nail , without a particle of food to keep him from fainting  --  and what will become of him . He gathers perhaps some wild fruits from the bushes ; he picks up perhaps some shell-fish from the water 's // edge ; he surprises , perhaps , a fawn or a kid , and throttles it and tears it to pieces with his fingers ; he kindles a fire , perhaps , by rubbing two dry sticks together till they ignite with the friction ; and so he keeps himself alive for a few days ; but how little progress does he make . He is still the same miserable naked wretch , with the faintest possible chance of improving his condition , or even of prolonging so precarious an existence ; his only capital is the scanty supply of food for the hour , which keeps him from fainting till he can gather enough for another meal . But let him by any means have a little to begin with in the shape of implements and materials ; give him an axe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an iron hoop ; give him a gill of seed wheat , or a single potato , or no more than a grain of maize , for planting ; and how soon will his condition be changed ! He has begun to be , even in this small way , a capitalist ; and his labor , drawing something from the past , begins to reach into the future . Instead of spending all his time and strength in a constant scratching for the food of to-day , how soon will he have a blanket of skins , and a hut , and a garden in which he is preparing to-day the food of future months . Give him now a little more capital ; let him have the means of stocking his farm with some sort of domestic animals ; give him only a steer and a heifer or even a pair of goats , and how soon will he begin to be rich ! I* is often said that all wealth is the creation of labor alone , inasmuch as capital is nothing more than the accumulated proceeds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day in the production of wealth , is not to be confounded-as by some declaimers and writers it is confounded-with the labor of to-day with which that capital codperates. rplie laborers employed to-day in the construction of some public work , are using implements and materials , and means of subsistence , which , if regarded as the product of labor , were produced not by this day 's labor hut by the labor of former days ,  --  and not by these laborers at all , but by the industry of other hands than theirs . And not only so , but in the production of these implements and materials and of these means of subsistence , other implements and materials , and other means of subsisteu* , ce for labor , had a part . It is only by some violent effort of ima*ination , making a supposition of some extraordinary concurrence of contingences , that we can conceive of labor producing anything without capital . The palpable fact is , that ever since the expulsion of Adam from Paradise , capital-something provided beforehand-something saved from the past-has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human industry . How preposterous , then , is the sophistry which , because capital is in some sense the product of former labor , assumes that in present production capital is nothing and labor everything . Yet this // remarkable delusion lies at the foundation of many a well meant disquisition about the rights of labor . See how transparently it is enclosed in the very first sentences of Mr. Kellogg 's preface . " The laboring classes of all civilized nations have been , and are , as a body , poor . Nearly all wealth is the production of labor ; therefore laborers would have possessed it , had not something intervened to prevent this natural result . " It does not seem to occur to Mr. K. , that the reason why " the laboring classes " - that is the classes who live by manual labor , - are poor , is that when the laborer ceases to be poor , he ceases to be a laborer ; and that what he calls the " natural result " namely the possession of wealth by those whose labor has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were once mere laborers into employers of labor . It does not seem to occur to him that the grand motive to frugality and saving , and the only motive to any labor beyond what is necessary each day to the supply of that day 's wants , is the fact that by laboring and saving the laborer gradually becomes a proprietor of wealth , which wealth , employed as capital , will take hini out of the category of " the laboring classes . " " Nearly all wealth , " says our *author , " is the creation of labor , " and from this postulate his inference is that " therefore " nearly all wealth ought to be , and but for some organic injustice , would be , in the possession of those who are uoxv laborers-as if those who are now laborers had been the unaided creators of nearly aU the wealth of which others are the possessors . To see whether we misunderstand him , let us turn forward a few pages . In his Introduction , p. 19 , he is illustrating this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimen of the distribution of wealth in this country , a village of ten thousand inhabitants , where fifty men are worth as much as all the rest . He says , " If it be found that the fifty men and their families own one-half the property , then see if they have contributed more labor physically , intellectually , or morally , for the general benefit , than the rest of the villagers . I do not now speak of what their wealth may have done in hiring others to make improvements , but of the improvements that the fifty men and their families have effected by their personal labor . If they have not accomplished as much by their personal labor as all the rest of their townsmen , and yet own half the w6lth of the town , some wrong to the majority of the people has been done . " * " They have not earned it ; for they could not have performed the labor of building half the town , nor of providing half its inhabitants with food and clothing ; nor could they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the school education of the villagers . And f/they have not done one half the labor , why is it that they possess one half the property ? " We have indicated as emphatic a few words which show how completely the benevolent writer has ensnared himself with an unconscious sophism. lie entirely overlooks the fact that capital , as really as labor , is an element in the production of wealth . He // takes it for granted that because capital is the result of the savings and investments of former labor , therefore capital can not earn anything , and the entire proceeds of labor , without any consideration of the capital employed , ought to be divided among the laborers . Or to make the doctrine palpable by making it specific ,  --  the manufactory , the machinery , the steam engine , the cotton , and the subsistence of the persons employed in the establishment , are simply the creation of labor ; therefore the cotton fabric when manufactured has been created exclusively by labor ; and therefore the entire proceeds of the concern , day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . But we are coming to the verge of topics which will be considered more conveniently in the sequel . Remembering that the matter in hand , just now , is the production and not the distribution of wealth , we have nothing to say as yet about the rights or the wrongs of labor . We have not yet done with the elementary fact that three distinct forces concur in the production of wealth-LAND , or the operations and resources of nature ,  - -  LABOR , or human effort ,  --  and CAPiTAL , or the implements , materials and subsistence of labor . Nothing can be simpler than this distinction , nothing more self-evident , nothing more easily reniembered . Political economy begins with this distinction . Let this distinction be overlooked or confounded , and all the facts with which the science concerns itself become perfectly inexplicable . Yet here we have two American books , of no slight pretensions , which deliberately and purposely confound this distinction . The very name of Mr. Kellogg 's book- " Labor and other Capital " - proclaims his looseness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent reader . And when he undertakes to explain his use of terms , he shows still more distinctly that he does not understand at all what others have written . " Properly , value , or cepital , is anything which , either by combination or inherently , possesses the means of affording support , comforts , or luxuries to man . Labor is a species of capital , and a most important one-without which , all other kinds of capital would be nearly if not wholly useless ; for even food of spontaneous growth could not be gathered without labor . Labor is not , however , generally considered as capital , but as something very ir*erior to property and products . I have , therefore , found it convenient , in compliance witb popular usage , to speak of labor and capital as distinct from each other . C'apital , throughout the treatise , siguffles all property but labor , or ability to hsbor. " - p. xv . " Property , value , or capital " - what looseness in the use of language ! The writer who takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' are convertible terms , may be expected to advance principles " essentially different from those which have been advocated by former writers on political economy . " // In like manner , Mr. Colton has a chapter ( Chap . II. ) entitled , *rFhe new points of this work . " In that chapter he takes great credit to himself for the new point " that labor is capital , and the parent of all other capital . " He confesses indeed that this is not entirely a new idea , but he tells us , that " it has never before been introduced into a system of public economy as an essential elemen t . " His great originality is that he puts this idea first of all , and makes it fundamental . ' He says , " We profess , that we could not begin to write on this subject , in any hope of doing justice to it , and of coming out right , without first determining the true position of labor in public economy , not only as capital , but as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be said that the technicalities of science are in some respects and in some degree arbitrary ; but a misnomer in science , which for ever represents one of its chief and fundamental elements , not only in a false position , but in a position which puts every other element out of place , will for ever be fatal to the proper adjustment and right view of its parts . Such , we think , has been the necessary consequence of the exclusion by economists from the list of capitals that which is the parent of all , and which more properly deserves the name alone , than that its mere products should have superseded it in the nomenclature of art . There is a reason to be deplored in this malpractice , a moral cause , we fear , which aimed for ever to exclude labor from its rights . It reversed the order of nature , and transferred the cause to the place of the effect . It is not capital , in the common , or in what the economists have made the technical sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in this condescension to enslave it ; but it is labor which in nature occupies the first place , and which was designed to be the employer of its own creations . It is virtually so always . That which is commonly called capital , can do nothing , is worth nothing , without labor . Labor is not only its parent , but its efficient and vivifying power . But , in the nomenclature of the economists , labor has been thrust from its true position , and as a consequence robbed of its rights . " - pp. 45 , 46 . We can not but ask , as we read this , what does Mr. Colton mean when he says that labor is capital ? Here are two terms , labor and capital ; and the proposition is that the former is in* cluded in the latter as the species in the genus . The meaning is not that capital is the product of labor , and may therefore be considered as representing the labor that produced it . On the contrary our author instead of saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the varieties of capital . We turn then to the chapter on labor , in which this " new point " of political economy is elucidated . Two definitions are necessary to make The meaning of the proposition clear . What is labor ? and what is capital ? " Labor , " our author tells us , " is the application of the powers and devices of man , to supply the wants and gratify the desires of the race . " Unless more meaning lurks in the word " devices " than we are willing to impute to it , this is a sufficiently accurate definition of labor in the common acceptation of the term . There is no reason to suspect that Mr. Colton attaches any other meaning to the term " labor " than that which it bears in all w.orks on the science of wealth . Labor is the application or exertion // of human power whether bodily or mental ; and it is this-this application of human force-*vhich is affirmed to be capital . What then is capital ? If the author and expounder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he means by capital , we have been so unfortunate as to overlook it . Nothing is more certain than that he does not use the word in the sense in which it is invariably used by writers on political economy . To say that labor is a part of the accumulated products of former labor , or that labor is the same thing with the implements , materials and subsistence of labor-is nonsense more palpable than our author could have intended to utter . If then we would ascertain the meaning of the proposition that " labor is capital , " we must try to make it out from the author 's proofs and illustrations of the proposition . Thus we ascertain that this remarkable proposition - this " new point , " which is destined to revolutionize the entire science of political economy-this great first principle , which Adam Smith , and Say , and their whole tribe have blunderingly or willfully overlooked-means only that labor is , like capital , an agent in the production of wealth , and that all " other capital " is the accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of his successors had ever overlooked or undervalued the indispensableness of labor in the production of wealth ! Some recognition of the distinction between land , labor , and capital , as three codperating elements in the production of wealth - some recognition of the reciprocal dependence of these three forces , and of the indispensableness of each to the value or to the productive efficiency of the others-is essential to any understanding of the natural laws which control the distribution of the wealth created by industry . The enquiry of political economy concerning the distribution of wealth , is not so much how wealth ought to be distributed , as how it will be distributed in given circumstances . The inquiry is , Who are the partners among whom the value created by industry will be divided , and what are the natural laws by which the shares of these several part .. ners are determined ? Such an inquiry presupposes the existence of society and of property . It presupposes , therefore , the existence of the products of former labor , cobperating with present labor in the crefftiou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any right in the disposal and employment of his own labor , or any consequent right to a share in the value which is produced in J ) art by his labor , and if his share , when he receives it , is his property ; then the laborer of yesterday , or of last year , or of twenty years ago , had the same right in that which his labor created . The right of property is a right which can be completely transferred , at the convenience or will of the possessor , to some other person , or it can hardly be said to exist . The man who has acquired venison or // bearskins by the labor of hunting , has a right not only to eat the one and to make a blanket of the other , but to exchange one or both of them for a rifle and for powder and ball , or for anything else , and the new possessor has the same right with the old one . The man who has acquired a hundred bushels of wheat by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of it , or any portion of it , for other things , at his discretion ; - he may exchange one portion of it for fuel , and another portion for clothing , and another portion for the use of the mill by which the remainder is converted into flour . Take away that right of transferring his wheat to other persons ,  --  or , what is the same thing , take away from those other persons the right of using it or again transferring it in their turn at their discretion ,  --  and all that portion of it which he does not need for personal use in the satisfaction of his own hunger , becomes worthless ; he has labored for nought and spent his strength for that which can not satisfy . The moment any check is put upon the alienation of property , at that moment , and to that extent , it ceases to be property ; and at the same moment , and to the same extent , all the motives to frugality , and all the incentives to any labor beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distribution of wealth presupposes also that wealth is produced by cooperation . In proportion to the progress of society in wealth and in the various arts of production , the codperation by which wealth is produced , becomes wider and more complicated . With a backwoods pioneer , beyond the verge of civilization , who raises his own corn , and pounds it between two stones , and then bakes his bread on a piece of board before the fire , the production of his bread is quite an independent affair . No body codperates with him in any appreciable degree , and nobody comes in for a share of its value . But the production of bread by a baker in a city , is the result of cooperation indefinitely extended . The labor of the baker co6perates with all the labor previously expended in providing the flour and other materials , the fuel , the oven , the workshop and tools , and the subsistence of the baker for the day . In the production of the flour , the labor of the miller codperated with the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its machinery , and the barrels for packing it . In the production of the wheat , the labor of ploughing , sowing , reaping and threshing , codperated with the labor previously expended in clearing and improving the ground , erecting fences and buildings , and in providing seed , cattle , and the tools and apparatus of agricultural industry . Nor is this all . The wheat was transported from the threshing floor ao the mill-perhaps from the back country of Chicago , to the city of Rochester ; and the flour in the barrel was transported perhaps from Rochester to New York and thence to some New England city , where the baker made it into bread . And in all this trans // portation how much was there of coöperative labor ,  --  not only the labor of porters and draymen , of sailors and engineers , of conductors and firemen , but the labor which prepared the vehicles , and means of transportation , ships , steamboats , canals and railroads . We need not pursue the illustration . The reader sees that it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation in the production of wealth . Yet with all this reach and complicity of codperation in the production of the things which constitute wealth , the problem of distribution is one which is continually disposing of itself at every stage in the indefinitely extended process . Of the bread manufactured by the baker-not the whole , but only a small portion , represents his labor . Another and a far larger portion represents his capital , the flour and the fuel , and the use of his workshop and his tools . Another portion still represents his ownership of the land on which his establishment is built and the use of which is as essential as anything else to the manufacture . If he owns the capital , fixed and circulating , with which he carries on his business , and if he owns at the same time the land which he occupies , and if the labor by which the flour is converted into bread is exclusively his own labor , there is no distribution of the product . But if , on the other hand , the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then there will be a division of the product , and a portion of the bread will belong to the owner of the ground . If the capital , or any portion of in , belongs to other owners , then there will be a farther division , and the owner or owners of the capital will have their share of the product . And again , if any part of the labor directly employed in the manufacture , was the labor of some other person , there will be yet another division ; and a part of the product will belong to that laborer . So if we go back from the bakery to the mill where the flour was manufactured and packed in barrels , a part of the product there will belong to the proprietor of the land and the water-power ; another part will belong to the owners respectively of the wheat , the machinery and the building ; and still another part will belong to the miller , or will be divided between him and the workmen , if there are any , whose labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So if we go back still farther to the agricultural operation of producing the wheat from the soil and threshing it out for the market , we shall find that there too only a part of the product belongs to the laborer simply as a laborer ; while another part belongs to the owner of the capital , and still another part to the owner of the soil . How is it then that from one stage to another in the production and reproduction of wealth , these successive divisions are effected ? in what method , and by what laws and forces is it , that the portion is determined which comes to each cooperating // agent in each successive creation of value ? The industry of society , by a natural system of wide and complicated cooperation , is constantly producing the means of human subsistence and enjoyment , hi some method , the means of subsistence and enjoyment , thus produced , must be distributed . What method is provided by nature , or rather by that wisdom and foresight of God which determined all the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution , which is not yet wholly disused , and of which many traces remain even where the method itself is couuted disreputable ,  --  is what is now called robbery ; " the good old rule , " " The sirrtple plan , That they should take , who have the power , And they should keep who can. ** The simplicity of this plan is sufficiently obvious . Those who are stronger than their neighbors seize upon that which has been produced by other men 's industry , and make it their own by club law or by the right of the longest sword . Those only who are strong enough to keep their goods against all opposition , are permitted to accumulate anything . The difficulty about this method of distribution-regarded in a purely ecouomical light-is that it effectually checks the progress of production . Wherever propert* is insecure , industry is paralyzed . In language which the poet puts into the mouth of a robber , philosophizing on this " simple plan , " " All freakishness of mind is checked ; He tamed , who foolishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashions his desires . " Under such a method of distribution , the natural desire of possessing , ceases to act as a stimulus to labor and to the accumulation of the products of labor , and acts only as a stimulus to robbery . Capital instead of constantly increasing by accumulation , and constantly seeking to employ itself in production , disappears and perishes . Labor without the necessary provision for its subsistence , aud without its necessary implements and materials , is discouraged and helpless . Production ceases ; and there is nothifig left to be distributed . To avoid such a result , the producers or possessors of wealth , unable to protect that which their industry created , have not unfrequently been constrained to make a compromise or compact with some chief robber who happens to be strong enough to protect them . So long as they submit to his exactions , he exerts himself to protect them against all other plunderers . In this way there begins to be some room for the development of industry ; the products of industry , instead of being all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and employed // in aid of an increased production . The producers feel those multiplied yet natural motives to activity and a provident frugality , which could not act upon them so long as they had no protection against violence . But under this system their protection is imperfect . Who shall protect them against indefinite and destructive exactions on the part of their protector ? They find themselves under an arbitrary and irresponsible government , which takes away with a strong hand at its own discretion , and distributes the spoils as it pleases . The exactions of such a government tend to an indefinite increase . Unless some way can be invented , to limit the share which tyranny may take out of the proceeds of industry , and so to make property secure against the grasp of power , it will be found in time that the progress of exaction is outrunning the progress of production . The old system of robbery has reappeared under the form and name of government . Accumulation ceases . Capital vanishes , for property , no longer secured to its possessor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor in production . The people sink down discouraged and degraded ; the country is more and more impoverished ; wide plains once irrigated by artificial watercourses , and waving with wealth , are gradually abandoned till they become a desert ; cities once resounding with commerce , lie in ruins ; the land is emptied of its inhabitants , and of its extinguished civilization there remains only a story or a song . These illustrations may suffice to show what results are to be expected when power interferes to control the distribution of the products of industry . If there is a disorganized state of society , where no law exists but that of mutual plunder , where every man appropriates whatever he can seize , and where every man holds what he has only till he meets some other person strong enough to take it away from him ; or if there is an African or Asiatic despotism which protects against private robbery only that it may have a monopoly of plunder , and which appropriates to itself , and distributes at its will , all that it seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which-enterprise is discouraged ; capital hides itself and becomes extinct ; production ceases ; the hands of labor hang down in xveakness and despair ; alL things tend , irresistibly and rapidly , to the lowest pitch of barbarism . Nor would any other result be realized in the end from any other interposition of power , under whatever forms or names ; to seize and distribute the products of industry . A " social republic , " founding itself upon the maxim that " property is theft , " and seizing all the products of industry and dividing them at its discretion by the sword , would have the same effect with any other system of robbery equally stupendous . If in this age of the world , it could stand long enough to work out all its natural results , it would convert the fairest and richest country of Europe // into a wilderness haunted by impoverished and wretched barbarians . Another ancient method of distributing the products of industry in society , is by a different sort of robbery  --  a robbery which instead of seizing upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rather upon the persons of laborers , and uses them as cattle . This is the instittition of slavery , which realizes literally , and according to the proper meaning of words , Mr. Cotton 's grand proposition that " labor is capital . " Under this institution , the landholder and capitalist  --  the planter-is literally the proprietor of " labor and other capital ; " and , in the distribution of wealth , the laborer is of no more account than any other beast of burthen . Those who have seized upon the person of the laborer , and who claim his blood and sinews and all his faculties as their property , compel him to work without any share in the result . He must have what may be necessary to keep him alive and in working condition ; but whether he works more or less , whether his labor is productive or unproductive , he has no more share or interest in the distribution of wealth , than if he were a horse . Such a system , under certain conditions , may promote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of productive industry ; but it soon reaches its limit . The increase of wealth refuses to keep pace with the increase of population with which it is confounded . Those who tinder another system would have been the possessors of capital constantly accumulating , are more and more the possessors of labor ; and they imagine themselves rich , while for want of capital the labor of their increasing multitude of slaves is growing less and less productive . The laboring population , under such a system of distribution , is stimulated to activity only by the fear of punishment ; it is incapable of sympathy with any contrivance for the saving of labor or of any motive to frugality and accumulation ; arid if it can escape the lash , it has no care but to eat and drink and sleep at the expense of the proprietors , and to increase and multiply . rp*115 , so far as this system predominates , the natural resources and capabilities of the country , instead of being more and more developed by the increase of capital in proportion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the once fertile soil ; the smaller estates are swallowed up ; the inequalities of distribution become more extravagant ; in proportion as those who have no interest in production become more numerous , production itself is diminished ; and in the end , unless the proprietors of labor betake themselves to the atrocious trade of rearing slaves for exportation , there is nothing to distribute . All these methods of distribution are natural , in the sense in which depravity is natural . It is natural for selfish men to seize and appropriate by force the products of other men 's industry . It is natural for selfish men , having the superiority in arms , to // seize the persons of other men and to use them as cattle . But in another sense , all this is unnatural . It is all contrary to the design and the arrangements of the great Author of nature . In this better sense of the word , the only natural , and therefore the only legitimate distribution of wealth among the members of society is by a free e.xchange of commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , the land and the capital employed are both the property of the same man , and that man is himself the sole laborer , then , of the value thus produced , there is no distribution . But if one man is the possessor of land which he is unable to cultivate with his own labor , and for which he can not provide the necessary implements and materials of cultivation ; and if another man has an adequate supply of food for sustaining labor , and of seeds for plan ting , and of tools and cattle for agriculture , while yet he has no land on which to employ this capital ; and if another man has neither land nor capital , but has strength and skill which he is willing to employ in labor ; then it is for the interest of these three persons to combine land , capital and labor , and to divide the product according to any terms that may be agreed on among them . The laborer may rent the land and borrow the capital ; or the capitalist may rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may hire the labor and borrow the capital ; or under a different sort of compact the three may cultivate the land in partnership ; but whatever the arrangement may be , the aggregate value which the labor produces from the land by means of the capital , is divided among these three parties . That part which falls to the landholder is rent for his land . That part which falls to the capitalist is profit on his capital . That part which falls to the laborer is wages for his labor . How much of the gross amotint is for the use of the land , how much is for the use of the capital , and how much is for the labor , depends upon the free agreement beforehand in consequence of which these mutual accommodations and services were rendered . f*ach of the three parties freely exchanges what he has and can part with , for something else which is to him more desirable . What are the considerations which will determine the consent of each of these three parties ? For the sake of convenience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it productive to himself by borrowing the necessary implements and materials , and by hiring the necessary labor . A disbanded soldier from the Mexican war with neither skill nor strength for present labor , has obtained his " bounty land " on some wide and rich Northwestern prairie . His land is neither fenced nor stocked ; there are no barns upon it with supplies of food and seed left over from a former year ; and he has no means of making up the deficiency . But another man has a supply of these things , which he is willing to lend for a fair consideration . And just at this juncture , there comes along another // adventurer , healthy and sturdy , who understands how to work , and who is willing to work if an arrangement can be made that shall be advantageous to him . The question is , on what conditions will this landholder be able to borrow the capital of the one and hire the labor of the other ? it is obvious at first thought , that if he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than they are on him for the productive employment of their capital and labor , their share in the product will be greater than his . If in a new and isolated settlement there are twenty farms , and only one plow with one yoke of oxen , then while that state of things continues , the proprietor of that one plow and yoke of oxen will have all the landholders paying homage to him and begging him to dictate the terms on which he will accommodate them . Or if with a full supply of plows there is only one plowman , that plowman 's skill and strength , upon which ever farm and with which ever  |p16w  he may choose to employ it , will obtain a larger share of the product than can fall either to the proprietor of the plow or the landholder . We need not pursue the illustration of this topic ; for the method in which the wealth produced by the diversified and complicated codperation of industry in a civilized state , is distributed among all who directly or indirectly codperate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the very nature of wealth as consisting of objects of value that can be appropriated and exchanged-that it constantly tends to distribute itself by the free exchange of commodities and mutual services . At each successive production of value , the value produced divides itself among all the parties that coöperate in that production . A thousand bushels of wheat in a storehouse at Chicago , have been received there in exchange for other articles which at the time and place of the exchange were of equal value . Part of that value was the consideration paid for the use of the land on which the wheat was raised ; - an other part was for the use of the capital employed in raising it ; and still another part was for that exertion of human skill and strength without which land and capital would have been unproductive . The wheat arrives in due time at the mills at Rochester . By this change of place it has acquired an additional value which has accrued partly to the proprietors of wharves , vessels , canals and railroads , who have exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and partly to porters , draymen , sailors and others who have exchanged for it their personal services . The miller converts the wheat into flour packed in barrels . Here then is a new value created-part of it accruing to the proprietors of the waterfall , the building and the machinery , for the use of their propertyanother part to the cooper , for the use of his capital and the exertion of his skill and strength  --  and another part to the lahorers in the mill , as the equivalent for which they have exchanged their // services . And thus we may trace the flour through all its stages of transportation or of manufacture , and we shall find that at each successive creation of value , whether by change of place or by change of form , the value created tends by a law of nature to divide arid diffuse itself among all who codperate immediately or remotely in creating it . These elementary views of the nature of wealth , of the forces that codperate in the production of we&lt;h , and of the natural laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy what " the four ground rules " are to arithmetic . Upon these elementary views , all the applications of the science primarily depend . And as the science , starting from these first principles , is extended by induction and analysis , and carried out into its details , it is found to be capable of the most important applications to the business of legislation and to the whole philosophy of the welfare and progress of society ; while on the other hand , he who undertakes the functions of a political or social reformer without a familiar acquaintance with these elements of political economy , will be likely to involve his schemes in the grossest and most fatal blunders . Mr. Kellogg 's book is an attempt to set forth " the cause why few are wealthy and many poor , " and to propose a remedy . The mistakes upon which the whole attempt is founded , are of such a nature that a little familiarity with the distinct meanings of the three words , wealth , capital and money , or a little familiarity with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible for the author , with all the benevolence of his intentions , to make such an " exposition " arid proposal . He confounds the productive power of capital , or in other words the profits of capital , and the rent of land also , with the interest of money ; and in his opinion " the power of money to accumulate value by interest "  --  and indeed every other quality of money - is dependent entirely on the will of the legislature . His grand remedy for all the evils that afflict society , is the issue of an indefinite quantity of paper money , which shall be loaned by the government of the United States , to all corners who will secure the loans they ask for by a mortgage of productive lands o* twice the value of the loan , and for the use of which the borrower shall pay interest to the government at the annual rate of 1* ' . per cent . This paper currency is not to derive its value from so paltry a circumstance as convertibility into gold arid silver at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be money in its own right by the efficacy of an act of Congress endowing it with all the qualities of money . If a man finds at any time that he has more than he wants of this " safety fund money , " as the inventor proposes to call it , he can exchange it on demand for a " safety fund note , " which is nothing else than a certificate of stock in a national debt paying interest annually at one per cent . The benev // olent inventor is quite sure that , under such a system , all sorts of industry would thrive wit hout check or fluctuation ; and that , in every creation of value , the laborer would get almost all , and the capitalist almost nothing . He has no suspicion that when his new order of things has been introduced , and money of gold and silver has been superseded by his new currency with indefinite capability of expansion , the price of land will increase , or the price of houses , or the price of food , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clothing , or the price of any product of labor ; while the price of labor itself will be indefinitely augmented . And his imagination glows with the anticipation of the moral changes which will ensue when labor shall obtain its " natural reward . " " Ultima Cum*ei venit jam carminis a*tas ; Magnus ab integro s*eclorum nascitur ordo ; Jam redit et Virgo , redeunt Saturnia regna . " Thus in consequence of the expulsion of gold and silver from circulation as morley , and the legislative reduction of the rate of yearly interest to 1 * per cent , " Time will fly back and bring the age of gold . " Or , in the author 's own expressive prose , " When the natural reward of labor is secured to the laborer , poverty can not exist in any family whose members are able and willing to work . And those who can so easily provide for their own wants , will cheerfully contribute to the support of the sick and needy . They will be able to supply themselves amply with the comforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moral culture . The incentives to vice will be comparatively few . Avarice first arises from the fear of want ; to rOmove want will therefore in a great measure remove this vice , and the unnumbered evils which are its attendants . " - pp. 284 , 285 . " If interest be reduced to a just rate , almost the entire population of the country will be engaged in some species of productive industry , and the laboring classes will be relieved from the support of a numerous body who now live by their wits-that is , by contriving to obtain the products of others without toil . When money is made a just standard , the injustice of contracts founded upon it will cease , and many laws necessary to support the present unjust standard will disappear . " So long as monetary laws continue a standard that will wrest products from producers , and place and protect them in the hands of non-producers , they will require for their support the aid of the sword and hayonet , because man 's natural sense of right revolts against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when monetary laws shall sustain a just standard of value , which will award and protect products in the hands of their producers , they will of course conform to the natural laws of production , which were ordained by a higher than human power . The distribution then being according to justice , strife will cease , because a man having his own rights respected and protected , will naturally respect and protect the rights of others . The time is not far distant when this truth will be known and appreciated by all civilized nations , and the mistaken power of legal might , which has such dominion over man , will wither before the higher power of right . " - pp. 288 , 289 . And yet , before we are quite carried away by so cheering a prospect , we can not but ask for information on another point . Admitting the proximate results which the author anticipatesadmitting that , under his system of " safety fund money , " all // but an inconsiderable fraction of the product of industry xviii go , in every case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that inconsiderable fraction will go to the proprietor of the land and the capital-what motive shall hinder the laborer from consuming his wages as fast as he earns them ?  --  and what security have we that the capitalist will not withdraw his property from all productive employment to consume it in the gratification of other desires which , in this new condition of things , have become more effective than the desire of accumulation ? The stimulus to that frugal saving on the part of individuals , out of which groxvs all the accumulation of wealth in society , is found in the productive power of capital and the returns which capital therefore brings to its proprietor . What is it which determines the laborer to put five dollars every month into the Savings Bank , instead of spending it for a frolic or for some foolish luxury ? It is that every deposit is productive of yearly interest at five per cent . If a man has twenty thousand dollars , why is it that instead of spending it upon hounds and cooks and fiddlers , he invests it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments are productive , and will give him annual returns of six , eight , or perhaps twenty per cent . Where then is Mr. Kellogg 's beautiful picture of universal industry , contentment , benevolence , and good morals ? Gone to the limbo of vanity . The laborer to whom that exhilarating increase of wages has been secured , finds that the superfluous dollar or five dollars of his first day 's wages , is incapable of any lucrative investment . And before the end of his first month under the new system , he finds that a untversal paralysis has struck the nerves of industry . The ship that returned from her voyage richly laden , goes forth no more . One great establishment and another is beginning to be dismantled . The fires of the forge are extinguished . The water pours along the raceway , neglected . To the momentary dance of exhilarated prodigality , there begins to succeed the grim processton of alarm , want , idleness , despair and rage . We were looking for the laborer 's millennium , but behold ! destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " We have said less of Mr. Colton 's book than its pretensions may seem to require . Our apology for this must be-if any apology is needed-our inability to do full justice to such a book within the limits of an article like this . rrhe leading idea of the book-its unity-is opposition to freedom of commercial intercourse between the United States and other countries . We could not enter upon the discussion of so great and grave a subject , and one so implicated with popular prejudices and vested interests , without more space than now remains to us . The time may come when this volume of " Public Economy " will be read by philosophic minds with an attention which , in the present stage of human progress , it can hardly command.
