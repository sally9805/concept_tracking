txt IN our last number we gave a hasty notice of the " Ne*v Theological Controversy , " which had originated in the publication of Dr. Bushnell 's two " Discourses on Christian Nurture , " and which then seemed likely to continue . Since that time , there has been but little progress in the discussion , and as far as publications are concerned , the staus belli is very nearly as we left it . The Committee of the Massachusetts Sabbath School Society have not seen fit to take any public notice of the " Argument " addressed to them . Meanwhile the author has assumed to himself the copyright which he never wholly relinquished , and has issued in a volume , " the Discourses , " the " Argument , " and other productions that are related to the subject in discussion . These are , an article on the " Spiritual Economy of Revivals , " first published in the Christian Spectator for 1838 ; another entitled " Growth not Conquest the true method of Christian l*rogress , " which originally appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two sermons , now published for the first time , one entitled " the Organic unity of the family , " and the other , " the scene of the Pentecost and a Christian Parish . " The design of this additional matter , was to explain , to vindicate , and to qualify the positions advanced in the Discourses and the Argument . The volume is substantially otte , having one object and being sustained by the same considerations ; all of which are suggested or tmplied in the original discourses . The discourses give us the substance of the entire volume . The additional essays , &amp;c. , are but an ex pansion and defense of its l ) riaCiPleS and arguments . We do not propose to give an extended account of this volume . Nor do we think it necessary for the purpose which we have in view in this discussion . That it shows on every page the attractions peculiar to its author , we need not say . Our constant readers are too familiar with these attractions to require that they should be commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bushnell , as one associated in the conduct of this journal , is a writer and a man whose aid we value most high 1 ) 7 , and on whom we very much rely . We are very willing , too , to have them suppose , that we should be inclined to bestow a friendly and perhaps a partial criticism upon any of his productions . We should be quite ashamed to be supposed capable of any other feelings . At the same time , we are not willing to confess ourselves conscious of arty deficiency in the purpose to judge of his positions and argume ntsinanyotherthan the light of truth , or to withhold from them a full and unbiased scrutiny . Without premisingany fartlter , we enter at once into the critical examination which we have proposed , following our own order of thought . We inquire at the outset-What is the truth that is advttnced and defended by the author ? To this inquiry , he has given a distinct answer . The doctrine of the original discourses is thus announced in his own language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true idea of Christian education ? I answer in the following proposition , which it will be the aim of my arguments to establish , viz : THAT THE CHiLD 15 TO GROW UP A CHRISTIAN . In other words , the aim , effort and expectation should be , not , as is commonly assumed , that the Views of Christian Nurture , and of subjects adjacent thereto ; by Horace Bushneti. l2rno , pp.247 . Hartford : Edwin Hunt 1847 . Vom . VI . 16 // child is to grow up in sin , to be converted , after he comes to a mature age ; but that he is to open on the world as one that is spiritually renewed , not remembering the time when he went through a technical experience , but seeming rather to have loved what is good from his earliest years . " - p. 6 . The proposition announced in these words seems to us to be sufficiently clear and intelligible . It speaks its meaning for itself . To avoid any possible debate or confusion , we add that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning a duty . The duty is that Christian parents and teachers should aim , strive and expect , to realize a ( riven result . That result is , " that the child is to grow up a Christian . " The reality and the obligation of the duty , will of course turn upon a question of fact . That question is , whether the result conteml ) lnted is both possible and attainable . This is the only question about which there is or can be any difference of opinion , and the whole discussion is entirely concerned with this question of truth or of fact . No man will deny or question , if the imf ) lied truth thus contended for by Dr. Bushnell is established , that the consequent duty will follow . The proposition actually discussed is one of fact . The author contends that a child can and may be expected to grow up a Christian . The great question about which he concerns himsetf , is the question of the truth or falsehood of this position . Vie inquire next , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Dr. B. takes and defends ? We raise this inquiry , because the author contends that it is peculiar , in distinction from that which he supposes his readers to hold  --  and in distinction also from the view current among the churches ; and that therefore it will be considered by them as new , though inasmuch as it has been recognized in other countries and at other times , it is not new . We raise it also for another reason . There is a certain class of critics , whose wisdom is often exhausted by the very pithy observation on a doctrine , which they are unable or are indisposed to canvass , that " whatever is new in it is not true , and whatever is true is not new . " For this common decision of cautious and non-committal wisdom , we have very little respect , albeit it constitutes the entire stock of many who are cried up as oracles for safety and profoundness . It is with an eye to them that we propose the question , whether there is any thing peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , as we have said , thinks his views are new and peculiar . " But unhappily the public mind is preoccupied extensively by a view of the whole subject , which I must regard as a theoretical mistake , and one which must involve , as long as it continues , practical results systematically injurious . This mistaken view it is necessary , if possible , to remove . And accordingly what I have to say will take the form of an argument on the question thus put in issue . " - pp. 5,6 . What the mistaken view is , with which he joins issue , he indicates in his formal proposition , as already quoted . He does it in the words , " not as is commonly supposed that the child is to grow up in sin , to be converted after he comes to a mature age . " With the view thus stated he holds a vigorous argument . He expands this view . He dwells upon it . He attempts to show its absurdity and inconsistency with the nature of things , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and in grace , with his declarations in his word and with the experience of other nations and other times . The fact that the view against which he contends is really held , he does not discuss . This he takes for granted . Is he right in // this assumption ? Is the opinion against which he contends the prevailing opinion , and is his own opinion peculiar in being different from that which generally prevails ? In undertaking to answer this question , we can only speak of that which is more generally received , and which is recognized as the current doctrine . For a doctrine may be current , and yet not be universally received . The writer of these remarks has always believed and preached the doctrine advanced by Dr. Bushnell . He has even preached it in the same antagonistic form which he has adopted , as being different from the theoretical views of the great mass of the Christian community , and from the practical aims of the most of his hearers . It is to be supposed that not a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same opinion . Many too may have felt dissatisfied with the current doctrine , and have felt and strongly felt that there must be a truth that differed from that doctrine , and yet have not reached any settled conclusions . All this is cluite consistent with the fact that the view of these discourses differs from that which is generally received . What then is the generally received opinion in respect to Christian nurture ? It is generally held , we believe , that there is a nurture which is peculiarly Christian-that there are methods of discipline and instruction which are the appointed means of spiritual blessings , and that to fulfill the measure of duty which rests upon the Christian parent , is a most serious obligation . We do not believe that there exists a Christian parent in New England , who does not suppose that he owes important duties of this kind to his children , and that the training which they shall receive from him has much to do with the question , whether they shall be Christians at all , and also with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We believe it is also true , that the majority of New England Christians view this training as a process preparatory to the possession of the Christian character by their children ,  --  and that as a prepara. - tory discipline , a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ ' it is generally to be long continued , and patiently prosecuted for years , before the result shall be realized-that the main design of so slow and gradual a development of the powers of the infant into childhood and youth , is to provide for a long course of this discipline , which may be expected to result in conversion , when the child attains that reflection which shall fit it to understand and receive the Gospel . This it is thought must be the ordinary history of the Christian life . Exceptions are admitted to be possible by all . It is allowed that now and then , there may grow up the rare and blessed spectacle of a child that shall have never known the time when prayer and praise were not exhaled from its spirit , as natura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning rises from the dewy bosom of the eartha child into the history of whose intellectual and moral life , kind aflbctions and virtuous resolutions , conscientious services and religious hope , have been so closely intertwined , as to seem a part of that life itself . But these children are spoken of as special and strange exceptions to the ordinary method of God-as sanctified of God by a special act of his favor ; - children around whose cradle bright angels of grace have watched , and into whose infantile dreams they have breathed gentler and purer influences than fall to the lot of ordinary mortals . The blessinm* of such a child is looked upon as peculiar , to hope for which would be presumptuous by ordinary mortals , and to attempt to train which would be to commit an audacious effrontery , by asserting a claim sure to be dis // honored , upon the secret and reserved gifts of God 's sovereign pleasure . Accordingly such children are looked for in the hut of some widowed mother in israel , as the rare comfort in sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheer her along her desolate pathway-or perhaps in the house of some patient and noble laborer for Christ , the earr*est of the reward for which he hopes  --  or perhaps in the line of a long series of eminent Christians , as the memorial of prayers that in past generations went up to God-or , which is last*and rarest of all , as sent into some house of godlessness and sin , a child of innocence in the midst of corruption , to carry the remembrance , the reproofs and the attractions of heaven , into the very precincts and among the very defilements of hell ; We do not say that the ; existence of such a character is4leemed a miracle , for it would nof be trim ; but we do say , that as far as the hope to rear such a child by efforts app ropriate to the result , is concerned , so far it is viewed as though it were a miracle . It is treated as a miracle , so far as not to be labored for , because labor for it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even prayed for with any faith , because it is a gift of so rare and singular a character , that even to pray for it to be wrought by concealed methods of grace , is thought to be presumptuous . The grounds for this opinion are manifold . There is first , the view of the Christian scheme as necessarily beyond the reach and comprehension of the mind of the infant . The child , it is reasoned , must be saved by the Gospel . The Gospel to exert its influence on the character , must be understood . In order to be understood , the character of God , the evil of sin in its demerit and danger , the work of Christ as a justifying Savior , must be reflected upon and believed . rJhese are the fewest truths , and this the simplest scheme of doctrine , that can be thought of , to furnish the basis of faith . But a mind to understand these truths , must he trained to reflection , and must be so far developed as to comprehend them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not supposed essential to conversion . Too often is it thought necessary that the Gospel should be expanded into an intricate metaphysical stalement , and embarrassed by the subtleties of scholastic distinctions , and assent is demanded to all this in order that the Christian character may have a beginning . For this a mature mind is requisite  --  a mind not only mature enough for the ordinary processes of thought , but one specially disciplined in the niceties of dogmatic theology . But to such a com prehension of Christian truth , the mind of the child is entirely unequal , and on the : *theory which makes it necessa*y , it is cut off from the Christian character , simply because it is not sufficiently mature ; and no effort , no prayer , and no hope is put forth , till the child shall be old enough to comprehend the Christian scheme . All the efforts that are used have a prospective reference . They all look to a date pushed forward in the history of the child . The prayers even , are all drafts on time upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of possible conversion , great pains are taken to simplify the doctrines of Christianity down to the capacity of the child . Metaphysical ( lisquisitions on the nature of the soul , the attributes of God , the evidences of Christianity , and almost on the origin ofevil , are amplified and diluted . They are spiced with stories and illustrated by pictures , in order to steal a year or two upon the appointed time for the development of reflection , and to shorten the dreary season of necessary impiety . Another cause akin to the one just named , is the very prevalent // conviction that the Christian life must begin by regeneration experienced as a conscious change of character . This supposes the capacity for reflection distinctly developed , and the power to scrutinize closely and clearly the inner self , in order to observe and record its internal processes . Now inasmuch as the child is intellectually incapable of such an experience , it is thought in vain to hope for it . The child lives in the outward . Its inner self is unknown as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its passions , hopes and fears , are all projected upon the outward objects that excite them . It hardly knows that it has a heart , a conscience , affections , or a will , and the teaching that it must have a new heart to be . gin with , and that it will do no good to begin till it has first aimed to have a new heart and succeeded in this aim , is paralyzing to the parent , and if nothing worse , is Chinese to the child . The parents are aware that such a conversion , as a conscious event to the mind reflecting on itself , is beyond the years and the powers of the infants that prattle on their knees . To alleviate this difficulty , the same effort is used to force the mind to an unnatural precocity , and to drive it into itself by most unnatural and revolting efforts at self-reflection . The child is set to the metaphysical study of the question , how to get a new heart , ' by a treatise or story that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant understanding . Last of all , the prevalent view is confirmed by a reference to the actual history of early conversions . It now and then happens that in a season of excited religious activity , or perhaps stimulated by the warntngs and entreaties of faithful parents , one or many children seem to begin the Christian life , and the hope is feebly ventured that they have true Christian feelings . But the season of present excitement is soon passed . Childhood and youth return to their sports and their thoughtless moods , and because the Christian convert does not show his piety by the gravity of f ) remature manhood-because he does not moralize like a sage of seventy , or look out upon life with the sadness of one who has had experience of life 's anguish and its tears , is early promise of goodness is at once set down as a " false conversion , " and this severe conclusion is written on the brow of parents and Christian friends . Nay , it is well if it do not stare out from the chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no hope , ' the evil heart still remains . ' We ask next whether the view advanced in these discourses is true and justly stated . We quote the words a second time for the sake of clearness . " The aim , effort , and expectation should be-that he the child is to open on the world as one that is spiritually renewed , not remembering the time when he went through a technical experience , but seeming rather to have loved what is good from his earliest years . " Is the fact taken for granted in this proposition of duty , that a child may and may be expected thus to " open on the world , " well grounded ? Is the statement true or false . On this point we feel no hesitation . Of its truth , we doubt not in the least . And yet to guard against any possible misconstruction , we add the following explanations of what we suppose the author to have intended by his language . When he speaks of the child rightly trained as " not remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we do not suppose him to mean that the child shall know nothing of reflection upon sin indulged or committed , with the honesty of hearty repentance and the relief of trusting faith . Such " experiences " are not unfrequent occurrences in the history of the best of men long after the first " tech // nical experience " which seemed to introduce them to the Christian life . Nor do we suppose that he means , that there is to be none of that conflict between duty and inclination which constitutes much of the mora ! discipline of the present life . On the contrary he speaks of " a rough mental struggle " which the child already a Christian , often goes through " at some future day , " and which is so like a first conversion as to be supposed to be such a fact . When too , he describes the child as " seeming rather to have loved what is good from his earliest years , " he does not mean that this child has never known the love of the evil as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , or that his love of the good has been an even onward impulse , driving him with the steady impulse of the trade winds on the smooth Pacific . This last can not he intended if the first is not . The doctrine as thus explained we hold to be true , and contend that the effort of a true Christian nurture should be , so to train a child that he should thus open on the world . We hold it to be true for the following reasons . First , it is not necessary as is commonly believed that Christianity in order to be received should be received as a completed system of truth , adapted to the reflective mind that is fully developed . Right feeling or which is the same thing , holy feeling , is possible and supposable with no knowledge either of God or Christ , of sin against the Creator , or of his readiness to pardon and save . To suppose an infant wakening into a life with no emotions but virtuous emotions , and with a will acting itself out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its nature is an impossibility , though the supposition may never he realized in fact . To make such a supposition possible , there is no need that the infant should cease to be an infant ,  --  no necessity that in the place of the infant 's knowledge limited to the furniture of the nursery , there should be substituted the wide range of the man who soars beyond the stars in his thoughts of the infinite Creator . There is no need that instead of the infant 's unreflecting conviction that it owes obedience to a mother 's will , for the sake of that mother 's love , there should he introduced the whole theory of God as a lawgiver and a reflecting faith as to the reasons why heoughtto rule . Nor is it required that instead of the child 's conviction that it is well and right to trust the look that tells him that the mother , whose love has been wronged , still longs to forgive , and under the power of that look , to give way to generous relenting , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by faith , and a knowledge of the right theory of the atonement . As soon as there is the knowledue of any moral truth , so soon is there the possibility of a hearty subjection to that truth . As soon as the moral nature of man is at all developed , so soon can that nature he followed , and take to itself the fair proportions prescribed by its own internal laws , and be harinoniously developed . We say clearly and without reserve , that it is possible for a perfect being to exist in the perfect exercise of all its powers , to have nothing but virtuous or holy feelings , nought but right or holy purposes , days , weeks , nay , months and years , without the knowledge even of God , or the Savior . Wherever there is sin , there may be holiness ; wherever there is wrong feeling , there may be right feeling ; wherever there is a wrong character , there may be a right character . It is a very common doctrine that infants are sinners from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , that they are sinners before they sin . But against whom do they sin ? do they sin against God . Sin against God , when all the // objects in the universe , whose existence they recognize , may be , a doll , a rattle-box , a hammer , their nurse or their mother ! This is impossible . If then they may sin and exercise sinful emotions , or put on a sinful character , without knowing that there is a God , and much more without being reflectingly acquainted with even the simplest elements of religious knowledge , it is true on the other hand that they may have holy feelings and put on a holy character , without such knowledge and such reflection . To present the argument in another form it is not uncommon to see a child in some exhibition of sin against a parent 's love and authority , and to watch the unreasonableness , the perversion , the fixed and passionate willfulness against love and patience and reason in the demand of the parent . Who ever saw such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable instant , when the worse feeling should give place to the better , and reason and love should gain the victory , and who , if he has waited long in vain , did not condemn the infant sinner for failing to feel and do as he ought , and perhaps also condemn the patience of the l ) are nt , because it withheld the punishment that was due . But all this it may be said , pertains to the natural affections , and to the very imperfect morality which regulates their workings , and has no relevancy to the queslion , whether thei'e can be holiness or true and religious virtue in a mind so infantine . To this we reply that it has the utmost relevancy , for the reason that if in the cases supposed there can be sin in the moral and religious sense , then in the same case there may and ought to be holiness . Nay there may be holiness , because there ought to be holiness . We might at this point go on and show positively how there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for riuht feehinr and a a action , all the motives that urge It strongly to the right , and all the requisites in itself to make its activity reach to the heart and carry with it the whole man . But this will be brought up by succeeding considerations . It may here be objected , that for the purposes of testing character , the child 's want of acquaintance with religious truth may suffice , but that it can not for the purpose of recovery and rel ) entance-that to act on the mind for this object , reli ious truth must be formally stated and received with mature reflection , and hence that we can not hope for the recovery of the child until its powers can concern themselves with the mysteries of redemption . The objector would doubtless argue that there is a peculiar power in the love of God to man , as revealed in the life and death of Christ-which can not be brought to act for his recovery , till God as existing and God as revealed in Christ , and Christ as living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be comprehended by the soul . We do not lose sight of the power of this truth , compared with any and every other truth which the mind can know . It shines out amidst all the other knowledge to which man attains for his moral renovation , as the sun among the stars . But the question is , is man so hopelessly evil in every case , or in the majority of cases , that he must wait till this truth can be comprehended , before his moral recovery can be secured , and the will be made a captive to saving influences ? Certainly not . That which gives the truth its power , is , that here is love for the unworthy , so patient and forbearing , that it will do every thing that it can to recover the sinner , and use every possible method to show the intensity of this desire . Who shall say that this love may not look upon a wayward infant , and into the soul of the infant , // before that infant can understand the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall relax from its guilty purpose , and even relax from the guilty character of which that purpose is but an expression XVho knows that a mother 's look upon her child , may not be armed with the same converting power as attended the look which Christ gave to Peter ? Who does not know that such looks of faithful parents are attended with temporary relentings and resolves , whose only deficiency is that they carry not the whole man . What hinders that these same relentings should be lasting and thorough , and thus be repenungs unto life , which need not to be repented of . The fact should never be forgotten , that the objects of all the good or evil feelings , of which the child is capable , for its first years , are those that the family furnishes . The beginnings of its moral life are shaped and formed upon the living beings by which it is environed in its very earliest years . The authority and faithfulness and love , against which it nerves the mysterious and awful energy of its infant will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nurse . If by these it ts awed and subdued and charmed , it is by them as they are displayed in the parent and nurse . The only being whom the inFat adores and loves and worships , is the father whom it reverences by its childish insinet . The benefactor whose love warms it into love again , or charms down its obstinate and wicked purpose , is the mother that can never forget her child It is upon these beings so nearly allied to it , and in whose presence are formed and shaped all the earliest movements of its intellectual and moral being , that it tries the fearful experiment of sin , and as we contend may make the blessed experience of holy love and obedience . It should also be remembered that as this infant slowly climbs up to the distinct conception of God and of infinite goodness , or of Christ and of love unto death , it is out of the moral materials furnished from those real beings with whom it comes in contact , that it shapes these awful conceptions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These creations not seen but believed , ' are of all the truths which the adult man knows , the grandest and the most commanding . Reason and conscience both acknowledge them to be the appropriate and lawful sovereigns of the soul . As the young immortal looks out from the paternal roof , and gazes up to the higher roof of the heavens above him , that moment God as a higher and holier Father takes precedence of his earthly parent . The instant that he reaches out beyond his earthly relationships , he finds himself caught into those which connect him with the noral administration of God . But it may wefl he made a question whether these truths of faith , received by the reflecting and adult man , have more power for evil or for good-whether they are more commanding or are so fitted to move , as the realities perceived by the senses and brought home by sensible contact , with which the infant man comes first in collision , and out of which it shapes its conception of these greaer realities ; - whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery , the administration of the family is not more etTective , and has not within itself higher capacities for moral and religious influence than any which comes afterwards . We find as a result in fact , that those unfortunate children who have had but scanty experience of goodness and of wisdom in earthly parents , are very slow to form the conception of goodness and wisdom in God , arid still more slow to believe that that they really exist . Whereas let a child have seen little else than // wisdom and goodness in a parent 's administration , he can never haVe the faith in their reality , or in their diffi*rence from the opposite , driven out of him . So much has faith in God to do with faith in parental virtue as taught by experience . We find on the other hand , another class of children who are esteemed most fortunate in their religious advantages , but who seem to us to be well nigh as unhappy as those whose early homes are houses of sin . The parents are amiable , exemplary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepless nights to the welfare of their children . They guard them with excessive care from contact with vulgarity , impurity and vice . They load them with counsels , concerning their duty to God who has made them , and the Savior who has died to redeem them . They lead them to the throne of grace . They inculcate the most rigid punctiliousness in repeating prayers and hymns . And they look for delightful results in the early piety of their chhdren* and in the beautiful development of a perfect Christian char. acter . And yet they are appalled and almost heart-broken , when they see the reverse of all this . The child loathes the religious counsels with which he has been dro *ged from his earliest infancy . They call forth no warm and affectionate response in his subdued and warm returns of love . The child is without moral sense , and rushes to every evil work as by the unbridled impulse of brute nature . What is the cause of this sad disappointment ? XVhv are these instrumentalities of no effect ? So far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al*riost universally at fault in this , that the religious instruction is not in harmony with the parental administration , but is hostile to it . The parental government , which should be the lively symbol of the government of God , is a likeness of any thing rather than of this . The one touches the child at every moment , envelops him by a perpetual presence , gives him impressions when he is in a most plastic state , becomes interwoven into all his earliest associations and prejudices , and furnishes the materials out of which he conceives of spiritual realities . The other government is described by words , and brought down to the infant understanding by illustrations . But these words are all taken from things that pertain to the lower government-the illustrations are drawn from these relations . If this administration is weak , indulgent , capricious , luxurious , deficient in true moral earnestness and manifest sinceritv-if in a word it does not represent truly and heartily the administration of God , all the religious admonition and prayer and expostulation may not only be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than lost , because the power that there is in its awful words and awful thoughts , may be expended only to deaden sensibility , and to excite disgust and contempt . Hence there is many a child who may with truth be said to be most unfortunate , just in proportion to the amount of education called religious which he has received . No one is so hardened as he , so hopelessly irreclaimable , so repiobate to all good , so desperate in respect to recovery . These considerations are sufficient we think to establish the fact that , in order that a nurture appropriately Christian should begin or even take effect , it is not necessary that the mind be mature enough to receive Christianity as a system of truth . Nor is it requisite , we observe in the second place , that the Christian life should begin as a conscious change of character , and that on this account its beginning should be delayed till after the mind is mature enough to understand and strive after such a change . The doctrine of conversion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essence of true virtue which it involves , we hold to be philosophically evident , and to be clearly revealed and sanctioned by the Scriptures . We can conceive of nothing virtuous which does not pertain to the character , the heart , the will , or whatever you call the commanding law of the man . If this be wrong , it ought to be right . If it ought to be right , it ought to be right at once . If it ever is right , it must begin to be so by an instantaneous occurrence . And that such a change should occur in the moral history of a man mature enough to give account of himself , and who has been living with all his energy in a wrong direction , without being noticed by himself in some of its attendant experiences , and without producing a decisive alteration in the course of his thoughts , his feelings , his purposes , his hopes and his joys , would be the most unlikely of all events . But it were quite as unnatural , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even should be able to notice each successive step of the process , and to mark with unerring precision the time upon the clock when thischange occurs . It were unnatural we say to expect it , and the results are most unnatural when it is made necessary as a test of the reality of the occurie nce . And it becomes especially unnatural , and to a sound mind revolting and fanatical , when it is demanded that the man by inference even , should be able to tell the moment when God by his finger touched his spirit and made it whole . When the additional doctrine is held or the demand is made , that the soul should know the presence of the Spirit by direct consciousness , the material is furnished for the worst excesses and the most disgusting orgies of fanaticism . The working of the doctrine may be arrested by the sound sense or the gentle spirit of many a saintly and pious soul , or by the social influences of a well ordered religious community . But the unholy fire is laid upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sulphurous smell even with the purest offering , and it will be well if it does not choke it altogether , or profane and defile the altar on which it was kindled . If then the doctrine of conversion as used or applied , must be applied with these cautions to the reflecting man , how much more to the unrefleeting infant , if a man may be converted , and yet not know the time or trace the process , how much more may the child be thus converted . And if the fact that it so occurs , forms no objection in the case of the man , why should the incapacity for it in the case of the child be any objection . The argument then , that a child can not enter the Christian life , because it is too young to go through the experience of a conscious conversion , must fall to the ground . That this conversion be genuine in the case of the man , it is not required that it be developed to the eye of reflection , in all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the child at all ? If a change from holiness to sin in the case of our first parents , might all turn upon the choice or rejection of the forbidden fruit , surely a change from sin to holiness may turn on a single act of love or obedience , that is put forth by a child . There is no ground of objection from the apparent failure in the instances of early conversion which have been tested by experience and been thought to fail . The tests in the majority of these cases are wholly inappropriate and false . It is not only ignorant but cruel to expect that the Christian child should cease to be a child ; and to fro*vn upon the first buddings of its childish piety with suspicious looks , because it does not wear all the forms of reflecting wisdom , or to discourage the first and feeble beginnings of its hopes because // they are mingled with the thoughtlessness , the changeful moods , and the occasional inconsistencies which are natural to merry and careless infancy . If we judged of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as unsuitable as those which we apply to children , it may well be questioned whether the tests would not as often disappoint us . Then again , we do not give to these early nurselings the genial Christian culture which we might and ought . Certainly we do not , if we chill them by our suspicions of their sincerity , and force them into premature and hypocritical gravity by the rigor of our requirements . So too , if we withhold from them the constant incitement of our own tempered lives and pure affections and consistent purposes , the appropriate atmosphere which dependent childhood seeks and requires , we should not yonder that an early blight so often serves to blast their delightful promise . Childhood lives in the atmosphere made for it by its elders ; if that atmosphere is corrupted , let it be no matter of wonder , that its piety so often seems to die . To all this it may be said , that this may be a finely sounding theory , but it will not hold true in fact-that though it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not thus early begin the Christian life , yet it is not to be expected that they will do so in fact . Qertainly they will not in fact , so long as it is believed that they will not ; and whether it is believed that they will not or that they can not , makes but little difference , in its influence on the diligence and zeal with which we labor for this end . If it be a received doctrine that the Christian life can not begin , till religious truth is distinctly received , and until the powers are matured for a formal conversion , then no effort will be made for any other result . All the nurture that is bestowed will contemplate a prepa ration for a deferred success . But let it be once believed , that there can be a religious nurture , in the very earliest trainina of infancy , and what earnestness of effort will there be , that the trainina be made religious . If it must be a theory only , and not a theory realized in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often a theory , and so rarely a fact . But let it be supposed that an angel should have the sole care and handling of an infant from the moment of its birth , and that all the earnestness of a seraph 's ardent piety , should be able to communicate with the infant through the means of power that are furnished in human sympathies , nod by parental affection , can it be thought for a moment , that such a parent would convey no moral and religious impressions , by its looks and ways , and the whole machinery by which the mother knows how to awaken the interest , and to move the svmpathies-that even before the Iangun ge of words were learned , the Inn gunge of the heart would not be used for this purpose . No man can doubt it for an instant . And there only needs to be the same faith and the same earnestness for the object in the mind of every l ) are nt , to induce a revolution in the expectations and aims and results of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need not urge the question of fact , whether or not the child will be truly holy before its acquaintance with God and Christ . We may safely and reasonably believe , nay , we may certainly know , that the preparatory influences of the nursery may blend so gracefully and harmoniously with its rudimental religious instruction , and both well touether tha may act so * , tasthe powers are developed , and the knowledge is enlarged and the habits are matured , there shall be first a Christian infant , then a Christian child and then a Christian man . // We do not suppose it will be objected by any one , that the mind of an infant is beyond the reach of the influences of the Divine Spirit . " Heaven lies about us in our infhncy , " says the poet , and it may he more than figuratively true . At what period of life , are moral truths realized with so much simplicity , and impressions of them more deep and earnest than in the tender years of an honest and truthful child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up before the soul with a grandeur so awful and a reality so vivid and unquestioned , as when the curtain is first drawn back from eternity , by the pious parent ? These impressions are fleeting , it is true , but while they last , they are most distinct , and the soul responds to them with quick and sensitive emotions . At what period would it be more likely , that the spirit should take of these things and show them to the spirit of man , with distinct and abiding presence , or wake up its emotions into a constant activity , than at this ? In infancy there are wondrous processes of thought and reflection , which are shut out from the eye of every observer , and which if they could be exposed or recalled , would solve all the perplexing questions of philosophy . It is then that are twisted the secret and mysterious cords , more magical than those which the fatal sisters ' were thought to spin . To these hidden processes , this divine spirit has direct access . it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No thread of their magic cord is so fine as to escape tts notice , and at a gracious moment , it can interweave a golden thread which shall bind the spirit to holiness and to God . A powerful argument for the truth of this view may be drawn from the fact that the system of things under which we live is in its design and structure a redemptive system . It is not a system of moral law , or as the old divines would say , a " cove nant of works , " under which each human being steps forth with powers matured , and with full knowledge of his duty and exposures , with a clear comprehension of God and his law , and a nature equally inclined to evil as to good  --  to make under these circumstances , the fearful experiment of obedience or disobedience which shall decide his destiny . Nor does he come into the world with a rudimental nature merely , which is placed here , to be educated into habits of holiness , and then to be transplanted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those powers which have here been trained at school . No ; it is for recovering purposes that man is here developed and trained and disciplined as he is . It is that he is contemplated as a being , who if tried under law would fall , and as stich taken in hand in the very rudiments of his moral being , in order that he may be saved . For this purpose is he placed in the hands of parents and teachers , and like a passive lump as he seems to be , yielded up to their control . For this object are his first offenses , and the whole development of his eyil self , so hemmed , limited and alleviated , that he may not by one bold act of rebellion against God , with open eyes rise up against the Eternal Throne and be set at once beyond hope by the terrible energy of his first transgression . For this to each man is ordered the checkered history of life 's joys and life 's sorrows . It is to recover and save . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have sinned and perverted that which is right and it profiteth me not , He will deliver his soul from going down into the pit . " To finish this work , nay , to give the solution to this work , Christ came to suffer arid die , and ascend again . But it was for Christ that this world was constructed , and every part of its structure , as well as all the institutions of the family , of society , of government and of law , are framed // to promote the purpose for which Christ was revealed to man . The Lamb of God was slain in the plan of God , before the foundation of the world and the world was made by him and for him , that here his work of recovery might go on . It is then a miserably narrow view of life , and all its structure and its history , to suppose it to have no Christian import , to suppose that no part of it has an important relation to the recovery of the soul , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is under the necessity some lime or other to be converted , in order that he may get ready to die and save his soul from perdition . It is a pitiful , nay a contemptible view of ' life , and of the great social organizations for the training of man , to suppose that they have no relation to God 's recovering purposes , and furnish no room for the exercise of Christian principle . In the true Christian view of life , every day is a Sabbath , every meal a feast of thanksgiving , every joy an occasion of praise , and every social gaiety a glad recognition of God . He , on the contrary , who looks upon the great enterprise of life for himself to be , to get through the unpleasant job of ' being con verted , and for his children : o get them through it some how or other , and that this is all the connection which Christianity has with the business , the pleasures and the institutions of life , has , to say nothing worse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole su h*ec t. in this work of recovery , the family acts a most important part . For it takes this being in hand , first of all , and has the earliest opportunities to meet him by its influences . Thea it takes him in hand when his substance is most susceptible to plastic influences . Then it surrounds and penetrates his being with influences , in their nature the most powerful , influences which are the longest remembered , which cleave and cling to his being with the most obstinate tenacity , and which even seem to become a part of the very substance of the soul . In addition to all this , the influences are in their very nature disciplinary and corrective , even when they are most perverted , and are capable of the highest religious efficiency . Surely , if the life which we live is constructed for this purpose in all its arrangements and its institutions , and if the family is an agency of such power , then it must be true that the Christian family ought to send out its inmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bud , the blossom , and the fruit , each in its order , and the one as preparatory to the other . We name another argument for the probable truth of this view . The world is *vaiting to witness the predicted triumph of Christianity . What is the difficulty . Why tarry its chariot-wheels . Is it for want of numbers . Is it for want of wealth . Is it for want of better and more apostolic organizations . Is it for want of learning . is it for want of noisy and earnest preachers . Is it for want of busy and even of officious activity on the part of laymen . Is it for want of frequent and violent praying . No , it is riot for the want of one or all of these , so much as it is for the want of that resistless , yet quiet attraction , and that noiseless yet sublime power , which there is in character harmoniously developed on Christian principles , thoroughly consistent in all its actings , taking to itself as by a right divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in literature , which Christianity helps forward ; and yet humble , meek , self-denying , and ready for a martyr 's confession or a martyr 's fire . One such man shall chase a thousand , yea , he shall put ten thousand to flight . We look around at this moment upon the state of christendom even in the best parts of it , and what do // we see . Not that there is not enough Christianity , hut that it is not of a better quality . XVe notice how warm and heroic trust in Christ as our example and life is dying away , and in its place , is the cold yet grasping confidence in the great money-god . We see how mainmon is not merely giving law to the mightiest monarchs , but penetrating and it would seem ruling the souls of all living men , eating like a canker at the heart of generous affhctions , and of self-sacri ( icing purposes , and turning the Christian life into a scramble and study for luxury and comfort , rather than exalting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church into two great classes , the rich , who in their study to be richer , forget that there are higher riches than those of earth , and the poor , who in their envy idolize the comforts which are denied them , and so cheat themselves of " the peace of God which passeth understanding . " We see how as a consequence the present lije is in the church , the great object of consideration , and the great mass of professed disciples seem to have relapsed into so delightful a slumber of comfortable living , that it may he asked whether God is not soon to visit his people , with some terrific judgment to teach them that this life is not their rest . Or if there come tiow and then an interval of zeal and prayer and faith , it is unnatural , tumultuous and violent , and so much so , as soon to tire us out by its convulsive activity , or to disgust us by its unnatural inconsistency . The cause of this inferior quality in our piety , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our life , that it is not developed in harmonious consistency with the development of the man , that it has to contend with the remains of the earlier life which was lived without Christ , in which evil and degrading habits were formed , and low maxims were adopted , and the whole struc ture of the mind was built up on the principles of selfishness and sin . Let there be a change in this respect and we shall see the development of a Christianity , which in the charm of its attractions and in the majesty of its commanding authority , shall possess the world . Let there but go out from the families that are called Christian , a generation which shall have never known the time when God was not honored and Christ was not loved , and the gre at principles of Christian truth were not recognized and obeyed , a generation whose entire training has been so even and harmonious , that all the recollections and associations of childhood shall suggest nothing but what is favorable to Christian virtue ; and there will stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never seen . Now it is from the fact that the world is waiting for a Christianity that is more consistent with itself , and from the fact that such a Christianity can only ho formed in the nursery , that we argue that die expectation encouraged in these discourses is reasonable and of binding force . The next inquiry which we raise respects the considerations used by the author in support of his doctrine . We had proposed to examine the entire argument of these discourses , and closely to scrutinize its several parts . But this our limits will not allow . We are forced to confine ourselves to those which have attracted the most attention and which have occasioned some controversy . The flrst* which we notice is the * We are informed that it has been asserted by some and betieved by more , that Dr. B. holds and teacties , that the first moral character is not in all cases sinful , but the training nay be so complete and so blessed of God , that there may be no place nor need for conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we did , we stiould seek to show that it is contrary to the induction of experience and the teaching of the Scripttires. // assertion of " something like a law of organic connection as regards cnaracter subsisting between " the parent and child . Some five pages of the volume before us are occupied with the illustration and defense of this argument , in the first of the original discourses , and an entire sermon is devoted to it as a separate topic . The use of the word organic , in this connection , has occasioned some inquiry and provoked sharp words of criticism . What the author intended by it is explained in the sermon which is devoted to this topic . He there says , " In maintaining the organic unity of the family , I mean to assert , that a power is exerted by parents over children , not only when they teach , encourage , persuade and govern , but without any purposed control whatever . The bond is so intimate that they do it unconsciously and undesignedly-they must do it . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether they will or not . " * * * * " And thus whatecer power over character is exerted in families one side of consent in the children , and even before they have come to the ace of rational choice , must be taken as organic power , in the same way as if the effect accrued under a law of simple contagion . So too when the child performs acts of will , under parental direction , that involve results of character , without knowing or considering that they do , these must be classed in the same manner . " From this explanation , of which we have given but a part , it appears sufficiently clear , that what he means by " organic connection " is the law by which certain unconscious influences are sure in fact to be conveyed from parents to their child ren ,  --  that these influences must tend to a good or evil result in a religious respect , that they may be turned to a most important religious service , and that these influences are often more de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher importance is attached . To show how powerful these influences are , that they are more powerful even than any other can be and more decisive , was the object of the author in his first discourses . To magnify and inculcate this importance , he set them forth under the bold and striking figure of those organic laws which in the vegetable and animal bind the material particles together in a unity of the same life , and make one part to feel every influence that befals the other . We say the " bold and striking figure , " for it is clear to us , it was by a figure , and by a figure only , that the term was used , and as such it was to be interpreted by the limitations which would grow out of its subject matter . We do not affirm , that these limitations were clearly expressed . We think they were not . The writer sacrificed accuracy to force . Perhaps he may err not infrequently as a writer , in being fond of " Orphic sayings " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most correctly . We are not often offended by these foibles of his , for we hold it good to have " a catholic taste , " and there is in his style a freshness and vigor which needs no praise from us . But the best things suffer the most from blemishes , and it is for this reason that we take the liberty of saying , that in propositions which are to serve as texts to hang a series of remarks upon , and which are to be expanded into a lengthened argument , enigmas , however bold and striking , are in more than one sense inconvenient . XVe have said that in the assertion that these decisive and peculiar influences of the family act by an organic law , the necessary limitations are not given . Those limitations are in this case of a peculiar and incomparable importance . If a man is , or is not guilty for his own sin , and if his holiness must be his own , // to have any moral virtue at all , then it can in no exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or moral essence is propagated or transmitted by organic law . Influences of the most suhtle character may environ the will from the moment of its emergence into a state of moral responsibility . They may he gathered and condensed into an immense and overmastering power before the soul is summoned to what seems to he the unequal encounter . But the moral in man , the will , is yet mightier than they all . They may transmit the prejudices , the sympathies , and the religious creed of the parent , and stamp into the man , the obvious inefi'aceahle impression of the family likeness , hut the soul , the moral self , is still independent in its own freedom . The fact that it is thus independent in its individualism , " while it is surrounded and swayed hy these " organic laws " of a social character , is only adequately accounted for by the theory of man , created as under redemptive influences , in order to feel which most completely , he must he met by them so early and be brought so entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his natural freedom arid as it were to destroy his moral respousibility . It is only as we understand that they are organic influences to save , and as we see in them aU a design to bless , that we can explain their unequal hearings and solve the mystery of human existence . If it be objected that the organic influences imply a power to curse as well as to bless , we can only say that no man can say that his existence in this world even under the most unfavorable preponder , ance to evil , is attended with no redeeming tendency , and that the claim of the gtiilty to mercy and especially to more mercy is a contradiction in terms . But this subject we can not argue at length . It will be conjectured from these remarks , that we should present the two great facts generalized hy Dr. B. as " organic laws " and " individualism , " in relative proportions differing considerably from those in which he employs them . We do not doubt in the least , that the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the responsibility of the individual man , to the neglect of the real and 1 ) O*Verful agency of those social influences , by which we rise and fall together , and in which are found the most indispensable elements of character . To expect a high degree of religious prosperity without availing ourselves of these " or*nnic laws " designed by God for man 's redemption , is both folly and sin . To neglect those pectiliar influences which are designed to prepare the soul for an early and gentle entrance into the kingdom of Christ , and to secure it there by the ties " light as air but strong as links of iron , " which hold the soul right , because it has never known any other than a conscientious and prayerful lifeto neglect these , we say , because perhaps by and by this ungodly and wicked spirit may be broken down into submission , and become the willing servant of Christ , though carrying upon his person the scars worn into him by the fetters and stripes of his bondage , is ignorant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capacity to discern the real laws of power which God has given us for good ; and it is ungrateful because it shows an unwillingness to work in harmony with God , and with the laws of his redeeming power , through a fond attachment to the one way which we prefer . So too , to abandon all those genial methods of Christian culture which are furnished in the refinement , the taste , the intelligence , and the laborious love of a Christian household , in which the soul as truly advances in the life of Christ , as it does in the prayermeeting // or the revival , is to attempt to unsphere the spirit from the conditions of its life in the body , and to despise as " common " those duties which God has hallowed . Holding then to the good and timely truth of the many forcible illustrations of these topics that abound in this VOlume , and wishing the book success In its ministrations of counsel suited to the times , we can not but wish that this class of truths had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming disparagement of another class . We might illustrate our views by a particular criticism on the remarks upon the Edwardean theology , and the revivals since the time of Edwards . We regret that our limits will allow b ' *t a single sup ' - gest ion . As far as these remarks indade an argume ? du ? n ad lzoininem with those of his opponents who boast that their theology is good because it is old , the reply given by showing that their views have sprung up within a little more than a centurv , is triumphant and unanswerable. they shall say , or by silence shall say more emphatically , We want no theology , theoretical or practical , older or truer than the ipsissirna i'erba of Edwards , ' we presume Dr. BuThnell will be very well content to leave them upon this avowal . XVe deny wholly , however , one inference which seems to be implied in his critique on the New England Theology , and that is , that " angular conversions , " explosive expertences. or spasmodic piety , ttre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of conversion is applied , than where it is repelled as inappropriate and profane . On the contrary , we believe it will be found true in fact , as well as explained by sufficient reasons , that in those communities in which there is the most metaphysial scrutiny of the nature and tests of conversion , there the revivals are the most pure , the piety is most rational , and the fruits most consis tent , graceful and abundant . If we look any where for the most fanatical and repulsive kinds of revivals , with their fruits in delusion and disappointment , we shall find them in those regions where Ne*v England Theology is most an offense . Those communities too which will most readily recognize and receive the truths which Dr. B. has advanced , will be the churches trained in the discriminating yet liberal spirit of the New England Theology . In respect to revivals of religion we feel bound to say a word . In his Argument , Dr. B. has spoken strongly of certain faults which accom pany and follow some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has commented with severity and point and justness , upon the piety that is formed on such principles and finds a theater in such scenes . In the volume before us , lie has aimed to give a fuller expression of his views on this subject , and to save himself from misconstruction has re-published the article on " The Spiritual Economy of Revivals . " In this , he speaks of ' revivals from an Opposite point of view , and shows that they have a powerful agency in the work of man 's salvation . He suggests also that they are provided for , by a law as really organte as that of the household , i. e. , the law of social influences . Notwithstanding all this , the influence of the volume and of its author has been quoted as decidedly hostile to these scenes of peculiar religious activity and triumph . This can not be done fairly , we are well assured . To show that it can not , would require a more extended argument than we can gtve , and to save a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond our hopes . There is nothing which we more desire to see , than a thorough discussion of the whole subject of revivals of religion , and of their relations to the progress and piety of // the church . To discuss this subject here would be quite unseasonable . But we must say a word in passing . We look around upon the most favored portions of Christendom , up . on the population of any of the purest religious communities , and what do we see ? First of all , multitudes living in an ill disguised or avowed contempt of the name , the spirit and the salvation of Christ , earthly , f ) rayerless , hopeless-many of them brutalized by a gross and stupid animalism , or savage by ferocious passion . Others there are , who with an outward respect for religious institutions , show none or next to none of that faith in Christ which cheers and purifies and controls . Of the churches that maintain the word and worship of Christ , one class have no belief in revivals of religion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of acting which contemplates any direct influence upon the men that most need to be reached by the gospel . Christianity is with them to show itself most conspicuously by refining the manners , by elevating the tastes , by enlarging the intellect , and by maintaining the charities of life , if in their view it has any fhrther end to gain , by transforming the character through faith in spiritual realities , that end they believe can best be promoted through its mild social influences . Another class are wedded to the church , and assiduously gather all within its gracious pale , that by the " organic " institutions appointed of Christ-baptism , confirmation , the sacraments and the liturgythey may attain toa comfortable hope of their salvation , and seem to attach to these a higher consequence , than to lay apostolic plans , to preach apostolic sermons , and to carry the apostolic summons to immediate repentance and a preparation of heart for heaven . Another class were once believers in the Gospel as having a converting message , and rejoiced in that direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . They delighted in those vigorous and personal efforts which arouse the attention of the whole community to an immediate consideration of the Gospel , in its relation to personal character and their eternal destiny . But these churches , where are they ? Some are distracted by projects and principles touching slavery , and temperance , and other questions that gender heat and strife . Others are speculating about the theory of revivals . Others are occupied with the various methods of Christian culture , and the important duties which the church owes to her children , to the family , to the school , to the national Congress , and to Mexico . These are all well and important , but what of the force that is to animate and move the church in all these enterprises ? Is it said that it makes and gathers strength by moving-that it is in obedience to the great laws of social and domestic and religious life - that it is deepening its piety , and drawing nearer to God . But are there signs that this is so ? Are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing more spiritual in their tastes , more chastened and cultivated in their estimate of life , less in haste to be rich , more generous and charitable to their neighbors , more manly and rational in their likeness to Christ ? or are they more intensely occupied with the hard and hardening objects of sense , with less and still less of the temper appropriate to the school of Christ ? Are the rich men more generous , furnishing with a true benevolence the means of saving their fellow men ? or are they less simple hearted and abundant in their gifis , more fond of a vulgar display , or of an exclusive and refined religious attention to themselves , which partakes more of self-culture by selfnursing , than of self-culture by selfdenial ? Are the poor more or less sordid , more or less contented , more // or less diligent in living for heaven ? Are the ministry preaching with a constant and earnest aim to see their hearers converted to a manly but earnest piety-now indirectly , to give cautions and instruction-now directly , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent on results ? or are some palsied by despai r , others frigid with indifference , others elegant sentimentalists or very popular preachers , others satisfied with holding an orthodoxy which they dare not preach , and but few laying those plans which make their people feel that their preaching means what it purports to say , that the soul without the Gospel must die forever ? ' Is there not a general impression that the style of preaching is changing , and from being manly , close , logical and commanding , it is becoming effeminate , diluted , literary and weak if we are told that we are to have no more revivals , but must seek out more approp ) riate methods of ad vanc lug religion-that we must get the power and show the power of our religion by obeying the great laws of activity under which we are placed and by which we thrive ; we reply , it is true we must obey these laws , and make our Christianity harmonious with them all , and grow by them all . And it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the church makes of these divine appointments , the more frequent and more powerful will be its scenes of revival . The more hallowed are our Christian homes by content , by simplicity of life , by intelligence , by a training for Christ  --  the more they are filled with an atmosphere redolent of heaven ; the more vigorous and faithful will be our care for those youth whose homes are any thing but Christian , and for those men who , whether their early training were Christian or heathenish , are without Christ , and presiding over homes where Christ is not so much as named . The more vigor* ous and symmetrical the piety of the head of the Christian household becomes , the more readily and the more efficiently will it act in the church , and when the church uses her united power to arouse the masses of spiritual ignorance and death which wait her movement . The more mature and perfect Christian character becomes , the more power will that character develop when it is seen in its united and social strength . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more frequently will it go forth in conqtest , " and the more numerous and more lasting will be its triumphs . We look then for more frequent , more quiet , and more lasting revivals than we have yet seen , unless the " dry rot " of worldliness , taste and sentimentalism is to consome the pillars of her strength . The power that there is in social sympathies and social strength , is too grand and commanding to be disused . Its possible results , as enlivened and moved by the presence and Spirit of God , are too rriagnificent in their promise to be relinquished or to be a theme of despair . We regret that we see no more promising signs of the speedy return of such revivals . We regret that the signs of an earnest solicitude for them are rio more abundant . We regret most of all that there is so much preaching that has little direct or indirect tendency to promote the great end of the Gospel . We regret that the acquiescence of our religious communities in this state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an earnest piety , that shall be symmetrical , tasteful , and of the highest culture . It is evil that an earnest piety should be deformed by ill manners , vulgarity , narrowness and cant . But a Christianity that is not earnest , and thus true to its Gospel that it may save the soul , is abLorred of God and ought to be abhorred of men . It is a thing of all others the // most untrue- " the greatest untruth that can be lived "  --  a profession of all others the most hypocritical , and of course most wearisome , disgusting and unprofitable . Let us have an earnest piety first of all , even if we must have with it vulgarity and cant . And let those who will not sympathize with such a piety , because they must associate with the enthusiastic *and vulgar , ask themselves where is their readiness to endure " the reproach of Christ , " which has been endured in this very form by all his followers from the first . The last inquiry which we raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hands of several classes of Christians . This inquiry is one of some interest , inasmuch as they have attracted a *vider attention than is usual . It is one of the rarest of occurrences , that a book written by a clergyman of one denomination is thought to be of so much consequence by so great a variety of other sects . If it assail. a sect at a single point , we expect of course a notice and reply . If it attack a prin* ciple which is common to several , we look , that they make a common cause , in the defense . This work does neither of these things . It has to do with a truth of universal interest and of high practical concern , and yet it has awakened the attention and received the commendation or criticism of almost every leading sect in the land . It is a hopeful sit*n to the lover of truth to feel that truth may reach beyond the bounds of a limited circle , and can find its way to the heart and reason of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles as might be expected . For though not in form , it is yet in fact an able vindication of the propriety of the rite of itifant baptism , by showing that it has a significance in the constitution of a Christian family , and in the rela tions of a child born in a Christian house . The strength of the argument for this rite , which is proved in the Scriptures by inferences , strong and numerous tndeed , and yet only inferences , is to be found in its meaning . The doctrine of these discourses is little else than an argo. ment to show that there is such a significance in one of the most niportant organizations subordinate to the Christian church . That organization is the Christian family , which may be said to be the ante-room , or the vestibule to the inner sanctuary . There are side-doors , it is true , that none may be shut out ; but this is designated by the law of nature and owned by the laws of redemption , as the entrance appointed of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolizing the privileges and hopes which gather about the infant that is admitted through its portals . Our Baptist brethren have resisted and do still resist the inference from this position . Much will be gained if they receive new views of the thing signified , if they acquire livelier and deeper impressions of the principles for which they reject the rite . We have little expectation that an Episcopalian critic can ever look at any doctrine except to see how far it agrees or disagrees with what is taught by the church . He may be impressed by a candid and graceful manner , and have sympathy with a strong and earnest mind ; but he seems to reason almost always with the major premise fixed and unquestioned , that what is provided by the church is true , important and divine . Not only must he hold that it is true , but that it includes all truth . We are riot at all surprised at the interest taken in this book by Episcopalians , nor at the grounds on which that interest rests , nor at he considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine , for the same reasons that the Baptists dislike it . For they exalt infant bap // tism just as really as the Baptists reject the rite . rfheir only complaint is , that Dr. B. does not go far enough . They would have him not only show that there is a fundamental reason for the rite in that great law of providence , by which a Chris . tian character ought to be presumed , in a baptized child , but wish him to assert that an actual change is secured in connection with the rite by regeneration . By this they mean , that the elements or seeds of this change are imparted in baptism by the Holy Soiri t , which if improved , will result in salvation . Dr. Bushnell attaches no such consequence to baptism . He esteems the thing *vhichBaptism signifies , i.e. , theChristian trainin** and its blessings . This he esteems to be so important , that it is worthy to be symbolized and cxpressed by a rite . But he does not tie noi- limit the blessing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , be secured . The one man believes in the spiritual power , and in the form because it represents the power . *fh other believes in the form because it is through the form that the power is imparted . Here is pre . ciselv the distinction between formal and spiritual Christianity . The assertion of this distinction , is enough in our view , to show on which side lies the truth . While Dr. Bushnell is complirnented that he approximates so nearly to the truth , " as it is in the church , " on the subject of Christian nurture , he is also advised that he has neglected to consi ( ler the child in his relations to the church . The simple reason for this is , that his subject did not render this appropriate . Were he to write a book on the relations of the church to the Christian child , it might be expected that he should treat of the subject . Should he do so , he would doubtless define the church , not as that body which is provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a congregation of faithful men in which the pure word of God is preached and the sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ 's ordinance , in all these things that of necessity are requisite to the same . " But we do not propose to argue with the Episcopalian on this point . That he should measui-e every principle and doctrine by the degree of its conformity with the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States , as constituted by the General Convention , is no more than we expect . We are not at all surprised at this . We choose to adopt another standard . An amiable yet able critic of the Discourses , appeared in the person of Dr. Nevin , a leading divine of the German Reformed Church . His criticism was generous and discnimmating , and is strikingly contrasted in respect to its ( lignifled and Christian spirit with certain riot ices which have emanated from New England , and we are ashamed to say , from our own denomination . The critic hails the work not only as valuable in itself , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' which he regards as the great fault of Puritanism , conceiving that Puritanism is regardless of those powerful social , religious laws and institutions in which is mom-c than half of our life . This estimate of the New Engla ad Theology and religionism , which is so freely expressed by Drs . Nevin and Schaf , we think is quite overstrained and exaggerated . We doubt not , if these gentlemen would corneto Ne*v England ofrener and acquaint themselves with us as we are-if they would hear our preachers , and see the workings of our religious system , they would see another set of Christians than those which they conceive of at a distance . They might find us something more than a set of skeletons-with clothing haniging on us as upon scarecrows ; all loose and frightful and grotesque . They might see instead of these , human beings with the feelings of men and // the warm hearts of Christians . Our preaching they might discover to consist of something more than metaphysical dogmas , alike unintelligible and repulsive . Our religious life might appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and duties of life , and not to be altogether too impracticable for weak human nature . In short , we wish that these gentlemen would visit the Yankees more , instead of looking at them through the medium of hereditary German prejudices , united with a little of the disdain , which may be pardoned in a German Gelehrte . Let them remember too , that the reports about New Ehgland Pheology are liable to a little deflection and reduplication , as they cross the state of New Jersey , and that we by no tneans trust our Princeton brethren as perfect conductors of intelligence in relation to what we believe . Perhaps they will discover too , that the character of no school of New England Theology is more rationalistic than that of their own . At all events , let them remember that Pantheistic and Rationalistic are interchangeble coin , and a brass guinea is likely to be returned in brass farthings . But if there is any thirtg good which they can teach us in criticism , in ecclesiastical history or in science , we will learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning any thing good from us . Of the Congre6ationalist criticisms on our author we hardly know what to say . Dr. Tyler 's letter , is on the whole good natured in its tone and manner , but we think neither fair nor generous in its strictures . It is open to two grand objections . First , it shows no just and hearty interest in the important truth which is advanced , and little hearty desire to give that truth a wide circulation ; and second , it places the most unfavorable construction on the passages , exl ) ressions and illustrations , which would admit of a construction that was good . These are two capital faults in our judgment . In respect to the personal questions which have unhappily arisen between Dr. Bushnell and the writer , we have nothing to say . We are still less satisfied by the criticisms on the work in another section of New England . The contemptuous manner in which the author is treated , the decided implication that he is not a *L safe " roan , the more pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published at the request of the Association of ministers before whom it was read , was not true , and all these followed by the strangest freedoms with the argument , the style , and the good n'aioe of a man whom the clergymen of Boston have some reason to treat with respect , are offenses too gross against all the laws of generous and gentlemanly warfare , not to deserve and to receive our distinct reprobation . We are obliged to withdra*v the compliment , expressed in a notice of this controversy in our last number . If this is the way in which the truth is to be defended in Massachusetts and orthodoxy is to be represented , we have only to express our regret . The perusal of some of the criticisms from quarters where the author had no reason to expect any thing but fair dealing , has enabled us to understand the peculiar circumstances of provocation under which he PrePared his " Argument . " From another quarter , where Dr. Bushnell might with reason expect some honest suspicions of his orthodoxy , the book was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have read the criticisms tn the Christian Mirror , we have felt thankful that a New England man could he generous and fAir in appreciatint* what is good from a writer whom he supposed to differ from himself . The fact too that this critic , found not only so much that // might bear a favorable construction , but so very much that was true , important and strikingly expressed , has given us greater confidence in our own opinion , which otherwtse we ought to suspect , that some of Dr. B 's New England critic spreferred the worse to the more favorable judgment . After this checkered game of crossfiring on the part of the so-called orthodox in New England-after each interest had taken its position , and so many of them against the book and all for the cause of truth - it is quite amusing to see the Princeton Review come fbrward as an arbiter and final umpire . We may be mistaken , but we suppose it is very silently allowed by these lower judicatories , that this Princeton Review is a kind of Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , the crier has opened the court , and we see the censors from Connecticut , from Boston and Portland , all eager to hear the ruling of this tribunal , accustorned to speak as " one having authority " And what do they hear ? Alas , wo to them who go down into Egypt for help ; "  --  the decision is more than half clear and full for Dr. Bushnell . This Princeton criticism however , is quite a curtosity in its way . It opens with a recognition of the leading idea of the discourses , as that of " organic as distinguished from individual life . " It does not exactly like the shape in which it is presented , but the truth in it is as familiar to Presbyterians as household words , " and " has power to give his discourses very much of an Old School ' cast and to render them in a high degree attractive and hopeful in our estimation . " This organic life which has been attacked with such vigor by the New England critics , at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , that the organic connection between the New England and the Presbyterian churches , is given as the first reason why the work demands a notice ! rphe critic then speaks of the truths which give value to the publication- " First , the fact that there is such a divinely constituted relation between the piety of parents and that of their children , as to lay a scriptural foundation for a confident expectation in the use of the appointed means , that the children of believers will become truly the children of God . " " A second truth predminently presented by our author is that parental nurture , or Christian training is the great means for the salvation of the children of the church . " Some eighteen pages are devoted to the discussion of these topics . He then proceeds , " There is a third feature of this little tract which gives it great interest and importance in our view . Dr. Bushnell can not sustain his view of the intimate connection between the religion of parents and that of their children , without advancing doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to his testimony and other sources of evidence , have been very much lost sight of especially in New England . " * " * " The pillars of this false and superficial system are overturned in Dr. Bushnell 's book . He has discovered that Goodness ( holy virtue ) or the production of goodness is the supreme end of God . ' - p. 34 . That virtue must he the product of separate and absolutely independent choice is pure ussumption. ' - p. 31 . He on the contrary asserts , that virtue is rather a state of being than an act or series of acts . ' - p. 31 . What mighty strides are here ! " Mighty strides , from what ? From that strange and persevering misconception of the New England Theology , which seems to be imputed and transmitted ' to the Princeton theolc ) Uians . On what is the conclusion C founded that such strides are made by Dr. Bushnell ? On parts ofsenten // ces , written for other purposes than as a formal exposition of philosophical opinions , and to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . Without attempting to defend or criticise Dr. Bushnell 's language , we disclaim and deny that the meaning conveyed by this writer , in his use of these quotations , is a true or just representation of the principles of any school of New En land Tb cotogy . After this out b*irst of enthusiasm , the critic proceeds to remark upon certain passages in which Dr. Bushnell speaks well of certain forms of statement in the XVestminster con fession , because they were founded 00 and sought to express the great truth for which he contends , naming particularly the doctrines of " federal headship and original or imputed sin . " By a very pleasant dexterity he takes occasion to reason , as though this were a proof positive , that the real truth in the case , was that which the confession teaches , and that this real truth had 1early been lost sight of in New England . All of which proves to us that of which we have had abundant reason to be convinced beforehand , that if the Princeton gentlemen possess all truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never yet been able to show their truth or wisdom by attaining to a just conception or description of the New Eiigland Tb eulogy . After thus almost giv in* Dr. B. the right hand of felloxvsliip , and taking him into the inner mysteries that are taught at Princeton , the critic proceeds with great deliberation to turn him out again , by discovering that his doctrine is in fact little better than naturalism , or rationalism . Letting Dr. Bushnell 's solemn and explicit asseverations to the contrary go for nothing , though he recognizes them distinctly ; he concludes the first portion of his argument with quotations from two German Rationahists , Base and Wegscheide r , we suppose to show the coincidence of language or sentiment . That they do show it we have failed to see . We certainly think that a quotation from the reviewer himself ought to be given to complete the square of coincidences in naturalistic doctrines . " There is , " says the Princeton reviewer , " a natural adaptation in all meu us of God 's appointment , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appropriate connection between sowing and reaping , between diligence and prosperity , truth and holiness , religious training ano the rehi ions life of children . " Here is naturalism , as clear as the sunlight . Ho*v then , it may be asked , can the Princeton reviewer be a supernaturalist ? Because , to use his own language , he refers " the connection between the religion of parents and that of their children , " " to the promise of God and his blessing on faithful parental trainino " And when Dr. Bushnell briefly describes his own theory " by natural laws inhabited by supernatural noencies " - what right has his critic to say that Dr. B. is a whit less of a supernaturalist than himself , or to say that his theory is nothing more than that which " resolves it into a law of nature , accounting for the connexion in question in the same way or on the same priii iples , which determine thie transmission of other forms of character from parent to children ? " But as the reviewer progresses in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger , just as he did in going from step to step in making him a Princetonian. lie speaks " of the ridicule which he heaps on the idea of any immediate interference of the Spirit of God , " in a way which in our view is unjust and ungenerous . He then thinks no honest account can be given for his pleasing the Unitarians , and finally brings this argument which has ascended up to the point // which made Dr. B. almost a Calvinist of ' the straitest sect , and then has descended till it has made him almost a Unitarian , to a very significant practical conclusion , viz. " that there is enough of a rationalistic cast about it to account for all the disapprobation it has excited , and to justify the course of the Massachusetts Committee . " This and a word of notice for Dr. Tyler , is all the comfort that it gives to its Ne*v England breibren . The ingenuity of the article certainly seems to be its most remarkable merit , and we think much credit is due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavored to argue in directions so opposite and to satisfy interests so d verse . The Massachusetts Sahbath School Society deserve a word . The only notice which his Committee have taken of Dr. Bushnell 's argument is , we are informed , to pass and transmit a resolution , relinquishing all claim to the copyright of " the Discourses . " This vote was communicated to Dr. B. with no comment or explanation , except that contained in a formal preamble . This strikes us as rather a cool proceeding , and perhaps it was designed to show that they received the Argument " coolly . " The relinqttishment of the copyright , by the way , was a little " supererogatory , " inasmuch as the title to it had never been wholly yielded by him , so that there is not even the slender justice or courtesy of which there is a show . Some argument and some indignation has been expressed by the defenders of the Coin mittee , that it should he asserted that they had designed to " suppress the book , " as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding or killing the dangerous thing , after they had got it into their power . We assure those who think it worth the while to ( lefend the Committee against this charge , that among the unfavorable judgments that have been passed upon their conduct , we never heard that they were suspected of beingca pable of a purpose so weak as this . But we ask , is it nothing to receive , examine with great deliberation , and finally to conclude to publish , a work from a man like the author , and then quietly to stop the sale and give no reason either to him or the public . If they had objected to the sentiments of the original manuscript , or had thought it a work unsuitable for their society and had said so , this would have been manly arid fair . If having decided to publish it at the end of a long deliberation ; they had then discovered , even at the suggestion of critics from another state , or by the objections of their patrons nearer home , that the sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embarrassing controversies or suspicions , and on any or all of these grounds had concluded to issue no more copies , and had given the grounds of this change of opinion to Dr. B. and the public , this would have been just to the author , the public and themselves , however little credit it might gain to their fitness to pass an independent jtidgment on an unpublished manuscript . But to stop the book and give no reason , is to treat the author and the public with too little consideration , and argues a liberty ofjudging and of disposing of a man 's good name , which is not usually entrusted to committees , and which ought to be exercised by none . Whose character is safe , whose opinions may not be marked , if a committee holding a position of so much influence , can thus dispose of character and pronounce u *00 opinions , without being held to answer to any tribunal ? And is this manifest wrong , both in principle and in the method of its exercise , to be slurred over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could think of inking ? Certainly not . We respect the Committee and the Society // of which they are the organ , but we must take the leave to say , that while we concede to them the entirest freedom in judging for themselves on the merits of the work , and also in reversing any judgments which they may have pronounced ; and while too we believe that they must be far better able to judge of the fitness of a work for Boston and Massachusetts than we can be ; still we can not concede to them the right to deal in this way with any man 's good name . In the name of all fair dealing and good manners and Christian courtesy , we pro*esL against it . As patriotic Ne*v Englanders , we have a natural pride in our metropolis . As provincial to Boston , we may be expected to defer to the judgments which issue from our lawful capital . But we can not so far defer to these decisions as to be content that they shall dispose of our reputation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall capitally condemn us , without trial and without an appeal . We profess also a strong interest in the faith and principles which we hold in common with our orthodox brethren at Boston . Feeling thus , our concern and interest is not a little sensitive that this faith may be defended by honorable methods , and that a concern for the truth , may never betray into a neglect of the plain maxims of common lustice . XVe confess our mortification that this zeal for the truth has been exposed to the Unitarian body , in actions so und*gnified ; - that a book so interesting and useful as this , has been laid aside , and not a reason has been rendered , nor a fault has been specified ; - so that when the uninitiated ask , If this book be heretical , what is orthodoxy , and what is it to be sound in the faith ? ' the only answer that they can receive , is , A man is orthodox when he is orthodox ! and sound in the faith when he is sound l ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested or confessed as a sufficient reason to condemn the book , that the Unitarians are pleased with it , and it can not therefore he either sound or honest . The Unitarians may all be very artful and dishonest men for aught we know . Our Boston brethren ought to know better than we . But it is hardly expedient to tell them so , nor is it either wise or politic to talk of them in this way as a class of men who can not be trusted . This talking of them as a class , in terms expressive of suspicion and horror , or the dividing them into subordinate divisions according to their relative claims to soundness in the faith or true piety , has always seemed to us a liberty utterly unwarrantable and offensive . Are they not men , and as such are they not to be supposed to have reasons for their opinions , and to hold them on some distinct grounds ? As men too may they not be reasoned with , and is there any way of approaching them with hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , the power of judging , and the capacity of feeling the force of an argument . If they have a wrong and deficient system , as we believe they have , it is a very 1 ) lnin ad simple business to tell them what we believe and why we believe it , and to show them why their system is deficient and wherein . if they are our friends and neit*hhors , it is a Christian duty which we owe to them , to meet them in the religious as we do in the social world , with some show of friendly concern , that we may have a common faith . We ought to believe them capable of changing their opinions . Besides , we hope the time may come when they will change . We do not expect that they will do this all at once , but that they may look at the Christian faith with less and less prejudice , and with a full and still fuller consent to all its princi // pies . If that time should have already come with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite ungracious to take the very sign of their conversion , as a ground of reproach agatnst the bo9k or the man who has been the means of it , and to repel every token of a common way of thinking , or every sign which indicates an approach to it , by repulsive and suspicious attitudes . These seem to us very plain and simple principles , and we regret that they have been sinned against in the present controversy . * * * * * In taking leave of this book , we say distinctly to our readers , that it has not been our object to criticise the whole volume , or to sift every expression , illustration or opinion even , advanced by its author . There are expressions which we think mtght have been altered for the better , illustrations which might have been improved , and opinions which are hastily ventured and not well defended . The doctrine of the book as we understand it , we think to be true and important . The leading arguments we have noticed , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception of the work has seemed worthy of comment.
