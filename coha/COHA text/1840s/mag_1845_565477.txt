txt THIS is a remarkable document . Its author , the democratic governor of the most democratic state in this democratic country  --  the favorite of that party which goes for the largest liberty , in a commonwealth where that party meets with scarce a show of opposition , in a republic whose most honored instrument declares that all men have an inalienable right to liberty , boldly announces to the world his position thus , " come what may , we are resolved that oua SYSTEM OF DOMESTIC SLAVEHY SHALL STAND , "  --  a system which utterly deprives of liberty about half the people of the commonwealth-yea , he affirms that slavery is essential to the perfection of the social state , is " the foundation and corner-stone of every well designed and durable republican edifice , " and is enjoined on men by the express command of Jehovah : and this in an age when the church of Rome , that nursing mother of human despotisms , has been constrained , through her acknowledged head , to condemn slavery , and the Bey of Tunis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of its guilt . The reasons of these extraordinary positions are obvious . Slavery is fast becoming the scorn and contempt of the civilized world . It is almost universally condemned as an outrage on the rights of man and the precepts of God . The church condemns it . The philanthropist condemns it . The man of the world , when uninterested in its favor , condemns it . The literature of the world with its thousand voices and omnipresent influence condemns it . These all especially condemn its existence under a government whose whole foundation rests on the * Gov . Hammond 's Letters on Southern Slavery , addressed to Thomas Clarkson , the English Abolitionist. inalienable right of man to freedom . Slavery thus surrounded by the condemnation of the whole world , is like " the scorpion girt by fire . " The burning disapprobation of the world it is hard to endure . Slaveholders are uncommonly sensitive to the opinions of men , and writhe before the pointing finger of scorn . A large part of them-that part as a general rule who are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor which makes them shrink from the name , even when they shrink not from the reality of oppression and cruelty . They therefore make a desperate effort , like this of Gov . Hammond , to reverse the world 's dread sentence respecting slaveholding ; and stoutly affirm that slavery is a beneficent institution , sanctioned and recommended by its happy effects on both masters and slaves and by the laws and commands of the benevolent God . There is another strong reason which compels these men to this extraordinary course , viz , the movements of conscience in the *laveholding communities themselves . Good men in the slaveholding communities-and they are not few , as we hope and believe  --  and indeed all men there , whose humanity and natural sense of justice are not wholly quenched by selfish interest or passion , with the enormities and atrocities of the slave system transpiring all around them , and light from free institutions and free discussion blazing on the hideous character of the system , can not but see and feel that it is a very bad system  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous wrong to servants . Under this impression , they hope and pray , and , by some preparatory steps and some feeble and indirect methods , labor , to a // 568 Southern Slavery . limited extent , for its removal . To meet this difficulty , to quell this dangerous foe within , to correct , and strengthen , and lull to rest the misguided , and weak , and aroused consciences of these men , the McDuffies and Calbouns and Hammonds , having utterly seared their own consciences respecting this subject by a determination to uphold slavery at all hazards , take the high and bold ground , that slavery is a most righteous and benevolent institutionan institution , not only permitted , but expressly sanctioned and commanded by God-an institution , not only not inconsistent with our national proclamation of the rights of man , and with the spirit of our free government , but absolutely essential to the preservation of republican liberty-an institution , which , so far from being unjust and cruel , promotes , far more than a system of free labor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution , therefore , not only to be tolerated , but to be cherished and perpetuated by every friend of his country and every servant of God . Thus by urgent motives both from without and within , these determined upholders of slavery are urged on to this bold and extraordinary position . We have not a particle of faith in their sincerity . We have no idea that they really believe slavery to be consistent with human rights or beneficial to human interests . We do not believe that they expect it to be perpetual . They know that it must perish before the progress of truth and piety . But we believe that they expcct by it to gratify their avarice and love of power , and are determined at all hazards to uphold it as long as possible . Therefore , they take this high moral ground , as that on which they can make the longest defense , before the world , and before those among slaveholders who have humanity and conscience . *ATe both mourn and exult to see them take this ground . We mourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickedness . We exult at the folly and madness by which the enemies of human freedom defeat their own design . For , we believe that they have made an effort whose recoil will be immensely greater than its onward movement . They have made a wretched mistake as to the best mode of counteracting the opinion of the world . The very best thing they can do for this end , is to hold still and say nothing . We believe too , that , from lack of experimental acquaintance with a good man s conscience , they have greatly underrated the strength of good men s consciences in the slave states , and could have done nothing better fitted to arouse and arm that strength against slavery and its defenders . These letters of Gov . Hammond embrace a great variety of topics . lie first speaks of the slave trade , which he condemns , evidently not because he deems it intrinsically evil , but because of the manner in which it has been and is conducted . He speaks of the act of Parliament which prohibited that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteems the glory of his life . He shows his courtesy and sympathy with philanthropy , by sneering at this venerable and world-honored and divinely honored philanthropist , for what he is pleased to consider the failure of the opposition to the slave trade . " I hope , " says he , " you have not lived too long for your own happiness , though you have been spared to see that in spite of all your toil and those of your fellow laborers , and the accomplishment of all that human agency could do , the African slave trade has increased threefold under your own eyes-more rapidly perhaps than any other ancient branch of commerce  --  and that your efforts to suppress it have effected // nothing more than a threefold increase of its horrors . There is a God who rules the **28;32;TOOLONG . He does not permit his creatures to foil his designs . " He takes no account of the truth , that the demand for slaves and the means of procuring them , have increased twenty fold perhaps , since the passage of that act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of increasing threefold , which he asserts and we doubt , would probably have increased twenty fold . Nor does he take any account of the immense moral influence of that act of Parliament , which branded this trade before the world as wicked , inhuman , and by logical consequence , condemned slavery itself . Gov . H. next speaks of prescriptive right ; and argues , that , as the Englishman 's title to his land is good , though ultimately founded on the unjust and rapacious acts of a Norman or Saxon conqueror , so the slaveholder 's title to his slaves is good , though they descend from those who were kidnapped in Africa . He does not seem to perceive that his illustration is made correct ( or parallel ) only by supposing the Englishman 's title to be good , even though ( were that possible ) the originally defrauded Briton was constantly present to claim his ravished land . For , each human being has an inalienable right to liberty , whatever his descent . Each babe of a slave coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " born into slavery , " as it is called , is stolen as truly as the kidnapped African ; and slavery in each individual case exists only by a continual theft . Gov . H. has no liking for human cooperation with God , in removing or ameliorating the condition of the human race , and says , that it " would be well for us to leave the Almighty to perfect his own works and fulfill his own covenants . " This may be slaveholding theology . But in the free states we have a way of thinking , that the law , " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , " is to be fulfilled by active as well as passive obedience . We wonder if Gov . H. would have his rule of non-interference with Divine Providence applied , not only to slavery , but also to the tariff which he says plunders the slave states for the benefit of the free states . Gov . H. in the next place affirming that the great question respecting American slavery is , whether it is a sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is not only not a sin but a duty ! ! These are his words . " American slavery is not only not a sin , but especially commanded by God through Moses , ( American slavery commanded by God through Moses I ! ) and approved by Christ through his apostles . " His Excellency does not inform us how a divine permission or even command to the Israelites to enslave the divinely doomed Canaanites , authorizes and commands the Americans to enslave the Africans . We infer , as Gov . H. seems to have a logical mind , that he carries out his logic consistently , and holds , that the command given to the Israelites to exterminate the Canaanites and possess their lands , makes it an imperative duty for the Georgians to exterminate or drive out the Indians and possess their lands ; and for the Texans to deal in the same manner with the Mexicans ; and indeed for any man who happens to desire another 's lands and has the power , to exterminate or drive off that other man and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also that his Excellency adopts other conclusions which follow logically from his " scriptural doctrine , " viz , that might makes right ; that it is the right and duty of his slaves , if they think they have the power , to enslave his Excellency , and of the // southern slaves generally , when they think themselves strong enough , to rise and enslave or exterminate their masters , and possess their property ; and that it is the duty of the stronger always to enslave the weaker ; and of the intellectual and wealthy classes to enslave , if by their superior skill they can , the laboring classes . We hope that he will address his democratic brethren at the North on that subject . Gov . H. next c.onsiders slavery in its political influences ; which promote , as he thinks , the order , safety and power of the state ! " I endorse , " says he , " without re ; serve , the much abused sentiment of Gov . McDuffie , that slavery is the corner-stone of our republican edifice ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no where accredited dogma of Mr. Jeriferson , that all men are born equal ' " ! His Excellency 's mode of proving slavery to be essential to the prosperity and perpetuity of republican liberty is very amusing and very democratic . We will quote it entire , as it is brief . " No society has ever yet existed , and I have already incidentally quoted the highest authority to show that none ever will exist , without a natural variety of classes . The most marked of these must , in a country like ours , he the rich and the poor , the educated aud the ignorant. , It will scarcely be disputed that the very poor have less leisure to prepare themselves for the proper discharge of public duties than the rich ; and that the ignorant are wholly unfit for them at all . In all countries save ours , these two classes , or the poor rather , who are presumed to he necessarily ignorant , are by law expressly excluded from all participation in the management of public affairs . In a republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not essential in theory , seems to he in fact , a necessary appendage to a republican system . Where universal suffrage obtains , it is obvious that the government is in the hands of a numerical majority ; and it is hardly necessary to say , that in every part of the world more than half the people arc ignorant and poor . Though no one can look upon poverty as a crime , and we do not generally here regard it as any objection to a man in his individual capaci ty , still it must be admitted that it is a wretched and insecure government which is administered by its most ignorant citizens , and those who have the least at stake under it . Though intelligence and wealth have great influence here as every where , in keeping in check reckless and unenlightened numbers , yet it is evident to close observers , if not to all , that these are rapidly usurping all power in the non-slaveholding states , and threaten a fearful crisis in republican institutions there at no remote period . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole population , and those the poorest and most ignorant , have no political influence whatever , hecause they are slaves . Of the other half , a large proportion are both educated and independent in their circumstances , while those who unfortunately arc not so , being still elevated far above the mass , are higher toned and more deeply interested in preserving a stable and well-ordererl government , than the same class in any other country . Hence , slavery is truly the corner-stone ' and foundation of every well-designed and durable republican edifice. ' " - pp. 5,6 . That is to say  --  the poor and ignorant , who are the numerical majority in every community , are unfit to manage or to participate in the management of public affairs . These affairs can not be entrusted to them without certainty of ruin . These affairs are and must be entrusted to them by universal suffrage in the free states ; therefore reupblican liberty must soon perish in the free states . But in the slave states the poor and ignorant are happily prevented from putting their dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests of republican ( ! ) ( pro bono publico ) government are exclusively in the hands of the " higher classes , " the educated and rich  --  and of those who , if " unfortunately they are not " rich , are rendered high-minded and noble-spirited by being elevated above their rich neighbors ' slaves ! " Hence slavery is truly the corner-stone and foundation of every well-designed and durable republican edifice " ! Beautiful , beautiful democracy this ! Excellent republicanism ! No aristocracy here ! No want of confidence in the mass of the people ! If his // 1845 . Gov . Hammond 's Letters to Thomas Clarkson . Excellency had not said , " Nor have 1 , to tell the truth , much confidence in the details of what are called statistics , " we would stop here to ask him , what the census says about the educationof the whites at the South ; *. bout the number of those in Virginia and South Carolina , and in the slave states generally , who can not read E.rnd write. * But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe in statistics . And he bad better not . It would greatly endanger his conclusions . And then , the inquiry is of no importance : for , what if white citizens can not read and write ? " Being still elevated far above the mass , " ( i. e. the slaves , ) they are higher toned " than the same class ii* any other country . " Reasoning on these principles , and on the lawlessness which is general and fast increasing at the North , ( ! ) Gov . LII. tells us ,  --  " It will not be long before the free states ' of this Union will be compelled to introduce the same expensive machinery to preserve order among their free and equal ' citizens . Already has Philadelphia organized a permanent battalion for this purpose : New York , Boston and Cincinnati will soon follow her ezample ; and then the smaller towns and densely populated counties .

This is a fair representation of the difference in this respect between the two sections of country . It should also be remembered , that most of those who can not read and write in the free states , are foreigners . The great mass of the native colored population are capable of doing both , having had access to the public schools equally with the whites . cenaries , is the ultimate destiny of the non-slaveholding sectioii of this confederacy , and one which may not be very distant . " - p. 6 . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our cities and occasional patrolls in the country ensure us a repose and security known nowhere else. ( ! ! ) * Gov . H. informs us that " it is a great mistake to suppose , as is generally done abroad , that in case of war , slavery would be a source of weakness . " ( ! ) The reasons which he gives for this very reasonable opinion are these-that the slaves would fight in behalf of their masters , and if any nation should be so inhuman as to " invade the country with black troops for the base and barbarous purpose of stirring up servile war , " they ( i. e. the slaves ) would assist in reducing these black troops to slavery , and thus increase the wealth of their masters ! Gov . H. then considers slavery in its social effects . Dueling , which he paraphrases by the words , " to acknowledge a standard of honor , * , and which by the way he appears to think does not " tarnish the character of a community , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As to mobs , " The only thing , " says his Excellency , " that can create a mob here , is the appearance of an abolitionist , whom the people assemble to chastise . ( ! ) And this is no more of a mob than a rally of shepherds to chase a wolf out of their pastures would he one . " ( Shepherds and their flocks ! ) And as to repudiation , about which so much noise has been made , * A friend at our elbow , who resided formerly in North Carolina , informs us that he was called out in his turn to patroll every third night-occasional patrolls ! And who does not know that the citizens of the slave states all go armed , that they sleep on their arms , that the whole country is virtually garrisoned every hour ? We leave it for Gov . H. to say , whether this universal bearing of arms is for the purpose of protection against the blacks or against the whites . // no people pay their debts as well as slaveholders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white half of the people ) - his Excellency says he has no confidence in statistics , but thinks the question is settled by the facts , " that our presidential chair has been occupied for forty four out of fifty six years by slaveholders ; that another has been recently elected to fill it for four more , over an opponent who was a slaveholder also ; and that in the federal offices and both houses of Congress , considerably more than a due proportion of those acknowledged to stand in the front rank are from the South . " We can give a very different reason for these facts . " The piety of the South , " the the Governor tells us , " is unobtrusive , " but very safe and not at all inclining to extravagance . " So far as numbers are concerned , " says he , " I believe our clergymen , when called on to make a showing , have never had occasion to blush , if comparisons were drawn between the free and slave states . " ( We thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of licentiousness , though his Excellency 's modesty shrinks very much from discussing it with the abolition " clergymen and virgins , " he tries to deny , but , in spite of himself , about half admits its truth respecting white men and black women : but he thinks there is ample compensation in the superior chastity of their white women ! This fact ( the licentiousness of the white men and the black women ) we have heard slaveholders confess . This doctrine of " compensation " we have known them unblushingly avow ; yea , we have seen this fact and this doctrine confessed and avowed in a published letter from a slaveholder to the New York Tribune . That is to say , the chastity of one daughter of Adam is cheaply purchased by the prostitution of another daughter , and by the debauchery of a son of the same nal progenitor ! ! origi Gov . II . then proceeds to consider the economy of slavery , or the comparative expense of free and slave labor ; the treatment and instruction of the slaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers ; the condition of English laborers ; * schemes of abolition ; West India emancipation , and many other topics . We can not for want of space , follow his Excellency " Our limits do not permit us to enter on the subject ofthe comparative condition of English laborers and American slaves . We are very willing that Gov . H. , or any one else , should speak with severity to British statesmen oftbe wretched state oftheir laboring population . It is a subject on which we think much and feel deeply . But statements on this subject addressed to Thomas Clarkson and his anti-slavery associates as an " argumentum ad hominem " are wasted powder . For the philanthropy of these noble men has regarded that subject . They have endeavored not only to abolish West India slavery but East India oppression and slavery , and also to relieve and remove the sufferings , so complicated and difficult of remedy , which result from the aristocratic government and social life of Great Britian . There is one class of facts that can be alluded to in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and American slaves in its true light . The English laborers can learn to read . American slaves are forbidden this privilege by law . No benevolent man is molested in teaching English operatives to read . The benevolent man who teaches . american staves to read , is a criminal in the eye of the law , and receives also , in the " chivalrous and peacefal South , " the tender mercies of Lynch law . Any man in England can publish a newspaper , to instruct the laboring classes in religion , or morals , in their civil rights or as to their civil wrongs , or on Owenism , or Fourierism , or any subject whatever . But who can publish a newspaper to the Southern slaves with impunity ? Yea , who can publish a paper for the citizens of a slave state , advocating even a gradual emancipation of slavery , with impunity ? Let any one attempt it , and though he be like Cassius M. Clay , a nobleman by nature and education , a native of , and having all his interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaveholder himself , and his press is broken up at any hazard of property or life , by a mob of gentlemen ( ? ) ! It is useless for Gov . H. to declaim in view of such facts as these , respecting English laborers and American slaves . The Southcrn slaveholders dare not let the // through all these subjects . Nor is it necessary . On many interesting points we have stated his positions ; and our readers will see that their statement is their refutation . From these specimens they can judge of the remainder . There is one topic , however , to which we have just alluded , which we will for a few moments examine , viz , the influence of slavery on the slaves , and Gov . H. 's representations of their kind treatment and happy condition . We do this because the superficial observation of northern persons , traveling or residing for a time in the South , and the confident assertions of such slaveholders as Gov . H. , have thrown a veil over the atrocities and cruelties , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , Gov . H. confesses that on this point slaveholders are responsible to the world . We will hold him to that responsibility . " I have admitted , " says Gov . H. " without hesitation , what it would be untrue and profitless to deny , that slaveholders are responsible to the world for the humane treatment of the fellow beings whom God placed in their hands-p. 16 . " I deny that the power of the slaveholder in America is irresponsible . ' He is responsible to God . He is responsible to the world  --  a responsibility which abolitionists do not intend to allow him to evade  --  and in acknowledgment of which I write you this letter . lie is responsible to the community in which be lives , and to the laws under which he enjoys his civil rights . Those laws do not permit him to kill , to maim , or to punish beyond certain limits , or to overtask , or to refuse slaves hare light . This shows the wretchedness , nay the absolute desperation in which slaveholders know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , proves that they believe themselves on a magazine which a spark may explode . The tyranny of their measures , both for the exclusion of light and for the quelling of resistance to the master 's authority , or of the first symptoms of insurrection , proves the extremity of the oppression by which they crush their slaves into a condition of known desperation . to feed and clothe his slave . In short , they forbid him to be tyrannical or cruel . " - p.11 . " Still though a slaveholder , I freely acknowledge my obligations as a man ; and that I am bound to treat humanely the fellow creatures whom God has trusted to my charge . 1 feel , therefore , somewhat sensitive under the accusation of cruelty , and disposed to defend myself and fellow slaveholders against it . it is certainly the interest of all , and I am convinced that it is also the desire of every one of us , to treat our slaves with proper kindness . It is necessary to our deriving the greatest amount of profit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " I have no hesitation in saying that our slaveholders are as kind masters , as men usually are kind husbands , parents , and friends-as a general rule , kinder . A bad master - he who overworks his slaves , provides illy ( ill ) for them , or treats them with undue severity-loses the esteem and respect of his fellow citizens to as great an extent as he would for the violation of any of his social and most of his moral obligations . " - p. 12 . " And to sum up all , if pleasure is correctly defined to be the absence of painwhich so far as the great body of mankind is concerned , is undoubtedly its true definition-I believe our slaves are the happiest three millions of human beings on whom the sun shines . " - p. 15 . These are extraordinary declarations . Fortunately we are not dependent on the testimony of such men as Gov . H. and George McDufLie for evidence of the truth on the subjects which these declarations respect . Nor are we dependent on the testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can he proved by the most irresistible evidence , direct and indirect , from slaveholders themselves , that slavery is a system of most atrocious cruelty to the slaves , against which the laws furnish really ( whatever they may do ostensibly ) no protection . Let us attend first to Gov . JI. ' s assertion that the slaveholder is responsible to the laws for his treatment of his slaves . The law gives to the master absolute power over the slave . The following proofs are sufficient on this point . " The slave is entirely subject to the will of his master . " ( Louisiana Civil Code , Art . 273. ) // " Slaves shall be deemed sold , taken , reputed , and adjudged in law to be chattels personal , in the hands of their owners , and possessors , and their executors , administrators , and assigns , to all intents , constructions , and purposes whatsoever . " - ( South Carolina Law . ) " The slave must feel that there isno appeal from his master . " ( Decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Law of Slavery , p. 247 . ) But , says Gov . Hammond , " the laws do not permit him ( the slaveholder ) to kill , to maim , or to punish beyond certain limits ( ? ) . . . his slave . " True , there are laws which forbid these crimes . But they are rendered wholly ineffectual by other laws , which make it impossible in ninety nine cases out of a hundred to convict a white man of those crimes-laws , which exclude a slave 's testimony in any case where a white man is concerned , and allow the masters to clear themselves by their own oaths . In all the slave states , except two or three , there are laws which forbid the reception of the testimony of a slave or a free negro where a white is concerned ; and where there is no law on the subject , custom and the force of public opinion invariably reject it . ( See Judge Stroud 's Sketch of the Laws of Slavery . ) The law of South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , limb , or member , when no white person shall be present , or being present , shall refuse to give evidence , the owner or other person who shall have the care of such slave , and in whose power such slave shall be , shall be deemed guilty of such offense , unless such owner or other person shall make the contrary appear by good and sufficient evidence , or shall by his own oath clear and exculpate himself . Which oath every court where such offenses shall be tried , is hereby empowered to administer , and to acquit the offender , if clear proof be not made by two witnesses ( whites ) at least. *- ( 2 Brevards Digest , 242 . ) Now couple these two facts , viz. that slaves can not testify , and that the master or white overseer , in the absence of the testimony of two whites , can clear himself by his own oath , with the fact that whites are rarely present on plantations to witness the maiming or murdering of a slave , and if present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maim or murder ; and who will pronounce this " legal responsibility , " even for maiming and murder , any thing but the merest shadow ! A man who would maim or kill a slave , would not scruple to take a false oath ; and by that false oath he could clear himself , though an hundred slaves had seen his cruel or murderous act . Indeed the Supreme Court of Louisiana , in a case where the defendant was , not indicted for murder , ( as he would have been in a free state , ) but sued for the value of a slave whom he had shot and killed , expressly say , " The act charged here is one rarely commilted in the presence of witnesses , " ( whites . ) - ( Law of Slavery , 249 . ) And Judge Ruffin of the Supreme Court of North Carolina , says in one of his judicial decisions , ( see Wheeler 's Law of Slavery , page 247 , ) - " The slave , to remain a slave , must feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can anticipste the provocations which the slave would give , nor the consequent wrath of the master prompting him to bloody vengeance on the turbulent traitor  --  a vengeance generally practiced with impunity , by reason of its privacy . ' How much the laws design to protect the slave may be seen by the following decision on this point , made by the Supreme Court of South Carolina in the case of the State vs . Cheetwood. ( 2 Hill 's Reports , 459 . ) " The criminal offense of assault and battery , can not , at common law , be committed on the person of a slave . For , notwithstanding for some purposes a slave is regarded in law as a person , yet generally he is a mere chattel personal , and his right of personal protection belongs to // his master , who can maintain an action of trespass for the battery of his slave . " Let us look at some of the tender mercies of these laws , to which Gov . LI . says the master is responsible . The law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike any white person , such slave shall , upon trial and conviction before the justice or justices , suffer such punishment for the first offense as they shall think fit , not extending to life or limb ; and for the sccond offense , DEATH . " Look at this . If a slave , when cruelly beaten by his master , resists by blows , or offers to resist , ( as the North Carolina bench interpret the law ,  --  See Stroud 's Sketch ; ) or if a slave should be attacked when on his master 's errands , by some drunken or cruel white man , and defend himself by blows or by offering blows ; or if a female slave should resist or offer to resist by force , an attack on her chastity , the slave in each of these cases may be lawfully killed ! A law of North Carolina says " Any person may lawfully kill a slave who has been outlawed for running away and lurking in swamps . " ( Jud , , e Stroud 's Sketch of the Slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " A slave endeavorzng to entice another slave to run away , if provisions , &amp;c. he prepared for the purpose of aiding in such running away , shall he punished with death . And a slave who shall aid the slave so endeavoring to entice another slave to run away , shall also suffer death . " ( Law of South Carolina . Stroud 's Sketch of Slave Laws , 103-4. 2 Brevard 's Digest , 233 , 244 . ) Another law of South Carolina provides , " that if a slave shall , while absent from the plantation , refuse to be examined by any white person , such white person may seize and chastise him ; and if the slave strike such white person , such slave may be lawfully killed . " ( 2 i3revard 's Digest , 231 . ) In Devereaux 's North Carolina Reports , 263 , we have the case of the State vs . Mann ; in which the Supreme Court decided that a master who shot a female slave and wounded her , because she got loose from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , had violated no law , and could not be indicted . The atrocity of these laws is aggravated by the fact , that slaves are not permitted by law to read , and in few cases can obtain any knowledge of the laws , which for these trivial offenses authorize their death . The following penalties are attached by law to the following acts of slaves . If more than seven slaves are found together in any road without a white person , twenty lashes apiece ; for visiting a plantation without a written pass , ten lashes ; for letting loose a boat from where it has been made fast , thirty nine lashes for the first offense , and for the second shall have cut off from his head one ear ; for keeping or carrying a club , thirty nine lashes ; for having any article for sale without a ticket from his master , ten lashes ; for traveling in any other than the most usual and accustomed road , when going alone to any place , foriy lashes ; for traveling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in another person 's negro quarters , forty lashes ; for hunting with dogs in the woods , thirty lashes ; for being on horseback without the written permission of his master , twenty five lashes ; for riding or going abroad in the night , or riding horses in the day time without leave , a slave may be whipped , cropped , or branded in the cheek with the letter R , or otherwise punished , not extending to life , or so as to render him unfit for labor. * The comparative regard which the laws pay to the property of the master and the person of the slave is seen in two laws of Louisiana , passed in 1819 .

A slave of the plaintiff had been deprived of his only eye , and thus rendered useless , on which account the court adjudged that the defendant should pay the plaintiff his full value . The case went up , by appeal , to the Supreme Court . Judge Matthews , in his decision , said that " when the defendant had paid the sum decreed , the slave ought to be placed in his possession ; " adding , that " the judgment making full compensation to the owner operates a change of property . " He adds , " the principle of humanity which would lead us to suppose that the mistress whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave with more kindness than the defendant to whom the judgment ought to transfer him , can not be taken into consideration ! ! " Why should it ? On the theory of slavery the slave is mere property " for all purposes whatsoever . " His personal welfare the law does not consider . An act of the legislature of North Carolina , after declaring that he who is " guilty of wilfully and maliciously killing a slave shall suffer the same punishment as if he had killed a freeman , " concludes thus : " Provided always , this act shall not extend to the person killing a slave outlawed* by virtue of any act of assembly of this state ; or to any slave in the act of resistance to his lawful overseer or master , or to any slave dying under their moderate correction / I " Here we have a commentary on the meaning of " moderate correction I " " Dying under moderate correction I " In Mississippi slaves are by law punished capitally for thirty crimes , for which whites are punished by fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hammond , when such laws and decisions as these are spread before the world on the legal books of slaveholding states , to publish to the world that the laws protect the slaves from abuse ! We think our readers will agree with us that the protection which the laws give , is " such protection as vultures give to lambs . " We proceed to another of the topics which our quotations from Gov . H. presents . He says that it is the desire and interest of all slaveholders to treat their slaves with proper kindness , and as a general rule they do treat them more kindly than husbands do their wives , or parents their children . That it is for the pecuniary interest of masters to treat their slaves kindly , is probably true ; though many doubt it , and think that the most lucrative plan is to wear out a stock of slaves every few years by excessive labor . But if humane treatment is most economical , as a general rule , there are important exceptions to the rule , which prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be relied on to secure the humane treatment of slaves , even were it true ( as it is not ) that pecuniary interest always controls passion and other forms of selfishness . When a man hires a slave for a given period , it is for his interest to get as much work out of him with as little expense of keeping as possible . Then there are many , whom his pecuniary interest would tempt him to keep on the shortest allowance and even to get rid of by cruelty or neglect , such as those who are disabled by * He may be outlawed for the slightest theft to appease his hunger . // age , those whose constitutions are broken down or worn out , those who are maimed or have incurable chronic diseases , those who are blind , or deaf and dumb , or deformed , or insane , or idiotic , and infants who are sickly . Then there are the disobedient , and incorrigible , and runaways . These the " interest " of the master requires him to treat with great severity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " every one of us " ) to treat the slaves kindly ! They are treated more kindly as a general rule than wives and children , and " are the happiest three millions on whom the sun shines ! " Does Gov. 1 . really expect any man to believe these statements ? We might pronounce them untrue on general principles , without any examination of facts . They who have irresponsible power over human beings to whom they are not united by the ties of kindred , will , more or less , abuse that power . They will , unless they are far better than any generation of men that has yet existed . To such power , so far as it is held by parents over children , God has given a salutary , and in most cases , a sufficient check in parental affection . But does not Gov . H. see how the facts stated and implied throughout his letters , and all the features and history of slavery stare this assertion of his in the face ? He admits , that chains and irons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " sometimes in capturing , he ( the slave ) is unfortunately killed . " The southern laws are full of provisions to punish for and prevent running away . Runaways are outlaws , and any white man may shoot them down like dogs . A slave enticing , or helping to entice , another to run away , is punished with death . The southern newspapers are filled with offers of rewards for the apprehension of fugitive slaves ; and thousands and tens of thousands do es cape every year . Now , how do these facts and Gov . H. 's statements of the kind treatment and happiness of slaves harmonize ? Why should those happy beings run away from this blessed state ? Why is it necessary to attach such penalties to escaping or enticing to escape from preeminent happiness ? Would the legislature of Massachusetts he thought any thing hut a body of lunatics , should they pass a law , forbidding the citizens of that commonwealth to fly from freedom into southern slavery , declaring any one who should thus fly an outlaw , licensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death for the offense of enticing a free man to escape into slavery ? What if a provision had been inserted in the Constitution of the United States , requiring the surrender of citizens who should voluntarily escape from the free states into the slavery of the southern states ? The great search of man is after happiness ; and , so far as it consists in temporal good , he is keen in his discernment and just in his judgment respecting it . Why , then , are laws and chains and stripes and bloodhounds and outlawry and threatened death necessary to keep men in slavery , if it be such a blessed condition ? Why do not all freemen rush into it ? Why does not Gov . H. himself evince the sincerity of his opinion by becoming himself a slave ? Since Gov . H. has so confidently and widely put forth these statements ; and since there are many who , relying on superficial observation , and their knowledge of kind treatment in some cases , are inclined to believe his statements with considerable abatement ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall advance but a fraction of the evidence at our disposal ; and that shall be from slaveholders and southern citizens , and of a kind that can not be gainsayed . And here , lest we should be misunderstood , // we will distinctly say , that there are , in our opinion , many masters who treat their slaves with great kindness , and make their condition , physical , intellectual , and moral , as good as their subject state and the cruel laws will allow . But it ought also to be said , that these kind masters can not see to every thing , and are often absent for months , and are obliged to trust much of the care and government of their slaves to overseers , of whose wisdQm and kindness they can not be sure . Moreover , this comparatively good condition of their slaves is very uncertain . The life of that good master is insecure . He may die at any moment , and his slaves may then pass into the hands perhaps of a debauched and cruel son . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his slaves may then be sold to those wretches , the slave traders , or to masters who will be hard-hearted and tyrannical . We see not how a good man can , with a quiet conscience , allow those whom he loves , to remain in a situation , over which impend such dreadful contingencies . But to the point before us . Gov . H. says that masters are , as a general rule , kinder than husbands and parents . What says Thomas Jefferson in his " Notes on Virginia " ? " The whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions , the most unremitting despotism o the one part , and degrading submission on the other . . . . The parent storms , the child looks on , catches the lineaments of wrath , puts on the same airs in the circle of smaller slaves , gives loose to the worst of passions ; and thus nursed , educated and daily exercised in tyranny , can not but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities . " Hon. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said ,  --  " When in the sublime lessons of Christianity he ( the slaveholder ) is taught to do unto others as he would have others do unto him , ' he never dreams that the degraded negro is wi ly can9n. " thin the pale of that ho The following is the testimony of Rev. William Allan , son of iRev . Dr. Allan , a slaveholder of Huntsville , Ala . " Lest any one should think that in general the slaves are well treated , let me be distinctly understood , that cruelty is the rule and kindness the exception . " The fol1owin* is the testimony of B. Swain , Esq. , ( formerly Governor of North Carolina , and now President of the University of that stale , ) in an address , published in 1830 , before tlte abolition agitation which Gov . H. says is the cause of all the seventies practiced by slaveholders . " Let any man , " says he , " of spirit and feeling , for a moment cast his thoughts over this land of slavery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others , the flowing tears , and heaving sighs of parting relations , the wailings and woe , the bloody cut of the keen lash , and the frightful scream that rends the very skies ; and all this to gratify ambition , lust , pride , avarice , vanity , and other depraved feelings of the human heart . The worst is not generally hnown . Were all the miseries , the horrors of slavery , to burst at once into view , a peal of sevenfold thunder could scarce strike greater alarm . " The following extracts are from an address of the Presbyterian Synod of Kentucky , ( a body representing all the Presbyterians of that state , ) to the churches under their care , to be read , by their request , on the Sabbath , to every Presbyterian congregation in the state . " This system licenses and produces great cruelty . The law places the whip in the hands of the master , and its use , provided he avoid destroying life , is limited only by his own pleasure . " - p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provided life be spared . Mangling , imprisonment , starvation , every species of torture , may be inflicted upon him , and he has no redress . But , not content with thus laying the budy of the slave defenseless at the foot of the master , our system proceeds still further , and strips him in a great measure of all protection against the inhumanity of any other white man who may choose to maltreat him . " - p. 6 . " There are now , in our whole land , two millions of human beings , exposed , defenseless , to every insult and every injury // short of maiming or death , which their fellow-men may choose to inflict . They suffer all that can be inflicted by wanton caprice , by grasping avarice , by brutal lust , by malignant spite , and by insane anger . Their happiness is the sport of every whim , and the prey of every pussion , that may , occasionally or habitually , infest the master 's bosom . If we could calculate the amount ofwoe endured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would move even the obdurate to sympathy . " - pp. 12 , 13 . But the most impressive and perhaps most decisive testimony to the cruelty of slavery is the advertisements of futigive slaves contained in the newspapers of the slave states , over the signatures of the master , or of the sheriff or jailer . We will give a few specimens as an illustration . " Lodged in jail a mulatto boy , having large marks of the whip on his shoulders and other parts of his body . " ( New Orleans Bee , Aug. 14 , 1838 . Signed , Maurice G. Garcia , Sheriff of Jefferson Co. , La . ) " Comtnitted , a mulatto fellowhis back shows lasting impressions of the whip , and leaves no doubt of his being a SLAVE . " ( Fayetteville ( N. C. ) Observer , June 20 , 1838 . Signed , John A. Rowland , Lumberton , N. C. ) - " Ran away , Bill-has several large scars on his back from a severe whipping in early life . " ( Baltimore Republican , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rockyule , Montgomery Co. , Md . ) " One hundred dollars reward , for my negro Glasgow and his wife Kate . Glasgow is 24 years old , has marks of the whip on his back . Kate is 26-has a scar on her cheek and several marks of a whip . " ( Macon Messenger , May 25 ; 1837 . Advertised by Mr. E. L. Cooner , Branchville , Orangeburgh District , S.C. ) There is another class of advertisements which testify that slaves are shackled and tortured with iron collars having prongs , fetters , &amp;c . " Ran away ,  --  a negro named David , with some iron hobbles around each ankle . " ( The Spectator , Staunton Va. , Sept. 27 , 1838 . Mr. Hazlitt Lofiano . ) " Raz1 away , negress Caroline7-. had on a collar with one prong turned down . " ( New Orleans Bee , Oct. 27 , 1837 . Signed , T.

' ( Montgomery Advertiser , Sept. 29 , 1837 . Signed , B. W. Hodges , Sheriff of Pike Co. , Alabama . ) Then there are those which testify to brandings and maimina , and wounds from fire-arms and other deadly weapons . " Ran away , a negro woman and two children : a few days before she went off , I burnt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . I tried to make the letter ill . " ( Raleigh Standard , July 18 , 1838 . Advertised by Micajah Ricks , Nash Co. , N.C. ) " Ran away , Sam . He was shot a short time since , through the hand , and has several shots in his left arm and side . " ( Helena ( Ark . ) Journal , June 1 , 1833 . Advertised by 0 . W. Lains . ) " Ran away , my negro man , Simon . He has been shot badly in his // back and right arm . " ( Petersburg ( Va . ) Intelligencer , May 2 ' 2 , 1838 . Advertised by Nicholas Edmunds . ) " Was committed to jail , a negro man-says his name is Josiah , his back very much scarred by the whip and branded on the thigh and hips , in three or four places , thus : ( J. M. ) The rim of his right ear has been bit or cut off . " ( Clinton Gazette , July 23 , 1836 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mi . ) " Ran away , my man Fountainhas holes in his ears , a scar on the right side of his forehead-has been shot in the hind parts of his legs-is marked on the back with the whip . " ( Georgia Messenger , July 27 , 1837 . Advertised by Mr. Robert Beasley , Macon . ) The specimens which follow are explained by an extract from a narrative of Sarah M. Grimke , ( daughter of the late Judge Grimke , of the Superior Court of South Carolina , and sister of the late Hon. Thomas S. Grimke , ) of her personal observations respecting slavery . She testifies concerning a mulatto woman , 18 or 20 years old , a slave in one of the first families of South Carolina , who often ran away : " A heavy iron collar , with three long prongs projecting from it , was placed round her neck , and a sound and strongfront tooth was extracted , to serve as a mark to describe her in case of escape . " " Ran away , Myal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( Nashville ( Tenn . ) Daily Republican , April 30 , 1838 . Advertised by Egbert A.

Signed , Benjamin Russell , Deputy Sheriff , Bibb Co. , Ga . ) " Committed to the Charleston Workhouse , Tom , two of his upper front teeth out , about 30 years of age . " ( Charleston ( S.

" ( Baltimore Chronicle , Oct. 6 , 1837 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) There are hundreds upon hundreds of these several classes of advertisements in the newspapers of the slave states . We have ourselves seen a hundred of one class ; and they from papers issued , the greater part of them , during a single year . Testimony like this can not be gainsayed . For here we have the very words and signatures of the masters who thus publish their cruelty to the world . Now , when we consider that these advertisements appear constantly in journals edited by respectable men , and widely circulated in the southern communities , of what cruelties are we forced to deem them the index ? The fact that such advertisements , even a few of them , should be allowed or could be made without overwhelming their authors with shame and contempt , would be decisive . What then shall we say when these advertisements are almost as numerous as those for the sale of any kind of merchandise ? * Gov . H. says " A bad master-he who over-works his slaves , provides illy for them , or treats * That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst specimens of advertisements , we give the following from a North Carolina paper : " Ten silver dollars reward will be paid for apprehending and delivering to me my man Moses , who ran away this morning ; or I will give fire times time sum to any person who will make due proof of his being kitied , and never ask a question to know by whom it was done . " This is signed by a clerk of one of the counties in North Carolina . // them with undue severity-loses the esteem and respect of his fellow citizens to as great an extent , as he would for the violation of any of his social arid most of his moral obligations . " - p.1* . But what says John Randolph of Roanoke , in a speech in Congress ? " Ambition has its cover-sluts in the pride , pomp , and circumstance of glorioils war ; but what are the trophies of avarice ? The handcuff , the manacle , the blood-stained cowhide ! What man worse received in society for being a hard master * Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monsters * " We might bring forward witnesses in great numbers to testify to horrible instances of individual cruelty , such as flogging till the whole back was a mass of raw and mangled flesh ; and flogging till life was extinct ; and this with impunity . But we have said enough on this part of the subject ; and our taste as well as our hearts shrink from such loathsome details . Gov . IL compares the flogging of slaves to the birching of boys in school ! ! ( pp. 13 , 14 . ) What unparalleled impudence is this ! This Gov . U. knows that the birch is one thin a ad the " blood-stained cowhide , " as John Randolph calls it , is entirely another . lie knows , that to compare a flogging on the bare body that leaves scars by which the man or woman can be described for years , with such an application of the rod as is ever made by parents or teachers , is an outrage on truth . Let Gov . It . make the case his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floggings be made on the naked hack of himself , or his son , or his daughter , and it would , we think , correct his wayward faculty of comparison . We pass to another topic-violation of domestic ties  --  the forcible separation of families , of husbands and wives , parents and children , by slavery . On this topic Gov . II . says " On the whole , notwithstanding the migratory character of our population , I believe there are more families among our slaves who have lived and died together , without losing a single member from their circle , except by the process of nature , and in the enjoyment of constant , uninterrupted communion , than have flourished in the same space of time and amongthe same number of civilized people in modern times . " - p. 15 . Respecting this assertion , we have to say-first , that to separate families without any hope of reunion or revisit or communication , by force of law , is a very different thing from a separation of families by the voluntary departure of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune , and pursue their happiness in other parts of the country or world . Then in a free community the fundamental domestic relation , that of husband and wife , not only is not sundered except by crime , but is forbidden by law to be sundered ; while by slavery , that fundamental and tender relation is violated as often , perhaps , as any other . Yet , waiving the unfairness and fallacy of the assertion , we pronounce it , and will prove it , *false . The nature of the case proves that the domestic ties of slaves must be often forcibly sundered . Slaves are taken for debt and sold ngain . When estates are settled by process of law , or when sheriffs ' sales occur , almost necessarily families ( the different members of which , and very often the husband and wife , are owned by different persons ) are torn asunder . This occurs with peculiar frequency in times of pecuniary embarrassment. * But we will not dwell on this kind of argument when we have so much positive and direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always has be*tn an object of prime consideration with our slave- * " The times are truly alarming here . Many plantations are entirety stripped of negroes and horses by the marshal or sheriff . " ( From a letter to a member of Congress from a friend in Mississippi , published in the " Washington Globe , ' June , 1837. ) // holders to keep families together . Negroes are themselves both perverse and comparatively indifferent about this matter . It is a singular trait , that they almost invariably prefer forming connexions with slaves belonging to other masters , and at some distance . It is therefore impossible to prevent separations sometimes , by the removal of one owner , his death or failure , and dispersion of his property . In all such cases , however , every reasonable effort is made to keep the parties together , if they desire it . ' p.15 . Now , on the contrary , there is abundant proof that many slaveholders , especially in the northern slave states , make it a prime object to breed slaves for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blush to speak it of our countrymen . But such is the loathsome fact . Mr. Gholson of Virginia , in his speech in the legislature of that state , Jan. 18 , 1831 , ( see Richmond Whig , ) says-that " The owner of brood-mares has a reasonable right to their product ; and the owner of female slaves to their increase . It-is on the justice and inviolability of this maxim ( partus sequitur ventrem ) that the master foregoes the service of the female slave , has her nursed and attended during the period of her gestation , and raises the helpless and infant offspring . The value of the property justifies the expense ; and I do not hesitate to say , that in its increase consists muck of our wealth . " Prof. Dew , President of the University of William and Mary , Virginia , in his review *of the debate in the Virginia legislature , 1831-2 , p. 49 , says " From all information we can obtain , we have no hesitation in saying , that upwards of six thousand slaves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Again , p. 120 . " A full equivalent being thus left in the place of the slave , this emigration becomes an advantage to the state , and does not check the black population as much as at first view we might imagine ; because it furnishes every inducement to the master to attend to the negroes , to encourage breeding , aud to cause the greatest number ' possible to be raised . " state , in his speech before the legislature in 1832 , while speaking of the number of slaves annually sold from Virginia to the more southern slave states , said " The exportation has averaged eight thousand five hundred for the last twenty years . It is a practice and an increasing practice in parts of Virginia to rear slaves for market . " The following is from Niles 's Weekly Register , published at Baltimore , Md. , Vol. 35 , p. 4 . " Dealing in slaves has become a large business ; establishments are made in several places in Maryland and Virginia , at which they are sold like cattle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied with thumb-screws and gags , and ornamented with cow-skins and other whips oftentimes bloody . " The editor of the Virginia Times , a political paper published at Wheeling , Va . somewhere about the year 1836 , says " We have heard intelligent men estimate the number of slaves exported from Virginia within the last twelve months at one hundred and twenty thousandeach slave averaging at least $600 , making an aggregate of $72,000,000 . Of the number of slaves exported , not more than one third have been sold , ( the others having been carried by their owners , who have removed , ) which would leave in the state the sum of $24,000,000 arising from the sale of the slaves . The Maryville ( Tean . ) Intelligencer , some time in the early part of the year 1836 , says " Sixty thousand slaves passed through a little western town for the southern market during the year 1835 . " The Natchez ( Miss . ) Courier says that the states of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Arkansas , imported two hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1836 . Lest it should be said that these facts do not certainly prove the separation of families , we add the following testimony . Prof. Andrews , formerly of the University of North Hon. Thomas Mann Randolph of Carolina , in his work on " Slavery Virginia , formerly governor of that and the Slave Trade , " page 147 , in // 583 relating a conversation with a slavetrader whom he met near Washing . ton City , says he inquired " Do you often buy the wife without the husband * ? Yes , very often ; and frequently , too , they sell me the mother , while they keep the children . I have often known them take away the infant from the mother 's breast , and keep it , while they sold her The Presbyterian Synod of Kentucky , in the address from which we have before quoted , say " Brothers and sisters , hushands and wives , parents and children , are torn asunder , and permitted to see each other no more . These acts are daily occurring in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often witnessed on such occasions , proclaim with a trumpet-tongue the iniquity of our system . There is not a neighborhood where these heart-rending scenes are not displayed . There is not a village or road that does not behold the sad procession of manacled outcasts , whose mournful countenances tell that they are exiled by force from all that their hearts hold dear " But the most impressive testimony on this point , is of a kind which we have already adduced in treating of another part of the subject , viz. advertisernents in the Southern journals ; of which there are many like the following " One hundred and twenty negroes for sale . The subscriber has just arrived from Petersburg , Va. , with one hundred and twenty likely young negroes of both sexes , and every description , which he offers for sale on the most reasonable terms .

What must we think of a system which involves such brutal indifference to the sundered ties and bleeding affections of husbands and wives , parents and children ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who // denies that such forcible sundering of domestic ties is frequent ? We pass to another topic-the moral and religious condition of the slaves . Respecting this , after describing it , Uov . H. asks- " Now where will you find a laboring population possessed of greater religious advantages than these ? " p. 15 . Now Gov . H. knows ( for he was educated , we are told , at Harvard College ) something of the " laboring population " of the free states . He knows that the great majority of northern citizens are the " laboring population . " He knows , notwithstanding his lack of confidence in " statistics , " that with almost no exception they can read their Bibles and have an opportunity to unite in the services of the sanctuary . And yet he has the impudence to speak of the religious advantages of the slaves , who , as he acknowledges , are forbidden by law to learn to read , and thus are shut out from any personal examination or study of the word of life , as equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other facts respecting the slaves than these , that they are not allowed by law to be taught to read , have no education , and are , therefore , as a general rule buried in ignorance , we should be fully qualified to pronounce Gov . Ii . ' s representations of their religious advantages and condition , untrue . But we will resort to direct testimony ; and that too of those who are , we believe , more competent witnesses on such a subject , than his Excellency . Ihe Presbyterian synod of Kentucky in their address to the Presbyterians of that state , from which we have before quoted , say of slavery ( we copy their words and italics exactly ) - " 1 . Its most striking effect is , to deprave and degrade its subjects by removing from them the strongest naturat checks to human corruption . " " The wisdom and goodness of God are seen in implanting in man a sense of character , a desire for property , a love for distinction , a thirst for power , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these natural feelings are crushed or eradicated in any human being , he is stripped of the nobler attributes of humanity , and is degraded into a creature of mere appetite and passion . His sensuality is the only cord by which you can draw him . His hopes and fears all concentrate upon the objects of his appetites . He sinks far down toward a level with the beast of the field , and can be moved to action only by such appeals as influence the lunatic and the brute . This is the condition to which slavery reduces the great mass of those who wear its brutalizing yoke . Its effects upon their souls are far worse than its effects upon their bodies . Character , property , distinction , power , and fatnily respectability , are all withdrawn from the reach of the slave . No object is presented to excite and cultivate those higher feelings , whose exercise would repress his passions , and regulate his appetites . Thus slavery deranges and ruins the taoral machinery of man ; it cuts the sinews of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preserves it , and leaves it a corrupting mass of appetite and passion . " 2 . It dooms thousands of human beings to hopeless zgnorence. " 3 . It deprives its subjects , in a great measure , of the privileges of the Gospel . " " The privileges of the Gospel as enjoyed by the white population in this land , consist in free access to the Scriptures , a , regular Gospel ministry , and domestic means of grace . Neither of these is , to any extent worth naming , enjoyed by slaves , as a moment 's consideration will satisfactorily show . The law , as it exists here , does not prevent free access to the Scriptures ; but ignorance , the natural result of their condition , does . The Bible is before them , but it is to them a sealed book . " " Very few enjoy the advantages of a regular Gospel ministry . They are , it is true , permitted generally , and often encouraeed to attend upon the ministrations specially designed for their masters . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their capacities .

The preachers of their own color are still farther from ministering to their spiritual wants-as these impart to them , not of their knowledge , but their ignorance ; they heat their animal feelings , but do not kindle the flame of intelligent devotion . " " Domestic means of grace are still more rare among them . Here and there a family is found , whose servants are taught to bow with their masters around the fireside altar . But their peculiarly adverse circumstances , combined with the // natural alienation of their hearts from God , render abortive the slight efforts of most masters to induce their attendance on the domestic services of religion . " " We do not wish to exaggerate the description of this deplorable religious condition of our colore*1 population . We know that instances of true piety are frequently found among them ; but these instances we all know to he awfully disproportionate to their numbers , and to the extent of those means of grace which exist around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , their hope of fully Christianizing it rests upon the fact , that they can array and bring to bear upon the minds of these children of ignorance and sin , all those varied means which God has appointed for the reformation of man . But while the system of slavery continues among us , these means can never be efficiently and fully employed for the conversion of the degraded sons of Africa . " In an official report of the Presbyterian Synod of South Carolina and Georgia , embracing all the ministers and lay representatives from all the churches of that denomination in these two states , adopted at its session in Columbia , S. C. , and published by order of the Synod , in the Charleston Observer of March 22 , 1834 , we find the following testimony . " Who would credit it , that in these years of revival and benevolent effort , in this Christian republic , there are over two millions of human beings , in the condition of HEATHEN , and , in some respects , in a worse condition ? From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the colored population 's ) moral and religious condition is such , as that they may be justly considered the heathen of this Christian country , and will bear comparison with heathen in any country in the world . Before we attempt to set forth the duty , to evangelize these heathen , ' it will be proper to show , that the negroes are destitute of the privileges of the gospel , and ever will be under the present state of things . " There are some exceptions to this , they say , and they rejoice ' in it ; " but although our assertion is BROAD , we believe , that , in general , it will be found to be correct . . . . his universally the fact , throughout the slaveholding states , that either custom or law prohibits to them the acquisition ofletters , and consequently they can have NO ACCESS TO THE SCRIPTURE5* so that they are dependent for their knowledge and Christianity upon oral instruction , as much so as the unlettered heathen when first visited by our missionaries . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in their circumstances , is necessary to the enjoyment of the gospel ? In other words , have they a regular and efficient ministry ? THEY HAVE NOT . In the vastfteld extendingfrom an entire state beyond the Potomac to the Sabine river ; and from the . qtlantic to the Ohio , there are , to the best of our knowledge , not TW ELVE men exclusively devoted to the instruction of the negroes ! The number , two millions of souls and more , ' divided between them would give to each a charge of near one hundred and seventy thousand ! ! ! As to ministers of their own color , they are destitute infinitely both in point of numbers and qualifications ; to say nothing of the fact , that such a ministry is looked upon with distrust , and is discountenanced by the present state of feelin the South , such a ministry could neither be obtained NOR TOLERATED . But do not the negroes have access to the gospel , through the stated ministry of the whites ? We answer , so ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such being the fact , what becomes of the colored ? And the question may be asked with still greater emphasis , when we know that it has not been customary for our ministers when they accept calls for settlement to consider servants as a regular part of their charge . . . . If we take the supply of ministers to the whites now in the field , the amount of their labors in behalf of the negroes is small . " The Synod assert that something has been done towards the religious instruction of the negroes ; ' but they say , " we venture the assertion , that if we take the whole number of ministers in the slaveholding states , but a very small portion pay any attention to them . " . " No effort is made to draw them out ( to church ) ; but let them come to hear the preaching of ministers to white congregations , and such is the elevation of their language , &amp;c. they might as well preach in Hebrew or Greek . The negroes do not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rev. C. C. Jones , of Georgia , who has been specially engaged in ascertaining the moral and religious condition of the slaves , prepared an essay a few years since on that subject , under the direction of the Presbytery of Georgia . This gentleman has since been appointed professor in the Theological Seminary of Columbia , S. C. In that essay he says , in answer to the question , " Has the negro access to the Scriptures ? " " The statutes of our // respective states forbid it ; or when through oversight they do not , custom does . On the one hand he can not be a hearer of the law , for oral instruction is but sparingly afforded him ; and on the other hand , he can not search the Scriptures , for a knowledge of letters he has not , and can not legally obtain . " Mr. Jones says further , " It is a solemn fact which we must not conceal , that their private and public religious instruction forms no part of the aim of owners generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such instruction . They are shut out from our sympathies and efforts as immortal beings , and are educated and disciplined as creatures of profit , and of profit only , for this world . " We think that this testimony from such high authorities in the religious communities of the South is entitled to our full credence , the Hamrnonds and the McDuffies notwithstanding . This testimony fully proves that the slaves of the South are " in the condition of the heathen . " And yet this Gov . Hammond says , that to transport the slaves of Africa to the slavery of this country would be to cause them " to emerge from darkness into light , from barbarism to civilization , from idolatry to Christianity , from death to life . " ! ! With the entire truth of this testimony that we have given , consists the fact , which Gov . H. states , and which we have often heard from pro-slavery quarters , that many of the slaves are communicants in churches , especially in the Baptist and Methodist churches . We might bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ministers at the South , to prove , that a very large proportion of these colored communicants have no idea of the essential truths of Christianity , and , on account of their ignorance , are " poor deluded creatures . " But after what has been testified of their ignorance this is unnecessary . We here take our leave of Gov . Hammond , with what respect for his humanity , veracity , and good manners , our readers must judge We invite distinct attention , in conclusion , to two topics . The testimony which we have adduced fully evinces , that the idea entertained by the opposers of slavery at the North and in New England , and even by those who are technically called " Abolitionists , " of the cruelties of slavery , is not extravagant . Indeed it falls far short of the dread reality . There is little danger that the human imagination even will exceed that reality . The greatest cruelty in the estimation of those who take right views of eternal things , and consider the results of slavery in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it sinks its subjects . The guilt of the murder of millions of souls is on those who uphold the system . But the cruelties inflicted on the bodies of the slaves are not to be lightly esteemed . Suffered by those who are our brethren by the tie of a common humanity and a common redemption , they should be estimated as though they were suffered by ourselves , or our sons and daughters . They are , we have said , far greater than is generally supposed . " The worst , " says Gov . Swain , " is not generally known . " And from the nature of the case it can not be . These cruelties are generally inflicted in secret , away from the observation of whites , and especially of strangers and visitors. * The only wit- * It happens not infrequently that travelers and visitors from the North to the South , return with quite a mollified view of the cruelties of slavery , because they have not witnessed them . The value ofsuch testimony is seen in the light of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly authenticated from a gentleman of great intelligence and moral worth . Several years since , he took a tour through the slave states to ascertain , by personal observation , the treatment of the slaves . He was entertained by many slaveholders in different states , and observed very litnesses // fully competent to reveal them all , are the poor slaves themselves , who have no means of declaring their sufferings to the world . We have to judge by laws , and advertisements , and the rare and unwilling testimony of conscientious and humane slaveholders , and the occasional observations of travelers . These fall far short of a fuU testimony . They are only inklings of the great whole . They are a fearful index of what is unwitnessed and unrecorded , save in the book of the all-seeing Judge . And if such enormities flare into sight through the crevices of the system , what must be the horrid reality within , and how , if fully revealed , would it appall the world ! Well said Gov . Swain , who knew whereof he affirmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to burst at once into view , a peal of seven-fold thunder could scarce strike greater alarm . " There is another inference to which we wish to call special attention . It is this . These crueltiesthis buying and selling of human beings-this whipping and branding , and shooting and chaining , and separation of families ,  --  are necessarily incidental to slavery . They are , as human nature is , essential parts , or certain results of the system . These enormities are fully acknowledged by our southern brethtie of cruelty , and had almost concluded that it did not exist . At length he won the confidence of an intelligent houseservant , and , telling him that be observed but very little cruelty , asked him if it was so . The slave , when he began to feel that he could fully confide in him , replied , " Massa , do you whip your children before company ? Now , do you go out at night and watch . " He did so , and late at night from an out-house he heard dreadful groans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries and promises . Having thus learned to look beneath the veil , he found , ere his tour was completed , most appalling evidence of cruelty , where all , to a superficial examiner , as he at first was , appeared very mild and fair . ren to be great sins ; but , it is said , " These are the abuses of the system , and the system is not proved evil by its abuses . We may remove these abuses , and let the institution , which is good in itself , remain. ** And thus they excuse themselves ; and thus many at the North excuse them , for not aiming at its extinction . Now we say , that these enormities are as a general rule inseparable from slavery . And when slavery is spoken of as it is , and must be , the word should convey the idea , not merely of the abstract institution , but of the institution with these enormities . It should convey the idea , not merely of bondage , but of stripes , and branding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of a sundering of domestic ties which lacerates the hearts of husbands and wives , of parents and children  --  the idea of intellectual degradation , and moral pollution , and education for hell . The word means all this , in fact , and will mean all this , till this world is a world of angels . Take for instance the sale of slaves , and the sundering thereby of domestic ties . In the first place , were the masters ever so much disposed , it could not be prevented . Slaves are deemed property . They constitute an important part of estates . When estates are settled , the slaves must be divided , and often by being sold . And when slaves are sold to the highest bidder , and to suit purchasers , what can prevent the husband being torn away from the wife , and the parent from the child ? As property , they are liable also to be attached for debt , and often are the only property which can be laid hold of by legal process . Slavery can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of human beings as merchandise , nor can it without the sundering of conjugal and filial ties . But the question whether the sale of human beings and the sundering // of domestic ties can be prevented , if all parties are so disposed , is not the practical question . That question is , will these evils be prevented while slavery exists , human nature remaining as it is ? With all there is in the human heart and life , of avarice , and extravagance , and lust , and selfishness in its varied forms , will these evils be prevented ? And here , what has been , is the answer to the question , what will be ? Just as certain as man is a depraved being , will the sale of immortal beings and the reckless sundering of conjugal and filial ties accompany slavery . It is a violation of truth , and a deception of ourselves and others , to speak of the system of slavery as not involving these enormities . So with cruel punishments . They are necessary to the system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So long as man loves the enjoyment of his divinely given and inalienable rights , so long will the slave love liberty , and endeavor to gain it when there is a ray of hope , by running away . This running away must be prevented by severe punishments , or the system will soon vanish . Hence the cruel laws licensing the horrid whipping and the shooting of runaways . Hence the iron collars with prongs , and the chains , and cobbles , and fetters , and gun-shot wounds , and branding , and maiming . And even if they would not try to escape , there must be cruelty , in a vast many cases , in order to secure labor . For , slavery renders inoperative almost all the motives which are peculiar to a rational being , and leaves its subject to the influence of those only which are common to man and the brute . As the Kentucky Synod say , and as we have quoted for another purpose on another page , " he ( the slave ) is stripped of the nobler attributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere appetite and passton He sinks far down toward a level with the beast of the field , and can be moved to action only by such appeals as influence the lunatic and the brute . " Hence masters must flog . Flogging , and brutal flogging , is essential to the system . It is far more necessary in the management of slaves than of brutes , inasmuch as the will of men is stronger , and their consciousness that they are deeply wronged renders their will often inflexible by the appliances of oppression . In support of this position , that slavery , by rendering inoperative almost all the motives which are peculiar to a rational being , and leaving its subject to the influence of those only which are common to man and the brute , makes it necessary that the master should have , and certain that often he will cruelly use , and necessary too that he should sometimes cruelly use , unlimited power over the slave 's body , we will here quote a very important and pointed passage from a decision of the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slavery , pp. 244-247 . " The Siate vs . Mann . Dec . T. 1829. 2 Devereaux 's North Carolina Rep. 263 . " The defendant was indicted for an assault and battery upon Lydia , the slave of one Elizabeth Jones . On the trial it appeared , that the defendant had hired the slave for a year ; that during the term the slave had committed some small of . fense , for which the defendant undertook to chastise her ; that while in the act of so doing , the slave ran off ; whereupon the defendant called upon her to stop , which being refused , he shot at and wounded her . The judge in the court below charged the jury , that if they believed the punishment inflicted by the defendant was cruel and unwarrantable , and disproportionate to the offense committed by the slave , that in law the defendant was guilty , as he had only a special property in the slave . A verdict was returned for the state , and the defendant appealed . " Per Cur . RuJJln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases as the present are brought into judgment . It is impossible that the reasons on which they go can be appreciated , but where institutions similar to our own exist , and // are thoroughly understood . The struggle , too , in the judge 's own breast between the feelings of the man and the duty of the magistrate is a severe one , presenting strong temptation to put aside such questions , if it be possible . It is useless , however , to complain of things inherent in our political state And it is criminal in a court to avoid any responsibility which the laws impose . With whatever reloctance , therefore , it is done , the court is compelled to express an opinion upon the extent of the dominion of the master over the slave in North Carolina . " " The inquiry here is , whether a cruel and unreasonable battery on a slave , by the hirer , is indictable . The judge below instructed the jury that it is . He seems to have put it on the ground , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat the master or other person having the possession and command of the slave , as ' entitled to the same extent of authority . The object is the same , the service of the slave ; and the same powers must be confided . In a criminal proceeding , and indeed in reference to all other persons but the general owner , the hirer the owner . This opinion would , perhaps , dispose of this particular case ; because the indictruent , which charges a battery upon the slave of Elizabeth Jones , is not supported by proof of a battery upon defendant 's own slave ; since different justifications may be applicable to the two cases . But upon the general question , whether the owner is answerable criminaliter , for a battery upon his own slave , or other exercise of authority or force , not forbidden by statute , the court entertains but little doubt . That he is so liable , has never been decided ; nor , as far as is known , been hitherto contended . There has been no prosecution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country in this respect , is the best evidence of the portion of power deemed by the whole community requisite to the L reservation of the master 's dominion . f we thought differently , we could not set our notions in array against the judgment of every body else , and say that this or that authority may be safely lopped off . This has indeed been assimilated at the bar to the other domestic relations ; and arguments drawn from the well established principles , which confer and restrain the authority of the parent over the child , the tutor over the pupil , the master over the apprentice , have been pressed on us . The court does not recognize their application . There is no likeness between the cases . They are in opposition to each other , and there is an impassable gulf between them . The difference is , that which exists between freedom and slavery  --  and a greater can not be imagined . In the one , the end in view is the happiness of the youth , born to equal rights with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young to usefulness , in a station which he is afterwards to assume among freemen . To such an end , and with such a subject , moral and intellectual instruction seem the natural means ; and for the most part they are found to suffice . Moderate force is superadded , only to make the others effectual . If that fail , it is better to leave the party to his own headstrong passions , and the ultimate correction of the law , than to allow it to be immoderately inflicted by a private person . With slavery it is far otherwise . The end is the profit of the master , his security and the public safety ; the subject , one deemed in his own person , and his posterity , to live without knowledge , and without the capacity to make any thing his own , and to toil that another may reap the fruits . What moral considerations shall be addressed to such a being , to convince him what , it is impossible but that the most stupid must feel and know can nerer be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of natural duty , or for the sake of his own personal happiness . Such services can only be expected from one who has no will of his own ; who surrenders his will in implicit obedience to that of another . Such obedience is the consequence only of uncontrolled authority over the body . There is nothing else which cast operate to produce the effect . The power of the master must be absolute , to sender the subsaissia of the slave perfect . I most freely confess my sense of the harshness of this proposition . I feel it as deeply as any man can . And as a principle of moral right , every person in his retirement must repudiate it . But in the actual condition of things , it must be so . There is no remedy . This discipline belongs to the state of slavery . They can not be disunited , without abrogating at once the rights of the master , and absolving the slave from his subjection . It constitutes the curse of slavery to both the bond and the free portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation of master and slave . That there may be particular instances of cruelty and deliberate barbarity , where in conscience the law might properly interfere , is most probable . " The difficulty is to determine , where a court may properly begin . Merely in the abstract it may well be asked , which power of the master accords with right . The answer will probably sweep away all of them . But we can not look at the matter in that light . The truth is , that we are forbidden to enter upon a train of // general reasoning on the subject . We can not allow the right of ' the master to be brought into discussion in the courts of justice . rj7** slave , to remain a slave , must be made sensible that there is no appeal from his master ; that his person is , in no instance , usurped ; but is conferred by the laws of man , at least , if not by the law of God . " The cruelties of ' which we have spoken can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sects of the Christian church . The Kentucky Synod , speaking of the cruelties of slavery , and particularly of ' the forcible separation of families , say " Our church , years ago , raised its voice of solemn warning against this flagrant violation of every principle of mercy , justice , and humanity . Yet we blush to announce to you and to the world , that this warning has been often disregarded , even by those who hold to our communion . Cases have occurred in our own denomination , where professors of the religion of mercy have torn the mother from her children , and sent her into a merciless and returniess exile . Yet acts of discip line have rarely followed such conduct . Far be it from us to ascribe to our people generally a participation in these deeds , or a sympathy with them-they abhor and loathe them . But while the system , of which these cruelties are the legitimate offspring , is tolerated among us , it is exceedingly difficult to inflict punishment upon their perpetrators . If we commence discipline for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall we stop ? What principle is there which will justify us in cutting off a twig or a branch of this poison tree , that will not , if carried fairly out , force us to proceed , and hew down its trunk , and dig up its roots ? These cruelties are only the loathsome ulcers , which show corruption in the blood and rottenness in the bones of this system . They may be bound up and mollified with ointment-they may be hidden from the sight ; but they can not be entirely removed until there is a thorough renovation within . Our churches can not be entirely pure , even from the grossest pollutions of slavery , until we are willing to pledge ourselves to the destructiom of the whole system . " The truth is , churches in the slave states know their impotence to discipline for any of the incidental enormities of slavery ; and the late Old School General Assembly clearly evinced by their evasive and partial action that they knew it . Two questions were presented to them one which asked , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in itself , in all cases , such a sin as to call for church discipline ; the other , respecting the ncidental enormities of slavery . On the first they were very elaborate and edifying . The second they dodged . They did not touch it . They knew that these incidental enormities are sins . They knew that they must acknowledge and denounce them as such , if they said any thing about them . But they knew that they were powerless . They knew that they would not only be liable to mobs in that " chivalrous " country if they spoke the truth on that part of the subject , but that they were powerless as to discipline ; that if they denounced these crimes , they could not discipline for them . They felt the difficulty thus expressed by the Kentucky Synod- " If we commence discipline for any act which the laws of slavery sanction , where shall we stop ? " And therefore , unlike the Kentucky Synod , they dodged the great practical question as to the abounding and acknowledged sins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called on by their situation , as by a voice from heaven , to speak in behalf of the dumb ; and thus , by their silence on one question , more probably than by their partial and negative action on the other , strengthened the bands of slavery . We think the chairman of the committee , Rev. Dr. Junkin , well deserves the pair of silver handcuffs which a meeting of free colored people in Cincinnati voted to present to him for his pro-slavery report. * * We were quite amused with the following squib which first appeared , we believe , in the Cincinnati Herald . " Ca n't stand that . ' - We were standing by the side of one of our veteran democratic leaders in the place of the Gen 590 // Even then in the straitest sects of the Christian church these atrocities of slavery exist , and can not be prevented till they pledge themselves to the destruction of slavery itself . Surely we ought to hear no more of these acknowledged atrocities being mere abuses of the system of slavery . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more that slavery does not necessarily involve cruelties and fearful iniquities . But we must close . We *hould like here to discuss the question , on which Gov . H. discourses very confidently , whether the Bible sanctions slavery . But we have not room . Perhaps we shall take it up at another time . We will only say here to those who think that the Bible sanctions slavery , such as we have proved it to be , Meet the infidel on the question of the internal evidence of the divinity and truth of the Bible , if you can . Prove , that any hook which authorizes and commands this " complicated villainy , " as John Wesley called it , is from the God of love , if you can.
